0,TheLittleSongbird,Filled with soul,10,30 March 2021,"Pixar is one of the finest animation studios to exist and one of the few studios today for anything to continually deliver. Sure they did become less consistent post-'Toy Story 3', but in the 90s and 2000s their work was of higher quality than Disney's generally and hit more than it missed. Pre-'Toy Story 3', the one slight disappointment was 'Cars', the others are very good to brilliant and even their lesser work is still watchable.'Soul' is nothing short of amazing and proved to be one of the few highlights this year. Not just as an overall film, but everything about it is fantastically executed. It has a huge amount of soul and heart, true of Pixar at its very best, and also filled me with joy and hope (and goodness don't we all need it right now). In my view, 'Soul' is one of Pixar's best post-'Toy Story 3' films alongside 'Inside Out' and 'Coco'. And as far as the studio's overall filmography goes it's definitely in the top 10.As cliched as this sounds, everything in 'Soul' works. The animation, as usual for Pixar, is stunning. Consisting of some of the most gorgeously vibrant colours for any animated film in recent memory and some very imaginative backgrounds. A major star is the music, one of the studio's finest scores, one that really celebrates the style and does so so affectionately, and this is coming from a studio that always delivered in this aspect. The music here is so catchy, full of heart-pumping energy and poignant emotion.The voice acting is dynamite, meant in a good way. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey are at the top of their game, voicing their characters with deep feeling and infectious enthusiasm. The characters are ones worth rooting for, feeling like real people and not stock caricatures. The script is playfully witty, beautifully affecting and also honest, there is nothing childish here and to me coherence actually wasn't an issue. Really admired the message of you can change and that it is never too late to do so, such a good message honestly delivered and it resonated with me.When it comes to talking about the story, the one in 'Soul' is more thematically ambitious than most Pixar films. Which is amazing considering that Pixar have had a number of mature and ambitious themes and stories. 'Soul' executes this in a very bold and never dumbed down or convoluted manner. Can understand where people are coming from when they talk about it being more for older viewers than children, but from my experience as a young adult but a child at heart 'Soul' made me laugh and gave me the feels, as well as left me deep in thought. Something that Pixar was very good at in most of their films. Personally didn't find the ending rushed or too neat, and actually found it pretty poignant.Brilliant film and more than deserving of its acclaim. Thank goodness it came along when it did. 10/10.",Soul
1,SnoopyStyle,the water is the ocean,8,9 January 2021,"Joe (Jamie Foxx) has come to a crossroad in his life. He's offered a full time music teacher job at the high school but all he really wants is to be a jazz pianist. He finally gets a great music opportunity and then he falls into a manhole. He finds himself in the afterlife. After some shenanigans, he is forced to mentor Earthphobic soul 22 (Tina Fey).I do like the tackling of the questions of life in this movie. Joe is an appealing character. It's an intriguing journey. I love the cat out of water aspect in the middle part of the movie. I love the little nuggets of wisdom. This is a terrific Pixar movie.",Soul
2,Prismark10,Soul,6,27 December 2020,"Pixar animation has been box office gold in the movies. The Covid pandemic has meant Soul has skipped the cinema and gone straight to Disney+. Not even a premium VOD release.Does this mean Disney thought the animated film was a risk too far?Voiced by Jamie Foxx. Joe has spent years trying to make it as a jazz musician. While contemplating an offer of a full time post as a music teacher. Joe gets an offer to play piano for a respected jazz quartet.Joe is so excited, he hop and skips through traffic without looking properly. Joe falls down a hole in the road and dies.In a state of purgatory. Joe tries to get back to Earth and back to his life. He ends up being a mentor for a soul numbered 22 who does not want to go to Earth and inhibit a body.Joe knows his spark is music, he is tasked to help find 22's spark. He follows in the footsteps of a lot of famous people who have failed with 22.On Earth, Joe realises that he was wrapped so much in jazz. He failed to appreciate the simple things in life, even talking to people about something else other than jazz. 22 appreciates things like just walking down the street, eating pizza and watching the leaves fall.The animation is very much up to Pixar standards. Colourful and this time they have sequences in 2D type CGI.Co-directed by Pete Docter, it does share themes with Inside Out, his previous Pixar film released in 2015. It gives Soul an air of familiarity. A lot of this type of stories have been done before in other afterlife movies and television shows. Heaven Can Wait, Defending Your Life, Dead Earnest to name a few.",Soul
3,nogodnomasters,In the Zone,8,7 July 2021,"Joe Garner teaches band. What he really wants to do is play jazz piano in a big gig. He gets his chance, but as fate would have it, he dies falling into an open manhole. His soul doesn't want to go to heaven, but back to Earth so he can play that gig. He manages to hide out among the unborn souls including 22 (Tina Fey) who has been there a long time and doesn't want to be born. She is in her comfort zone. Together they work to find a solution.This was a fun heart warming of enjoying life with some heavy philosophical talk which adds to the comedy. Pizza is the reason for life. Loved the Disney beginning.",Soul
4,kosmasp,So much ... Soul/Pixar,10,27 December 2020,"Some people may get annoyed when they hear ""another Pixar classic"". And I really try to avoid the term classic, especially with a movie that was just released. How can it already be a classic. Doesn't it have to stand the test of time? And how does Pixar actually achieve what they're doing? How can they keep this up with almost all their output. Even their ""weak"" movies are good by any measure.But this isn't just good! This is epic! Yes I went there! And not just because it is the flavor of the month. I won't bash Wonder Woman 84, even if I feel similar to some who have already seen it - the fact I probably have to wait at least a few weeks until it is officially released in Germany won't make a difference to the criticism: I do believe that it is more effects and show than substance ... but not everyting can be entertaining and so full of Soul like ... Soul/Pixar movies in general.But back to this, which starts off slowly in a way. You may feel differently when you start watching it, especially considering what they do with the ""music"" from the start. But considering all the places this movie takes you (literally and not) ... just wow.And it is about so much! That not just an animated movie can and does go there ... it's incredible. Of course those familiar with Japanese Anime in particular and Studio Ghibli in particular already know this is possible. Don't be offended if you are one of those, if people just start recognizing this and are blissfully unaware of this other world you were aware of aleady. Educate them if you want, don't belittle their experience or the one they get from this or other Pixar efforts.Having said all that and as you can see, I am not going into the story itself. For one I don't like to spoil, but also in this case, it is not so much about the apparent goal of our hero. It is about life itself. Again this is as deep as an animated (kids) movie can go. I can not praise enough what they have done here and how they achieved it. There is still silly humor and other things that make this entertaining. And that balance is finely tuned and mixed. A heartfelt story that I would assume almost everyone can connect with! And that is what makes the Pixar experience so unique - most of the times that is! It is not ""oops they did it again"" anymore - it's ""of course this is a Pixar movie and it is awesome!"".",Soul
5,classicsoncall,"""Look, I'm not supposed to be here!""",7,31 December 2020,"This movie straddles the line between appealing to both kids and adults, and that's noteworthy for an animated feature. The central character Joe, voiced by Jamie Foxx, finds himself landing a dream job, only to find that his exuberance has led him into a situation that forces him to examine his life by coaching a new soul who is more into appreciating what it has in the here and now. In that respect, the film makes it's point that for each of us, it's the journey and not the destination that should provide fulfillment in our lives. The film offers the inspiring message that savoring life's daily moments can be just as much appreciated as achieving one's final goal.",Soul
6,jboothmillard,Soul,8,5 May 2021,"I did manage to watch computer-animated Disney/Pixar movie Onward before the cinemas closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but this movie was delayed. Many people would have signed up to the Disney+ on-demand service to watch this and other cancelled films, but I chose to wait until it was released on DVD, directed by Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., Up, Inside Out) and Kemp Powers (One Night in Miami). Basically, Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) is a passionate jazz pianist and music teacher living in New York City who dreams of playing jazz professionally. His mother Libba (Phylicia Rashad), who works as a seamstress, insists that he should be teaching full time, fearing for his financial security. One day, talking to former student turned professional drummer Lamont ""Curley"" Baker Curly (Questlove), Joe learns of a spot as pianist in the band of jazz legend Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett). He auditions at a music club for Dorothea, who is impressed with Joe's piano playing, and hires him to perform for that night's show. Joe leaves excitedly and so distracted that he narrowly avoids being killed by various fatal hazards, including falling objects and traffic. Finally, after ending a phone call, he falls down a manhole. Joe finds himself as a soul heading into the ""Great Beyond"". Unwilling to die before his big break, he tries to escape but ends up in the ""Great Before"", where unborn souls prepare for life on Earth. The counsellors, all named Jerry (Alice Braga, Richard Ayoade, Wes Studi, Fortune Feimster and Zenobia Shroff), explain that each soul has a badge which grants passage to Earth once all personality traits have been filled. Mistaken for a mentor, Joe is assigned to train a cynical soul named 22 (Tina Fey), who has always lived in the Great Before and wants to avoid Earth. 22 takes Joe to a place where he can see key moments in his life, and there they discover he is in a coma in hospital. Seeing his situation and his passion for music, which she claims not to care for, 22 agrees to let him help find her ""spark"" to complete her badge and then give it to him so that he can return home. 22 is taken to the various activity places to try and find what she is passionate about, with no success. So, they visit, ""the zone"", a place that souls can enter when their passions create a euphoric trance, but which can also become a trap for obsessed lost souls. They meet Moonwind (Graham Norton), the captain of a galleon carrying hippie mystics, who help Joe locate his body on Earth. Joe is too eager to get back into his body before Moonwind can explain anything, and he takes 22 with him. This results in the souls of Joe and 22 entering different bodies; 22 has entered Joe's body, and Joe has ended up in the body of a therapy cat. 22 talks with Joe's voice, while Joe cannot be understood as a cat. After leaving the hospital, 22 and Joe seek Moonwind on Earth, who works as a sign twirler, he agrees to meet them later at the jazz club to restore Joe to his own body. Meanwhile, 22 finds herself fascinated by the world around her, discovering the senses of smell and taste for pizza, washing and dressing, and a real interest in music. Joe is happy watching her experience the small moments in life, while also communicating with his friends and family. In Joe's body, 22 has poignant conversations with student Connie (Cora Champommier) who is considering quitting the school before performing a trombone solo and changing her mind, and barber Dez (Donnell Rawlings) who fixes Joe's hair and talks about originally wanting to become a veterinarian. After 22 rips Joe's pants while bending down, the duo goes to see Libba to have it fixed. 22 repeats Joe's words whispered to her and makes his mother finally understand and accept his passion for music, and she offers Joe his late father's blue suit for his upcoming gig. Meanwhile, back in the Great Beyond, obsessive accountant Terry (Rachel House) who tallies souls discovers that Joe is missing, and heads to Earth in order to send him back and restore the count. As the day ends, Joe and 22 rendezvous with Moonwind, but 22 has an epiphany and decides she must find her purpose on Earth and wants to stay in Joe's body. As she flees with Joe tailing behind, Terry catches up and brings both back to the Great Before. There, 22 realises her badge is filled out, Joe insists that it was because of his traits, and that she did not truly find her ""spark"". 22 angrily tosses the badge at him and disappears into the zone. A Jerry tells Joe that a spark is not a soul's purpose in life, but only an indication that it is ready to live. Refusing to believe this statement, Joe uses 22's badge to return to Earth. In his own body, Joe performs at the gig and the show is a success, but he is not completely satisfied. He realises, despite fulfilling a dream, his life has not significantly changed. He looks at objects collected by 22 while in his body, and recalls the moments they enjoyed together, he realises that these moments are what created the ""spark"". By playing piano, he enters the zone with the intent to return her badge but discovers that she has become a lost soul. He chases her down and reminds her of the time she spent on Earth, making her realise that her passion to live is the ""spark"", and she is restored to normal. Joe returns the badge and escorts 22 out of the Great Before for her journey to Earth. As Joe prepares to enter the Great Beyond, a Jerry stops him and offers another chance at life in gratitude for finally inspiring 22 to live. The obsessive Jerry is tricked by another to believe that he has completed his count of souls so that Joe can be ignored. Joe returns to his body on Earth and starts the next day committed to enjoying his entire life. Also starring Sakina Jaffrey as Doctor, June Squibb as Gerel, Jeannie Tirado as Principal Arroyo, and Ulka Simone Mohanty as Mother Teresa. Foxx as the enthusiastic musician and Fey as the sulky unborn soul who has no enthusiasm for anything are great voice casting. As long as you can concentrate the existential story is interesting, it has good humour, it has emotional moments, the music is magnificent, and the animation is brilliantly colourful and imaginative, overall, a most watchable animated fantasy comedy-drama. It won the Oscars for Best Animated Feature Film, Best Original Score for Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Jon Batiste, and it was nominated for Best Sound, it won the BAFTAs for Best Animated Feature Film, and Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Animated, and Best Original Score. Very good!",Soul
7,studioAT,Soul,7,24 April 2021,"On the back of the pandemic a film teaching us to live life to the full has never been so timely.This is a grown up Pixar film, I imagine that there's a lot that would go over the heads of young children watching it, though the body swap angle may appeal.With some lovely messages and moments, I enjoyed this latest Pixar offering.",Soul
8,LeonLouisRicci,GROWN-UP MAGICAL THINKING FORCED ON KIDS TOO YOUNG TO PROCESS/CONTEMPLATE,7,12 August 2021,"Animated Movies in the Past were Made for Kids that Adults Might Enjoy.Animated Movies in the Present seem to be Made for Adults that Kids are Asked to Enjoy.But Do They?There is an Enormous Amount of Feedback Concerning the New Pixar Movie ""Soul"" and Losing the Kids in Large Numbers During Viewing.It's Easy to See Why.The Look of the Movie is Bland for a Pixar.Something You Couldn't Say about Their Last One that Tried this Kind of ""Heady"" Presentation....""Inside Out"" (2015)At a Minimum that one was Ultra-Colorful, Sharply Brimming with Zeal.Here in ""Soul"" the Color Template is See-Through, Anemic, Wispy, and Vacant.With a Lot of Single-Color, almost Sepia-Toned in its Limited Color Scale. The Screen is Often Filled Edge-to-Edge with Blue or Blue-Green.This Movie does Not Look Like a Pixar Movie. That's Not Necessarily a Good Thing.The Pixar ""Charm"" in its ""Zone"" is a Super-Power that when Stretched or Abandon for other Realms Negates the Personality of the Studio to its Detriment.The ""Life-Lessons"" so Heavily-Handed here do Nothing Much for the Youngish and seems to be a Muse for Mature Folks Grappling with ""Life"" and Personally the ""Soul"".Most Non-Adults aren't There Yet and this Kind of Thing seems to be ""Jumping the Starting-Gun"" and Perhaps Leaving the Innocent at the Gate.It's Not Without its Appeal and some of its Artistic and Philosophical Template can be Appealing if You Let It.But One Wonders if the Younger Half of the Audience Really Wants to Let It.Overall, its an Overreach and a Mediocre Pixar, but Even Mid-Land Pixar is Very Good.",Soul
9,grantss,Mediocre,4,3 February 2021,"Joe is a middle school music teacher in New York. His ambition is to be a renowned jazz pianist and he finally gets his big break but unfortunately suffers a serious accident shortly thereafter. He then finds himself in a limbo-world somewhere between life and death.Directed and written by Pete Docter who gave us Up, Monsters Inc and Inside Out as well as wrote WALL-E and Toy Story 1&2, Soul isn't in the same league as those classic animated films. It started well enough: the story of Joe the jazz pianist was an interesting and engaging one, and surely something you could build a very solid plot around.Sadly, no, that's not how it pans out. The moment the movie moves from the story of a musician making his way in the world to a half-dead man swanning about in some supernatural world, the engagement and interest disappears. The plot is largely random from there on out and made for kids. Very little makes sense and the attempts at profundity are token and clumsy.It does have its moments though with some good humour and music but the general tone is that of a mindless children's action-adventure film.",Soul
10,view_and_review,"Had a ""Spark""",9,26 December 2020,"Pixar never ceases to amaze me. Somehow they've cracked this incredible code which allows them to have profound stories woven in such a way even kids can enjoy. They've found this perfect blend of tapestry which appeals to kids and adults alike. It's remarkable.Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) was a middle school music teacher with an eye on his big break. He believed he was born to play jazz and if he could do that for life he would be a happy man. His mother (Phylicia Rashad), on the other hand, thinks Joe should find steady work and stop chasing this dream.Joe finally got his big break when he was asked to fill in for an absent piano player. He crushed his rehearsal and was given the gig right there on the spot. In his jubilation Joe stepped into an open manhole and the next thing we see is a blue, roundish, figure of Joe on a conveyor belt going to ""the Great Beyond."" This couldn't have been a more inopportune time for Joe as he just got his big break.He found a way to stave off the Great Beyond with the help of some other souls--namely Number 22 (Tina Fey). Number 22 is a disembodied soul who never lived because she never found her ""spark."" If Joe can help her find her spark and get her soul patch (not the facial hair) then maybe he can go back to Earth and play in the gig of his life.""Soul"" is funny, insightful, and profound. I thought it wouldn't be as enjoyable once I saw the ""souls"" and the other entities in the netherworld Joe was in. They were of such a cartoon quality that I assumed the story would take on a cartoon quality as well. Thankfully, that was never the case. Yes, the movie had funny moments as it should have, but it never was silly. And even when we got the requisite pensive moment, it wasn't sad or depressing. It's a story of following your passion, but not missing life while you pursue it. I thought the movie came together very well and definitely had a spark.",Soul
11,evanston_dad,Pixar Has Lost Its Touch,6,15 January 2021,"I think Pixar has lost its touch.Movies like ""Wall-E,"" ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Toy Story 3"" could hold their own with the best of any live action movies out there. But ""Soul"" has a generic animated movie quality about it. It's full of platitudes about what it means to be alive, and there's never anything really funny about it nor moving about it, which are qualities in which other Pixar movies have excelled. It felt more like a marketing ploy to get more viewers to subscribe to Disney+ than anything else.And the ending really cops out. Too pat, too happy. It had a chance to go somewhere poignant but chooses not to.Grade: B",Soul
12,ferguson-6,jazzing,8,30 December 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. With their first 22 feature films, Pixar excelled at balancing the eye candy and action kids favor with the second level intellect needed to simultaneously keep adults entertained. As proof, one need only think of such classics as TOY STORY, CARS, and THE INCREDIBLES. Surprisingly, film number 23 is the first Pixar film aimed directly at adults. It's a marvelous companion piece to the brilliant INSIDE OUT (2015), but be forewarned, there is simply nothing, or at least very little, for kids to latch onto.The film is co-directed by 2 time Oscar winner Pete Docter (INSIDE OUT 2015, UP 2009) and Kemp Powers (the screenplay and stage production of ONE NIGHT IN MIAMI, 2020), and they were joined on the screenplay by Mike Jones. And yes, it's a brilliant script to go along with the always stunning Pixar visuals and effects. Brace yourself for a metaphysical exploration of the meaning of life and finding one's purpose. As we've come to expect on Pixar projects, the voice cast is deep and filled with well-known folks such as Graham Norton, Rachel House, Alice Braga, Richard Ayoade, Phylicia Rashad, Angela Bassett, Questlove, Daveed Diggs, Wes Studi, and June Squibb. Leading the way is the dynamic duo of Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey.Mr. Foxx plays Joe, a junior high band teacher still chasing his dream of performing jazz and experiencing the feeling that only music can provide ... ""the zone"". Instead, the school offers him a full-time teaching job, and his mother demands he seize the stability (and insurance) and give up his silly dream of jazz. As seen in the preview, shortly after an audition lands him his dream jazz gig, a freak accident occurs and Joe finds himself in ""The Great Beyond"", where a conveyor belt takes those souls whose time has come to that giant bug zapper in the sky. Joe's not willing to accept his plight and finagles his way into being a mentor for Soul 22 (Tina Fey) in ""The Great Before"" where unborn souls search for their ""spark"". It's all very existential.After a look back at his life, Joe takes 22 to ""The Hall of Everything"", which is the one segment in the film which felt underplayed ... much could have been done with 22 looking for a reason to live. Instead, it's a few great punchlines, including a Knicks gag that will surely play well among basketball fans. We learn of the fine line separating ""lost souls"" from those ""in the zone"", and mostly we take in the banter between Joe and 22, as purpose and passion become the subjects of chatter.As with most Pixar movies, multiple viewings are required to catch all the sight-gags, one-liners, and Easter eggs, however, the first viewing is like unwrapping a giant Christmas present. The opening Disney theme is hilariously played by a junior high school band, and the score is courtesy of Oscar winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (THE SOCIAL NETWORK, 2010). Director Docter claims Pixar good-luck charm John Ratzenberger makes a vocal appearance, but I didn't catch it. The film leaves us with the message that the meaning of life is simply living life ... and keep on jazzing.

13,siderite,A beautiful Pixar animation almost on par with Inside Out,8,1 January 2021,"The film explores the things that make our souls tick and spark joy in our lives. And it does this by analysing the life of this wannabe jazz musician who teaches in school and dreams of his big break. But what does that mean? What does he actually need? The story is quite complex, with multiple entities in different dimensions playing their roles and the animation is very well done. Yet there was something missing. The plot was predictable, telegraphed minutes before something was happening. Being animated made it entertaining, but if it would have been a normal live action film with a bit of CGI sprinkled in, many scenes would have felt a bit flat. A lot of what was meant to be deeper meaning stuff was drowned in the comedy and the actions of the quite superfluous Roquefort-like character.Now, this is a good film and it is not my intention to dissuade you from watching it, quite the contrary, but while the approach was innovative, the story told is just one I've seen before and the moral is the same old Carpe Diem and enjoy the little things and journey before the destination crap.",Soul
14,ksf-2,fun adventure... gotta watch this one again.,7,3 March 2021,"Interesting story from Pixar. school music teacher has an accident, and goes on an adventure. is he dead? is he dreaming? or is it a near death experience? the story is quite ethereal, and you can't really ask questions... just let it unfold. briefly, when joe (Jamie Foxx) falls, he must become a mentor to ""22"" before either of them can move on to where they want to ""go"". they DO say Hell a couple times. after going into the ""before place""... they chat a while, go through a closet C.S. Lewis style, and end up someplace new. we're not sure where. more adventures and pop references. i recognized the voices of Tina Fey (22) and Graham Norton. I turned on captions, hoping to see the song titles (since it's a film about music!) but was disappointed that they didn't list any music titles when they were played. some jazz. some BEAUTIFUL piano music. some short bumpers. i DID recognize the Bob Dylan song, but you have to be old enough to pick it out. some story similarities to A Guy named Joe, the 1943 van johnson film, where an angel must stick around and give the pilots confidence to fly the planes during WW II. Also named Joe. this updated version is a bit trip-ier... we flash back and forth between the animated ""real world"" and the cartoon-ish ultra-animated blue puffy character-world. still not sure what really happened, but it does make me want to watch it again. it's rated PG... all ages can watch it, but definitely some heavier themes in here. lots of references that go by pretty fast. directed by oscar winning Peter Docter.",Soul
15,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Soul (2020) 8.2/10,8,4 January 2021,"""Apart from its perspicacious advocacy of joie de vivre and mindfulness, which exalts SOUL to be one of the most eloquent cinematic philosophers, its animation department also amazingly struts its stuff by designing its cubistic line-drawing characters in an otherworldly macrocosm, and seamlessly concatenating the disparate, kaleidoscopic elements of an absorbing story taking place on multiple planes. Though by my lights, SOUL cannot reach the extraordinariness set by INSIDE OUT, which has a more cogent outline to underlie its emotional weight. That said, as far as it goes, SOUL is a marvel of its own, not least for that dreamily ethereal score confected by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Soul
16,thesar-2,It's Definitely Got It,9,25 December 2020,"Probably one of the most spot-on titles of all time...and one of Pixar's best ever.This inspiring movie came at the most appropriate time in 2020. It wants to remind us to LIVE, BREATHE and LOVE LIFE. What better message to give on Christmas day?Joe's focused on becoming a Jazz player for a living, but has been held back all his life from outside forces/events. Or has he? When an accident happens on the day of what appears to be the gig of his life to make his dreams come true, he's forced to mentor a lost soul as he tries to fulfill his purpose. Or so he tells himself.I was intentionally vague in that synopsis as much as I could as I went into this almost completely blind having only seen a few seconds of clips online. There's so much to unravel here, it's best you discover this gem all by yourself.The music and score are perfect, the humor hilarious - I was thoroughly laughing out loud a ton and the heart is 100% shown. Not to mention the animation is spectacular - it's so good, you forget all about it and focus on the laughs, story and morals. And I bet the excellent animators want that to be true for everyone.I can't recommend this movie enough. It's so unlike other Pixar movies, it feels like it's in a new class of its own. I'm not ready to call it my favorite Pixar film...yet. And that's probably, again, because it feels so different. Elevated. A new breed. Adult.Oh, if anything: watch this to remember why we live and breathe. Why we have (a) Soul.***Final thoughts: On a personal note, I've always wanted to visit a genuine, established and real jazz club someday. Was close once in Seattle a few years back, but other plans got in the way. Headed back to Seattle soon and if this plague finally subsides, I hope to live that dream soon after.",Soul
17,cherold,Wonderfully imagined and plotted Pixar classic,10,14 January 2021,"Co-helmed by the guy who wrote Wall-E, Up, and Inside Out and directed the latter 2, Soul is yet another amazing film. It goes deep, covering the nature of existence, the important of dreams and life, the need to find meaning. It goes funny, with crazy gags that leave you breathless. It goes visually stunning, with remarkable imagery. And the plot is constantly moving and shifting and surprising.Seriously, just watch it.",Soul
18,ElMaruecan82,"A fine continuation of ""Inside / Out"" and ""Coco""... that only deserved a more mature conclusion...",8,24 April 2021,"For almost a century, Disney has been THE visual factory of dreams coming true with the sheer magic of animation and the most unsuspected sparks of imagination.And since the 2000s, a new trend started driving the creativity of the studios: the high-concept film - building out of 'abstractions' parallel universes or even corporations with guidelines and processes; ""Monsters, Inc."" was the first of that genre. Then came ""Inside/Out"", the film that dealt with emotions, ""Coco"" with the afterlife and memories, the latter presenting parents as dream-killers but then questioning whether dreams amounted to much when it came to the simplest things such as family and love. It's only ""fair"" that the quintessential family-oriented brand dealt with such matters.And in the midst of that perpetual life-and-death brainstorming, ""Soul"" came out. Anticipated since 2020, the film is about a middle-aged music teacher and Jazz-passionate named Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx). He's stuck in one of these secure jobs that give life a security but not quite a meaning. In the span of one single day, he learns that he's finally a full-time teacher (he's as ecstatic as Jafar when he gets the news) and that he's getting a gig in an important jazz recital with legend Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett)... oh, and in that very day, he dies and finds himself (as a bubble-like creature) taking the stairway not to Heaven, but what they call the ""Great Beyond"" (with the obligatory ominous chorus sound).Just when his life got a fresh start, it got cancelled. Karma is... you know.So far, so good... the bureaucratic almost Kafkaian depiction of heaven isn't new: it's been handled by filmmakers like Ernst Lubitsh and Michael Powell, it inspired countless cartoons and ""Heaven Can Wait"" is a title that rings a bell, but CGI animation gives its specific visual literature speaking through a few powerful frames thousand words. The 'Great Beyond' part had set my mind to something exceptional. But then the rebellious Joe-soul refused to reach the white light and in his panic, found a loophole to take him to the Great Before, with little souls in preparation getting mentored to get an Earth pass, literally becoming humans.That part enthused me a little less than the first act, channelling so many deja-vu feelings it distracted me from the unique concept of the ""before-life"". Something about the looks turned me off, it looked like some animation designed for toddlers with these annoying bubble-souls and the linear and sketchy Picasso-like aspects of the 'office workers' made me wonder if it wasn't taken from some earlier ""Inside/Out"" drafts. That Tina Fey voices the rebellious soul #22 (after Amy Poehler did ""Joy"") and the whole personality assignment enhanced that feeling. By the way, did they know in advance who was going to be a loser or a psychopath?Anyway, the novelty passed at that moment though the whole trip into the world of souls allowed the script to unveil some hilarious nuggets ""you can't crush soul, that's what Earth is for"" or ""that's Earth problem"". But I guess the real problem is that once we get into that part, the expositional elements tend to overshadow Joe's existential crisis. And once Joe manages to get back, the film takes a new boost of energy with 22 getting into his body and Joe into a cat and then the film takes us to Joe's universe where he's got the voice and mannerisms of 22, which allows him to have different and deeper interactions with people from his environment, especially his mother Libba (Phylicia Rashad).There are two revealing truths in that part: for Joe, we take many personalities for granted and sometimes miss a lot by not saying things properly and for 22, the greatness of life can rely on the smallest little details normal people take for granted : a warm shower, a slice of pizza, a melody etc. Meanwhile, there's a subplot going with a petty bureaucratic clerk drawn like ""La Linea"" (remember that cartoon?) working with the tenacity of a bailiff to get the two after-life fugitives back to the Great whatever, it all comes down to Joe and 22 but only one Earh Pass, so the situation is pretty heavy.Now, let me say that I just love a film that surprises me and everything was building up to that jazz concert being the climactic sequence, even the title suggested a movie about music (the expression of the soul and all that), so I appreciated that the concert wasn't exactly what the film was about, but rather Joe who went from a man considering his life as a series of failures to a not-so terrible life after all. As a man who took wrong decisions because of dreams, I felt Pixar animators gently tapping on my shoulder, telling me not everyone is entitled to succeed, and our passions aren't necessarily what we're best at or that dreams are overrated.And within its anticlimactic aspect, there's something true-to-life within Joe's epiphany and the final gesture it inspired, beautifully closing his arc.Now, the question is: what counts the most: the lesson or the opportunity to apply it? For such a mature and modern-looking film (the rendition of our today's world is 100% convincing), I was a tad disappointed that it chose to remain in the same spectrum than ""Inside / Out"" and ""Coco"". Fantasy is a tricky genre because it sets so many rules it's easy to counteract them, but dealing with fantasy and yet sticking to a ""realistic"" ending à la ""Ghost"", now that would have been something.I suspect there were heated debates about the ending, but aiming a children audience, Pete Doctor picked the safe option but I'm not sure that same target would respond as enthusiastically to all the metaphysical and existential undertones of the film. Such a splendid premise deserved a more mature ending.",Soul
19,MOscarbradley,A brilliant mess of a movie.,7,13 April 2021,"This year's sure-fire Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature and probably Best Original Score, ""Soul"" is a brilliant mess of a movie more likely to appeal to adults than to children who almost certainly won't 'get' it, (and they certainly won't get the references to ""A Matter of Life and Death"" unless they have sophisticated cineaste parents). In some ways it's both old-fashioned and ground-breaking, at least in its attempt to push the boundaries of children's animation while never reaching the sublime heights of say ""The Incredibles"" or ""Inside Out"". The animation may be extraordinary but we've been here before.The title, of course, has more than one meaning. Soul might refer to what a good jazz musician puts into his music but more fundamentally here it also refers to what we are all said to carry within us. Quite early in the film our hero finds himself on a 'Stairway to Heaven' to give that Powell and Pressburger film its other title and from here on it alternates between the avant-garde and that old-fashioned Pixar formula right down to a talking cat, (big mistake). A brilliant voice cast, (Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Angela Bassett, Daveed Diggs and a surprisingly cast Graham Norton of all people), do what they can with the material but the scirpt is uninspired and it is noticeably lacking in gags, (I think kids will get bored quite quickly).

20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Good for the soul.,7,31 December 2020,"'Soul (2020)' isn't really concerned with the afterlife (we only see the entrance to its version of 'the great beyond'), instead it mainly focuses on the place where souls are formed before they enter a human body. 22 is one of such souls who simply doesn't want to leave 'the great before' and has scared away all those who have tried to help her do so. That is until she meets Joe, a jazz musician who winds up having an extended out of body experience. The two embark on a journey that sees them reevaluate their priorities, preconceptions and, even, life itself. The high-concept plot explores emotionally mature themes surrounding passion and purpose. For the most part, it plays out as an otherworldly adventure that whisks you along without asking you to think too much. That's not an issue, though, because it's all quite delightful. It culminates in a touching, somewhat profound final message: the purpose of life is to live. It's an enjoyable and engaging affair right from the start. Its animation and overall aesthetic is rather beautiful, portraying its relatively realistic world with a subtle yet vibrant vigour and experimenting with somewhat extreme stylisation whenever elements of 'the great before' come into play. It's also worth noting that its principle cast of characters are almost exclusively black, something that's sadly still rare within the genre. Nobody feels like a caricature and it's great to see people of colour represented as, well, ordinary people. Its world is generally more diverse than usual and, as such, better reflects the one we know. Overall, the affair is entertaining and, sometimes, poignant. It's incredibly well-achieved, even if it isn't quite as affecting as some of its studio's other efforts. 7/10",Soul

I didn't care for much of the plot, the heart wasn't there, and even the score (which is usually one of Pixar's strong points) wasn't as good as it should have been, especially for a movie with music as its' centerpoint. I just don't find that it answers a majority of the questions it sets out to ask, about life, afterlife, and any sort of meaning a person can have.

23,Cineanalyst,Jazzing,6,28 December 2020,"I do enjoy a movie based around puns, and ""Soul"" is about a Jazzcat who literally becomes a feline focused on playing jazz at a nightclub and about soul music involving spiritual mind-body dualism. That's my preferred eye-rolling examination of the arbitrariness of meaning--not the sophomoric philosophizing on the meaning of life and death that occupies much of the rest this ""Soul.""It's also the first Pixar movie to feature an African-American protagonist, although it took 23 features to do it--five more than the Marvel Cinematic Universe but much fewer than for parent-company Disney (unless one counts ""Song of the South"" (1946), but nobody does, not even Disney). Yet, that's only to put a white voice (Tina Fey) in the black body for much of the runtime as if it were some sort of light, cartoon treatment of ""Get Out"" (2017), or with the blue bodies of the souls, a reverse ""Avatar"" (2009), and to put the black actor's voice (Jamie Foxx) in a non-human animal. To most of the picture's world, his voice is even taken away as a result. The soul catch-22.Even for a long cartoon, ""Soul"" seems particularly silly to me and more religious, albeit of a goofy sort, than usual. On the other hand, the computer animation looks good, per usual of Pixar, including a cubist-inspired afterlife (or pre-life, I guess). I suppose the theme of confusion and lack of control of one's body may have some resonance with children audiences, but Pixar already did that with personified emotions in ""Inside Out"" (2015). The narrative emphasis on music in ""Soul,"" however, which corresponds neatly with the importance of scores in these animated pictures, raises this one up some. The cat is kind of funny, too.",Soul

So I'm an expert of some sort.And it's got so many great aspects-for kids at least-I have to only admire the construction, the acting (via voice and animation), and the music (which is not incidental).I do like jazz, which helps, because I bemoan its continuing marginalization. The film makes it seem relevant on some basic level, a way to talk with layers and beauty. Yeah, the movie actually has qualities of adult loss that add to the very childlike wonder and the basic twisting plot.I don't talk plot, so can only say that there is a key twist (on the hospital bed) that took me by surprise the first time and still thrills me on later watching. It's key to the willingly inventive qualities thoughout. For my taste, the recreation of heaven and souls and the apparent rules that govern that world are fun but just a shell for the rest of the movie (just as they are inside the head of the girl in ""Inside Out.""But I have to return to the music, and to the dramatic stylizing of Jon Batiste, who is funny and talented in real life, too.

Visually imaginative and sprinkled with jazz music, this cartoon is a feast for the senses for all generations. Its only drawback is that at times it seems a bit hasty.

30,ironhorse_iv,"Pixar truly put their heart and soul into this animated movie. For the most part, it kinda work.",7,9 April 2021,"Watching protagonist Joe Gardner (Voiced by Jamie Foxx) try to escape the world of before life with the help of a young soul 22 (Voiced by Tina Fey) was a somewhat interesting character study. Although the mature philosophical themes about living may elude younger viewers. Even for adults, the movie can be a bit confusing at times with the spiritual elements of existential crisis involving the character's out of the body experience; along with the Catch-22 subplot of looking for a spark. After all, screenwriter and director Pete Docter along with co-writers Kemp Powers & Mike Jones didn't even know if the film should go with the nurture or nature route with the baffling unclear Eastern and New Age mediative. Having both themes just made the message of the picture a little more jarring & muddled. Then there is the fact that the movie can get a little too preachy and seriously heavy handed at times to the point that most of the humor takes a backseat. The jokes that were left for the audiences didn't really hit my funny bone. The montage of interactions with key historical figures trying to mentor 22 was somewhat insulting. I found the sassing bantering between Joe and the cynical, snarky and mischievous soul really annoying. Plus, the constant messing with people by 22 in the Zone probably caused at least a few fatalities. Truth be told, none of the souls in the Great Beyond doesn't really seem to care about the value of life; including the Jerries. After all they're the worse, openly willing to let megalomaniac' personalities go to Earth. Who knew that the manifestation of dynamic energies, appearing in a comprehensible form, albeit abstract could be so hypocritical? As for the 'Freaky Friday' body swap concept later on the film. I found those jokes a little more adorable. However, some animal lovers might find Mr. Mittens' out-of-body experience jab tasteless. Along with that, certain people of color might find the fact that Pixar's first movie with an African-American lead somewhat problematic. The film visually has Joe barely portray in his own body. As for me, I found everything about Gardner's urban surroundings felt authentic and real. The film so deeply ingrained into Afro-American culture that not seeing the protagonist in his human form for most of the runtime was no bother. After all, that concept beats the original idea of Joe as a Caucasian animator wanting to become a rock star. I really don't see that fitting the title that much. That said, the movie still fails to go into detail how Gardner could be ever be mistaken for Dr. Bjorn P. Börgensson. Honestly if the Jerries could tell the different between unborn souls with little more than vague circular blobs and few personalities, you would think that they would notice who the mentors are, through their distinctive features that those souls carry over. Bjorn and Joe truly don't match. The Jerries really are awful. Plus, did they ever found what happen to the good doctor in the end? I don't think he ever appeared in the movie. Shame that they didn't even use John Ratzenberger's voice for him. Anyways, I guess he's a mysterious throwaway character; along with odd mentions of Joe's unseen ex-girlfriend Lisa and missing posthumous father. Backstory on these three would had help the film a lot as they could had played more into the plot. Because of those unexplored character developments and the cop out ending, the movie wasn't as tear-jerking or cathartic as other similar Pixar flicks. There just weren't enough supporting characters with great voice performers to provoke a deeper and more resonant emotional response. As for the main cast. Those voice performers felt at times like they were holding back. Especially Foxx whom could deliver a very good emotional musical driven performance. The actor doesn't even provide all the jazz piano playing as that role went to pianist Jon Batiste. Since the film was centered around music and needed something to animate Joe's piano playing to, why not use Foxx! It would had been nice. The tune to 'Epiphany' with his singing voice could really stood out. Sadly, I hardly remember any of the score by composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. I found most of them forgettable. As for the animation. It's a mixed bag. Some of the visuals are breath taking vibrant. I do like the way the music notes looking Jerrys and Terry (Voiced by Rachel House) were traditionally animated; along with the abstract sound waves shapes the main character falls into from the musical staff conveyor belt. The blending of the 2D animation into a CGI world landscape was truly flawless. However, those scenes are far between with others designs failing by being little too unnatural. As for the after-credit zinger. That add on really doesn't make much sense now since many of the 2020 movies were impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, forcing Disney to skip its theatrical release and debut on its streaming service instead. Nevertheless, the movie still certainly still worth checking even if fails to capture the greatness of other Pixar existential films like 2017's 'Coco' had. At least, the flick is not too much of a grinding, soul-crushing experience. It's decent at best.",Soul

I really enjoyed the film's protagonist, Joe, whom I can relate to in many aspects. His perseverance was justified, and I rooted for him all the way. I enjoyed his family set-up and back story. I really felt and understood his determination.This might be one of the top rated films according to IMDB, but (for me) it never reached the emotional depth as films like 'Inside Out' - which it is often being compared to. Maybe this was due to the ever-present humor. In a way, it almost felt as if they used the idea of 'Inside Out' and tweaked it a bit to give it a different appeal. Some of the dialogue, manner of speech, and characters sounded and looked as if they were taken right out of 'Inside Out' - especially the character '22'. There's even a bit of 'Finding Dory' here, with Tina Fey sounding a lot like Ellen Degeneres at times.'Soul' is a jazz-infused animated film with soul! It has a powerful, positive message. The film deals with death in an uplifting manner - as to appeal to a younger demographic in an easy to understand way, I suppose.

Movie Review -Pixar's filmography is like handful of diamonds. Every single film is like a diamond with different shape but all shine equally on their own side. Pixar's Soul was awaited since the announcement cause the master director behind Pixar's classics like 'Monsters Inc.', 'UP' and 'Inside Out' Mr. Pete Docter was coming back. Soul promised to be a journey of a lifetime and undoubtedly it fulfills all the promises made before and matches all expectations kept by movie fans.Soul is about a musician, Mr. Joe Gardener who has lost his passion for music is transported out of his body and must find his way back with the help of an infant soul learning about herself. In this journey he realises many unknown facts about himself and then how he transforms into a new soul living person is all that Soul has got to show you. Pete Docter, Mike Jones and Kemp Powers's trio has written a beautiful script that breaks certain notions about life, passion and purposes. It's like, may be you want to be something for the sake of your passion but that wasn't a purpose of your soul and so you had to look at your life in a new way. The screenplay for the same is highly appreciated because the way it links fictional world with real World is truly amazing.Soul is artistically fabulous as the creativity behind the subject is Marvellous. The production design and visuals are eye-pleasing. It may not be groundbreaking but enough to prove it's creavity considering the need of the storyline. Pixar always gambles with similar theories where they connect emotions of the real life to the fictional fantasy world which doesn't exist but you easily believe in that unknown World. And the best part is, that fictional World teaches you a lot about real Life. Soul has managed to balance the content very well despite its complexity. The structure feels bit intricate at the start but once it's get going there're no hurdles. Soul connects to all ages audience because the importance of this message is universal, ageless and timeless.In a nutshell, Soul is lovable lesson on life that no one can hate. Emotional binding of Soul is unbreakable hence it tugs a ring in heart. A person with heart surely leaves with tears in eyes and joy in heart, that's where Pixar wins it all. Pete Docter delivers another heart-touching Classic in Pixar's legacy and he makes sure you're gonna live every moment of it. Disney and Pixar invites you on a journey of a lifetime which you must not miss if you are willing to find the real meaning of your Soul. This one is swimmingly in the top 5 films of the year.RATING - 8/10*",Soul

42,Vartiainen,Heartfelt examination on life's values,7,19 September 2021,"Joe Gardner (voiced by Jamie Foxx) is a pianist who works a day job as a music teacher. His life's greatest aspiration, however, is to make it as a jazz musician. But just as a golden opportunity lands on his lap, he falls down and his soul ascends towards the Great Beyond. But he's not going to let little something like that to stop him.Directed by Pete Docter, the man behind Pixar's Inside Out, this film certainly has that feel of self-reflection and deep philosophical bent to it. While still being perfectly kid-friendly. Gardner's voyage through afterlife has him asking what it truly means to be alive and what is even important in the grand scheme of things.I also really liked the way the movie avoided tying itself to a religion. The concepts examined are certainly the ones every single major religion on the planet also addresses. But that's just it. These ideas, questions and concepts are universal. And this film very neatly finds that golden path that allows everyone to see it, no matter their faith, race or creed.If I had to nitpick, I'd say that I quickly grew bored with the film's design. Some shots, like the approaching white oblivion of the Great Beyond, are simply breathtaking, but for example, the unborn souls are simply these blue blobs. It's very IKEA slash Apple style of design, which I personally find off-putting.Still, it was a good film. Not Inside Out good, but then again, very few films are. I'd say it falls just a bit short of Up and lands somewhere around A Bug's Life.",Soul

This movie is codirected by Pete Docter (Up and Inside Out) and Kemp Powers (upcoming Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2) and includes the voices of Jaime Foxx (Django), Tina Fey (Mean Girls), Angela Bassett (Strange Days) and Richard Ayoade (The IT Crew). The animation for this is first rate and as you would expect for Disney. A real enjoyable visual especially with how they depict the music. The characters were depicted well also. The depth of the features and character's characteristics were delivered very well. The story was fun to follow and very entertaining.

46,drqshadow-reviews,"A Groovy, Stimulating, Feel-Good Wonder",9,19 January 2021,"Pixar toys with jazz and the afterlife in this quirky, blissful rumination on the nature of inspiration and the meaning of life. The film's superficial framework involves an optimistic high school music teacher, trapped in a body-swap triangle with a wary spirit and an emotional therapy cat, but it's really all about a sweeping sense of discovery, about celebrating the miracle of consciousness and the little daily pleasures we all take for granted.In-between crisp, validating episodes on a lovely day in autumnal NYC, we also play with a heap of peculiar, interesting ground rules and unusual conundrums on an odd, colorful alternate plane of being. This gives the creative team both the time and liberty to really go for it, a chance to portray all manner of abstract visual concepts in their own distinctive fashion and, to the surprise of none, I'm sure, they're an unparalleled success. A theoretical masterpiece in motion. Those scenes, plus the equally hypnotic musical breaks when our narrator sits down behind a piano keyboard and lets the moment sweep him away, had me wrapped up from the first hit.No surprise this is from the same director who brought us Monsters Inc., Up and Inside Out: it's a perfect spiritual successor to that powerful string of rich, emotive, conceptual heavyweights. Come for the wacky comic situations, the top-notch voice acting (Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey fit together like a jigsaw puzzle) and the flashy renderings (Pixar's visual team has leveled-up yet again), stay for the life lessons and mind-easing philosophical notes.",Soul

May be Doctor's best work.,10,27 January 2021,"That this is a heartwarming story filled with wonderful scenes and quite a few laughs is a given. That the animation is *breathtaking* is also a given because of Pixar. But the feature I like most about the film is how abstract and for a lack of a better word philosophical it is.It is not just that a central concept in the story-""spark""-can be read in several ways (i.e. divinity, being, readiness etc.) but it is also the film is careful enough to undermine the surface meaning of the concept (i.e. purpose) as a plot development. The film really grapples with big questions of life's meaning and what to make of it. The abstraction goes throughout the entire film. Even more easily grasped concepts-i.e. The Zone-are very open ended.I simple *love* the design work of pre-life, afterlife and especially the Picassoesque Jerrys and Terry. This films' design scope is the largest in Pixar's history. It combines very fanciful settings of pre-life with the banality of everyday city life with the geometry harshness of say Terry's files. This film takes a huge amount of visual risks to blend such different tones but it adds up to a deeply engaging film.",Soul

54,masonfisk,ANOTHER HIT FROM PIXAR...THIS IS GETTING OUT OF HAND...!,10,27 January 2021,"Pixar's latest from last year. Joe Gardner, voiced by Jamie Foxx, is a music teacher struggling w/his bored students (one student does manage to hear his words as evidenced by her off the book solo) but then he comes to a crosswords in his life when he learns he's gotten a permanent position at the school (benefits, insurance, etc.) & later the same day he aces a tryout for a position in Dorothea Williams', voiced by Angela Bassett, band. What do to, what to do? Oh no Joe watch out for that open manhole cover! And down he goes appearing next on an escalator in space heading to...wherever but in a panic he decides he's not ready for that next step & falls off landing in the Great Before; a green room of sorts where souls are given their traits which will make them human except for one, which the fledgling soul has to figure out before arriving on Earth. Joe tries to take the leap to Earth but keeps finding himself back in the same place so he pretends to be one of the advocates who instructs the new souls & is given the biggest pain in the neck 22, played by Tina Fey, who can't commit to selecting her spark to enter the next realm. Using the services of Moonwind, played by Graham Norton, a spacey new agey shaman, they both get their souls sent to terra firma but due to a mishap 22 ends up in Joe's body & Joe ends up in the body of a support cat. From there ensues an adventure of the metaphysical & corporeal as Joe tries to get to his gig & maybe 22 can learn what makes humans finally tick after all. Espousing the 3 tenets which has kept Pixar afloat all their years, story, story, story, Soul becomes another successful notch in their ever increasing belt of hits which continues to confound the law of averages. W/each world richly drawn (sorry!), the great before is all ideas & notions (down to the counselors all named Jerry, voiced by the likes of Richard Ayoade & Alice Braga, are all lines & squiggles) to the realities of our world where we can see (& feel, yuk!) the dirt of the school walls where Joe teaches. And if the story was merely the tale of a misplaced human soul in a cat in any other animated feature, that would be it, but knowing the gurus behind the scenes that was just an opening salvo. Glorious from start to finish, get your hands on someone's Disney +'s login stat.

Soul has its ups and downs, some predictable moments aside though, this film is an emotional and truly touching masterpiece, and is truly another great film from Pixar- perhaps their best in a while. Jamie Foxx provides an excellent performance as our lead, and Tina Fey also provided a great supporting performance as 22. Graham Norton is also quite good, but doesn't get as much time to shine as the other two main cast members. I did find moments of this film predictable, but how it made me feel and why was anything but. Pixar is known for their ability to make an audience cry, and for the most part I have been pretty immune (Inside Out and Toy Story 4 aside), but never have I been so emotional watching their films as I was with Soul. I won't spoil anything, but it's a touching and absolutely breathtaking spiritual journey with goregous animation and all our grand performances.

The way it uses sound and music, the relationships that are formed, it makes the viewer laugh and feel all at once in a artful orchestra of emotions.Go, watch Soul.

58,jadepietro,Soul Training,8,30 January 2021,"IN BRIEF: Animation that has moments of visual glory that is lacking some soul in its script.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) One can easily see that Pixar/Disney is reformatting some of its former ideas to recreate a new film. You can freely associate other animated wonders from their own vault serving as direct inspiration. From the likes of previous hits such as Inside Out, Coco, Up, and especially its recent project, Onward, the studio creates another high-concept entry. (The latter film has a plot where two boys try to piece together their dead father by sundown...sounds a tad gruesome, doesn't it?)Soul follows that same exact formula and has its lead character trying to piece together himself in his neon-colored afterlife or ""Great Beyond"". It's time for more life and death issues for the younger set: Joe Gardner, a bored middle school music teacher, dreams of a career as a jazz musician and has a golden opportunity to fulfill that dream one night when asked to perform with the Dorothea Williams Quartet at a small club in the Village when he meets his demise. Instead he is transported to a dreamlike universe only to escape and separate from his soulful self. Unable to accept his fate, he returns to Earth with an assist from 22, an unhappy trainee soul.Yet the only real innovation, besides some truly astounding computer animation, excellent voiceover work, and a marvelous jazz-infused score by Trent Raznor and Atticus Ross, is that it is the studio's first All-Black Moviegoing Experience. Kudos to that, I say! But shouldn't the creative bar be set higher? My expectations about this movie certainly were. This film could have been even stronger with some more rewrites and some re-thinking in its narrative structure. But the film's many plusses outweigh its few flaws.Soul is absolutely top-notch in the animation department but middle ground in the storyboard plotting. There are moments of animated bliss (the opening pre-credit sequence, its life affirming montage, most of its NYC setting, especially its wonderful barbershop and subway scenes), but also present are some incidents of lazy writing and visually weak underdeveloped characters both script-wise and conceptually (The ""Great Before"" setting and Captain Moonwind's psychedelic voyage are letdowns). Yet whenever the story remains earthbound, which fortunately is most of the time, the film excels in its details and storytelling. The NYC background settings astound in their creative artistry.But the movie loses its way when it is mired in its otherworldly world. That vision of a afterlife is filled with uninspired Day-Glo glitz populated by flat linear characters that look like Picasso's Cubist rejects that come off as one dimensional visual representations in need of a ""spark"". The screenplay is stuck with dialog lacking in any real wit and brimming over with metaphysical references that no child could possibly understand. (Heck, I even had some difficulty!) Still the puns are frequent in the film's approach to visual humor and its subtle sight gags far exceed the film's written words.Jamie Foxx plays Joe and his vocal talents are excellent, as is his animated expressive character. As his cynical cohort 22, Tiny Fey provides the character's voice effectively, but literally and visually, her character is lifeless like many of the other unborn cute souls. However, her therapy cat image is a priceless match. Solid voiceovers are delivered by Graham Norton, Phylicia Rashad, Donnell Rawlings, and Angela Bassett as the sassy Dorothea.Very well directed by Pete Docter and Kemp Powers, Soul is an entertaining journey that is impressive in its animated computer-generated vision, even if its story is merely serviceable.

61,rannynm,Wonderful Jazz element and beautiful music. One of Pixar's most profound films yet!,8,5 February 2021,"With a charming jazz element and beautiful music, alluring storyline and remarkable voice work, Soul is perhaps one of Pixar's most profound films from all time.This is the story of Joe, a middle school band teacher whose life hasn't gone the way he expects. His true passion is jazz and he is a very gifted piano player. He is not really happy with his non-exciting job and when he gets a gif with his favorite jazz musician, his life seems to experience a life changing experience. Unfortunately he is a little too excited and he ends up in a near death situation. Joe travels to another realm called ""the great before."" In this fantastical place, he has to help someone find their passion and he soon discovers what it means to have a soul. It feels like I'm giving away some stuff, but this movie is so complex and meaningful that is worth to watch everything that unfolds. While the storyline is very earnest and genuine it does get a little hectic. While this movie is animated and colorful, it turns complex and dark. I felt there is a bit too much going on at one point, but the story itself is very winsome.While I'm not a huge fun of the storyline of this film, because it moves back and forth constantly and the concepts explored are too deep at times. Soul is not only for kids and I like that. Usually, most films such as Toy Story, Cars and Coco are targeted for young kids, Soul has a broader appeal and people of all ages will learn valuable lessons from it.The music is unbelievable. I expected it would be primarily jazz, but discovered textures and electronic vibes I didn't expect. Most of the score is by industrial rock band members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross from Nine Inch Nails. The futuristic vibes contrast with the more down-to-earth jazz songs included in the soundtrack.The animation is hyper realistic in the scenes of the real world, which is typical of Pixar's work, with great attention to detail, urban landscapes, and a beautiful color palette. In the before scenes, the animation reminds me of the style of Inside Out, which is simpler and not that stylish.The voice work is stupendous with Jamie Fox leading the cast in the role of Joe Gardner. He certainly gives this character gravitas and an adorable personality. Tina Fey plays 22, the character Joe befriends in his other life, and is quite vibrant and unique.The message of the film is that everyone can find their own talents at the right time in their life. Life can be as delicious as a slice of pizza, because life is amazing and simple as it is.I give Soul 4 out of 5 starts and recommend it for ages 8 to18 and adults as well.

Beyond that, it's fun, beautifully animated, wonderfully cast and just a really great movie (and you don't have to love jazz to like it, but if you do, that's a bonus).

The animation is magnificent: Every character, setting, and scene just looks beautiful. Character animation is so stunning and very realistic with attention to detail in the skin tone, afro hair and facial expressions. Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross's music is a major highlight with most songs making a mark and successfully fits well with the moments in the movie which makes the soundtrack so memorable to listen to.

69,blott2319-1,Thought-provoking,9,23 July 2021,"Soul is probably the most adult-focused film that Pixar has ever made. In fact, I don't even see it as a film that would click with young kids. However, since I'm not a kid and I don't have any children of my own, I felt that this movie was meant for me. I was surprised how much the themes of this movie spoke to me, and led to real in-depth conversations between my wife and me. I also greatly appreciated that it didn't go in the expected direction. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that there was an easy, more ""Hollywood"" way of resolving the main character's arc, and it would have felt like the right and satisfying direction for a traditional movie to take. However, the writers of this film clearly understand that life isn't so black-and-white, and our purpose in life can be a bit harder to discern than we would like to think. I can't remember the last time I was hit by the profound message of a movie quite like the one in Soul. It's almost a bait-and-switch that this film was released by Pixar, because the ideas it tackles are going to fly over the head of most children.I was totally on board for the deeper and more involved ideas in play when I was watching Soul, but I'm not sure the studio was totally on board. I think my biggest complaints about the film would be those moments when they would undermine the heavier themes by adding the more silly elements. While I did chuckle at times, it felt like they were fighting to keep this a kids movie when the original story concept wasn't constructed that way. I did find the visual representation of the afterlife and the beings that run things there to be fun and abstracted in an interesting way. Instead of going overly complex and detailed they made these supernatural beings quite simple and two-dimensional. I also appreciated that they touched on the journey of a soul, but didn't delve too deep in order to make it overly confusing or questionable. There was a lot that worked well in Soul, and I didn't even mention the amazing music that I loved.

70,thekarmicnomad,Good - but dull by Pixar standards,6,9 January 2021,"As you would expect with a Pixar movie this is a great concept, excellent talent, wonderful animation and a good story.Saying all that I didn't really enjoy this.
There was a few issues I didn't like.
I am being a little harsh on this movie, but if you are going to wear the Pixar badge you need to be judged by it.It is commendable that the main character is an average person. But if you are going to make a movie about a ""nobody"" then they need to be a little special.
Here we have a middle aged man who is generally a success but has somehow got it in his head that he needs to be defined by one thing - not sure why, some sort of daddy issue.
He can't possibly leave Earth yet. Why?
Because he needs to play piano in a bar.
Why has he not done so before?
Because his mommy disapproves.
I found it hard to get behind this guy.The pace is very slow and a lot of the film takes place in very mundane situations that really didn't need to be animated.
Even the other world scenes are quite bland, cast in blue with minimal detail.
In comparison to the amazing worlds created in other Pixar movies this feels very underwhelming.Me and my girlfriend lost this about halfway through - she finally fell asleep - there was just nothing really going on.
Normally Pixar films have big emotional sequences and grand musical numbers - that I never expect to like but end up loving - here we just get a bit of piano.I found the theme a bit unnecessarily abstract and high brow.
Does anyone really believe they are only alive for a single purpose?
Is your life really reliant on sparks of inspiration?
By the end it got a bit metaphysical and blurred.Not a bad film but I was hoping for something more exciting and fantastic.

73,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Pixar's most philosophically deep film to date.,8,14 January 2021,"I'll give Pixar credit: they know how to make trailers that give away almost nothing about what the plot is. Sure, I could roughly gauge what Soul (2020) was about, but I could never have guessed it would be this deep. Of course, when dealing with concepts as heady as the afterlife, Pixar had to really balance the line between adhering to any particular religious belief. Be prepared to tear up at least a few times because Soul can hit hard when it comes to life itself.As is the case with any Pixar film, I usually watch for CGI modeling/technology advancements. In Soul, they took the time to perfect the look of some of the most difficult hair to animate, and it shows. This isn't to say that we're getting closer to jumping the uncanny valley (of which they can probably do by now) because this would also ignore the mind-bending ""architects"" who seem equally 2-D and 3-D at the same time. It was also fascinating to see an actual real-world city brought to life through CGI since it almost felt like the real thing.Admittedly, I didn't have this movie high on my ""to watch"" list. Tina Fey's character seemed annoying, and Disney's choice to push it to Disney+ instead of going to theaters (even simultaneously) felt like a move to quell a film they didn't think was that great. I was glad that I took the time to watch it, though. I appreciated the little plot details that connected everything and made logical sense.

On the cusp of realzing his dream, Joe (or, rather, Joe's soul) finds himself in the afterlife desperately trying to return to his life to fulfill his dream.Strongly voiced by Jamie Foxx, Joe is singularly focused on his goal and he won't let anything get in his way, not even a ""lost soul"" (voiced by Tina Fey).
Now, I am a big fan of Tina Fey's and she does just as good a job in her voice acting as Foxx, but for me, I just didn't sense a gel of characters between these two. Part of that issue just might be in the storytelling - as Joe's character is constantly pushing Fey's character away and, so, was pushing me away as well.And that is too bad as this relationship is at the...well...soul of this film and I really wanted this to work better because the rest of the film is WONDERFUL.
Docter's depiction of the afterlife is sublimely abstract and I really felt that this worked well and was a smart way to deal with that portion of the film. The script moves along and the assorted situations and characters that Joe and ""22"" (Fey's character) encounter are fun.And that's because Pixar, once again, populates the film with a strong array of voice talent that brings ""something more"" to their characters - Graham Norton, Phylicia Rashad, Wes Studi and Daveed Diggs all shine in what are, essentially, extended cameo roles.Which brings me back to my central issue - Foxx and Fey are on screen together for most of this film and I just wanted to connect with them more. Perhaps I was just not in the mood for this film at the time I viewed it. I will definitely give this movie another look (because there are so many good things going on).Perhaps, I just need to open my soul more.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Soul
76,Animany94,Pixar surpasses itself yet again.,10,12 March 2021,"Every time I think Pixar can't get any better they do it anyway in some shape or form.The hype surrounded how ""Soul"" bore similarities to earlier output ""Inside Out"" which is my favourite by the studio, so of course I was excited.It didn't disappoint! It might even be Pixar's deepest movie to date with a thoughtprovoking take on what happens before life, between lives and most importantly during one's life that makes it worth living which is illustrated beautifully by the dynamics between every single character, but with musician Joe Gardner and troubled soul 22 taking center stage.Add in Pixar's masterclass animation which contrasts the living world's realism with the abstract world of the souls. A new masterpiece has made into our world which makes our lives worth living!",Soul
77,fernandoschiavi,"Determining the relativity and importance of diverse human passions, the film is a love letter to those who face difficulties in the search for a purpose",8,6 June 2021,"To elaborate this journey, the script written by this triad visits some successful constructions from other Pixar productions, such as the aesthetics and way of organizing the afterlife quite similar to the universes inside the head of Inside Out, which the spectator more attentive you will be able to perceive. Maybe that's why the first arc of 'Soul' seems too simple, with a lot of influence from the series 'The Good Place'; the second arc presents the adventure itself - a little too extended but fun; finally, the grand finale of 'Soul', which takes us unexpectedly, as we are guided to focus on a narrative line, when, in fact, the film's trump card is in a more special layer.The script brings the intensity of an exciting story always able to change its course every 15 minutes in an unexpected and very well constructed. When we are getting used to the story in Pre-Life, we are suddenly placed back in New York on a journey that had everything to fall into a silly exchange of bodies, but becomes essential for the evolution of the protagonist's journey and 22. Before long, a new twist arrives, approaching depression with extreme gentleness, demonstrating, in fact, Pixar's courage in not being inhibited in discussing serious issues for children, as had already occurred with the same disease in ""Fun Mind"" or the death and mourning in ""Viva"" and ""Onward"". To top it off, the trio of screenwriters brings priceless comedic reliefs, especially with the experiences of icons of Humanity in teaching 22 - what is poor Mother Teresa of Calcutta without patience?It may sound complicated, but the animation's narrative circumvents the complexity. The objective is well established. Joe is a good guy, talented, but who became so obsessed with becoming a great musician that he dropped things just as important. One is so essential that we adults never appreciate it. The simplest and most beautiful of all. To live. While at You Seminary, Joe follows his life before death and realizes that he was lonely and unhappy. The scene is heavily influenced by Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol.Although fun, 22 is a complex character. She has no motivation to earn a living on Earth, as she has never experienced feeling the wind in her face, the sand on the beach in her feet, or devouring a piece of pizza. Simple things for us on Earth. However, when 22 has this fleeting experience, we follow the sparkle in her eyes and her passion is aroused. That passion of 22 should remain in all of us. We're just like Joe, obsessed with a goal. The film makes us reflect deeply on the real meaning of life. We are here for what reason? From an early age, we've been motivated to go to a major university, get a great job, and settle down financially. But is life just about that? And live and enjoy what the world offers us every day?The script, by the way, is able to deconstruct this view of the world by initially putting Joe's perspective on the way we know Pre-Life. Still connected to the fast pace of New York, Joe is faced with a structure that, apparently, indicates a place to establish a person's destiny, of course, determined to work, to her social function. For this reason, he takes 22 on a brief journey through the most diverse professions, including painter and librarian. Gradually, however, the project of being human teaches the trained adult the importance that simply watching a falling leaf or feeling the sea water touch one's feet can be far more striking than any minimal pseudo-professional advancement.If the physical world is just a path that Joe wants to quickly cross to reach his destination, when he dies the relationship is reversed: on that treadmill to the Afterlife, he doesn't want to reach the end, but postpone that journey as much as possible. Soon, like most Pixar movies (and Western fables in general), Soul will teach its protagonist a path he will take. The triply script signed by Pete Docter, Kemp Powers and Mike Jones has some central themes that will be the great moral of the story here. First, it's an anti-deterministic journey, as one of the major twists revolves around the discovery that, contrary to popular belief, the requirement to go to Earth was not a professional aptitude, but the very fact of being ready to take advantage of the worldly experience itself. The distinguishing characteristic of a person is not his great ability for an activity-basketball, cooking, music, and so on. - for this would imply reducing human existence as a whole. The film's title itself is a polysemic joke as it works both in the sense of soul in English and soul, an Afro musical genre. When the narrative starts, there is a convergence between the terms, as it is the music that completes Joe's soul. At the end of the journey, music will no longer be the great essence of this man's life.Consequently, to this first motto, a big subject that surrounds Soul's narrative is also the learning that life is not limited to work. Therefore, as throughout his life Joe only had eyes for his professional obsession, the narrative creates a device for him to start looking, in a forced way, at himself: the exchange of bodies. It is a solution not very new in this type of story, but in Soul it seems to work precisely because its protagonist is completely imbued with an individualism that, ironically, will be solved through an external view of himself. Even so, powerful is the moment when Joe, in the skin of the cat, sees number 22 (in control of his body) being a pleasant company for the barber and other customers, precisely for doing something so simple that he never managed see: talk about a subject other than music. ""You never asked anything about my life"", says the barber, when it's time to say goodbye. Here's the big reality check for Joe.If this particular moment is one of the most direct in the narrative, other events corroborate the same intention in subtler ways. One of them is when number 22 (controlling Joe), in a movement opposite to the protagonist's rush we saw earlier, stops in the middle of the subway station to listen to a musician playing the guitar, evidently delighted with that experience. Therefore, this moment is contrasting not only because it goes to show the small beauties of life, but also to point out once again the individualism of the protagonist. After all, he apparently has a great passion for music, but he never had time for an attitude like that, caring only for his music.Soul makes Pixar's most adult film, where the studio goes back to talking about not easy topics and here it deals with philosophical issues, of life and death and the meaning of life itself. And in doing so, he spares no effort to get the viewer's attention, and deviate a bit from the topic that can sound a little boring to children. Even though in Soul everything is very colorful, visually wonderful to watch and the animation graphics are so beautiful and it makes you want to look at everything and pause the movie at all times. Pixar's work excels more than anything in all its setting and visual techniques, whether on Earth or in the world of souls, where we can clearly see the textures on the screen, and of course in creating the personalities of these characters to tell this story. A simple story, nothing fancy or out of this world, which shows that deep down all human beings have a unique thing that makes them special in their own way.If the graphic aspects that dictate the experience were not enough, it is also important to emphasize the extreme quality of the sound work presented by the production, a characteristic that greatly enhances the important representation displayed on screen. Bringing the first black protagonist in the studio's history, the narrative establishes the fundamental connection that Joe has with jazz, a cultural expression deeply associated with the African-American figure - and responsible for shaping genres such as Soul music, for example, the music sector that makes the title of the cartoon is even more significant - and that the character carries in her life as a purpose and a way of remembering her dear father. Thus, pianist Jon Batiste was in charge of creating songs that would rescue this artistic DNA so based on improvisation, a mission that results in a contagious dynamism that combines with the unpredictability of life the film talks about. Not enough, the rest of the soundtrack was made by composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, a duo that manages to efficiently elevate the most ethereal and emotional moments of the work.Soul deals with these essential issues yet manages to make a witty and emotional film. Maybe it's not for kids at all, but the colorful air, and the shenanigans that 22 and Joe make throughout the film should amuse the little ones. But make no mistake, Soul will definitely touch your soul and of course why not make you cry on the way too, right? It wouldn't be a Pixar movie if that didn't happen. We are facing a playful journey about human purpose and about the universality of the self-discovery process. Driven by a lively ambiance and a soundtrack that greatly enhances its representation, the animation captivates by establishing a great pair of protagonists and by never shying away from important themes that should not flirt with simplicity. Determining the relativity and importance of diverse human passions, the film is a love letter to those who face difficulties in the search for a purpose, showing that these can never be achieved without the help of those around us.",Soul
78,PsychoBeard666,Enjoyable,8,31 December 2020,"Pixar and Disney have a knack for the best kind of emotional manipulation, but this film didn't tug at the old heartstrings like the ones that came before. Instead, we're left with a message of ""Live every minute of your life like it's your last"".",Soul
79,mitsubishizero,It came out shining brightly,9,6 January 2021,"Another Pixar classic to add to the list. Soul is a great movie. Not perfect but i'll get to that later. It's a lot more mature than its previous films. You could say it's more of an adult film in that regard. What can I say about this that hasn't been said? It's greatly animated, well acted, and has mostly good story and theme to go off of. I say ""Mostly"" because there're some things that I felt could've been stronger or even changed for the better.My first issue is the story and its themes. Joe's (Jaime Foxx) a great character but he dies within the beginning of the film. Right when he gets his big break. He didn't last long like I hoped. His role as a mentor to 22 (Tina Fey) almost falls into the magic/ wise mentor black trope. Even when he gets back to earth, it's as a cat and not in his body. That's pretty backhanded. And at the end, just to add insult to injury, he chooses to stay in the afterlife and let 22 move on having inspired her to live. While I get where they were going, I still think he was shorthanded in that regard. He still has a life ahead of him. Well, ""had"" now that he moved on prematurely. I understand that the moral was not to take life for granted and to enjoy the little things when possible, but this just feels like he got the short end of the stick. He didn't fully live his life like the movie wants you to think. Instead he gave it to 22 who still doesn't know how to take care of herself in our world. That's concerning and as a mentor, he didn't really help her out with that.For all my issues with this, there're still some great things this movie did. First, the animation. It's amazing, it's Pixar so there's no surprise there, but still. The animation looks great. You have to admire the speed and fluidity of the character when they move and talk. The textures feel natural too. Especially the hair. Speaking of the characters, they work well off each other. Whether they're the main or supporting, they get the necessary screen time to fulfill their roles.I didn't know Tina Fey voiced 22 until the end. Her voice sounded so different than what i'm used to which was interesting. I like how snarky she is yet still curious whether she wants admit it or not. She's grows more and more adventurous and it feels natural. I also like Joe because while he's a bit hapless, he's not the typical nice guy you're used to and probably see all the time. He's optimistic but still a realist. He's determined and persistent but doesn't let it blind him and make him stubborn in his life's journey.The themes are kind've hit or miss. I already said what they were and while the film does a good job showing it, I still feel like it came short in some areas. Particularly Joe's fate at the end. They both should've returned to earth, it would've been interesting to see their lives either remain together or diverge, maybe even crossing paths later on if the ending was written that way.Even with these nitpicks, I still enjoyed it. It was funny, sad, energetic, and even cruel at times. Much like life itself unsurprisingly. With that being said, check it out, you may have a different viewpoint than I do on this film which's fine. Hop in and see what you an take from this.",Soul
80,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Beautiful story,9,2 January 2021,"I was awed by how freakishly detailed this Pixar animation is of the New York City scenes. The storefronts, streets, signs, subway seats, imperfections in materials in glass, metal, wood and other materials that it is almost indistinguishable from live action. I am impressed with what is now possible with computer animation in 2020/2021The story is also very beautiful.",Soul
81,bob-the-movie-man,Soul is Pixar at its most cerebral,9,30 December 2020,"In the last few days I've seen Pixar's latest animation - ""Soul"" - described by various reviewers as a cross between ""Inside Out"", ""Coco"", ""La La Land"" and ""Whiplash"". I'll add to that some older movies with more obvious parallels with the story: 1946's ""A Matter of Life and Death"" with David Niven; 1941's ""Here Comes Mr Jordan"" with Robert Montgomery and its 1978 remake - a personal favourite of mine - ""Heaven Can Wait"" with Warren Beatty. For these all tell the story of someone plucked from the world a tad too early.In ""Soul"", Joe (Jamie Foxx) is a talented jazz pianist always dreaming of getting to be a big time session musician. He is stuck though in a worthwhile but unappreciated job as a high school music teacher. But his luck is - temporarily - about to change when an old successful student (nice touch) recommends him to provide backing to the fearsome jazz star Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett).Just as things seem to going his way, an open manhole cover has other ideas, and Joe falls to his 'death'. Feeling his soul has exited the world too early, and just before he gets his big shot, Joe's spirit struggles to return to the world with the help of reluctant soul/recruit ""22"" (Tina Fey).Pete Docter seems to have done it again with ""Soul"". The man behind Pixar's hugely successful ""Up"" and ""Inside Out"" has the magic touch with these animated classics. He's had more than his share of Oscar success. (Although having gone straight to streaming on Disney+, does it qualify for the Oscars this year? Or have they relaxed the rules?) Assuming it is eligible, you'd be a brave man to bet against ""Soul"" winning Best Animated Feature this year.For there are some sequences of this movie that are breathtakingly effective. The fall of Joe from the ""stairway to the great beyond"" to the pre-life domain (as shown in the trailer) is a masterpiece of graphic design. (And do I detect in there a tribute to the ""stargate"" in ""2001: A Space Odyssey""?) What makes these sequences distinctive is not the afterlife soul's or the ""great before"" souls, who resemble blue variants of Casper. It's the 'counsellors' of the realms. They are surreally drawn Picasso-style in 2D and - although easy to draw for preschooler's with a crayon - might be a bit of a stretch for them to relate to.But will the kids get it? I know that my 6-year old grandson enjoyed watching it. But ultimately, this is principally a Pixar film squarely targeted at adults to enjoy. Indeed, the themes of death and afterlife might be disturbing for younger children (as in ""Coco""). They will certainly struggle to understand the land of lost souls, where those obsessed with their work or hobbies (metal detecting! LOL!) are almost beyond reach. And surely the message of 'enjoying the everyday here and now' rather than getting too wrapped up in career or life goals will only be relatable to adults.""Soul"" is brim-full with Pixar quirkiness. As per normal, the movie has a lot of detail that will need multiple watches. And I can confirm that the pause button helps! For example, ""22"" has been an earth-apprentice for so many millennia that he has had just about every mentor who's ever passed through. His 'den' is wallpapered with ""Hello, My Name is ...."" badges, and a pause at that point reveals mentors as varied as Gandhi, Aretha Franklin, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking! And in the end titles, the usual list of babies born during production are ""Recent You Seminar graduates""!The movie also features two of the most distinctive voices from UK television. Graham Norton plays Moonwind: a sign-spinning hippy and lost-soul-sea piratical captain (I've honestly not been taking drugs). And Richard Ayoade, a UK TV regular but familiar to US audiences from his role in ""The IT Crowd"", plays Counsellor Jerry (well, one of them!). Alice Braga, as another Counsellor Jerry and most recently seen as the doctor in ""The New Mutants"", is another familiar voiceFor once, Michael Giacchino doesn't get the scoring gig. Instead, this went to the ""Nine Inch Nails"" partnership of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. (The soundtrack for ""Mank"" was their most recent work). The music is perhaps not as immediately accessible as some of the previous Pixar scores. But I think will be a 'grower'.I have a ""but"" in my review. I sobbed like a young child during parts of ""Up"". And similarly, I was a mess as 'Bing Bong' faded away in ""Inside Out"". And yet here, my tear ducts remained stubbornly unchallenged. Perhaps this is a personal thing, and others were a soggy mess after this movie. But, for me, it simply didn't connect with me at the same raw emotional level that Docter's other work (and indeed other Pixar movies) have done. So, for that reason (only), I'm going to hold off my highest rating.It's highly recommended since, notwithstanding this, it's a magnificent effort. (At the 11th hour, it made my ""Number 7"" slot in my Top 10 of 2020). It's also worth noting that it's mildly groundbreaking in being the first Pixar movie with a black leading character.(For the full graphical review, please check out ""bob the movie man"" on the web or ""One Mann's Movies"" on Facebook. Thanks.)",Soul

85,kjproulx,An Imperfect Pixar Film That Still Wows,9,11 January 2021,"When it comes to Pixar films, it's very rare that they have a bad day at the office in terms of releasing feature films. Unless you're talking about the Cars franchise, every one of their films range from good to incredible in my opinion, so I'm always eagerly awaiting their next outing. Amidst everything going on in the world, Disney decided to drop their latest Pixar film on Disney+, which surely would have made millions for them from families in theatres. Honestly, it's too bad this film didn't make it to theatres, because it's pretty great. This is the definition of a film that looks and feels like a movie made for kids, but the existential messages throughout will probably go over the heads of a younger audience. Here's why, although not perfect, Soul is one of the best movies to have received a 2020 release.Joe Gardner, a middle-aged man who has yet to make a mark on the world, falls to his death on the day of his big break as a pianist. Immediately entering a soul-like world where is must discover what it truly means to be alive, this film sends you on a journey that will have your mind wandering. From thought-provoking messages to eye-opening revelations about humanity, Soul is one of the more realistic stories that Pixar has ever told, just with a fun look for children. On multiple occasions, I found myself swept up in the subtle use of musical cues or even when hardly any music was being heard at all. I'm also a sucker for films that revolve around music and they decide to play with the music or sound design, so that may also make me a little biased in that regard. It also didn't hurt that Disney picked up Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to score the film.Now for a quick detour into where I feel certain viewers will see issues, as well as myself. Personally, I found this film started off far too profound to the point where I didn't even know what it was trying to say. I put things together and I was eventually right by the end of the film, but I would say there are moments when the film feels slightly unfocused or gets caught up in its own world. It's about a soul world after you die, but the messages of life and living, in general, were slightly lost in translation sometimes. Still, the overall message and life lessons that are brought to fruition in the final act more than made up for a few of these missteps.For many years now, even with Inside Out, the classic Pixar feel has been thrown out the window in my opinion. When you go back and look at Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., Wall-E, and many more, you can absolutely identify them as Pixar movies. Soul, along with other films like The Good Dinosaur, Brave, and even Inside Out, feels just like another film animated by Disney. That's not a bad thing at all, because this film is great all around, but the Pixar brand feels looser and looser as the year's progress. Soul honestly felt like a mash-up of Pixar and Disney animation, especially when jumping back and forth from the soul world to reality.Overall, you should expect nothing less from Pixar/Disney to release a film that's gorgeous to look at. Once again, they knocked it out of the park visually, adding another layer to the story as a whole. A bit of the narrative, as I said, will be lost in translation for some, but I thought the idea of the film, along with the final message, added up to a fantastic film. Soul may not be one of Pixar's best films, but it's a great one, and in a year like 2020, that's a huge win. I loved watching this movie.",Soul

88,msbreviews,SOUL should be seen in the morning of Christmas Day. It will make you enjoy this festive season a lot more.,9,14 December 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Out of my Top15: Most Anticipated Movies of 2020, eight were removed from this year's schedule due to the current global pandemic, so I didn't have that many films for which I felt incredibly excited. I love pretty much everything that Pixar puts out, and at the start of 2020, I noticed that the studio was releasing not one but two original animated movies, something quite uncommon in their history (only happened in 2015 and 2017). Onward was yet another success, but everyone knew Soul was the studio's big gun. December release date means better chances to win an Oscar, and the highly anticipated return of Pete Docter (Monsters Inc., Up, Inside Out) to the director and writer's chairs also elevates the film's expectations.I'm no different. My expectations were high as the sky, but the main question in my mind wasn't really if Soul was going to be a great movie, but if it would be so good I'd love it more than Wolfwalkers, my favorite animated flick of the year so far? Well, let me write that it's a wonderful, beautiful, heartwarming tie. I love them both very much, and I wouldn't be surprised if I saw them in my Top10. However, this is Soul's spotlight, so let me get to it, and spit out the only minor issue I have with the film. During the first act, I couldn't feel a connection to the story nor the characters. It took me a while to really get fully invested in the narrative, and even technical aspects such as the animation style and the score (Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross) felt weirdly out-of-place and surprisingly not that enthralling.Nevertheless, this slow, unconvincing beginning doesn't negatively impact the movie overall, as most of these apparently awkward components improve as time goes by. From the moment it clicked with me, I went on that emotional rollercoaster I always expect to ride in a Pixar feature. The studio is known for its extremely heartfelt, shocking, tear-inducing third acts, and even though Soul isn't an exception to that rule, it's far from being one of those mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, devastating final minutes. Its third act is astonishingly emotional, and it sends a lovely message to the audience, one that made me reflect on the entire year and a specific moment in my life.Pete Docter, Mike Jones, and Kemp Powers explore the taboo subject of life's meaning in a predictable yet profound and entertaining manner. The approach on philosophical questions like ""what's my purpose?"", ""what's my spark?"", or ""what does it mean to have a soul?"" is cleverly developed and very well-written. There's a sequence with the protagonist near the end that will make tons of viewers experience it simultaneously. I found myself rewatching this scene in particular to help me remember a certain period in my life where I realized that what I thought was my destiny was, in fact, just one of those life passions that leave us with unforgettable memories.I was able to deal with that moment pretty well, but many people lose themselves once they figure out that what they thought they were meant to do/be isn't really what the future holds for them. They become lost souls, and only a spark of life can revitalize them. Soul explores this matter in such an authentic, genuine, creative way that I couldn't help but cry as I do in every Pixar film. Watching Soul will make you appreciate life a lot more, especially those tiny, little moments that we forget to remember. Living, with all its horrible phases, is the best life experience anyone can have. After a year of isolation and separation from the people we love, this movie arrives at the perfect time.Technically, the animation style and score didn't convince me in the first few minutes, but by the end, they're part of the key aspects that made me cry like a baby. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are starting to become two of my favorite composers (The Social Network, Gone Girl, Mank). Pete Docter proves that his undeniable talent behind the screen remains intact, and this time, he introduces Hollywood to the debutants Kemp Powers and Mike Jones. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey (22) deliver some terrific voice work, so expect them to receive dozens of nominations. Finally, congratulations to every single artist that worked on this film's animation. These gifted people are the real stars of Pixar.All in all, Soul is everything I expected it to be. A classic Pixar feature, with the trademark emotionally powerful third act; a heartwarming, sweet, tear-inducing score; and a relatable, profound, well-explored story about our own soul and the meaning of life. Pete Docter delivers another award-worthy flick with the help of Kemp Powers and Mike Jones, and with the outstanding voices of Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. It may start slow and follow a predictable path, but it's only a matter of time until every viewer connects with the main characters. Soul surpasses the barriers of cinema, becoming a healing media from which people can take away so, so much. It works seamlessly as a reflection on life, and as a motivation to truly live every single moment of it. It's the ideal movie to watch on the morning of Christmas Day with the entire family cozy and warm in the living room. I promise you: it will make you enjoy this festive season a lot more. Undoubtedly, one of the best films of the year.Rating: A",Soul

90,SoumikBanerjee25,The Lesson is for All!,8,26 December 2020,"""Soul"" digs deeper than what may seem on the surface. With their prevailing standards in animation & narrative; Pixar attempts to showcase an enlivening journey about life itself. An insightful voyage that you wanna be a part of!
Pixar has always been the frontrunner when it comes to animation movies.
Toy Story, Up, Inside Out, Wall-E, Coco; some of the remarkable feats achieved. All because of the sheer talent & audacity they are in possession of.Crafted with imposing ardour & perceptiveness; *Soul"" takes us on a enthralling journey.
That articulates more on life than anything else.
By conveying the rightful meaning, it enlightens us on how to live. It exhibits our narrow-minded nature of attaching ourselves to dreams, longings; meantime forgetting the very gift we all are so fortunate to have. How we as human beings yearn for greatness yet we don't bother to value the ultimate blessing one could have in their entire existence. The 'Life' itself.For the first time in a Pixar movie; the concept, the incentive moved me more than the characters did. After cherishing an abundance of great works from Pixar over the years, this one felt a tiny bit underwhelming as per its storyline goes. Although as I mentioned before; the visuals are simply stupendous. It's prismatic, vibrant & full of diversity. With precise attention to minute detailings. Soundscore is soothing, Voice work has been done really good as well.
Jamie Foxx as 'Joe' & Tina Fay as '22' stands out. It's only the last act that left me quite
discontented. Somewhere my greater expectations got the better of me in there.In Conclusion, 'Soul' would be a top recommendation; not because of its writing or the characters but for the significant lesson it profoundly accommodates!",Soul
91,mahmus,One of Pixar's most deeply personal and moving films,8,29 December 2020,"Pixar movies are good at making me cry, but rarely do they elicit deep feelings of sadness. Until now.Throughout its surprisingly unpredictable story, Soul tackles with very conplex themes in a way that manages to be not too overwhelming, but deep enough to leave you with a sense of enlightment and reassurance once its over.It goes to more familiar territory towards the third act, and not every unpredictable turn is as effective as others, but this might just be one of Pixar's most deeply personal stories and I'm so grateful to have been able to witness it.",Soul
92,aboalhyjaa,I believe its one of the best movies Pixar ever made !,10,1 January 2021,"Im inspired, and feel loved. Its a really good movie, and its not only for childrens, im 19 and I enjoyed it myself. What a great way to start 2021",Soul
93,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,26 December 2020,"That Pixar is the best animation studio in the world everyone already knows. So much so that, even when he releases one of his less original films, he still manages a beautiful work.This is the case of Soul, a production that opens this Christmas (Friday) on the Disney + video platform - away from theaters because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The animation is one of the funniest of the company in recent years and presents a commendable balance between children's language and visuals with a mature and open message to leave adults thinking for days.But it achieves this with a climate that seems to be a mixture of ideas present in other studio successes, such as Divertida mente (2015) and Viva - Vida é uma festa (2017).Let me see your soul
In Soul, a middle-aged music teacher finally achieves his dream of joining the band of a renowned saxophonist.Unfortunately, he dies before the first show and is looking for a way to get back to life.To this end, he assumes the role of tutor to a troubled young soul, with the hope that by helping her find her purpose, she will be able to deceive the system of the Beyond.Death suits you
The transition between the real and the spiritual world translates into a significant change in style. After a good part with the cartoonish but realistic look, traditional from Pixar, Soul adopts much simpler characteristics to portray souls.In this sense, despite a concept similar to that of Viva, it comes to remember a lot of Fun, with its graphically cartoon and less complex characters - which does not mean, however, that the film is less beautiful.The parts in the Hereafter are the best and funniest in the movie, and it's hard not to be sad the moment the story returns to Earth. Over time, the animation finds its rhythm, but would gain with more dedication to the afterlife.Child laughs, adult cries
The proximity to the 2015 animation can also be explained by Pete Docter, who signed Divertida mente and who shares the direction of Soul with the debutant Kemp Powers.In addition to the animation style, in the new film he also explores concepts intrinsic to human nature, while giving almost bureaucratic characteristics to the functioning of the universe.All of this maintains Pixar's classic balance of pleasing children and adults at the same time, often with the same things, but with details clearly designed for different audiences.Soul stands out even from the other works of the studio by dispensing with the more closed messages of its predecessors and presenting an open ending, which resonates as a direct punch in the viewer's soul - perhaps the best type of blow at the end of such a difficult year.I liked this review of the G1 site.Film seen on December 25, 2020.",Soul
94,amindostiari,More than an animation!,10,11 January 2021,"This animation teaches us a lesson in life! Do not get away from life and enjoy it!

95,MrDHWong,Transcends its way through the ranks as one of Pixar's most beautiful and mature works to date,9,26 December 2020,"""Soul"" is a Disney Pixar animated film directed and co-written by Pete Docter (""Inside Out""). Featuring the voices of Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey, it transcends its way through the ranks as one of the legendary animation studio's most beautiful and mature works to date.In New York City, Joe Gardner (voiced by Jamie Foxx) works as a school band teacher, frequently displaying his passion for Jazz on the piano to his students. Shortly after accepting a gig with a renowned Jazz artist, Joe accidentally falls down a manhole and finds himself separated from his physical body as a soul heading into ""The Great Beyond"". Not wishing to pass on to the afterlife just yet, Joe escapes and poses as a ""Soul Instructor"" for a rowdy, pessimistic young soul known as ""22"" (voiced by Tina Fey) and tries to use her as a way to reunite with his body back on Earth.Pixar films are famous, or perhaps infamous in some cases, for their ability to stir up many different emotions in viewers young and old. This has helped the studio endure on as long as they have, as virtually any generation watching can find at least one thing in these films that they can appreciate. ""Soul"" not only ticks all of those boxes in this instance, but also appears to usher in an exciting new era of animation and storytelling. There is so much wonderful philosophy on life and purpose being addressed here, sometimes so subtle that I only realised the deeper implications of what a character may have been saying several scenes later. Even as I write this, I am still pondering over many of the life lessons this film has to offer and how I could possibly apply it to my own. This film never talks down to its audience, which leads me to assume that it obviously intends for everyone to be listening to what it has to say, and not just young children. While this may not be the first Pixar film to touch on topics like emotional purpose (see ""Inside Out"") or the legacy we leave behind (see ""Coco""), this one definitely feels like the first one to combine each of those important themes together, creating the perfect hybrid of a film for the entire family to enjoy.It still amazes me how every time I think Pixar could never top the beauty of their current art style, another one of their films comes along years later to prove me wrong. To date, this film has some of the most gorgeous visuals I have ever seen in a 3D animated film. Even something as simple as fingers on piano keys or establishing shots of New York City brim with so much realism and attention-to-detail that I often found myself believing I was looking at a live action film and not something rendered on computers. You really get the sense of how much love and care has been put into a project like this on every frame and this further emphasises how Pixar cares about not only their movies, but their audience as well. This is a film that should be experienced for the first time on the big screen so it seems like a major injustice that it has been relegated to streaming services where its visual charm has been compromised.Jamie Foxx once again shows the wide extent of his acting talent, voicing the protagonist Joe with such affable relatability that you can't help but want him to succeed. His antics alongside Tina Fey as 22 were a delight to watch as both of them learn about each other and the differences in their personalities. Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing Fey play comedic roles but it caught me off guard when she delved deep into dramatic territory during some of the film's most serious moments. She does a great job here and has me convinced that we could see her cross over into more drama films in the near future. I would also love to see her act alongside Jamie Foxx again, as the two of them have excellent chemistry.With yet another winner in their grasp, it seems like Pixar are on roll right now, especially since ""Onward"" came out several months earlier in the same year. It does bother me that it is unlikely this film will ever receive a theatrical release due to the current state of the world right now as audiences will be missing out on experiencing how stunning it would look on the big screen. At least on Disney+, it has a wider reach to anyone who may be curious in seeing it, so I shouldn't complain too much.I rate it a solid 9/10",Soul
96,meydiana-65242,Moved Me To Tears.,10,5 January 2021,"I can't put into words how close to home this movie hit for me. Not to sound pretentious, but it's more than a movie - it's a life lesson on how to live. It'll teach you that life isn't about careers, goals, passions, or achievements. It's about living, right here in this moment, exactly where you are.The voice acting, animation, soundtrack, writing - all phenomenal. It is officially the greatest Pixar movie ever created in my book. Kids will enjoy it, but this one is for the older crowd. It's for anyone who's ever felt like their life has been a waste. That they've made too many mistakes, that they should have done something else, that it's too late to live. 10/10",Soul
97,cardsrock,This is why I love cinema,10,26 December 2020,"Movies like this come along once in a while and remind me why I love this medium so much. The sheer ingenuity, wonder, and heart makes watching this film an experience to remember. This is Pixar at its most bold and inventive. This NYC feels so vibrant and culturally rich, while the Great Before feels so new and full of promise. The score is magical and the animation is breathtaking. Soul is probably Pixar's most beautiful film.Seeing Pixar tackle such a deep topic and handle it with such a delicate, loving touch is awe-inspiring. Films like this truly transcend their medium and become something else entirely. This is without a doubt the most profound film Pixar has made and I challenge you not to reevaluate how you approach life after the credits roll.",Soul
98,cliftonofun,Get busy living.,9,25 December 2020,"Wow, Pete Doctor. Just wow. When I heard Pixar was attempting a movie about jazz and afterlife, I was skeptical. Just like I was about a story about monsters powered by screams...or a robot love story about the environment...or an adventure tale about an old guy whose house floats away...or a look inside adolescent emotions. Doctor helped write every single one of those stories, so I should have known that this film would deliver the goods. Much like Inside Out, this movie took some huge risks, some of which paid off and some of which didn't. But like almost every Pixar story (and especially Doctor's films), I FELT something. That is no small thing. This movie's climax was way less traditional than most other Pixar films, but those feelings were actually deeper for me. I walked away remembering what life is about and to live every minute of it. What's better than that? 2020 was hard, and I needed this one by the end of it.",Soul
99,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,6 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...""Soul"", Disney's and Pixar's take on what happens behind the scenes before you are born and where you go after you die, was an engaging film that will have you thinking about life and relationships, while entertaining you along the way. The CG work is second to none with strong characters (showcasing excellent voice-overs), and meaningful plot development.When Joe Gardner, a music teacher who finally gets his big break to play a once-in-a-lifetime gig, falls into an open manhole and dies, he finds himself in line to enter the ""great beyond"". Joe is unsettled inside and not ready to cash in his chips just yet, so he tries to escape and return to his body still on earth. Along the way, he runs into 22, a soul in the ""great before"" where souls are prepared for their life on earth. Together, they manage to find a way to return to earth, but 22 mistakenly takes over Joe's body, and Joe takes over the body of a cat. In their efforts to correct the situation, they both find out more about themselves that they never realized, and more about the meaning of life as well.This one took a little bit of patience to get into. It pretty much just dumps you into his predicament and moves along very fast. This film was geared more towards adults, I felt, though I'm sure children would enjoy it as well. The pacing is breakneck at first, but when things start to slow down and you are allowed to catch up, it began to be very enjoyable.Overall, I did like this movie, and I would recommend it. It isn't one of my favorite Disney/Pixar films, but it has a good message and a satisfactory ending. I have it in my own collection, and would watch it again. Perhaps a 2nd viewing will be more enjoyable than the first. 7 stars out of 10.",Soul

101,DogePelis2015,PIXAR IS GREAT,10,24 June 2021,"Soul is a deep and moving experience; the plot is very good, the animation is excellent and the soundtrack is beautiful; Pixar makes us a reflection on life.",Soul
102,elicopperman,What Would you Rather be in Life?,8,26 December 2020,"When it was announced that Pixar would release their most anticipated film of the year, Soul, everyone seemed to be cautiously optimistic at what appeared to be a diet Inside Out. Unfortunately, we all had to end up waiting another half year before the film ever got to see the light of day, with the pandemic being the key reasoning behind its delay. However, the timing of its new release could not be better, as not only was it finally released through streaming on Disney +, but on Christmas Day of 2020. So now only time will tell if audiences deem it as another breakthrough Pixar hit. But what about me?The movie centers on middle school band teacher Joe Gardner, who feels his life hasn't lived up to his expected passion of jazz. However, upon traveling through another realm to help someone find their passion, he realizes the purpose of having a soul. Without going further into the overall plot, as that would reveal massive spoilers, the main thesis behind this film is what it means to have a true purpose in life. As the film goes on, it focuses on Joe's search for helping out the other random soul that he has encountered, but also about the other soul itself and why people were made to live in the first place. It seems as if the film is a reminder to general people to not obsess too much about the fear of death and just focus on living in the moment while you still can. Whether that means following a personal passion you've been seeking for so long, helping someone discover their own meaning to progress, or even embracing a potential future, there is so much worth living for as a soul, and it all starts when you make it happen through your own story.Now that isn't to say the movie's narrative didn't come without its own share of flaws. As the film is partially set in an alternative version of reality where souls are either sent to perish or become a mentor to other souls, some of the story points are a bit complicated the more you think about them. If we're meant to believe that souls can go into the real world once they've formed their own personalities, then unless not considering Joe's past life as a music lover, Joe could have easily gotten back to normal. Not to mention, the plot itself might not please the usual Pixar detractors who feel like the company tells the same duo journey movie again and again, with a pointless antagonist who only serves one function to the story and that's it. However, despite the questionable plot points and unnecessary foe, the movie itself is more about the emotional experience of discovering who you are, so logic isn't as key as the main fundamentals. When you're trying to discover what your purpose in life is, you may skip on some little details and drive forward to the main focal point anyway.Being Pixar, of course the visuals are a sight for the eyes, mostly with the production design and world building. Since the film takes place in both our reality and the surrealistic soul world, there is a notable contrast between both interpretative worlds. Joe's world is a marvelous depiction of New York City in terms of scope & scale, and the realistic albeit caricatured people designs that work well for the overall acting side of the visuals. The surreal soul world is a more colorful abstract dystopia that allows these squishy soul beings to discover more about their own development. The latter world is more interesting from an imaginative standpoint, but the real world allows the raw emotional storytelling seep in well to let the viewers connect with the characters more. Lastly, because music plays a key role in the making of this film, the score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross and songs by Jon Baptiste are just phenomenal. Not only do they say so much about their individual sequences through their own melodies, but they sell the film's thesis on discovering who you are to a massive tee.If ever there were a reason to spend your holiday break on streaming services besides the Mandalorian and Wonder Woman 1984, then this would be it. Not only is Soul another well crafted Pixar feast for both the eyes and the soul (no pun intended), but its central characters and core themes are enough to resonate with anyone who feels lost in life. It can happen to even adults when we still can't discover what we're meant to be, but more often than not, you need to allow yourself to live once in a while instead of worrying for all time. So follow your passion, but do so while embracing your life every now and then.",Soul

104,ronakkotian,"Imaginative, mature and emotionally powerful",8,28 February 2021,"Pixar is easily one of the best animation studios to exist. They may have missed the mark on some of their films but the majority are great and Soul is yet another solid Pixar film.Soul is about Joe, a jazz pianist, who finds himself in between Earth and the afterlife after landing his biggest gig yet.Pixar films have been a huge part of my childhood and even though I don't watch them as much now, they still hold a special place in my heart. Soul is a film that has many elements to appreciate. It really touched me by the end of it and surprised me by how mature it was. Despite being a kids film, I feel Soul will resonate with adults in particular considering the themes its presenting. It spreads a message that's so heartfelt and emotionally powerful even though it's told in a formula that we've been exposed to countless times. The voice acting is spot on. Jamie Foxx does a terrific job as Joe and Tina Fey was also really good as 22. The only real problem I had was with the conclusion. Whilst I believe it will strike a chord with many people, I feel Pixar took the safe route instead of ending it how the film led us to believe it would end.Like always, Soul is a visual treat. There is so much imagination and creativity at play here. The scenes taking place in the Soul universe are absolutely stunning. The gorgeous blend of blue and purple make it a feast for the eyes. It's a vibrant world that I wish I saw in cinemas. I also liked the style of animation for the character design of Jerry and Terry. Playing a great contrast, the New York City scenes are portrayed very realistically. Being someone who has visited New York, the noisy and bustling nature is captured brilliantly. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic. It sounded amazing and is easily one of the best scores of 2020. The jazz composition by Jon Batiste is also beautiful to listen to.Soul is easily one of the best films of 2020. The animation is visually stunning and memorable. It deals with a lot of existential themes that connected with me and despite not being perfect, it still put a smile on my face.",Soul
105,garethcrook,Do Pixar ever get it wrong?,8,27 December 2020,"What a warm hug of a movie. Joe is a jazz musician. Teaching part time, it's not his dream, his dream is to play, to perform, to get lost in music. Anyone watching this, should know how it feels to get lost in something. It may have the Disney ident up front, but this is unmistakably a Pixar film. They effortless create these magical worlds that transport you to places you didn't think possible. Yes it looks gorgeous, has a solid moral tone, but it's sophisticated. To watch Joe's digitally animated fingers move on the keys is a thing of pure beauty. This isn't the beauty of Soul though. Joe, just as he's about to realise his dream, dies. Sending his soul into a gorgeously rendered world where, after running away from the light of the great beyond, finds himself cast as a mentor for new souls. It's a dreamlike place of floating characters that look like a cross between Olaf the snowman and Casper the friendly ghost, rendered in cool blues and scored deftly by Reznor & Ross. He hooks up with 22, a new soul disinterested in living a life, so much so, she's happy to try swap with Joe, giving him her life as passage back to his, while she skips to the great beyond. That's not how the system, run by a fluid outline character voiced by Richard Ayoade works though. His voice sits well. Graham Norton less so as the cosmic Moonwind, who rides in what my young film companion describes as a 'hippy boat'. It's all very existential, a continuation in some ways to Inside Out and to be honest I'd be happy to stay in this world. Moonwind, an enlightened soul though helps Joe get back to his body... almost. He falls back to Earth along with 22 who lands in his body, while Joe... lands in a cat. Together they have to navigate a way to fix this and learn a little about themselves. It's wonderful of course, in the true sense of the word. Delightful, charming, funny and poignant. It'd be lazy to say it's got soul, but damn it's brimming with it. The perfect tale of finding your place in the world and following your dreams. Pixar don't make bad films, this though is truly great.",Soul

Sure I had smiled a few times at the low key humor but never was a joke thrown in my face that seemed like it was just thrown in there to make sure the film didn't lose the kiddos. Admittedly Pixar doesn't usually go out of its way to ensure kids laughing every second but this film REALLY doesn't have that on it's mind.This is a lovely story about a grown man discovering his true gifts in life and it left a big smile on my face. A very sweet and inventive film that will hopefully leave most of us adults with something to think about when the credits role.,Soul
109,rubenm,A film without limitations or constraints,8,31 December 2020,"'Soul' doesn't have any limitations or constraints. Unimaginable things happen, undefined beings are introduced, unknown dimensions are explored. In 'Soul', it is possible to refuse death, to create the personalities of yet unborn people, and to travel through the opposite of the afterlife. Time, space or fysical boundaries have no real meaning. And still, 'Soul' is not difficult or hard to understand. It is funny, warm and optimistic.The movie is an absolute gem from a creative point of view. The animations are incredible, and the aesthetics of the Great Beyond are beautiful. It is full of unexpected twists, little jokes and funny surprises. But the film also has a very serious aspect to it - this is not just form without function. The message 'Soul' wants to convey is cristal clear: life is only worth living if you try hard to make the best of it. Maybe the film even emphasizes this a bit too much.In a way, 'Soul' is the modern counterpart of 'It's a beautiful life'. It has the same message about life being worth living. Both films have a very spiritual dimension, and both are, in a way, about life and death. One already is an all-time classic, the other seems to be on its way to become one.",Soul

111,saadanathan,A Pixar movie for adults 8/10,8,18 March 2021,"""Soul"" is a great movie. it is funny, original, amusing and beautiful. For a Pixar movie it is really odd and a bit of a gamechanger. This is the type of animation films that adults can relate to. If you show this movie to kids it's way more complicated. Pixar's older movies are the ones you might want to show to your kids because they are more fit for them. Movies such as Finding Nemo, Monsters inc., Toy Story and more are the ones every person can relate on and love. But Soul has something different. Maybe only adults can truly understand the meaning behind it's story. Soul talks about the meaning of life and how to enjoy every moment of it. How a character wants something vs what he needs. We can all relate to this film because of what it talks about: we want to live are lives doing something meaningful, but what happens when our passion becomes an average work? What happens when our work becomes an obsession? What happens if we discover in a later stage of our lives what we needed and not wanted. What if what we always needed was right in front of us the whole time and missed it? These are the kind of questions the main character Joe Gardner is forced to face throughout the whole movie. These are the same questions we are facing all the time and maybe with Soul we can find a few answers. The soundtrack is amazing, Pixar really nailed it this time with the Jazz music. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey are wonderful as Joe and 22, they are funny and have a amusing relationship. 22's line is a reliable and realistic thought: you can't crush a soul here (the great before), that's what life on earth is for. Overall as much as I want this movie to succeed I just feel like some people won't get it. On the other hand it's great to have another original and creative Pixar movie instead of a sequel.",Soul

113,andrewroy-04316,Soul is another simple but ambitious Pixar film with a strong message,7,26 December 2020,"My thoughts on finishing Soul are very similar to my thoughts after finishing Inside Out: very solid movies with interesting metaphorical takes on humanity, and a nice central message but not having as deep an emotional pull for me as they seem to for others. Where Inside Out wrestles with emotions in a creative way, Soul considers a soul's purpose in life. The central message driving the entire movie is that people don't enter life with one singular purpose; instead, you have a passion for living and enjoy whatever life ends up throwing at you. I really like Joey as a vehicle for this story, realizing that there isn't something else out there he's missing out on; life is life. I will also say that the script has some very funny moments, particularly with historical jokes with 22 (like the Knicks joke and Lincoln getting pissed about Jackson being on the 20). The characterization, especially of minor characters in the film, is strong across the board (with perhaps the exception of the Jerrys and Terry). There are plenty of minor things that don't quite make sense within the world, like how he's the first person in centuries to try to skirt death, or how the process of dropping into a body works, or how transitions from real world to soul world work at all (like what happened to that hedge fund bro when he didn't have a soul? How is there not a fundamental difference between people with and without souls? How can people lose their souls by being knocked out of the zone?). Also, what was the difference between boat captain soul bro and everyone else - why could he hear Joey inside the cat and nobody else could? These are fairly minor quibbles but I would have liked a bit more consistency. I do seem to be in the minority in seeing Soul as a solid Pixar movie but not one of their best, and even then I still think it's a solid, ambitious film with a compelling central idea.",Soul

115,baileycrawly,Absolutely Fantastic,9,25 December 2020,"Soul is Pixar doing what Pixar does best: telling stories that appeal immediately to children, but have messages that resonate with you no matter how young or old you may be. It doesn't pander to children and it isn't too adult for the younger age demographic. The story is simple enough, yet it packs a surprising amount of depth to it. It was moving and uplifting simultaneously.
The film is gorgeously animated, like you would expect from Pixar. The aesthetic is a little unusual and presents a very different picture of the afterlife than what we seen in Coco (which will inevitably be talked about simultaneously to this film), but both are every bit as interesting and imaginative in the development of what an afterlife would look like. This film differs from Coco in the sense that it's not steeped in any particular culture, so the afterlife is free to be as imaginative as they feel is warranted; they can make up whatever they want without fear of cultural insensitivity which is a freedom that serves this film well and makes it distinctly different from Coco. The afterlife - and, subsequently, the ""before life"" - in this film is vibrant and exciting for the viewers, and they came up with a really unique explanation for the state of a soul before you're born that I thought was pretty clever.
As always, this film hits the typical Pixar emotional cues. It's not nearly as strong emotionally as, say, Toy Story 3 or Coco was, but it definitely packs its punch. Underneath the simple story of a mundane man whose soul gets separated from his body just before he gets his ""big break"" is a story that openly and honestly forces you to take a bit of a look inside yourself and find the things that motivate and inspire you (the film calls it your ""spark"") and then it gives you a little bit of motivation to go out and do it.
The voice talent in the film is stellar yet again. The characters really come to life, and it's thanks to their hard work and dedication. Each role feels like it was written specifically for the actors who play them, with one even having a gag about how their voice is annoying (and it's definitely grating to listen to in the film). For a film as serious in message as this, it's not afraid to have a laugh. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is refreshing.
Trent Reznor, who I haven't been a particularly big fan of, scored this film with Atticus Ross, and it was honestly wonderful. They managed to stay on the line between emotional sentimentality and sickly sweetness, always erring on the side of emotional to create a tender soundtrack that perfectly compliments the visuals, characters and themes.
The timing of this release is really nice as well. It provided a little bit of much-needed encouragement and inspiration in the midst of the ongoing pandemic and, while it may not have been planned to be released in this way or for that purpose, it's the absolute perfect time for this film to come out.",Soul
116,sweidman-28016,Breathtaking,8,31 December 2020,"""Life is full of possibilities. You just need to know where to look. Don't miss out on the joys of life.""Here it is. My most anticipated film of 2020. I cannot tell you how excited I was to see Soul. Pixar hasn't made a single bad movie (with the exception of Cars 2). Even the ones others criticize like The Good Dinosaur and Brave (don't get me started on the hate for that one) I do think are good. And with director Pete Doctor making my top two Pixar films, those being Inside Out and Up, this was bound to be exceptional. Soul tackles the tough subject of life and death. A musician is transported out of his body and must find his way back with the help of an infant soul learning about herself. Though this is not as great as I wanted it to be, Soul is still a beautiful film both in story and animation.Sometimes I just wanted to watch the animation rather than focus on what was happening. This is an achievement in animation. I don't think anyone has seen anything like it. Everything on Earth looks very realistic that you sometimes forget this is an animated film. In The Great Before moments, the designs, both character and setting, match so perfectly. They're sort of abstract but we know what they are. One of the characters goes on to explain that briefly. The colors are bold and match the tone well. I'm most impressed with the color on Earth for it showing how everything actually looks. But by far my favorite scene is the falling scene. I can't describe it in words but that is the single most beautiful thing I have seen all year and in an animated film.The characters are well fleshed out. Again, they were trying to go for the realistic approach. Right from the beginning, we understand Joe's intentions and can relate to his goals of achieving his dreams. Jamie Foxx is brilliantly cast for voice acting. I loved his expression and how he puts a bit of his own voice into it. I can say the same for Tina Fey as 22. 22 is quite an interesting character and just what this film needed. She's there to remind us what it means to live and why it also sucks sometimes. Also for those who are accusing 22 of being a white savior, you are dumb. 22 is gender neutral, they even mention that her voice and everything that we're seeing is an illusion, and doesn't even fit the criteria for being a white savior. Cancel culture is stupid. Anyway, the dynamic works well between the opposing opinions makes for a more interesting story. Every character, no matter if they're on screen for 2 minutes or 20 minutes, they all have something of significance to say or do. I did want to know a little more about the Jerry's and Terry just because that aspect fascinated so much, but I understand that it's not key to the story.The writing is truly impeccable. We're already dealing with a tough subject and it's not there to dumb it down for the audience. They don't care too much that kids will be watching. Instead they made it a universal experience. There are many moments that younger ones won't understand. At one point it shows how small we are in this galaxy just through image with no dialogue. I liked how they handled that. Nothing needed to be said. All that was needed was a moment of silence and a reminder. Also the final moments are beautiful in both imagery and dialogue. It's a perfect conclusion to the film. So there is a moment where it's kind of weird. They really were going for an unpredictable moment. At first it feels sort of sloppy and too childish. As the story progresses, it comes together making an effective plot line. We learn more things about 22 and Joe in this situation. One thing is a side plot with Joe and his family dynamics. It's a good discussion, but I wanted a little more since it seemed a little rushed. Still some good moments though. If there is one problem I had with Soul, it's that I didn't get one of those Pixar moments. They always have those moments where it's heartbreaking and makes you cry. Since they were going for something different and more adult, it just didn't hit as hard. I felt sad but not the way I wanted.I'm just going to write a small paragraph on the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. They had two films to score this year being Soul and Mank. We knew that they would win the Oscar but we couldn't tell what film it would be. Now we can safely say that it's going to Soul. There style of electronic and experimental has never failed. This isn't top tier greatness like Gone Girl and The Social Network, but it's up there. The sound is both jazzy and ethereal. Since music is a big part of Soul, we needed that matching energy. This is definitely the best score of the year. The score is one of my favorite games elements in film and television. They found the perfect sound to make something beautiful. It matches the tone so well and gets us in the mood for whatever is to come. My personal favorite track, ""Falling"", works incredibly well in my favorite scene. I just hope everyone feels the same way about this as I do.Though Soul didn't exactly meet my expectations of the best Pixar film yet, it's still up there. Mainly I just have small issues that can be ignored and not having the Pixar moment that I wanted. Soul ranks as one of 2020's best films and will land as a classic animated film. I don't know how anyone could hate this. It's enjoyable, personal, and just an overall beautiful experience.",Soul
117,ethanbresnett,Up there with Pixar's finest!,8,30 December 2020,"Wow - there was a lot of hype around Soul, and I'm pleased to say it definitely deserves all of this hype. It is such a clever, beautiful, powerful, and funny film. One of Pixar's best for sure.Jaime Foxx absolutely nailed his role, bringing his character to life in a fantastic way. The character of Joe was really well crafted and watching his character arc and transformation was a joy. As you'd expect with a Pixar movie, all of the voice acting was top notch.The story hits in a way I wouldn't have imagined. It has so much heart, so much emotion, and such a great concept underneath all of this. I actually think its one of Pixar's more adult films. Obviously they always try to cast the net wide and blend humour and themes that both older and younger audiences can identify with, but I felt that Soul had more depth and complexity than any other Pixar film. As a result, as someone in my mid 20s I found this much more enjoyable than some of their other recent films.Another thing to note is that the animation is absolutely stunning. You will not find an animated film that looks better than this. Some frames looked like they were live action it was that good. A feast for the eyes as well as the soul.Watch this movie ASAP as you will not be disappointed!",Soul

119,TaylorYee94,I'm Gonna Live Every Minute of It,8,1 January 2021,"It was the PERFECT choice to end the chaotic and disastrous year 2020 because 'Soul' healed me, comforted me, and told me 'it's oaky'. Gosh, there are so many things to talk about because each part of the movie (directing, animation, soundtrack, etc.) does its job superbly.Concept. It was deep psychology and philosophy. Where does the personality come from? Is your personality inborn or learned? Are body and soul connected, and what is their relationship? These subjects can be abstract and boring to be unfolded on the screen. Even though I do not agree with the director's thesis on these matters, I just love how he draws out the director's version of personality and destiny with great aesthetics and animation. Moreover, it is not the process of explanation, more of the process of understanding, easy steps with much virtual information provided. (I personally do not agree with the concept that the personality is just randomly assigned before a person is born and that there is a place for all pre-existential souls before bodies. Personality is more affected by environmental factors.)Story. What I like. Ending scene. The movie does not show whether Joe decides to stay in the gig or as a full-time teacher. It is all right because he is ready to enjoy every minute of it, indicating there is no right or wrong answer in my life as well. What I do not like. A few far-stretched set ups and sudden move on the storyline. Come on, switched souls? I understand this establishment is necessary tool to unravel the story and reach the ending, but it is just too cliche for me. Also, Mom and son making up is so sudden. Maybe the director was running out of running time.Animation. It's Pixar. What more can I say? So realistic and charming, especially quartet scene and playing music scene.SOUNDTRACK!!!! Jazz and New Age combined together, rocks. Jazz in Joe's time of life and piano and electric music in pre- and after- life. Both fit perfectly with characters and settings. Music in 'Soul' is not a supplementary but a huge component of what contributes the movie. Songs and scores enrich the emotions and make 'Soul' more flavorful.",Soul

The cat is funny. ;D",Soul
121,LloydBayer,"Surging with imagination and narrative clout, Soul is the spark that brings Pixar back in form.",9,29 December 2020,"Ever wondered what your true purpose is in life? In its modest 100 minutes of runtime, this is the first of many questions Soul will throw at you; Questions that we have been asking since childhood, but that which no sage or science has ever been able to answer convincingly. In an attempt to answer some of these questions, the studio steers away from making this a visually groundbreaking masterpiece, and instead builds on its own purpose with a combination of skill, grace and narrative clout that we once loved about Pixar.This wouldn't be the first time Pixar (and owner Disney) tackled grand themes of existence on a deep and metaphysical level. Inside Out in 2015, followed by Coco in 2017 which both won Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature, were also similarly themed but delicate in their approach in narrating the frailty of love, loss and life. And if we go even further back, so were Academy Award winning animations Wall-E and Up. So it isn't always noise and big bucks visuals from Pixar to keep kids thrilled, while parents catch a much needed snooze. And yet, the best Pixar films have historically been the ones that strike a balance between delighting children while giving adults something to think about. Soul leans heavily towards the latter.That warning aside, Pixar veteran director Pete Doctor (Up and Inside Out) also sets a backdrop that perfectly resonates with the title of this film - New York. Perfect because of the noise, crowd, clutter, traffic, pedestrians, and perpetual rush of everything that we have always complained about but miss so dearly now, not just in New York, but also globally. As such, the ache of urban wanderlust is like a shot in the arm when the film opens in New York and when we first meet Joe Gardner (Voiced by Jamie Foxx). Joe is a middle school music teacher caught between his day job and aspirations of a career in jazz music. Despite objection from his mother (Phylicia Rashad), Joe lands an impressive audition with jazz legend Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett), but on his way to his first performance, has an accident that sends his soul into the Great Beyond.We call it ""limbo"" which in Latin refers to purgatory, a state of being between heaven and hell. In the film, Joe cannot come to terms with the thought of his own death, so escapes from the Great Beyond but ends up in the Great Before, a place where souls are prepped for life as humans. In the ensuing process, Joe meets 22 (Tina Fey) who has long resisted being incarnated as a human. 22 is scared of everything she knows about humanity, while Joe believes he has a second chance at finding his reason to exist. Eventually, Joe and 22 make their way to Earth, but not in the way we expect. It's around this point in the film where Soul really starts to surge, and then swell to a thought provoking and emotional level that brings the whole idea to its expressive peak. The answer - if you get it - is astounding, but also like something that has been staring at you in the face all along.Soul is aware of its boundaries in not being too ambitious (pun intended). Calling this film inventive would be a stretch, but at the same time, this is Pixar back in form with a screenplay that reaches beyond its coveted expression for realism. Add to that an upbeat and original musical score, a plethora of talented voice actors in madcap supporting roles, and a creative team that blends artistry with reality in a creative ""spark"" that ignites inspiration and joy, and you are literally watching a film with all that jazz.",Soul

Don't miss out on the joys of life.""Soul is Pixar's most human and, well, soulful movie yet. The themes of life and purpose are important to all of us. It's nowhere as grim as it all sounds, it maintains a lightheartedness and has a cool jazzy score to keep things bouncing along.

Great style and serviceable animation.
Sadly, the music wasn't as good or prominent.. which was a detriment in my opinion. Lack of good characters overall, and memorable scenes/lines. Having a predictable resolution didn't help.Probably won't watch again and it won't get an attraction in a theme park, but I wasn't miserable after finishing it :) In fact, left a good impression.",Soul

I cried and laughed, an amazing Pixar movie, meant more for a grown up audience.",8,9 January 2021,"Pixar always made movies with a deeper meaning and important messages. I have grown up with Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, but these movies can be easily watched by both adults and children. However some of them are more for a mature audience. This was for me very obvious with Up, released in 2009, which I still consider today one of their best movies. Soul is for me one of Pixar's highest peaks. Director Pete Docter managed to treat many different sensitive topics such as death, what is the meaning of life, which is our purpose on Earth, what might come before and after life, in such an effective way. It is a movie that hit me so hard and make me think about many things, even hours after I have finished watching..Characters are amazing, Jamie Fox and Tina Fey managed to give life to very interesting characters, their development is amazing and very believable, I really got attached to Joe and 22, that during their journey together become intimate friends. I really enjoyed the portrayal of both the afterlife and the before life, it was an ingenious way to represent these two phases of our being, how they showed these two universes is visually impressive and unique.""Soul"" is not a movie for children, they wouldn't understand the content and they would most probably get bored, as they do not have the tools to comprehend. It is also an extremely deep movie, so not ideal if you are searching for something funny to watch with your friends. I really believe that the best way to appreciate this flick is alone. ""Soul"" is such a personal movie and everyone can perceive it in a different way, based on their personal experiences. We are on front of an amazing piece of cinema here, an achievement that will be very difficult to replicate. Well played Pixar.",Soul
128,DeBBss,"Is it just me, or...",6,29 April 2021,"I really, really wanted to like Soul; I seriously tried my hardest, but I don't see the appeal. I went into this movie completely blind, without watching any trailers or reading any reviews. I thought soul was a story about joe trying to make a successful career out of himself, all while trying to inspire his students into being passionate about music. Instead, I got a sci-fi journey about the after-life. Soul could've been much more mature, realistic, and emotional, but it went a route that is far too common in Disney-Pixar movies. Sure, the visuals are nice and the character designs are creative, but it lacks a story that has depth. I just couldn't find myself being attached to joe or 22. The characters aren't bad, they're just missing something. And when you compare joe and 22 to other Pete Docter characters, like Mike and Sully, you realize that Soul doesn't offer anything too special.In the end, I found Soul to be a disappointing movie, considering its high rating. I may be the outlier here, but Soul is a slightly above average film. Soul just doesn't compare to other Pixar movie classics, so if I had to rate it as a Pixar film, it's definitely below average. Soul is still a watchable film, and it's definitely not the worst thing to come from Disney, so at least it could've been worse.",Soul

PG
Director: Pete Doctor and Kemp Powers
Starring: Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Graham Norton, Richard Ayoade, Angela Bassett, etcOverall rating 100/100Soul is about school teacher and aspiring jazz musician who loses his passion for music, is transported outside of his body and must find his way back to earth with the help of an infant soul learning about herself and how to enjoy life, he soon discovers what it means to have soul. Wow, what a movie Soul was, a true rare gem for pixar, there are so many good things to talk about here so lets get started.My first few positives would be the likeable characters, humour, animation and the fantastic cinematography. The movie had such incredibly likeable and charming characters, the whole cast involved was amazing in both New York and The great before, the main character of Joe (Jamie Foxx) was a truly special person and was charming and funny and realised his mistakes in the film and strived to make them better which was amazing to watch. Next the movie was hilarious, it had multiple laugh out loud moments with some really clever gags and with an excellent comedic voice cast it was hard to go wrong but Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey had fantastic chemistry. Next I have to say the animation was truly fantastic, the human characters genuinely looked realistic and it was just an incredible movie to watch blending realism and surrealism perfectly, and wow the movies cinematography was something special. I genuinely think Soul was one of the most visually creative and breathtaking movies I have ever seen, with so much attention to detail with beautiful world building, and just strikingly beautiful colour palette, the visuals also made me appreciate the world around me which was something truly excellent that the movie managed to execute.My next few positives would be the clever concept, great set up, fun plot points in the switching of the bodies and the movies excellent deep themes. Wow what an insanely creative movie this was, the way it handled such deep concepts as life after deaths and even when life is created before they are born and making it so beautiful and easy to understand for all ages was powerful, the movie thought of every little detail about its story world and this was truly Pixar at its creative best. I also thought the set up for the main plot points of the movie was really great. I thought the characters being mentors to train new souls to go to earth and find what makes them human with their different passions was really interesting, it set up the message and the development of both the characters well and started the development of both of both of the characters really well. I also thought the switching of the bodies between 22 and Joe was great, this led to so much character development for both characters, 22 got to see how amazing life truly can be and try new experiences finding herself and her own passions, and Joe got to see the world from a different perspective with how the people around him communicated with 22 in his body it was just excellent. I also loved the deep themes the movie developed. The way the movie portrayed death and where people go after their life has ended was done so beautifully and simple for the kids to be educated and have a deeper understanding of life, I also found the movies themes of enjoying the little things in life and living each day to the full was truly moving and a powerful message for Pixar to tackle, it was told so beautifully and so in depth it really made me look at my life in a completely different way with the movie truly developing Joe's character expressing these themes perfectly.My final few positives for the movie would be the character background and development, the fantastic script and the true emotional weight. The movies character background for Joe was truly amazing, we as the audience truly got to know how Joe lived his life, his relationships what inspired him and how he got into Jazz it was done so beautifully and creatively with going through his past memories it was just amazing. The character development as well was truly fantastic, the development for both Joe and 22 was fantastic, 22 was always told she wasn't good enough to live on earth, but when she finally got to experience some of the amazing day to day things that people usually take for granted her love for just living was inspiring, Joe developed so much throughout the movie as well, learning through 22 and his own experiences how he wanted to change the way he lived his life and the relationships within it for the better and appreciate and take every opportunity he got it was some truly powerful stuff. The script was also fantastic, the movies dialogue and morals explored through its script was fantastic, it can only really be appreciated by adults viewers, but wow some truly moving dialogue that truly made you think and made you feel something which Is what great cinema should do, I also thought the movie had a great and well earned amount of emotional weight to it. The movies emotional weight never felt forced it came naturally and was genuinely beautiful, as Joe realised the true meaning of life and to have a soul, it really moved me and made me look at my life differently and truly made me appreciate everything I have in my life and for a Pixar movie it shows true intelligence and deep thoughtfulness from the creative team to make me and I am sure a lot of other people think in this kind of way.Overall, soul is truly one of pixars best movies, it really shows Pixar is at its creative best when it creates amazing original movies like this, Soul told such a complicated and deep concept in such a beautifully simple way for the whole family to truly appreciate, and the movie just really connected with me and offers an equal amount of entertainment and emotion for people of all ages.",Soul

The concept is downright stale.The story is linear and pedantic, as in the first part what drives the characters is clearly *wrong*, while in the second part, you guess it, it's *right*. Quite predictable, no surprises.The two characters are largely unlikeable, mostly because, as I said, their drive is clearly wrong from the start, there's not much humanity or enlightment.Pixar insists with this overly complex, psychological subjects.

SO after some pushing by them we sat and watched it and I am so glad we did.

It wasn't a silly obvious ""life lesson"" such as ""fear is a legitimate feeling"" it was really witty and clever and it did have something worth my while to say. And on top of this it was directed, designed and acted. In my personal book it's the best I've seen from Tina Fey, ever.

145,Darkjak007,Soul train,7,28 February 2021,Pixar's Soul tells the story of a man name joe who after finally getting his chance to fulfill his music career. Suffers an accident ending up dead in the afterlife. Jamie fox gives a compelling performance as a man in the middle of a midlife crisis. The disapproval of his mother and not living up to his father's Potential. Joe portrayal acts a mirror to many that even though you may have a dream it doesn't nessasry means it your purpose.and through his journey in the great before a realm where souls prepare before they travel to earth to be born. While not as colorful as inside out the great before is full of cool color schemes and the design of the guardians Jerrys have a level of depth in design with a flat cubism style. Here joe meet 22 a rebellious soul played by Tina fey who doesn't want you go to earth and wishes to stay in the great before. After a serious of events the two realize that their point of views aren't as clear as they would think. Soul doesn't just refer to the souls themselves but in the music. The sound of music tells a lot about the story and the feeling and meaning of life. No surprise that Jazz soul music runs throughout the film.and it's perform beautifully Soul is a story that touches the heart of its audience and leaves you pondering on your own life choices.,Soul
146,patriciogl10,Pixar strikes hard once again.,8,28 December 2020,"Visually striking, with a clever display of philosophical themes and Pixar's usual warm delivery of pleasant emotional baggage, Soul is a crowning achievement, no more no less. Clearly, the people at Pixar have excelled their efforts to bring to light such a precious and thought-provoking output. Still customarily aimed at kids, yet much of the subject matter is more adult-oriented and presumably much more gratifyingly relatable to the latter target audience. The main characters, Joe Gardener and 22 are richly conceived, oppositely so, as the former is a fully-fledged human being with a life led comfortably but constantly waiting for a miraculous chance for dreams and aspirations to turn into reality, while the latter being a yet unborn soul, unable to obtain a pass to Earth, mainly due to not having a real ""spark"" which is what propels that exciting jump towars our planet. 22 never felt an authentic reason to live a life and is comfortably unapologetic about it. Obviously the two live in entirely different realms but find a unique way to cross paths and try to help one another.The plot finds its ingenious way to reveal a thickly touching, deeply rooted spiritual foundation that disputes our notion of purposes, meanings and eternal questions many of us have probably thousands of different answers to. A enchanting visual journey takes the audience to live a story so relatable, one can't help but to feel a little bit overwhelmed, especially facing towards the climax. It is both rather sad and worth-noting that Joe Gardener is Pixar's first black leading character, but this unfortunate piece of trivia can be mildly compensated by the fact it happened in such a fantastic piece of work, definitely one of Pixar's greatest realizations, a long overdue one.The imagery Pixar built for this film (slightly reminiscent of Inside Out, albeit more imaginative and less childish in my view) is geniously crafted, a bona fide work of art, which is gradually becoming slightly more realistic and impressive with each new picture. If only I could have had the glorious chance to watch this film on the big screen it would have enhance the viewing experience by a landslide. One of my favourite visual representations in the film was when the Terry character entered the Earth realm and manifested itself physically in the same form as in its own realm, but moving around in such a clever, not to mention funny way truly left me staggered.The highly respected animation studio has done it again, bringing their A game one more time, in a wondrous fashion, proving they are still at the pinnacle of their highly superior craft, this time furnished with low-key virtuosity as well as the habitual emotional climax. If there's one thing this film can never lack, is the very same thing penned in its title: soul.",Soul
147,noahgibbobaker,On paper it's great.,6,31 December 2020,"I love jazz, I play jazz, I liked the jazz in Soul, I like existential themes being explored... And I like the imagery (especially the Jerry's which were Picasso paintings).So why didn't Soul work for me?It was boring and the tonal shift from scene to scene is jarring.
It explores it's themes in a mature manner, but the rest of the film is very lighthearted and comedic in tone, this can work and it is for many, but it absolutely didn't work for me.The first scene with the cat is kind of the make or break moment, and it broke for me.Also since watching this I've cancelled my Disney plus subscription and it feels good not giving Disney my money.",Soul

The cartoon also reflects various psychological terms that are unlikely to be understood by a child. Secondly, the drawing of the cartoon is simply magnificent, when viewing the eye gets great pleasure. Third, a great jazz soundtrack perfectly complements this great cartoon. In short, this is another masterpiece from Pixar.",Soul
149,TheCorniestLemur,Where has this Pixar been,8,17 June 2021,"There was a fly buzzing around my room the entire day before I watched this that was annoying me to no end and just refused to land anywhere so I could swat it.Eventually, I lost track of it and it landed somewhere for a nap or something, so I gave up and started watching this film, extremely hacked off.When the film was over, the fly made its majestic reappearance, and suddenly I couldn't bring myself to swat it anymore. I opened the window and decided I'd wait as long as it took for the stupid little bugger to leave.All this is to say that this film did something to me, and that was it gave me an appreciation for my life that Jigsaw could only dream of, to such an extent that I didn't want to kill a fly.I've seen every Pixar film of recent years since Coco, and this absolutely dumped all over them in almost every way, from the characters, to the score, to the voice acting, and even the animation. Damn near every time I think Pixar can't possibly make their animation look any better, somehow they do it.The way they equally captured the grunge and beauty of New York, contrasted with the ethereal You Seminar, where everything is fluffy and blue, or in Picasso-y line art is just...goddamn this film is so pretty. Them colours, man.This also has to be one of the best directed Pixar films in bloody years, because it isn't just the beautiful animation that makes it visually memorable, there's so much imagination in how they show these things, and while we're on the topic of imagination, the score. Getting Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to score a Pixar film probably sounded like the dumbest idea in years for that studio, but my god they nailed it. And Jon Batiste's jazz side of the score is amazing too.And yeah, chances are, this will be one of those Pixar films that leaves you in tears at some point, but not really because it's sad, because you just know that there couldn't have been a bad bone in the writer or director's body, so if either of them ever turn out to be deserving of the Me Too hammer, I'll have finally lost all hope in humanity.Having said all that, it's a 4/5 for me because there is a not very short list of stuff that doesn't make much sense concerning how the rules are set out, and while I don't agree with all the points that have been raised, I don't think I can argue with some of the others. I wouldn't want to spoil it here though, so I'll leave it at that.Also the ending is definitely...questionable, but again I'll have to leave that up to your interpretation. Just watch it, okay? It's easily Pixar's best in years, probably since Inside Out.",Soul
150,jamesjustice-92,Souls can be lost but not crushed,9,8 January 2021,"After hearing too much about this little animation feature I just had to go see what was all the fuss about it and what else can I say but wow! Soul has surely put a lot of soul in it and one viewing isn't simply enough to fully comprehend and appreciate this body of work. I noticed that in recent years animated cartoons have become more and more adult oriented, they're way more multidimensional than they used to be; where a kid sees funny blue blobs walking and talking (and cracking jokes here and there that not all of them will be understood) an adult sees himself and asks himself all of the questions main heroes do. What am I and what is my purpose? Do I like what I'm doing? Is it my passion? Do I belong? Am I really living? Those are only a few questions raised in the movie but everyone asked himself those at least once in his lifetime. The movie will not give you any straight answers to them either because the only person who knows you best is yourself and not an animated movie made by thousands of people with their own lives in mind. But they definitely will give you some (or a lot) to think about. Music here is absolutely gorgeous, especially jazzy moments of it. Animation is outstanding, so is the voice work and despite some minor mistakes and so called ""sins"" Soul seems pretty flawless to me and I will gladly return to this wonderful, soulful feature in the near future.",Soul
151,TheVictoriousV,Life-affirming; Pixar's most lovingly made film in years,8,25 December 2020,"I was worried that Soul would be the thing that happens when Disney and Pixar nearly make an interesting-looking film on accident but catch themselves early enough. The teaser seemed to indicate a somewhat realistic but also stylized look into New York jazz culture, only to then veer into the territory of marketably cute, inoffensive blob creatures that wouldn't look out-of-place next to Olaf the Snowman, Joy, or whatever the characters in Onward were named.Much like The Good Dinosaur (2015), I expected Soul to be a film of false promise. Yes, I expected the movie to DEFY my initially-pleasant expectations. But maybe this expectation, in and of itself, was false?Indeed, Soul actually does spend more time in the superbly-rendered, endearingly-designed human world than I foresaw, with some additional niftiness I will discuss later. It's possible that Disney wanted to make the film more marketable in China (where movies starring black people aren't exactly popular, especially not if it's Star Wars, but Disney like to have it both ways: cashing in on progressive movements and also Chinese movie-fandom) and so had the seemingly raceless ""souls"" dominate certain adverts.Released on Disney+ instead of in a theatre (I invite you to guess why), Soul continues in the Pixar tradition of making kids ponder the different dimensions of reality and self (not that children are the only ones who will appreciate this one - in a way, hopeful youngsters watching it alongside weary, dispirited adults is very much part of the point). Focusing on the afterlife and spirituality, it may seem like it's covering the same ground as Coco (2017). However, Soul has a unique interpretation and could feasibly be Pixar's darkest, most thematically heavy film.In the movie, Jamie Foxx voices a music teacher with his sights set on the jazz stage, who plummets into an open manhole and passes away, finding himself in the presence of souls on route to the Great Beyond. However, through a series of hijinks, he winds up in the ""Great Before"", where souls are formed before being sent to their human hosts. Initially trapped, he is assigned as a ""mentor"" to one of the new souls, the glum 22 (Tina Fey), and so sets out on a quest to return to his body. The resulting adventure is funnier, more thought-provoking, and ultimately more life-affirming than what we've seen from Pixar in years.Most interestingly designed are the beings who oversee the souls. These entities resemble abstract face drawings come to life, but still appearing to be two-dimensional. It makes some sense; the ideas of purpose, legacy, and meaning held by ""three-dimensional"" beings seem to amuse them.The animation didn't wow me in the same way as Cartoon Saloon's WolfWalkers, but Pixar gets it right where it counts. In terms of texturing, lighting (particularly backscattering and saturation), and even things like depth-of-field and framing, this is their most painstakingly gorgeous movie yet.The additional vocal cast is also strong, including Graham Norton as a New Age kook, Rachel House as one of the soul counters I mentioned earlier, and Angela Bassett as a revered jazz musician whose resemblance to the legendary Nina Simone is hardly accidental. The characters (especially the humans and soul-counters) leave an instant impression, not only because they pass the Silhouette Test with excellence. I'll even be nice and say that, even if I don't much like the blob-like souls, their habitat has quite the atmosphere to it - which is to say nothing of the trippy shifts to minimalist 2D. Finally, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have a double whammy with the music (having also scored Mank earlier this winter).It has its clichés, but this may be the best Peter Docter-directed Pixar animation since Monsters Inc., which makes me feel slightly more enthused about what's to come (yes, even Lightyear). The title Soul is onto something, signifying the return of what's been missing.",Soul
152,ferdinand1932,Glossy,5,27 December 2020,"Aiming for profundity doesn't come easy and this movie shows it in several ways.It has ''A Wonderful Life"" type arc and delivers the same bromides too.While the production looks excellent, as is expected, and with an interesting take on jazz of a Coltrane style, it also has the familiar flaws of the genre.Characterization is caricature, there is much too much tedious exposition which is intended to play in the dramatic part of the piece, but is rather cold, or just wobbly in the framing. The dramatic center is a standard aspiration objective and the drama follows a typical set of platitudes to assuage the audience that our lives are meaningful however humble etc.The presentation is the thing and it looks and zings well but whether the script writers working from a Hollywood text book that has a commercial record to validate the idea, have anything of any value to add on the subject is debatable.And where are the cat owners objecting to the fat cat? This sort of representation usually outrages a sector of the public.",Soul
153,jackgdemoss,Objectively the most beautiful Pixar animation,9,28 December 2020,"""Pixar"" may not even be a necessary qualifier in the title. Barring any stylistic preferences, this is the most technically impressive animation I have ever seen. The glimmers of sweat and suit wrinkles, in combination with the lighting overhaul, yield a spectacular product. I would love to learn more about what technological advances made this possible, because nothing in animation history can compete on this front.The other strongest suit that Soul has going for it is its digestible yet profound story. It is so satisfying to have absolutely zero filler in a movie. I didn't realize until watching this that I haven't seen a film in months with proper pacing. The message the film drives home intends to make movie-goers ponder parts of their own life. Although the message is profound, my soul-searching regarding it lasted only a few minutes before pittering out. Maybe that is worth a whole 'nother movie.",Soul
154,ariqakbar,How???,9,31 December 2020,"Well cartoon now transform to something more intense for sure.I can't say to much. Soul was wrapped all the things we miss in daily life. Great movie with a great timing came out in December. You don't need anything else to start a new chapter of years beside all of this value in this movie.God, I miss a lot of things turns out",Soul
155,carlos37andre,"The world around us is beautiful, and we should appreciate it more",9,26 December 2020,"There are so many deep meanings I can think about for this story, man.This is something that's becoming sort of classic of a Pixar movie, it starts not that different from a regular film, there is a clear goal to the story, that seems pretty normal, and you just get kick in the face with an emotional bit you barely saw coming.I love the message of the film, as many great movies usually do, of just celebrating the fact that life is something amazing, and we a lot of times just forget about that, and let it pass through. Soul makes you remember the good stuff about life, appreciate it more, and everything that surrounds you.The part when he was trying to help 22, save her from been a lost soul, chasing her, I thought it was clearly a metaphor for the pressure that sometimes we get put on our shoulders, either by family members, or even just the world around us in general. How that can get into our heads, without we even knowing about, and holds us back from doing good in life. Falling into depression and other types of mental health issues.So, I love that there are clearly two sides of it here, and actually two points of view we can learn from. Joe clearly wasn't paying that much attention of what he really needed to pay attention, and through the eyes of a cat, he could see a different side of life, and finally, after achieving his ""big dream"", put 2 and 2 together and see the big picture. Music wasn't his sole mission, and he could (and should!) do more with his life.And also, 22, who learns, in a different way, that life is actually pretty cool, with millions of opportunities, and you can succeed, in your own way, if you put your mind to it, and do not focus on mindless criticisms.I think my only complaint, and I don't even know it's fair to call it a complaint, is that, even tho I like the final message ""Idk what I'm gonna do, but I will enjoy every minute of it"", I thought it would have been way more powerful if Joe's arc would just end with he going to the afterlife. I thought the journey was perfect, he died thinking he had done nothing with his life, and his big dream was waiting for him, he learn to see life from a different point of view, saw that the dream he thought would fulfill his life, wasn't actually that important, and that he had a pretty great life, with wonderful moments, a lot of people he cares about, passion, and love, and at the end, he would come back, rescue 22, and give her the chance to live her life. I think that he giving his life, for hers, would have closed that arc perfectly. Still, as I said, I like the final message, and it's also pretty damn cool.To sum up, Soul is just another great Pixar movie, from one of the best directors of animated films working today. I loved the message, the journey, the music, and everything else.",Soul
156,GravityLoudHouseLover1,Awesome to the Max :),10,13 January 2021,I saw Soul on Disney + on Christmas Day & it was Awesome. I loved the animation well it's Pixar there know for Beautiful animation.

157,harrylosborne,Slightly soulless,6,14 February 2021,"Soul's best feature is showing just how good animation is today. Every character has personality and a tangible weight, suiting their individual personas. The environments are so detailed and intricate that they enhance every scene, benefitting from intelligent lighting and depth of field.Unfortunately, depth of story is not what Soul does well. The message is somewhat muddled and lost, bogged down in existential questions and a slightly misguided plot. On top of this, I couldn't help but feel Soul definitely isn't for children - everybody that I know thought that this is the exact film kids would get bored watching.There doesn't feel like there's anyone to root for (or against), and this is definitely to the film's detriment when entertaining those not wanting to question their existence. The casting is high-tier, as can be expected from Pixar: Foxx, Fey, Norton and others all contribute their vocal talents. Not everyone is excellent, however: Rachel House and Richard Ayoade didn't fit the bill for me, but this is a minor issue.Soul is what you typically expect from Pixar - but the missing ingredient means it doesn't all quite come together.",Soul

It begins with the case of a life of acceptance and stagnation, dreams that are nothing more than that and fear of rejection.Then, the film addresses themes like anxiety, the failed educational system, social exclusion, the need for peer approval, elitist classes and opportunities that are not given to those who deserve them, and much more.Our spark is unique, and it is up to each one of us to discover the way to make it, and keep it lit.",Soul

160,Christopher_Reid,"Below average for Pixar, full of obvious jokes and unexplored ideas",7,6 January 2021,"I've found Pixar to be very consistent over the years, with the main exception being the Cars franchise. I thought Soul would deliver more of that Pixar magic, perhaps along the lines of Inside Out. But Soul falls far short of that standard.Part of the problem is the humour which is pretty lame and predictable. My favourite kind of humour tends to naturally stem from characters and situations. The most superficial kind of humour is based purely on throwaway jokes which aren't actually realistic. Soul is full of the latter. It has flashbacks similar to Family Guy. Cutaways with loud and obvious gags that occasionally earn a small laugh, but mainly distract from the story and make you roll your eyes.I also had hoped that Soul would offer interesting insights with its abstract world, similar to the way Inside Out did with the mind and Coco did with the world of the dead. But instead, Soul barely explores its ideas and its world doesn't make much sense.For example, when people are ""in the zone"", so to speak, they go to this place between consciousness and the world before normal life. But this idea isn't developed. Most of them just stay in a bubble, but somehow the main character and a few others are able to get out and walk around. It's not clear why.Then there's the notion of how souls are given attributes before being born. This idea also leads absolutely nowhere. It also makes no sense. While certainly children can have different qualities to them, there's no way that some are born snobbish while others are born insecure, etc. That depends a lot on their upbringing and life experiences. Soul has nothing to say on such topics.There's also the idea of souls sometimes being lost, which makes sense. But one of the only examples given is a superficial and soulless (excuse the pun) joke about some kind of financial executive. Yes, I get that a lot of people hate ""the rich"" and people whose jobs focus on money. That doesn't mean that they're all lost souls. In fact, that hatred traces back to the way the Nazis hated Jews - for being greedy, capitalists. Many investors and bankers are normal happy people, good at their jobs and with a balance between work and family. Soul makes a dumb joke based on a cliche and moves on.The main story is alright but often frustrating. Many of the plot points come about because of carelessness. It's hard to root for characters if they do everything in their power to sabotage themselves. As it turns out, these mistakes are just convenient excuses for pushing the plot along and in particular for the main character to confront his mother. Even here, the movie repeats old stereotypes and it's hard to understand how a person this age still obeys and fears his mother like he was a child.At times, Soul has the potential to say something profound. I thought part of the point near the end would be that his passion isn't piano, but teaching. I can relate, doing both things myself. After all, he managed to teach Soul Number 22 to want to live where countless famous figures had failed. And he was passionate at school, even if many of the students were uninterested or not particularly gifted.In my opinion, he was selling himself short, stuck in a public system which values bureaucracy over good teachers or happy parents. And it's a system where misbehaviour and disruption are tolerated way too much. He also has potential as a performer so maybe he should pursue that as well. But the movie becomes vague - the message seems to be to value every moment in life, all the little things. There's truth to that but the path to get there didn't really feel worth it.The music is nice at times, but nowhere near as powerful or memorable as Up, Inside Out, Coco or Randy Newman's early Pixar scores and songs. From Pete Doctor, Soul is quite a disappointment. One of the most superficial films they've made, even if it still looks amazing and is better than most animated movies by other studios.",Soul

162,sirwillisiv,Don't judge a book by its cover. Soul is amazing.,10,25 December 2020,"I think Soul is an instant Pixar classic. A genuine masterwork and in my opinion the best animated film - and overall picture - of 2020. With such an ambitious and otherworldly concept, I was impressed with the unexpected directions the story went and how I was able to follow all of it without difficulty and come out with a fresh perspective.Soul establishes a world and ideas at an absorbing pace, exploring the purpose of living while remaining a fast and exceptionally funny all-ages picture with dazzling and diverse imagery, and a mood-driven soundtrack. It's a film that asks more questions than it answers - which in normal cases I'd consider a problem - but once in a while I think it's warranted. It's food for thought; purposely ambiguous and challenges the audience's perceptions on life and ambition.Soul is the perfect example of a ""don't judge a book by its cover"" film. If you thought from the trailers that the fantasy component overshadows the Black representation, it doesn't whatsoever. Both elements are evenly portrayed and in a briskly imaginative, beautifully animated fashion. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey are an irresistible duo. The drama and humor is tuned to perfection; engaging and supremely relatable. By sympathizing with their identifiable outlooks and dilemmas, I felt like I really grew and changed alongside them and I left with a newfound appreciation toward many aspects of life.I'm astonished at how inventive, passionate and unpredictable Soul is. You know a film is outstanding when it's capable of moving you to the point of changing. Pixar hit the nail on the head with this one. Soul is among Coco, Up and Inside Out as one of their most progressive, layered and thought-provoking pictures. They still carry the gift and it shows no sign of dimming.",Soul
163,coasterdude44,The kind of movie we all needed,10,26 December 2020,"2020 has been horrible, it has been an all out attack on the mind, body and soul. Thankfully Pixar has been able to release Soul finally after about a 6 month delay and it has definitely been worth the wait. Soul is a wonderful, emotional and uplifting film that captures the preciousness of life and what it means to truly live and be human.The story follows themes of identity, self discovery and reflects and subverts on what it means to have a purpose to give your life a sense of meaning, self development and that you always have a choice to do whatever what makes you happy, and that sometimes chasing something that you thought defined you after so many years, might actually keep you in a kind of prison, but that it's never too late to break out and view life from a different angle, which is something that the movie touched up upon extremely wellIt's very refreshing to see a movie that celebrates the feeling of meaningless that has become an epidemic in our current society and instead of chasing a certain high standard of what we define as success or being good enough to be accepted and noticed in society, we should instead celebrate the fact that we are even alive at all and just relish in the joy of simply living and the experience of being alive and human, and not many movies today do that.Anyway I think it's another masterpiece by Pixar and an instant classic that should be enjoyed by everyone",Soul

Instead, it gets an assignment of guiding another lost soul to discover a reason to be alive in the first place.Believe it or not, this is the plot for the latest Pixar animated film. I honestly thought that after Inside Out there will be no way to get more philosophical but here is yet another animation directed primarily at adults. Children will probably appreciate it too for the beautiful visuals and the jokes but you best believe that this is a serious movie that tackles regret, choices and to some extent the meaning of life.The story takes off very early and the complex concepts are presented in a playful way which is enjoyable for both children and adults. However, adults are the ones who will relate most as they constantly make tough choices in life which often take them away from their true passions and possibly result in regrets. Depending on where you are in life, what choices you have made and how happy you are with them will all affect your viewing experience and the takeaways you will have.The animation style is so wholesome because it makes you feel emotionally invested in the fate of blue blobs with eyes and that is admirable. What's impressive is how such an intricate concept is broken down to simple terms and shown in a gentle, humorous and colorful fashion. I am not saying they cracked the code of describing the infinite mystery of the Soul but they surely managed to make it look and feel accessible. I have discussed this film with 3 people and each one of us had a different perception of the film and it's message.One thing we had in common is that life is about LIVING right now at this very moment and enjoying the little things.

What they did here is actually very special, they somehow covered serious topic with wide mainstream appeal. Finding meaning in life was humanity hardest challenge and here is Pixar.

But they did it.",Soul
175,gcsman,"The meaning of life is ...... well, just see the movie to find out!",9,1 January 2021,"I have to hand it to director/writer Pete Docter and the Pixar crew for crafting one heck of a trilogy of animated films about the nature of life, with ""Up"" (2009), ""Inside Out"" (2015), and now ""Soul"" (2020). I don't literally mean a trilogy in the sense of a connected series of stories with the same characters, but rather a trilogy of theme. What's life about and how does it work? Soul follows directly from Up in the sense that its lead character, Joe Gardner (voiced perfectly by Jamie Foxx), relatively late in life finds himself lost on his path but is redeemed by the very adventures that he finds off that track. And, Soul feels like a very convincing thematic 'next step' past Inside Out, which showed us those adorable 5 fundamental personality types inside everyone. What's the next step underneath even all of those? Soul, of course.I very much liked the feel of this movie, which is gentler and somehow more easily human than its predecessors -- easier to slip into, like your favorite shoes. (Not that that's a criticism of the others; they're quite brilliant in their way.) I think it's partly because Soul doesn't always go for what's very easy to do with animation -- that is, carry the story along with hyperactivity and the Big Laugh. Don't worry, it has plenty enough of those things; but it's just more mature, more relaxed, more reliant on straight-up thoughtful dialog. This is all the more remarkable because almost half the story takes place in the metaphoric realm of The Great Before where baby souls get their pre-op training, and not on Earth at all. Joe gets to mentor young little 22 (an equally perfect Tina Fey), whose fear and uncertainty about taking the plunge to Earth into real life is hidden within a blase shell. Their dynamic and their paired story do nothing less than redeem them both.The dialog and the Pixar animation are, as usual, terrific. They always give us something new and this one is no exception. Wait till you see what they do with the Great Before Counsellor whose job is to keep account of the numbers of souls in and out, and the Flying-Dutchman-type character who sails its metaphoric seas tracking down Lost Souls. The souls are drawn as little, pastel-blue heads, which is weird but both charming and sensible (I take it that they're representing the soul or spirit as being where the seat of consciousness is). And we see that that other VERY important realm after death, The Great Beyond, is a globular star cluster! It's all just so inventive.The purpose of life is to live it. What is this marvellous crew of movie makers going to do next?",Soul

It's the story of a jazz musician who tries to pursue his passion while holding down a job as a middle school teacher. From this vantage point, this witty, creative, humorous and heartfelt story comes to life.A promising opportunity comes along, which is immediately followed by an abrupt turning point in the plot when he finds himself suddenly headed for the afterlife. From there the adventure begins with an extremely entertaining take on how we humans are spending our lives, searching so much for the purpose that often we overlook what really matters. There are many moments of wry humor, but this is also meant to be a sincere meditation on time, purpose and calling and how we spend it or not spend it.I was impressed with Pixar before I watched this film, even more so now.

178,MovieBuff11732,Pixar Just Keeps Outdoing Themselves!,9,5 January 2021,"This was a film that hurt from not being released in theaters. Instead it came to Disney Plus for Disney Plus subscribers. Mulan made more money than this film because it charged thirty dollars to watch for Disney Plus subscribers. I am happy this film didn't but this is the sort of the movie that you feel bad that it didn't make that much money because it was so good.Soul is about Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) who got an amazing gig from Dorothea Williams. He then is so excited that he doesn't pay attention to his surroundings and falls into a hole and dies. He then escapes the great light and ends up in a new soul mentor program. He gets assigned to soul number 22 (Tina Fey). All Joe wants to do is get back to Earth to do his gig and twenty two doesn't want to go to earth at all.Soul is the second movie to come out this year from the Disney owned Pixar studio. The first one was Onward which was good. It wasn't anything that was tear jerking or jaw dropping but it was a fun adventure that I think many kids enjoyed. Soul was a film I thought was going to be around the same level before reviews started coming in. I was amazed that Rotten Tomatoes gave it a ninety seven percent. That was crazy. After I watched the film I found it to be around the same level that Rotten Tomatoes had it at. Soul was pretty emotional because of the message. I found there to be two messages in the film. The one that was more to kids was to respect everyone around you. I guess adults who don't really care about anyone else could use it too. The other lesson was more for adults and most kids wouldn't get this one. The lesson was to know what your dream is and you aren't limited to one thing in your life. It was a strong lesson. For a lot of people I think it would make them think about what they like. It made me think about it. I came to the conclusion that the path I have chose is the right one (obviously because I am writing a review). The lesson has caused many people to say that this film is more for adults. It pertains to adults more than kids maybe but kids you still enjoy this film. I watched it with my five year old brother and he never got bored. He did ask a lot o questions though. So I could say confidently that this film is for everybody. The only problem I found with the story was the middle act. I felt like they were stretching the point they wanted to make a little too far and they could have cut some of it off. So the middle act dragged a little. Besides that, the story was fantastic.If the voice acting wasn't good in this film, there wouldn't be any emotional pay off. Luckily, the voice acting was some of the best we got this year. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey both did a marvelous job. Overall, there was no bad voice acting in the whole film. Every actor or actress delivered lines in a way that made them feel funny or emotional. I don't think there was ever a time were one actor was going for another emotion while someone else was doing a different emotion.The feel of the film was something that clicked for me. When they were in the real world, it had a jazzy feel. When they were in the great before, it felt more comical and fresh. They both hit what they needed to do for the feel and the film. It ended up helping in the long run.Soul is one of the best Pixar films of all time because of the voice acting and the lesson the film teaches. I would recommend this film to anybody who has Disney Plus and anybody who likes Pixar in general.",Soul
179,BabelAlexandria,The Ambiguous Spirituality of Soul,9,1 April 2021,"A fabulous story about a near-death experience, with some conventional and some interestingly non-conventional statements about life and the afterlife. I really appreciated the major lesson that Joe/Joe's Soul/22 learn over the course of the movie: that one's ""spark,"" or inner motivation, isn't the same as obsession about something (like getting a great gig), because obsession drives many people to become lost souls, despite still living. This observation is made explicitly by one of the ""Jerries:"" divine(?) beings who control the ""Great Before"" where souls go before their incarnation, whose straight-line forms suggest computer vector graphics; but they also appeal to quantum mechanics as if to a divine law. These angels of science aren't evil, per se, although the cosmic accountant Terry reminds me of a gnostic demiurge, a being of imperfect knowledge striving for ""justice"" rather than ""mercy."" In any case, Soul is enveloped by non-denominational, quasi-scientific, and morally ambiguous pre- and post-mortem realms and their governing angels.Despite their imperfections, the ""Jerries"" mean well, and prove their good will at the end, when they offer Joe another chance at living after he selflessly concedes his ""badge"" (and thus his life) to 22, whom he then shepherds into the next world. For much of the movie, especially when 22 inhabited Joe's body, I was convinced that Joe's body would survive, but that it would no longer be ensouled by his own soul, but by 22. That would have allowed some truly interesting reflections on the nature of personal identity, especially the inner dynamics of major changes to one's motivations and values in life.",Soul

183,hoernkeem,"Soul review(2020, Pete Docter & Kemp Powers) I love the idea but I thought the plot got derivative and cliche",7,14 April 2021,"Soul (2020, Pete Docter & Kemp Powers) SPOILER ALERT
'Soul' is a 2020 film from Pixar that unfortunately never saw a theatrical release due to the Covid pandemic and instead debuted on Disney+ on Christmas 2020. It is directed by Pete Docter who has made a career of being a Pixar employee directing such films as 'Up' & 'Inside Out' among others and served other functions on numerous Pixar films. Kemp Powers co-directs and writes in what is surely a move to bring more African American representation to the forefront in a story where the main character is African American. This is the first Pixar film to feature a black lead. This film excels in numerous areas including the music, animation, design and voice acting. I certainly noticed that the story, while original, seems to borrow from a motley crew of sources to tell something new. As with all Pixar films it is endearing and heartwarming and does its best to draw those tears out of you by the time the credits roll.Jamie Foxx voices Joe Gardner who is a middle school music teacher who muddles through a mundane existence, or one he believes is mundane, teaching kids while dreaming of getting a big break to actually play his beloved jazz for a living. Immediately this gives me 'Mr. Holland's Opus' vibes although the film certainly doesn't travel down that story road. On the way to a big break Joe falls down a manhole and dies. He finds himself as a basically shaped soul in an area traveling into the Great Beyond. The animation style here harkened to the emotions of 'Inside Out'. Unwilling to accept this transition Joe rebels and runs away winding up in the Great Before which is where new souls are prepared before heading to life on Earth. All he wants is to find a way to return to his body so he can play jazz at his big break. Joe is mistaken for an instructor who mentors souls before they head to Earth trying to give them a purpose which appears in the form of a badge that allows them to journey to Earth and commence life kind of like an Earth passport. Joe sees an opportunity to nab one of these badges and get himself back to Earth. He winds up mentoring a jaded soul known as 22, voiced by Tina Fey, who has no interest in living and instead enjoys being in this pre-life state. In this process Joe realizes he actually isn't quite dead yet and instead is in a coma. The plot thickens when him and 22 get to Earth and 22 winds up in Joe's body and Joe winds up in a therapy cat. So here we are getting a switching bodies story that has been done ad nauseum. This reversal of fortunes allows Joe to see many of the people he regularly interacted with in a different light, and while he is able to realize his dream eventually he is unfulfilled and worse he took advantage of 22 to achieve it. He seeks her out and makes amends allowing her to finally move on to life and him to move on to where he was meant to go.While there was a lot of cliché in the basic plot, but it was infused with a decent amount of originality. It was hyper convenient that they were able to so easily play with life and death physics in order to make this story function properly. Also who's bright idea was it to put the Great Beyond and the Great Before in generally the same location? And this is the first time a soul has ever ducked the authorities and tried to make its way back to Earth? This can also be a bit grating as for most of the story our protagonist in single-mindedly pursuing his dream doesn't stop to consider anyone else. That realization and revelation is one of the main themes of the story. I am not quite sure I was enamored with the basic way they portrayed the after and before life sequences. These were somewhat simplistic and almost not fully formed which may have been on purpose as perhaps those areas are meant to exist in a more gray zone which includes how they look and function, but to me those sections were lacking. While I do think this is a good movie and I like the idea of the story it didn't move me or capture me as much as some of the best Pixar films. I just did not get into the body switching concept for this story or the non terrestrial based scenes. This movie does have numerous high level aspects though from the voice talent to the music and many have absolutely adored it. I thought this was good but with a less cliché story structure could have been much better. Also in a story that was, at least in part, about music it seemed to do very little to actually embrace that music.Eric's Grade: B-",Soul

The animation is good but I really disliked the character designs. They just looked so fake and plastic and smooth.The whole theme and message just rang hollow to me as well. It was just like 'be you' 'find something in life'. But that was it. It was so surface level. There was no nuance to it, the characters were just like ""I want to find something in life"". That's so heavy handed to me and not Interesting.The story was also a mixed bag of plots. I couldn't roll my eyes hard enough when a certain plot shown up. It is the most over done, boring and infuriating plot that for some reason shows up in every other kids movie. It was just so boring and made me just disconnect from the film because up until then I was pretty engaged with it and the world that they had created then they threw it away for a god awful plot that no one likes.I also didn't find it emotional at all.

Completely different plot, and yet similar in that they both involved a magical connection to the afterlife, set again a time crunch of 24 hours to get whatever accomplished in time. Also, this film replayed the ""guy can't stand up because using new legs"" gag, in the exact same way Onward did it. Watch both films, when ""22"" first enters the guy, it's the same exact gag.Beyond similarities to other films, I also was disappointed by the animation. It seemed, I don't know...lazy, compared to previous Pixar efforts. Compared to the dazzling worlds created for Wreck It Ralph, this film's portrayal of the afterlife seems kind of hollow and empty by comparison.

The plot revolves around a middle school music teacher trying to land a gig as a jazz pianist. After countless times of being rejected, he finally landed a gig which came at a price. His cockiness and arrogance led to his supposed demise.I thoroughly enjoyed these whimsical characters that sparked a series of hilarious moments. The character 22, an unborn entity, was particularly hilarious and made the film more childlike. The entire movie felt like it was intended for teenagers/young adults/adults. It did not feel like a movie for children. The film may be too complex for children to understand. I recommend parents to discuss this film afterwards with their children.As per usual, the animation is flawless and astounding. Pixar rarely disappoints when it comes to animation. Tina Fey as the eccentric character 22 was a delight to watch. It was incredibly heartwarming when Joe gave the Earth pass back to her. She started off rebelling against the system, but at the end it became clear that life is worth living.I think that this movie resonated with the audience on a personal level. Especially now with this pandemic, people are urged to rethink their life choices and are desperate for any escape from reality.To be honest, this movie is one of the least rewatchable Pixar films. It is memorable and timeless, but I would not regard this as a 'feel good' movie. It is insightful and engaging, but will not necessarily pull on any heart strings. The film has one to two scenes that were quite emotionally charged, but nothing that will make you cry.""Soul"" is thought provoking and quite complex, whilst still having plenty of laughs.

It's about how life doesn't have a built in purpose or passion you have to pursue. That star in the sky just out of your reach. Life is there every single day and sometimes you just have to realize that instead of chasing dreams maybe you've found something else along the way.The stylized art is beautiful, the music is lovely and the message is one that resonates.

194,theredsky,Soul Review,8,1 January 2021,"A pleasant surprise considering the original trailer for this film made it look like Inside Out 2. This is a huge step up in quality from Pixar's previous film Onward from last year. For reference, I gave Onward a 5/10. Soul has probably the most gorgeous animation in a Pixar film and I know saying that good animation in a Pixar film is like saying water is wet but I really wanted to highlight it here because it's incredibly gorgeous. The way Pete Docter and the animators incorporate different colors and shots for both the spirit world and New York is beyond amazing. Some might be glad to know that this film doesn't feel like Inside Out 2 like most were predicting. They only spend maybe 1/4 or 1/3 of the movie in the spirit world and I really enjoyed a lot of the metaphysical jokes they made and the art style of it. It distinguished itself from Inside Out by doing this. The story and themes here are captivating. We learn through Jamie Foxx's character Joe that we need to slow down and not devout ourselves to only one idea or else we will get stuck in that pit never get out. There is also a lot about our purpose and what we should do with our life which is represented through Tina Fey's character 22. It's surprising at how mature these themes are even for a film that is geared towards a younger audience. I have to talk about the music too because it's great. Scratch that, it's incredible. It's almost all jazz music and it fits the themes and tones of the film perfectly. You couldn't ask for a better score than this. My issues with the film are with its ending and one performance; Graham Norton. I think Norton is a fine talk show host but it was distracting whenever he was on screen here. They probably should have cast somebody else because his performance was average at best compared to the great performances from Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. The ending of this film is a little bit abrupt and a tad underwhelming. We get this absolutely incredible Jazz section with Joe reflecting on life before it takes us to a more normal ending and I kinda wish the film had been resolved in a better way. I still think the ending is good but it could have been better. If you enjoy Pixar movies or just animated movies in general then I would highly recommend this.",Soul

If you have ever sat back and thought that the life you dreamt about when you were young has passed you by, and now you've just settled for an average life...this will hit you right in the feels.

199,joshbarton15,Just the film we need at this moment in time.,10,22 December 2020,"Pixar are back to salvage some sort of hope and joy in what has been one of the worst years ever. A new Pixar film is always something to look forward to with the range of themes and imagination shown throughout their filmography, and with their latest, Soul, director Pete Docter returns but is he able to capture the magic of his previous Pixar films; Monsters, Inc., Up and Inside Out?Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) is a middle school music teacher who has always dreamed of making it as a jazz musician. An accident while on his way to the Half Note Club for his shot at making it causes Joe's soul to leave his body and make its way to the Great Beyond. Managing to escape to the Great Before, Joe finds himself having to mentor a soul in training before he can return to his own body, the only problem being that he has to train 22 (Tina Fey), a soul with a dim view on the concept of life.The first thing that sprung to my mind when watching Soul was just how stunning the animation is. Pixar really have been making major leaps with the animation in each of their films, making me think back to the days when people were in awe of the detail on Sulley's hair in Monsters, Inc. however, Soul proves they have taken it to the next level with an insane amount of detail in just about every single frame of the film. New York City is brought to life with such realism it felt like I was back walking the streets of such a great city with Joe and then there's the smaller scale details such as his regular barber shop or his mum's tailors. It really adds to the whole experience in such a positive and awe-inspiring manner.Music has a huge part to play in Soul and it's not just in the moments we see Joe trying out for a jazz quartet, which are amazing by the way. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross team up once again to deliver such a beautiful score for this film that I would honestly say is their best work since The Social Network.Pixar always have a knack for touching every emotional chord in the body and the case is no different with Soul, albeit managing the feat in a different manner compared to films such as Up or, more recently, Onward. Docter, along with co-writers Mike Jones and Kemp Powers, has crafted such a beautiful and imaginative piece of work that I thought would be very similar to Inside Out but ends up being totally different, going in a direction I definitely didn't see coming. The film carries with it such a poignant and touching message that will reduce even the toughest of souls to a tear or two.The vocal cast really does bring such a range of emotions to Soul, Jamie Foxx's performance as Joe Gardner being one that will rank amongst my favourite Pixar performances, the softness of his voice mirroring the softness of his soul so brilliantly. Then there is Tina Fey as 22, who we all know as a very funny actress, having to dampen spirits at first before having her eyes opened to a wondrous reality. There's plenty of humour amongst the screenplay for the cast to mess around with but it's when the film reaches its more emotional moments where they really get to impress.I absolutely loved Soul and I implore everyone to watch it when it drops on Disney+ this Christmas Day, because we could all do with something joyous this festive season. Call me a Pixar fanboy if you must but Soul will go down for me as their twelfth masterpiece.",Soul
200,sudhakaranakhilan,Peace-composed idea of human purpose,7,9 May 2021,"Soul, what its title means to wholly bespeak more than about the substantive soul refers to. It ensues the question about existentialism. It also fingers the separation of soul and body and the thin line between this after death. That is the moment where the movie contorts its lane and flown across fantasy-type portraiture. It's about turbulence where humans are always searching for the answer to their actual purpose in life. Here, 22 seems to be that purpose-less or in the cinematic way spark-less soul. She completely hates life on Earth because she even doesn't know about the purpose. But Joe wants to go back to Earth and re-incarnate into his body to fulfill his purpose or passion. But what will get if someone fulfills his dream? That is the query Soul always ponders. It's not a kid-hearted anime (we can find Kid moments in Great Before scenes) it annunciate the common notion of human existentialism. The film has some sort of philosophical context and which is not savor the kids. A beautiful piece of anime, similar to Coco considering the fantasy-like theme and well-oriented music supervision. It's a peace-composed idea of human purpose.",Soul
201,Camoo,One of the best Pixar films,10,9 February 2021,"Soul is the kind of movie I was trying to take apart and predict where it was headed as it started, and then suddenly it took me for an emotional ride I was absolutely not expecting, and I just sat back and enjoyed it.It could be considered a mid-life crisis story for kids and adults alike - Joe, a teacher by day and struggling pianist by night is met with a sudden *cough* change in his life which causes him to have to rethink everything about his aspirations as a musician and how he saw his life before. It's how he comes to terms with his predicament, and how he inspires those around him along the way that makes this film a sublime one, with gravity and emotion that is embedded throughout the whole film.I don't want to say much more about the plot except that it both fascinated me with its effortless ingenuity and it made me laugh harder in a movie than I have in a long time. So in that sense it was a joy, and I can't ask for anything more. It is the first Pixar movie I have seen which tells a story that is not as simple as 'if you follow your dream and stick with it, it will come true', which I appreciated - it is onto something much more honest, and important I believe.",Soul
202,Morejambo54,shWeet,7,9 February 2021,"Going into this movie I had no idea what it was actually about, and it being about music was a pleasant surprise. The whole concept of the movie was done really well and was projected so well due to the obviously amazing animation. The characters are alright with the standout being the main character, joe...you do gain some affection for him throughout and see some development in him but not all that much. The development is left to the other character that has to be shown how to love and so on. That works nicely throughout the movie and pays off with some pretty emotional scenes. I think where this let down for me was how cliche it was, it was original but not all of it, it had bits taken from multiple other movies and squashed it all into one which left a good movie but also some boring scenes that you want to skip past as you've seen it all before. I think the feel of the movie is very similar to inside out and has some really obvious resemblance to that movie, but it also reminded me of whiplash due to the music(obviously) but also the struggle to figure out what to do and how dedicated someone can be. Overall a nice family film with sad and joyful moments but lacking in other features...7/10",Soul

This was definitely geared toward adults, but almost at the expense of kids. Unlike 'Inside Out', which had an adult theme but was fun and enjoyable for children, I can't see this movie holding the attention of the younger audience. There was very little humor or fun to this movie. It was slow and matter of fact, and I doubt kids will decipher the moral of the story. This movie probably won't be one your kids will want to watch over and over.

Super character development, almost photographic quality animation and incredible entertainment all the way through, especially the very memorable and beautiful scenes with the ship sailing through the lost/zoned-out areas.This movie has changed a recent misconception of mine that animated movies are just for kids, especially after how bad Star Wars movies have become since being Disney-fied. I will now reassess why I enjoyed Wall-E, The Incredibles and Wreck-it Ralph so much, perhaps through such great imagination and freedom to express and think.Soul is so clever and well thought out, with brilliant animation, beautiful imagery and genuinely listenable and enjoyable music.I 'never' give movies 10/10 on first watch and nothing is going to change that here, and I honestly don't envisage myself watching this over and over again, but I'm really struggling for negatives because there are so few.",Soul
206,isaacsundaralingam,Fulfilling and heartwarming from start to finish,9,26 March 2021,"Soul is definitely one of Pixar's stronger movies. It tells the story of a middle school music teacher who lands the gig of his life, but due to an unexpected accident finds himself in the afterlife. And this concept of universal appeal is hammered home well in a movie that can reaffirm life in every level.The main issue with animated movies these days is that they don't have much to offer in terms of originality. Even with an abundant increase in the number of animated films to come out over time, they all feel borrowed and unoriginal. But once in a way, there's a movie like Soul that takes a familiar concept and gives it a delightful and though-provoking twist, good enough to seem very original even though it may very well not be the case.Soul is also a winner from its technical side. The score is just soothingly pleasant, the character designs are lively and visually energetic, the world-building is so attractive to watch and the animation is flawless as expected.It's a movie that I believe everyone would love regardless of taste, preference or age.

210,Doublej20005,Pixar at their Absolute Best,10,26 December 2020,"Pixar is quite possibly my favourite studio of all time. They've made masterpiece after masterpiece across four different decades now, and this might just be one of my favourites from them. Obviously the animation is stunning, but this might just be some of their best work ever in that department. There's just tonnes of creativity oozing out of this film, and whilst part of that stems from the animation, a lot of it comes from the imaginative story and fantastic world building that completely immersed me into this world. The bonds between the characters are fleshed out perfectly, and it helps that Joe is just a fantastic protagonist. He's multi-layered and complex, yet is also likeable and you end up wanting the best for him. 22 is a character who at first might seem annoying, but she ended up working for me as a representation of the main themes of the film, that being about finding your spark in life and making your impact on the world. It's something that, as I grow older, really hit deep with me, and it's explored extremely well throughout the film. Pixar's signature comedy is still there, and it makes the film even more enjoyable than it already is. The score is also just phenomenal. I didn't particularly like Reznor and Ross's score for Mank, but they have probably done their best work for this film. A film that is so high-concept has no right to be enjoyed by kids and adults, and yet, in my opinion, this succeeded. I might move this down to 9 later because I do have a couple of nitpicks surrounding parts of the ending, but honestly this was just the film I needed to watch right now, and I absolutely loved it. Definitely watch it if you haven't already.",Soul

212,mbhgkmsgg,Soul,10,26 December 2020,"Soul is stunningly beautiful and heartwarming animation from Pixar. It captured me from the very first moment and didn't let go until the credits started rolling. And above all else, it made me appreciate life just a little bit more, especially in the middle of this crazy year that we have all been living in.If anyone ever asks what my favourite film studio is, I'd have to answer Pixar. I don't think that they have ever made a bad film, and I absolutely adore most of them. Be it the more entertaining and adventurous ones, like Toy Story and Onward, or the slower and more touching ones, like Inside Out and Soul. No matter what the films are like, the thing that always makes me like them is how easy it is to relate to the characters. While it may seem outlandish to relate to a toy in the case of Toy Story, or a car in the case of Cars, the characters, whatever they may be, always feel close to home. However, I don't think that any Pixar film has ever felt quite as close to home as Soul did. The way it deals with a sense of never being enough or amounting to anything meaningful was not only touching but easy to connect with. And, while it might be easy to portray these emotions, it's not easy to portray them in a way that is both meaningful and engaging. Yet, Soul seems to have done it perfectly.The story centres around Joe, a middle-school music teacher who has dreamed of playing the piano at jazz clubs ever since his dad introduced him to the genre. However, as soon as he lands his dream gig, he gets into an accident and finds himself in a world between life and death. As he tries to get his soul back to his body on Earth, he meets 22, a soul that has been drifting around for centuries looking for purpose. As Joe and 22 embark on the journey to return Joe's soul to his body, they both learn a lot about purpose and meaning, and ultimately, end up with a very different view of their lives and the world, than what they started with.
While it might sound like a fairly simple story on paper, the final product is surprisingly complicated. I'd even say a little needlessly complicated for the message and emotion that it tries to convey. While I could've gone without some of the fantasy elements, they certainly add a lot of excitement for kids. And although it might seem and feel similar to Inside Out, it's unique in its own way, while still capturing all the heartwrenching emotion, as well as moments of beauty.However, no matter how great the story might've been, or how relatable the characters, the reason I loved Soul as much as I did, was because of its beauty. I can't remember the last time I have seen a film as beautiful as Soul. And I'm not just talking about the way it looks. Every moment and every scene, every interaction and every bit of conversation, is filled with beauty and meaning. Certainly, the visuals and atmosphere are gorgeous as well. Indeed, the one thing that I noticed, throughout, was this pleasantly warm hue that had a wonderfully calming effect on me. It made it stupendously easy to let myself fall into the meaningful and music-filled world of Soul. And quite frankly, by the time it ended, I wasn't ready to come back to the real world.
Another thing that keeps on astonishing me is the depth that Pixar's films have. As a kid, I never realized how deep and meaningful the themes and idea are. Soul doesn't just make you ponder about what brings you meaning and happiness, it also makes you realize that it might not be what you have always thought it is. It certainly made me pause and reflect on the things that I give value, and I'm sure it will keep me doing it for the coming days.When 2020 began, I would've never guessed that my favourite film of the year would be about a middle-school music teacher trying to find his way back to his body from the soul world. But then again, this year has been filled with things that I never could've seen coming. And in a year like this, it's the little things that matter. And for me, Soul was a tiny moment of beauty that allowed me to escape everything else, and come out appreciating my life just a little bit more. It gave me peace and a chance to let go, and that's exactly what I needed it to do.",Soul

It surprisingly focuses more on purpose in life than afterlife (which is a wise move considering people have different beliefs on it).its not overly laugh out loud funny, but it does have its moments of humour and the music is quite beautiful throughout. The plot despite having a few cliches is often rather original and not as similar to 'inside out' as people claim. I do like how the film tackles purpose and is not as predictable as ""person wants dream- person struggles to achieve dream- dream achieved."" The pacing is where the movie probably lacks the most: it can drag on for quite a while in the middle. This did mean I felt quite disengaged for a long proportion of the movie. Just when I thought the film was never going to be amazing, the ending took my breath away and saved the movie with a conclusion no one thought pixar could make. I believe this is probably what the 10/10s took away from the movie, but I urge a look at the movie as a whole.

217,tmpsvita,"Artistically it's a masterpiece, narratively it's a really good one it just needed more time",7,25 December 2020,"Artistically it's a masterpiece without no doubt, it's incredibly inventive like most of the Pixar movies and deeply poetic like just their greatest ones.
It manages to use the animation to create and rationalize images, worlds, characters and concepts so complicated and imaginative that usually can only find their form inside minds.
But at the same time narratively it feels rushed and this makes it hard to be involved, moved and you find yourself detached; so many aspects about the main character, the dimensions he cross and about the philosophy behind them and the main story needed more attention, a more elaborated development, especially in the first half where the movie don't find the right rhythm running and running without a breath, a beautiful, essential breath.
Maybe it just needs to be watched a second time or even more to be fully appreciated.
Still it really is a good movie, even a masterpiece under some aspects as already mantioned, but it could have been a masterpiece under every aspect if it lasted longer.
It had so much to say and too little time to do it.",Soul
218,nakrugt,No Need to Compare it with Inside Out,9,28 December 2020,"As it is a Pixar film, there are familiar themes with other films of the company.I am sure for most people, lost souls are reminders of forgotten memories of Inside Out, and that is why many compare Soul with Inside Out.The contrast between the simplistic design of the Great Beyond & the Great Before and the Earth is another similarity with Inside Out, as well.However, it is not that simple. Animation is spectacular (as usual), but more importantly you can relate to Joe and 22, the barber, the jazz band and even the students that Joe teaches.9 over 10, because of the ending. Not because I did not like it, but it does feel like rushed. It resolved very quickly.At this point, I have to add what I think would be (not a better ending but) a more complete ending: Joe's journey back to the Great Before might have been deliberate; Joe's passion for teaching might have been highlighted; and the last shot of the film where Joe steps outside might have been out of the barber's shop after a sincere chat with the barber.These three sequences would have added about another 2 minutes (or about 6 more weeks in rendering), but the story would have been 100% complete (and 10% more efficient).I still loved it, though.

219,stefstars,Pixar Quality Good,9,26 December 2020,"I feel like the last great film Pixar gave us was Coco and since then they haven't really made anything as memorable or that really feels like a Pixar film. I had high hopes for Soul and it more than delivered. It's a beautiful film with a beautiful message. That wonderful storytelling that we fell in love with Pixar for, is back in this film.The main message of the film is to slow down and enjoy every moment of life - and it's presented in a wonderful way. Though the main character, James Gardner, is supposed to be mentor to the mischievous new soul 22, she's the one who ends up teaching him a valuable lesson about life. That may sound typical but the way Pixar presents this story is so magical and inspiring. I think this film is a must see for everyone, especially those who doubt themselves because they haven't accomplished that big goal yet or who haven't made it to where they want to be in life yet. This movie beautifully shows you how it's all about the journey and not the destination, every little moment in our lives is precious.The animation in this film is beautiful, a particular favorite for me was when 22 is in James' body and she's just in awe of her surroundings, which people take for granted every single day, but you can see 22's enchantment in James' face, especially when the little seed falls on her hand. I just loved that scene and I felt it really showed the message of the film in such a subtle, yet powerful way. The way they animated the streets of New York City is great and expected from the talented animators at Pixar. They caught the energy of walking those crazy, yet magical streets. You forget it's a cartoon from how perfectly rendered it is.The one thing I wasn't a fan of was the antagonist. I know they needed an obstacle to add the element of conflict but I was left wondering if they even needed that villain and could've just used a timer to show that James and 22 were on limited time for completing the mentorship task. The character they used for the villain wasn't memorable or funny for that matter, I found it more annoying than anything. That was the only thing I felt could've been scrapped for something better. The rest of the characters were all great.I'm still left thinking about the little things in the film that further bring home the message of the film. This is one of the best films I've seen this year and it's definitely the film we all needed in a year that was full of turmoil and insanity but has taught us to really appreciate what we have. Congrats Pixar and thank you for such a beautiful film. More movies like this please !",Soul

It was heartwarming and relatable, and sometimes you feel something about this movie. This is a movie that was THE perfect gift for Christmas. It reminded me of what being alive is all about. ""What would you like to be known for?"" ""Life is full of possibilities. You just need to know where to look. Don't miss out on the joys of life"". I am telling you there are so many quotes here that they don't say in the movie. They SHOWED it. Everyone's performance was tremendous and played a whole part in this movie, making me feel a certain way of life. This movie had considerable balls to focus on death and the life of a single person in life, something people nowadays don't want to talk about.The Green Mile, Planes, Trains, Automobiles, and The Pursuit of Happiness were films that made me cry like a girl. But this film made me cry like a baby. I envy the fact that Pixar/Disney made a film so adult for a kids movie. Everything, the lines, the words, and how they spoke made us feel who we are. We fail and succeed in our life, and this film shows us what to expect in our life. This film (for me) showed me what I would like to do in the future. I thought about it for all my meriting, and this movie helped me out. There were obstacles in my life, and I saw it work. It made me feel like what a purpose is supposed to have in our life. We fall, but it's how we get up. What is the spark? ""Your spark isn't your purpose? That last box fills in when you're ready to come alive. And the thing is, you're pretty great at jazzing."" I urge you to watch this film as this film can help someone find a purpose. I would recommend this movie for you if you are down on your luck. Suppose you have anything harmful in life. Then this movie would be for you. I am happy to say that Soul was the best FILM of 2020. Shame this is a movie that DESERVES to go to theaters. Such a shame that the pandemic ruined it for all of us.

It doesn't change the fact the entire soundtrack is jazz so stay away and don't review bomb if you hate the genre go watch any other Pixar films you haven't seen yet. Personally I'm not a fan of jazz but I don't hate it either. I'm neutral and I gotta say the jazz didn't bother me because the story was quite enjoyable. You go from point a to b in the escalator to the great beyond and the great before. It was spiritual without being overt. It does not definitely say yes or no so don't be alarmed if you are religious like me. The animation was clean and the most realistic yet from Pixar in the New York area since the Good Dinosaur. The simplistic afterlife place is simple but entertaining. The movie was hilarious, fun, sad and has purpose. It was a very good time and Pixar has done it again. Although don't get your hopes up this is nowhere near as good as The Incredibles, Toy Story and Wall E but it's in the upper half.

Not willing to accept his fate; Joe escapes to a realm where new souls are assigned traits before being sent to Earth to start their lives. Joe is mistaken for a mentor and assigned 22 (Tina Fey); a longstanding resident who has resisted many mentors over the ages and has refused to complete the needed step to begin life.Joe and 22 must work with one another to set things right and this results in several funny and charming incidents both on Earth and in the Afterlife which are both filled with some great supporting characters that provide laughs and wisdom along the way.""Soul"" is in many way much like the music that inspires it as it is not as linear as one might expect.

229,valen060,Curiously Intriguing. Has You Questioning Life's Meaning,9,26 December 2020,"Following from recent Pixar flick Onward, here's a film that contemplates plenty over life's meaning. Due to the pandemic, theater experience in my area couldn't happen. Thanks to Disney+, this here is proof the studio's latest title 'Soul' is quite the eye and ear catcher. Makes you think. The visual setting, the characters, and especially the music (done impressively by composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) practically tells the story so well, including a wonderful performance done by stars Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey.So Joe Gardner (Foxx), a music teacher at a middle school in New York City, aspires to become part of a popular jazz band at a local club. He proves his worth and is accepted, but faces an unfortunate circumstance that lands him in a coma. Now a wandering soul, he must find a way to get back to his physical body with the help of an indifferent soul named 22 (Fey).It's interesting Pixar went ahead by toying with certain concepts pertaining to life and death, which is similar to their past films like Inside Out and Coco. However, that emotional tone is also included too. It's basically, Inside Out with Souls (instead of emotions).Life has great meaning in which the character #22 can't quite understand. Tina Fey did a fine job with the role that despite all the wisecracking and dim views she possesses, there is good somewhere in this perplexed, mischievous soul that never lived a life and Joe provides that insight that she was long in need of. Perhaps she decided to follow her good friend Amy Poehler's joyful lead from 2015? Anyway, for the kids it's definitely enough to keep them entertained and amused, but for adults, it makes you think for yourself over your own talents and passions into being something greater or what you may be missing out on. I was a bit lost on some parts of the story, but I picked up on it when observing the consequences if life is wasted on petty things. Docter released yet another wonderful addition to his slew of great films. As someone who plays the piano, this film relates to me on a personal level. I recommend it to all who are willing to give life a chance.Moral: Life's meaning comes in many shapes and sizes, but finding the guidance to show you the way is something that only you can complete yourself.",Soul
230,motrous,Soul,8,16 April 2021,"At this point, rating a Pixar movie highly because it had a well written and poignant story seems par for the course. I know a lot of people who say this is their best movie to date but it didn't do it for me in the same way. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind to enjoy it as completely as others, but I still really enjoyed it. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey play off each other really well. And just because I didn't enjoy it as much as, say, Coco, doesn't mean it didn't impact me as much as it intended. Also the music is wonderful, but Pixar excels at that too.",Soul
231,chrisrowexxx,Not for the usual crowd,6,14 February 2021,"If you want a light hearted laugh this isn't the film for you, in coco I found them embarrassing deeper more grown up themes and I was pretty glad, I didnt read up much about this other than it being the first black lead character, I for one don't mind as long as it's not forced, anyone who does care is just small minded. I have to admit I found it nice for kids to get these kinda life messages of a POC as I think instilling them early that all life is important can stamp down the nasty internet generation of ignorance.I found the film interesting, it was a bit slow to start, I also didn't particularly enjoy the realms in heaven or the character design up there. The staff especially I just felt seemed off. I liked the concept and depth of the earth badge but no5 about personality being randomly assigned as I felt how can a message sink in to a person who's straight away bad. But the film picks us, has bits of humour and some warm moments. Is it an all time classic... for message yes, for rewatching definitely not, it hasn't got that appeal of a pick me up film, or light headtedness of a moana etc. It's good no doubt but I didn't love it and didn5 particularly love the main guy, not sure why, he isn't bad but for me just needed to be built up more before the journeyOverall a good watch but one I'd not want to buy or see again. The animation was the best I'd seen but the characters were some of the most bland one dimensional characters that I'd seen in a Pixar film, there was no nuance, no follow up on side storylines, no future shot of either characters, I know why this films being rated higher even though it's definitely no better than a 6/7, it's kinda obvious. It's not funny enough for adults and way to deep for kids, I can't think of a target audience outside people who claim to be spiritual.",Soul

235,mmuggi,searching my soul,9,16 January 2021,"Soul is a Disney/Pixar movie, and the third I have seen this year. Once again it is directed by Pete Docter, and this time in the company of Kemp Powers. These two have also co-written the script with Mike Jones.Kemp Powers had a hugely important say in the fact that the main character Joe became an African-American man when it was initially planned that he should be white, and be a professor. But a black jazz musician better fits the tone and messages of the film.In the Danish translation, Nikolaj Lie Kaas plays the role of Joe. However, his voice does not sound the same as African Americans, which is why the voice does not suit a character like Joe. Fortunately for Nikolaj Lie Kaas, his voice spends a lot of time in a cat.Cinematographer Bradford Young worked on the film as a consultant, to help the team with just the right lighting to highlight the ethnic diversity in the living world. Pixar sought to capture the fine details of these black characters, including the textures of black hair and the way light plays on various tones of black skin. Scenes set on Earth are rendered realistically, mainly in earth tones and lit warmly. The Great Before uses more cartoony designs and has a rich palette of saturated pastel colors. The realm between Earth and The Great Before is rendered in cel-shaded black and white. The lighting is therefore used to that extent as a means of narration.My biggest issue in the movie is the realm between Earth and The Great Before, as it is never explained how Joe can get in the ""zone"" and in full consciousness talk to Moonwind. For there is no one else who can. If they could, they would also lose concentration immediately, thus leaving the zone again.All in all, a really sweet, thoughtful and beautiful film.",Soul
236,GavWaskett,You may not like this review but then again I didn't like this film.,2,14 January 2021,"Unpopular opinion alert!I was really excited about this film and lots of people I know watched it and loved it. I was very underwhelmed by it.Soul is a story of life, redemption, finding a path and jazz music, through a series of mismatches and mistakes, Joe finds himself mentoring new souls on their way to their loves and ends up with one who just does not want to play ball! However, the lead - Joe is pretty unlikeable for most of the movie, 22 is pretty much annoying and apart from a few funny moments it is far too preachy for my liking.Personally, I think it is too deep for most children and not funny enough for adults, but I'm going to be told how wrong I am about it so bring it on!Pixar works well when they have a large dose of comedy and heart with a touch of making you cry but lately, they seem to be going for the water works above all else and that makes me sad as they aren't doing their extraordinary writers and animators justice.Sorry, I wish I didn't have to be bothered to give this a score, I mean if they can't be bothered to give me a good film!",Soul

The best review I can muster is: ""watch!"" You will be a better person for it....",Soul
239,KyleLicht,#1 Film of 2020,10,13 January 2021,"**11.5/12**Yup. This one was an immediate masterpiece for me. The meaning of life and jazz piano, centralized by a black character. That's some pretty progressive stuff and quite the mature subject matter for a kids' movie. Disney/Pixar films are beginning to master the incorporeal and deeply philosophical themes that adults can watch and have their mind and soul enlightened, while children can be entertained and laugh. This one pairs with the the akin films: ""Inside Out"", ""Coco"", and ""Big Hero 6"". All instant masterpieces. The only thing that fell flat was the humor for me.I didn't laugh at very many jokes and a lot of them just seemed too childish or just unfunny to me. These type of movies are typically better at doing that but this one didn't work. The next thing I'd like to see these films do is really provoke deep thinking like Lynch or the Coen Brothers do; create some surreal explorations of dream logic or leave the viewer misled and confused, respective to each director's challenging of perspective and storytelling. Rather than the surreal postmodernism of the aforementioned filmmakers, these type of movies challenge the viewer in a much more digestible and kid-friendly way. I adore it in a different way, but I would love to see Disney/Pixar try to disorient or challenge the viewer in a different way some day.
Anyway, I've rambled enough. This was a tremendous film and truly made me feel cathartic and hit the right spots. I've been tapping into my spiritual side more and ""Soul"" showed me that those meditating or trancing go somewhere else and what it means to be in these metaphysical states. ""Soul"" inspires me to explore meditation and art, while also inspiring me to enjoy life as it is, small or large, and to follow my dreams, enjoying every negative or positive experience along the way. Here I come world; I've got a masterpiece to make now, straight from the soul.",Soul

The story is greatly told and would capture your heart. The animation is beautiful. And the characters are all memorable. What truly makes this something truly amazing is it's heartfelt message about not just be who you want to be, enjoy every moment you have in your life. Because we'll all be gone one day and we want to enjoy what you like doing. Even as I'm writing this review, I not only have a job. I have hobbies that make my life enjoyable.

243,uncsbuddy91,Not sure,7,16 July 2021,"Obviously the visuals are nothing short of incredible. The music is wonderful. The themes about living life are beautiful.But let's be realistic:By no stretch of the imagination is this a movie for kids. It's fantastic for adults, but since when is Pixar focusing on adults? This is a very dark and existential movie about who lives and who dies with realistically depressing points. It's profound, but I spent more time shocked about their story choices than enjoying the movie. I'm conflicted about whether or not this is a good film. Mind-blowing in some respects, entirely cognitively inappropriate in other respects. I'm not sure what they were going for here.",Soul
244,racoonito,Escaping Formulas,8,3 May 2021,I just watched Mitchells vs the machines and i am finally appreciating this a lot more then i used too. Mitchells vs the machines was a stereotypical and forced movie but this on the other hand was amazing. It would be hard to find cons and everything feels in place. The story is something different. The acting is amazing. Just so much creativity in this movie and you can actually feel the characters. Not dumb and stereotypical like Mitchells vs the machines.The sound track and the morale are worth pointing out too.,Soul

But also be happy with what you have if you don't find your 'passion.' Those are just three of the themes in this confused movie. And don't even get me started on the tone. Is it a grounded fantasy or is it an esoteric fever dream? No, it's both.Soul not only fails to be a good children's movie because it has a theme which would be incomprehensible to anyone under the age of 12, but it's also not particularly funny or cute. It's also a poor grown ups film because it's as intellectually deep as a puddle.It's only worth watching because of how beautiful it is to look at. Pixar did a magnificent job of capturing New York City. And I also adore the design of the afterlife, or whatever it was. This is a bad movie by Pixar's standards",Soul
246,AlbertCinefilu,Ready to be alive!,9,5 January 2021,"Embracing the will to live and the absurdity of the unlimited ''spark'' of life are a couple of themes I'd have never expected a Pixar movie to explore.As an 18 years old teenager who switched between different hobbies and haven't yet lived up to the social ideal of ''finding your purpose and thus completing your life'', this movie has just addressed my soul and diminished my anxieties regarding the future, an effect that most movies do not have on me. I don't know why, but it reminds me of Albert Camus' philosophy that encourages us ''to bravely face the absurd with a smile on our face''. And that's what I feel after the movie - I feel ready to be alive, feel my always changing spark and bravely face the absurd with a smile on my face.For its unique vision, wonderful imagination, modern themes, interesting characters and bizarre animation, Soul has a ...9,9 out of 10 from me.",Soul
247,MovieWarfare,A bold and unique Pixar movie that tackles deep and mature themes,9,2 January 2021,"Soul is the next in the lineup of Pixar animation movies. I completely adore Pixar movies, they are always so heartwarming which is what we needed in 2020. The premise is ""Joe (Jamie Foxx) is a middle-school band teacher whose life hasn't quite gone the way he expected. His true passion is jazz -- and he's good. But when he travels to another realm to help someone find their passion, he soon discovers what it means to have a soul"". So does this warm my ""Soul"" or send me straight to the Great Beyond,Firstly, I really love the main characters in this movie. Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) is a passionate Jazz pianist and music teacher but the struggles that he goes through, on Earth, are things that would resonate with a lot of people in modern times. Joe doesn't want his life to feel meaningless, wants to have that big moment in his life and no regrets. 22 (Tina Fey) is surprisingly not as annoying as trailers might make her up to be. 22 doesn't want to be reborn into Earth as she doesn't have a good view of life. A lot of the jokes she makes mostly land and she is a good contrast to Joe. What's weird is that you emphasise with the slightly optimistic Joe but also the pessimistic 22. Both characters have great character arcs that feel believable and heartwarming.On that note, this movie tackles some mature themes that are not expected for a family movie. Most of the themes of life's purpose and regrets are something that is prominent in adults, not kids. Yet it is handled wonderfully in this movie so that kids can still enjoy it while resonating with the adults. It's very ambitious with grand ideas and definitely something unique within the Pixar animated movies. The story is also wonderful and entertaining as it is a character-driven story. It also has a very profound yet important message at the end. There are multiple phases and different type of genres within this movie such a drama story, a mystery story and even a buddy cop story halfway through the movie. However, they are all done masterfully and blend together beautifully.Of course, considering its a Pixar movie, visually it is stunning. The real world looks breathtaking and is probably better than real life. There is actually a lot of real-world stuff in the movie which I would say makes 40% of the movie which is not what the trailer would suggest. Additionally, the afterlife world is colorful, vibrant and mesmerizing. The soundtrack is also phenomenal with its jazz compositions in real-world and electronic, orchestral sound for the afterlife.Nevertheless, I do have some issues with the movie. My biggest issue with the movie is the very abrupt ending. It's not a very satisfying ending in my opinion as it leaves with a bit too many questions rather than answers. It feels like the ending is missing some things that were essential to giving a proper resolution. Furthermore, while I, as an adult, love that Pixar went bold with deeper themes, it doesn't feel like kids would get it and the message would just go over the kids head.Overall, the movie is another massive hit from the legendary studio Pixar. It's a captivating journey with gorgeous visuals, a magnificent score, an engrossing story with relatable characters. It's a near-perfect movie that is only slightly ruined by the ending. Soul hits the right emotional core and will no doubt resonate with a majority of the audience. It really was a good movie for my soul.",Soul

251,PerryAtTheMovies,"As good as ""Up!"" and ""Inside Out"", a year end must-see....",10,26 December 2020,"Initial Thoughts:
""Soul"" is one of the must see films of the year. Why? Because it has a well thought out plot that is thought provoking, and at moments in time, emotionally heartening. This film is all it claims to be and more by not just skimming the surface of what most of us think in our day-to-day lives. It reaches much further into our souls. It had me thinking who I would like to be and what I could be. Although I didn't find the answer in 2-hours it had me wondering, what is THE spark that makes me, me?Visually, this film is spectacular. At times I would forget that it was an animated film, but this aspect had me more invested into the incredible story. I think each individual who watches this film will have a different take and level of emotional response. Speaking for myself. At the end of the day I didn't feel the emotional heartstrings being tugged at, but I honestly felt like my soul had been moved to want more and to be better.The last takeaway to this film is head up. Take each day for what it is and live it to your fullest because you may never get the opportunity for a do over or second chance. Be kind to yourself and those around you, as it may trodden them in such a way that they lose hope or faith in who they are and who they are meant to be.Overall:
Honestly, this is a must see film before the year is up. It's visually stunning, thought provoking, and emotionally driven. Admittedly, I did have my doubts and thought this film would fall short of my expectations, which was 10/10, but instead it met them, which was a 10/10.Enjoy the show!",Soul

254,Clank_Zoka,Another Solid Pixar Hit!,10,25 December 2020,"This tough year is almost over, but I'm not quite done yet, Pixar still has another animated film coming out this year after Onward and that.. is Soul!, what was supposed to come out in June (then November) just came to Disney Plus instead.., I mean I get why and I am a bit sad that I didn't get to watch it in the cinema, but it's on Disney Plus at least and just before the end of the year also, it's also not the only time where Pixar released more then one film within the same year as well, so we already got one great film, two for the price of one am I right?, I was very excited to watch this mainly because Pete Docter directed this who also did Monsters Inc., Up and Inside Out all of which I love, that and this is about the soul inside someone and actually about life also!, come on this has to be amazing!, I am a huge Pixar fan so I will give this a watch!, so I did exactly that and.... yeah I love it, not sure if I'd consider it perfect (not yet anyways) but It's another fantastic Pixar film, so let's talk about it.Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) is a music teacher who loves to play Piano, but after he gets an offer to play at a gig, he ends up falling in a sewer and is knocked out, which releases his own Soul into the Great Beyond, where new Souls are getting prepared to enter the new world, however Joe has to help a little soul fulfil their purpose, one of them being 22 (Tina Fey), so now Joe has to try to get back to his body while helping 22 finding out more about herself and what she wants to do with her life along the way, I love the idea of this film showing us like some sort of Utopia for souls, it's clever and the world building around the film and how The Great Before works, it's very unique, the actual story of the film is unlike anything I have seen from Pixar, it's very mature, down to earth and takes it's time, it shows us the positive and negative sides of life especially with Joe and some of his students, it also shows what life's like without a purpose hence why Joe has to help 22 in order to return to his normal body, but when he does..., well... without giving too much away, it gets quite funny and it gives 22 more of a personality, her chemistry with Joe and how she sees the world is very inspiring and a joy to watch, when we see Joe in the real world and showing us his passion with music especially with him playing the piano feels very human and rather magical too, the film for the most part has a rather original story that I didn't quite know where it was going, sure there were typical Pixar cliches in most Pixar films, but with most Pixar films it works if it has good writing and if you are sucked into the story, but this is another Pixar film that works in every aspect, although I will admit the concept can be a little hard to follow and the ending while it feels earned does feel rather rushed and just ends, but besides that Docter did a amazing job directing this and it really shows from the writing, originality, the comedy, the concept, the heart and relatability, this is a story that anyone can look into and relate to just by how mature and different it is, especially for a animated film, so the story really does have a soul, a refreshing one at that.The animation from Pixar still continues to get better with technology and with this, it's quite a sight to behold, I love the amount of detail and style within this animation, New York looks and the Great Beyond looks magical and full of colour and nice textures while the Great Before looks mysterious and huge, the human characters have this perfect blend of cartoon and realism, it can look a bit odd but it has it's certain charm and really nice look to them, they have look that looks like it was based on someone that someone at Pixar knows, I love the look of the souls also they look stylish especially ones that represent famous historians, the small souls look cute as well, they have nice textures and the film genuinely looks colourful, the movements are fast and cartoony but also nice, slow and real, I like the 2-D line design of the Soul counters as well at least there is more then one style to look at and umm.., yeah I don't have any complains about the animation, it's still stunning and full of style, it's another gorgeous looking Pixar film with lots to appreciate!The characters like the story have some sort of purpose, well most of them, Joe Gardner is the main character of the film who many people can relate to, he's likeable, passionate and well written, sure he can argue a lot with 22, but he wants to return to his body in order to make it back to his gig and we also get to learn more about him and his life, he's a very well stablished character with a lot of personality and passion, 22 is a surprisingly great secondary character, she may seem like a sarcastic comic relief who doesn't like anything, but as soon as she tags along with Joe, she not only starts to learn about life and the world but also about herself, she is a extremely endearing character and her chemistry with Joe is also well done!, the other supporting characters while not as well fleshed out as the main characters, they are all memorable and play a key role in the film, like Moonwinder (Graham Norton) is a fun supporting character, the Soul Counters like the Jerry's (Richard Ayoade, Alice Braga) and Terry (Rachel House) are pretty hilarious, Joe's family and friends are all down the earth friendly and hilarious also, even the cat is quite memorable too without giving too much away, the voice acting is what gives these characters so much life, Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey are both fantastic in their respected roles and really sells at the comedic and emotional moments, even celebrities like Graham Norton and Richard Ayoade are pretty entertaining and funny, with so many memorable characters, two fleshed out characters and awesome voice acting, the characters certainly have a soul, and a good one.The music for this film is passionate, stylish and wonderful, the song by Jon Bastiste & Celeste ""It's All Right"" is very relaxing and nice to listen to, along with a atmospheric score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, so the music is rather perfect and just all around nice to listen to!Yep, I agree with what everyone else is saying..., this is a really fantastic Pixar film, Soul may not be one of the Pixar's best (not yet anyways), but it's another heartfelt solid new classic, with a original story and a unique concept, it's relatable with lots of great heart, it's hilarious the animation is beautiful as always and has wonderful style, the characters are memorable along with two great leads, fantastic voice acting and excellent music!, however the idea is a little confusing along with a rushed ending, but it's not enough to make this film not-so-perfect, i loved this film!, although it's no Wolfwalkers as that is my favourite animated/general film of this year but it's a slight step up from Onward which I also really liked, but if you are a fan of Pixar like I am, you'll love this no matter what, it may not be one of their best films, but at least they are still going strong and not one bad film have come from them in a loooong time since Cars 2, so keep up the good work Pixar, I look forward to what they do next!Soul certainly gets a 10/10.",Soul

Simple but deep and universal, yet without the stunning visual, cute character designs, interesting character personalities, the fun adventure, ear-pleasing score, comprehensible plot, and a series of good jokes, who would even take it to their hearts?

The concepts are profound, the questions are deep, and the animation is vivid, drifting back and forth from the surrealism of Dali, to the cubism of Picasso, to the photorealism of Baeder, and then back again. Did you ever watch ""Yellow Submarine""? Well, ""Soul"" is a ""Yellow Submarine"" for the 21st century, with the high visual notes of ""Fantasia"" and the original music of Jon Batiste thrown in for grins and giggles. Philosophically, we have all been here before; we have all asked ourselves these questions; and this movie offers an answer - Pixar's answer anyway. You owe it to your mind, body, and soul to watch this movie. It'll tickle your innards, or at least your inner mind.",Soul

260,theoledoux,Almost made me cry,10,6 February 2021,"To be honest, I was not expecting this movie to be this great. It's an amazing animated film by all accounts. It's very well animated and acted out, and its message is relatable to any adult. For kids, this message might seem redundant with what their parents are telling them. Hopefully it doesn't come across that way, because it's something very important to learn early on. Anyways, the soundtrack and sound design are perfect. By the end of this movie, I was tearful. I highly recommend it to anyone, young and old.",Soul
261,blackoutH,It's about the journey,8,11 January 2021,"Disney and Pixar, with all their controversies, usually doesn't disappoint with their original movies and Soul is just another example of that.My relationship with Disney is a very bitter sweet one, they make some of the best movies and content out there, but they are also one of the greediest companies in the industry, and that same greed sometimes knows no boundary as we saw from the Mulan movie. And also, all of these remakes and forced content, although not as serious as the Mulan production controversies also adds to the greed argument.
But we are here to review Soul, which has an amazing message, one of the best from recent years coming from Disney. It seems like a very simple one, that you should enjoy life rather than being stuck with a thought or a moment that you believe will be the source of all your happiness, it's the journey, not the destination - but it's a rather strong message indeed.So I think I agree with the most positive reviews in this aspect, it's a beautiful idea specially for a kid's movie, the design is amazing as always, voice acting on point and the characters created for the ""Earth world"" are also moving and engaging.
Music is another important aspect of the movie, and regardless if you are a jazz lover or not I still think you will enjoy its soundtrack.Now I do have some slight criticism, for me personally, the ""soul world"" and the characters as well as the plot that was taken there, threw me off a little bit. I don't know what it was I felt strangely about those characters, I understand the metaphor and the importance of this ""world"" for the overall message, but for me it didn't work, I don't think it was necessary to add that segment to the plot and those weird ghostly cartoons, I believe the message could still be conveyed without the almost fatal event to the main character and the need to soft it (of course you'd need to do that to discuss such topics with a young audience).I'm not saying it was bad, it simply didn't work for me, I was looking to see more of the ""jazzy"" world that we were merged in while we watched the ""Earth sequences"". Other than that it's definitely a must watch and I suspect the most likely winner for best animation and this year's Academy Awards!",Soul
262,jackbanister16,This is a good movie!,8,22 January 2021,"I have seen this movie twice now and can definitively say that it is a good movie! It has a great message to it and explores high level ideas that we all ponder at some time or another. While I really enjoyed it, I am not surprised to see negative reviews or criticism because this films breaks the Pixar mold in some ways. Chiefly, I believe that adults can relate to this movie more than children. It's not unusual for a Pixar movie to appeal to both adults and kids, but is unusual for the story and characters to be more adult in nature.First of all, Soul is a bit more abstract than other other Pixar movies, even more so than ""Inside Out"" which tackled the concept of emotions very well but had a child protagonist and plenty of kid centered scenarios. On the other hand, this movie has an adult spin on before/after life, which is something kids may not relate to as well as a movie like Coco. References to historical figures such as Aristotle, Mother Teresa, Abe Lincoln and some of the humor will also likely go over the heads of the under 10 audience.The movie features a likable character, Joe Gardener, whose life is cut short and is forced to face the fact that he never accomplished his ultimate goal in life: playing gigs as a jazz pianist. He spends the whole movie bouncing between the supernatural and physical world, trying to get back into his own body so that he can live out his dream only to discover that his ultimate goal does not define his life. The movie ends with the realization that you should enjoy the little things in life and make ""living"" your ultimate goal. It's not a hedonistic message, but more of a stop and smell the roses message which is very refreshing.Technically speaking, the movie is gorgeously animated and features a great soundtrack. I don't think I'd go so far as to say that this is my favorite Pixar movie, but it's definitely a good one!",Soul
263,Tug-3,Life-affirming,10,10 January 2021,"""Soul"" deserves acclaim for so many qualities: Its impeccable animation, which captures both hyper realistic renditions of New York streets and storefronts as well as ""Tree of Life""-esque spiritual realms. Its soundtrack, which veers from excellent jazz performances to Brian Eno-inspired ambience. Its raucous and unpredictable humor. Its representation of jazz as a vital art form, sure to attract new, young listeners. Its stellar voicework.Beyond all this, ""Soul"" creates two compelling protagonists who are more complex and well-developed than characters in countless films for ""grown-ups."" Joe Gardner has gone into teaching to earn a steady paycheck, but he is ambivalent about accepting a full-time position and abandoning his dream of being a professional jazz pianist. His experiences in the ""Great Before"" focus his attention on what gives his life meaning. A more predictable script would have Joe realizing that he was meant to be a teacher all along, and that his students, such as drummer Curly and trombonist Conny, were his legacy. Instead, Joe remains committed to his dream. It's not that he's self-centered-he's shown to be a terrific teacher, and he ends up nearly sacrificing his very existence to help his celestial student, 22. The movie instead acknowledges that life is not based on binary choices, and that someone's ""spark"" cannot be limited to one facet of their personality. Joe has the same complex motivations, regrets, and dreams as a real person.The character of 22 is just as fascinating. Her story reminds me of ""Groundhog Day,"" a movie that is similarly simple on its surface, but profound on later reflection. In her refusal to become alive, 22 is like many of us, self-contained and hardened to the beauty of life. She first begins to see life's potential when she speaks with Conny, wintessing inspiration firsthand and urging it along. She begins to realize that life's value comes from involvement with and concern for others, and for engagement with nature and one's surroundings. She is saved once she embraces this profound truth.",Soul
264,samratsingraur,Soul is Pixar's crowning achievement.,10,17 December 2020,"Transcending the depths of their most introspective films, every facet of this film comes together beautifully to create an emotional symphony, resulting in a heartbreakingly optimistic narrative that will change the way you view life itself. This has to be a ""top three most mature Pixar film"" thus far as we are dealing with much more than what my mind could have comprehended at that a young age. Thankfully, the wonderfully written plot is presented in a colorful, visually outstanding, and authentic way. It is given to us in a way that allows us to comprehend it.
We are dealing with life, death, before, after, what it means to live, and what changes would you make to how you live. This all feels like too much for kids, but the script allows it all to come together beautifully and the creative storytelling just taps deep into our hearts. The movie may not have the nostalgic impact or laugh-out-loud sense of humor as other Pixar greats do, but ""Soul"" knocks it out of the park nonetheless.
Certain moments can be too playful for it's own good but there's a scene that comes close to rivaling the creation sequence of the Tree of Life, which should tell you how much I love it. Everything from the production design to the score, to the lighting, and the direction are just next level. It's truly unforgettable.",Soul

This idea of where we come from , why we are here and where are are going are fundamental questions that we struggle with as a species and universal themes make film powerful .This idea that only people who are ""great"" have lived great lives is an insecurity we all feel and think about , the notion that everyone can find fulfillment and truth is powerful and something we can all unite behind . These ideas are presented clearly and well in a way almost anyone of any age can relate to.The animation was good, there were some really funny parts , some pop culture references that were amazingly creative .My main beef comes in with the lack of connection I felt to the characters , they were perfectly likable but I never really found myself cheering for them the way I wanted to . Parts of the plot are unnecessary and over complicated and I probably would not watch this movie again as much as I can recognize that it was well done - it wasn't as entertaining as it needed and not quite artistic enough to make up the difference .I think everyone will like this film and many will love it - satisfactory movie and use of time .",Soul

279,HollisWoods,a philosophical analysis to anyone who needs this movie:,10,17 February 2021,"The Style of animation in the real world is the Pixar style that we're used to seeing with great details to facial expressions and textures. But the art style we see in the Great Before is totally different and unique. The Jerry(s) with their abstract design and movements matches with both the jazz music theme of the film as well as the abstract concept of the Great Before. The Souls designs are reminiscent of the emotions from Inside Out, with beautiful particle effects only seen in close detail. The world design of these mystical spiritual realms that Joe travels around to are beautiful and wonderous to look at.The soundtrack for all the theoretical construct realms helped give the abstract mystical feel to the atmosphere. The Jazz music in the film was as fun as jazz music should be. I particularly enjoyed the big performance toward the end as that performance captured the essence of what Jazz should be. I highly recommend having a real life jazz music experience if you can. The Epiphany song that Joe plays before the climax was stunning and enforced the emotional message that the film tries so hard to teach, and it made me shed a tear both times I've seen it so far.Every Pixar film has its own gimmick and theme that is seen as the face of their films' stories - What if toys had feelings? What if bugs had feelings? What if fish had feelings? What is cars had feelings? What if feelings had feelings? Soul's big gimmick actually entails perhaps the three biggest questions about existence - What happens before we are born? What is our purpose in life? And what happens after we die?While the concept of death is not something I enjoy dwelling on, and the whole ""life's purpose"" topic is it's own conversation, I found the concept of the Great Before most fascinating, mostly because I never thought about it in the way I have with the other two big questions. The Great Before is a place for all souls to randomly be assigned personalities, and in order to get to Earth, or to the living real, they have to choose a ""spark"" that will motivate them through life.Other than the fact that the Great Before was absolutely beautiful and ingeniously designed, I loved how a person's drive was something souls had to pick on their own. While personalities were dictated by the Jerry(s), every soul had its own decision (or at least it's not hand picked by the Jerry(s)) as to what would inspire them in life, and this is a concept I feel nobody is talking about. Could this be the film's way of saying everyone has a purpose or reason for living even if we can't see it right away? ""Your spark isn't your purpose. That last box fills in when you're ready to come live.""What I remembered from the trailers was only Joe's ""death"" and some of his experiences in the Great Before. So when the Soul Swap sequence started, when 22 was in Joe and Joe was in the cat, I was surprised and didn't know what to expect. Of course, at first, it definitely came across as comedic relief for the kids, but this aspect of the story led to some heartfelt moments. 22 as Joe has interactions with a few people in Joe's life, like his student and his mom. Joe was able to view these interactions out of body as 22 got to experience life for the first time. This put a lot of things into perspective for both lead characters.Soul hit me hard on a deep personal level (read philosophical analysis below). There was one moment in particular that can really hit home for someone with depression. When 22 becomes a lost soul she says - ""I have no purpose, I'm not good enough, I will never find my spark."" And all the negative and discouraging words every soul has ever said to her. When you have depression, you are your own worst enemy. All you think about is everything wrong with you and how poorly others think about you. You become trapped in your negative thought, and become lost, so to speak, in the depression that is knocking you down.When you're at your lowest moment, you're open to your greatest change (Uncle Iroh quote, you're welcome). And sometimes, we all need our own Joe to help us through it, so we can find ourselves again and move on to a new and brighter future.One of the big lessons Joe learns is that there is a fine line between passion and obsession. If you cross that line, your life can become unbalanced. You might loose relationships with people. If someone close to you is telling you to stop, you might keep going to prove them wrong, and think that proving them wrong will help but you just end up pushing them away. Obsession can also get in the way of the little life moments as you are constantly rushing to achieve your ultimate goal. The whole ""the fish looking for the ocean"" proverb was meant to teach Joe that even when you think you've ""made it"" in life, you may realize it's not as fulfilling as you thought it would be, and all that time obsessing over one thing can leave a hole inside. And maybe what you've been looking for the whole time, was right in front of you and you didn't see it.Another huge lesson Joe learned is that things might not go as planned, but somethings are just meant to be and you just got to ""jazz"" with it. His ultimate endgame was performing with a highly respected jazz artist to obtain credibility and success. What he didn't plan on was being a middle school band teacher. He then realized that he can achieve his own personal success by influencing the lives of kids and to help encourage a musical passion that could last a lifetime. Success comes in different forms, as does one's purpose in life, as Joe learned with his experiences with 22.What is our purpose in life? Another one of the three big existential questions we ask ourselves. Many people think a lot like Joe did - that the purpose of life is to find success in anything. Joe initially knocked down the validity of 22's spark of ""enjoying regular life things"" because of the circumstances and because he didn't think that was a purpose, but it wasn't his place to dictate that for 22. It was 22's own personal experience and reason to start living. Another aspect of purpose that Joe experiences is what happens when you achieve your endgame life goal? After Joe played with Dorthea, he was unsatisfied and was left with wondering ""what now?"" Life is about reaching your own goals, and creating new goals once it's achieved. You have to keep giving yourself a new purpose once one is fulfilled. For Joe, his first purpose was to become a piano player and jazz musician. Once he had the gig of a lifetime, it's left up in the air on what he did next, but I'd like to think he went back to his middle school job to help inspire kids to be passionate about music.Soul is a film I wish I had as a teen/young adult when I was lost and confused with major life decisions, as we all are at that age. In modern society, we're taught the ""correct"" ingredients of success and are expected to accomplish certain goals in a certain way at a certain time. Some people do it and work their whole lives to a comfortable retirement. But not everyone can achieve their own success in the same and/or expected way. Once you realize that achieving your own goals, goals you make for yourself and no one else, that's what rewards a true sense of purpose. Once Joe allowed 22 to do that, 22 was ready to start life in the real world with her spark to ""enjoy regular life things.""This whole concept of ""regular life things"" honestly changed my own perspective in life. I am not exaggerating when I say Soul impacted my life on a grand scale. I find myself enjoying the moment more than I've ever done before. If I'm outside during a sunset, I take a moment to enjoy the colors in the sky. When I'm around people that I enjoy being with, I appreciate whatever little conversation I'm having with them. Once I was eating dinner, and there was a moment where I stopped and thought ""I am alive and I can taste and enjoy my meal."" And I've definitely become more grateful for my past experiences, the good and the bad. The happy memories and the deep struggles made me who am. If I didn't have either, I wouldn't have been living this whole time.22's purpose was to live. Ironic given her extreme disdain for the concept of living at first. It wasn't any sport, or art, or career that became her spark. It was (say it with me) Regular. Life. Things. Sometimes that's all we need to keep going. Our past, present, and future is made up of little moments. If we take time to appreciate those moments rather focus on the big picture, then we are really truly living in the moment.",Soul

Disney/Pixar have an excellent record of storytelling. I can't imagine telling this in any other way.The story is essentially an inspection of what is a soul, what is the purpose and the meaning of life.It's a grand fantastical tour that takes really existential ideas and plays them out to an audience that Disney/Pixar know to be comprised of children and adults alike. And even though some of it looks completely off the charts, as an audience, you never lose track of what's going on. You are fully belted up and taken for a wonderfully engaging ride.To me an ideal film is something that is full of adventure, chock full of humour and pathos, an engaging narrative that never lags or sags and provides unexpected moments that leads to a fulfilling conclusion. This nails it.The film to compare it to, although they are totally different in their story, is Coco. Coco to me, and my children, is the epitome of animation. Funny, adventurous, fantastical, deeply moving with beautiful animation.""Soul"" is not like Coco, in that you well up as it concludes. In fact, you don't and that's the point.

291,cristinalinderman,A heartwarming inspirational film.,9,29 December 2020,"* There are cute soul moments during the end credits and 1 short funny end credit scene *The directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers plus the crew brought a heartwarming inspirational film. The story is about a middle school band teacher and a musician at heart whose life was hollow until he travels to another realm which establishes the meaning of life. This film is targeted at everyone who is starting life and the one's who stop living. The details were astonishing and fresh like the interpretation of being in the zone and how the souls were born plus the spark they needed to go to Earth. It also brilliantly explored the powerful emotion of having a passion and the risk of getting so focused on achieving it by letting it become an obsession. There is nothing wrong with going after what you want and never let anyone tell you otherwise though sometimes having what you always wanted doesn't fill the void and that emptiness will tear you apart if you don't cherish everything that life is giving you. This film projects those themes so profoundly in a lively way with a jazz vibe to which brought it home and I welcome my tears to it.The composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross set beautifully a cosmic atmosphere. The jazz compositions by Jon Batiste were so full of life and it was the perfect musical genre to tell this story.The voice cast, every single one of them gave the characters their purpose to deliver what this film was about.

'Soul' is a Pixar movie that's strangely not aimed towards it's typical audience demographic, and that is children ages 13 and below. It's not that the movie has adult themes or that it has messages kids won't understand, but it's because the story itself is relatable towards people who've lived life long enough and had experienced its ups and downs. Since the protagonist is a middle aged man with aging parents, unfulfilled ambition and balancing a work/life schedule, I can see how a lot of children would go ""huh?"" At this scenario, or simply become bored with all the ""adulting"" the protagonist goes through at the beginning of the movie. While many adults who watch this film will go, ""yep, that's kind of where I'm at right now.""Now, children will love the way Pixar illustrated this world they've created. There's plenty of eye-popping effects and silly moments to go around revolving the plot.At the end of the day, this is a great film for family viewing.As for my take on it, I enjoyed it very much. I feel the last act was a bit rushed and could had used a lot more fleshing out, but overall it was a good movie.",Soul
296,Bek204,"""You're missing out on the joys of life like pizza""",9,3 January 2021,"Just because this is an animation film, doesn't mean it's JUST FOR KIDS. For sure kids will enjoy it, but adults will enjoy it even more. I think it's Pixar's most grown-up film.Soul is a movie about many things, It's actually a life lesson. Its message is beyond beautiful & pure. It shows that every single second of our lives is a GIFT and WE SHOULD ENJOY IT. We shouldn't wait for a specific moment to happen to us for our lives to be happier or better. We should just LIVE & ENJOY THE MOMENT.Colors are very catchy and beautiful. they match with the film's theme and tone. Blue often symbolizes inspiration or wisdom. It's a calming color so I think choosing Blue as the film's main color/theme is a perfect choice.Moreover, the voice acting was perfect and more than well done. Jaime Fox killed it as Joe Gardner. Tina Fey as 22 who is my favorite, she did a fantastic job voicing 22. And, finally Graham Norton as moonwind who was a complete surprise. Although his character is not the main character in the film, he still did impress me. Also, the soundtrack of the film was very perfect. I really enjoyed listening to Jazz in this film.There is only one problem which is one that I could ignore and won't affect my rating of this film and that is sometimes I felt like the movie was rushing a bit. I also felt like some little details were needed to be talked about more but because of the ""rushing"", there was no time to explain or talk about them.Grab your friends/kids/family and enjoy this masterpiece. I ""highly recommend"" everyone to see It. It's Pixar's most grown-up film and a masterpiece. For sure, Soul will win the Oscar for ""Best animated feature film"" in 2021.My rating is 9/10",Soul

301,theshanecarr,"A psychedelic, animated Mr. Holland's Opus.",7,25 January 2021,"Hard to review a movie like this. With Inside Out, Coco, and now, Soul, Pixar have mastered a genre all their own; the animated movie that gives shape and voice to metaphysical concepts, does it with humour and heart, all while making everything look so damn good.Pete Doctor, who co-wrote and directed Inside Out, co-wrote and directed this (with Kemp Powers as co-director, and Powers and Mike Stone as co-writers), and while it's not quite as insightful as Inside Out, or as heart-warming as Coco, it's a more than worthy addition to this mini-canon.Jamie Foxx does great voice work as Joe, a music teacher who dreams of jazz greatness, but who hasn't quite gotten there. An opportunity to prove himself to one of his musical heroes comes up, but due to some eh... complications, he ends up instead in the Great Before; a forge for souls.
Along the way he meets Tina Fey as the disaffected 22, Graham Norton as an unlikely shaman, and Angela Basset as a diva. All of them pointing Joe along the journey to discovering his spark, his purpose, his reason-for-being.Joe thinks he already knows his purpose, but the film pushes him to question that, and asks what purpose is, and what value it can have in a hectic, commercial, and all-too fleeting existence.I defy anyone not to be carried along by the sheer conceptual and animated inventiveness on display here. Getting acquainted with the Geri's and the You Seminar (in a decidedly non-religion specific view of how the universe works) is a ton of fun, but ultimately, I felt like the ending didn't quite deliver a message I could fully support. I mean, yes, we could all do with appreciating the little things in our life a lot more, but the film also suggests Joe's musical passion was somewhat misplaced, and if that's the case; where does that leave Joe? I imagine it leaves him being satisfied with the life he has but.... something about that doesn't sit right with me. I mean, doesn't Joe's dream of being great at jazz have any value?I confess it's totally possible I just can't take in the lesson here. As someone who once dreamed of making it in movies, and still daydreams of my Dorothea Williams moment coming along, I find it hard to endorse the idea of letting go of the dream. Yes, I want to value the everyday, but the ending of Soul left me wondering what it was saying about the pursuit of a passion.I found it problematic too that Pixar, having made a film with a Black protagonist, turned him into a blue blob for much of the run-time. There's a metaphysical justification for this (Hey! All souls look the same!) but with so few Black lead characters in animated movies, this seemed unfortunate.The film is naturally heavy on music, and the songs and score (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on a Pixar movie!) are wonderful.Ultimately, the verve, ingenuity, and positivity oozing from this movie are a winning combination. This is a delightful film with amazing visuals, and great acting. If the ending didn't sit right in my heart, it may very well do so in yours.",Soul

The movie prompts me to think deep about my life calling. May it isn't about finding your ""Jazz"". But appreciating the simple magic of birds singing and sun shining. Life is always worth it.The storyline is amazing and so creative obviously. I kinda wish I could see more of his life story.

307,MackMonMay87,Pixar's Latest Shows How Family Films Should Be,9,15 February 2021,"Much of children's entertainment can be demeaning to the intellect of children, over-simplified, and embarrassingly stupid, especially when you go back and watch it as an adult, or have to endure it as an adult with a child in the room.Watch enough material like this and you can forget that movies like Soul exist: nuanced, beautiful visually and thematically, and including high quality concepts that really stretch the imagination of young and old.Featuring fantastic and well thought-out explorations of life, our ""purpose"" here, and what it means to live (sounds pretty heavy for a PG movie, doesn't it?), Soul manages to communicate all of these themes and ideas with the cover of charming, colorful and detailed animation, clever dialogue and humor, and jokes that both parents and children will appreciate.
Without anything visceral sex or violence-wise, Soul manages to get across a coherent story that really lets you focus on what it's trying to say. A lot of family movies, and movies in general, could learn from how Soul always seems to have its eye on a larger picture. It's not just dumb, trivial entertainment (which can be totally fine!), it lends itself to something more.Even if you're not normally a kids/family film viewer, if you're an older fan who watched the original Toy Story back in the day, or haven't seen any Pixar works at all, I would recommend giving this one a look.
Soul is smooth with a few unexpected surprises and left-turns, just like the music style that's featured in it.",Soul
308,luizfelps,A reminder to myself to stop hyping over trailers,7,25 December 2020,"I thought I had learnt my lesson, I stopped watching trailers until I got to see Soul's and every time something new was released on Disney or Pixar's channels I would watch. Needless to say that my expectations for this film were way over the roof and the blame is entirely on me for looking forward so much to it.The film in itself is quite enjoyable, but the music aspect is secondary to the main story, also there are some loose threads - even though they don't interfere in the film's whole construct, they are still a bit annoying when you are considering every scene.",Soul
309,andrewtisler,The Pixar movie that makes you think,10,9 September 2021,"I love Pixar movies. They're the kind of movies you turn to when you're trying to explain how to make an animated movie right. Soul, a new film from Pixar with deep storytelling, is no exception. This is perhaps a crowning achievement for the studio, mainly thanks to the philosophical writing done by the creative team led by director Pete Docter.Joe Gardner (voice of Jamie Foxx), an African-American middle school band teacher, lands the gig of his life at the Half Note Jazz Club in New York City, and accidentally loses his soul in a manhole incident, causing him to get trapped between the real world and the afterlife. After ending in a place called ""The Great Beyond"", where dead souls go to lay eternal rest, he jumps off of the moving platform to get back to his body, but accidentally lands in a place called ""The Great Before"", where he befriends a sarcastic soul named 22 (voice of Tina Fey), and helps her discover the joys of life to get back to before he dies completely and his body cannot be revived. During their time together, 22 begins to enjoy life, particularly when she is inside Joe's body. This movie's story is very poignant and thought-provoking, but it also does provide good humor, even if it's not as funny as some of Pixar's previous efforts, like Toy Story or Cars.Joe Gardner, being an African-American jazz pianist, has a very deep passion for jazz music and wishes to become a member of a quartet led by the much-respected Dorothea Williams (voice of Angela Bassett). I love how he is a musician, because musicians have lots of pathos (emotion) in them, and their music can compliment their deep, heartfelt tone about their interests. 22 is a sarcastic soul with a pessimistic, dim view on life, but after being in Joe's body and experiencing things in life more, begins to appreciate living and doesn't quite view it the way she initially did. Moonwind (voice of Graham Norton) is a hilarious spiritual sign twirler who helps Joe and 22 get back to normal, but he also provides lots of insight into Joe's desires to return to his body, and helps 22 learn a little more about life. Curly (voice of rapper Questlove) is Joe's old student and drummer, who acts like his best friend. His cool personality and love of Joe's old class is one of the many reasons that he is a true confidant to our hero pianist. The counselors in the Great Before are all named Jerry (voices of Alice Braga, Richard Ayoade, Wes Studi, etc.) and I love that. They all act as guides to the new souls, and that's very interesting. Terry (voice of Rachel House) is a soul in The Great Beyond, who desperately wishes to catch Joe, after learning he cheated the system to escape death. I love her scene-stealing personality and firm, but hilarious nature. And Libba Gardner (voice of Phylicia Rashad) is Joe's mother, always hoping for Joe to get the best possible job, and not liking his decisions to chase after dreams of being big-stage pianists at the jazz club, though learns to appreciate his passion after talking with him at her tailor shop.I really like the animation of this movie. It's a nice blend of realistic New York and cartoony astral planes. The details in both is very well-done, and how they are able to merge together beautifully. It's so colorful but also so uniquely crafted, with inspiration from caricature artists Pablo Picasso and Al Hirschfeld.Also, the music has a respect for African-American jazz. Each note played actually sounds like a real part of the jazz music, and I especially love it when you can tell that the musicians playing it are doing it authentically, rather than forced or fake. I also love listening to rap song from the movie, ""Rappin' Ced"", which is performed by Paul's voice actor in the movie, Daveed Diggs.Soul is by far one of the best Pixar movies ever made. The story, animation, voices, and music is deep, serious, and philosophical, and allows people to ponder their own decisions in life. Highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with their purpose in life.",Soul

If this movie doesn't get an Oscar award, then I don't know what to do.
It is very difficult to explain this movie. The reason why I feel it is difficult to explain this movie is that this movie is about you and me. It is about our lives. It is about life. Every single soul on this planet will relate to this movie. I feel they created a move about us humans. In a very creative way.
This movie is about life and our purpose. We humans chasing our purpose. We humans wondering about our purpose, etc.
Watching this movie was like watching ART. They created this animation in such a beautiful way.
I don't think that I have ever seen a story like this one. Such a unique story.
At first, when I heard about this movie, I thought to myself, what nonsense is this. I will never see this movie. A stupid movie, I thought.

317,blazesuncaster,Pixar at its finest,10,28 December 2020,"(Not really spoilers but be aware)When this film first got announced I already knew it was going to be a success and that the story was going to be beautiful. I didn't expect it to be this moving. When it comes down to it, soul is a masterpiece of film and I honestly don't even consider this film to be a children's film. It talks about very important topics like greed and longing. Yes it is a ""children's"" movie but little kids won't find the drama and humor found in this film. I cried at the end of the movie and it honestly made me rethink my life. It got me thinking about how passions can be found in anything such as the taste of pizza, the touch of a leaf, the giving to others, excepting others, and that living can be a passion. ""A passion to live"" so to say. It had me thinking about how my passion of becoming a film writer and director comes from our past encounters. The writing in this film is like no other and it really spoke to me. It doesn't happen too often when a film speaks to me. This film will obviously win best animated feature, but I full heartedly think it will win best picture as well as best sound mixing, original screenplay, and possibly directing. This film really encapsulates Pixar's motives when it comes to speaking a message and moving people. Masterpiece of a film and you should see it now.",Soul
318,RoBiN_SinGH211221,Awesome Movie with Great Message,8,3 May 2021,"Before explaining why I liked this movie, I'd like to point out that the main idea of the movie is *NOT* that you need find your purpose to have a happy life. It's the exact opposite! I'm not saying this just to be a professor, but because it's really important and that's why I loved the film so much. You don't need to be fixated about something to find a meaning in your life. You need to savour it and learn to enjoy the little moments instead of waiting for something big to happen to reach happiness. It's so profound and refreshing. A movie just about a guy waiting for his big moment and feeling fulfilled after having reached it would have been dull, boring, trite and most of all wrong, like pretty much all ""self-help"" advices. Instead the opposite idea is presented and if you just pay attention to the dialogues -and the story, really- you'll understand what I mean and most importantly what you might apply to make your everyday life better. But back to the movie I've got to say I almost cried as the end was approaching as much as I was going to turn off the tv when the movie started. The whole initial setting reminded me too much of Inside Out, a film I quite disliked, so I was worried it was a copy of it (it kind of is in the beginnin). But luckily the second half steered away from it and developed in one of the most moving film I've seen in a long time. Undoubtedly one of Pixar's best.",Soul

Visually, they are as stunning as ever, but stoywise, they are beginning to show cracks.""Soul"" looks like it's made for kids, but the themes explored might be a bit too much for most of those, while the adult audience might be a bit disappointed by some glaring plot holes and some of the pseudo-deepness in the script, which might let down both target audiences in the end.Additionally, for a film about a Jazz musician, the music in the film didn't have much soul to it. Which is kinda understandable if you hire Trenz Reznor to write it. Trent Reznor is awesome, but maybe not in this case. His synthesizers sound a bit like they come from some space music video on YouTube to help you fall asleep.

The magic from a Pixar movie is missing, there's no 'WOAH' moment here. It felt like one of those movies created just to deliver the message, which it did, but then falls flat. The script is wonderful too, and it's definitely a new perspective but they could have worked more on it. If you are somebody who watches movies for life lessons, then this one's for you. For everybody else, this is a good, one-time Sunday watch.I suggest you watch it with a good sound system, it's got some wonderful music.",Soul
337,TheJediWay9,Absolutely Phenomenal! Pixar Does It Again!,10,26 December 2020,"SOUL is Pixar's latest film that I wish had been released theatrically. Joe Gardner is a middle school jazz teacher and musician who has lost his passion for music and is transported out of his body. he must find his way back with the help of an infant soul learning about herself.With top notch animation, and I mean TOP NOTCH, this movie serves as Pixar's most original and mature work to date. The animation feels photorealistic, almost real, and there is one ow two scenes where I thought real actors were inserted and replaced the animated characters. It's that good.Coupled with a strong set of themes, an experimental score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and top notch voice acting, SOUL is a wonder to behold! I loved this movie!",Soul
338,warren-87235,Soulless and lacking any Spark,4,4 January 2021,"As others have said, I'm not quite sure what market this is aimed at. I can't imagine the characters and situations appealing to the _expected_ child audience, meanwhile it doesn't appear to be aimed purely at adults.Increasingly, Pixar movies appear to have transitioned from making entertaining children's stories with an occasional teary moment, and tipped the scales fully into the ""Let's get tears at any expense, so we appear deep and meaningful!"" camp. They are no longer even _attempting_ the pretence of making these movies for kids anymore.I noted this change in 'Onward', but at least the characters and world still felt aimed at their core child audience, even if the story was less about entertainment and more about forcing an emotional conclusion (And the emotional core would have at least been understandable by many children).'Soul' really does lack soul, I'm afraid to say. None of the characters are really engaging or interesting, and their motivations feel mechanical. The story is too convoluted and confused for smaller kids, and too simplistic and lacking in logic for adults.There is clearly a big influence from 'A Matter of Life and Death' with David Niven and Kim Hunter, an adult film that is still well enough written that I fell in love with it as a kid. 'Soul' on the other hand, feels ponderous and if I hadn't been watching it with my other half, I don't think I would have sat through till the end.Perhaps I'm just missing something, as the stand-out moment for me, was the chuckle I had when the rat passed the cat with its own slice of Pizza (If you've seen the film, you know what I mean).That's not to say it's devoid of charm. There are other occasional chuckles, and the voices of Richard Ayoade and Graham Norton bring life to minor characters that overshadow the leads, simply due to the enthusiasm in their voices! The animation is superb for the Earth-bound portions of the film, and the cat jokes, whilst not original, will always bring a smile or two. They're the only reasons for the few stars I'm giving this.As for the messages to be gained from the movie, they're all a bit mixed and muddled. The writers clearly weren't sure what they were aiming for. The main character _starts_ with an understandable desire to get back to Earth (albeit a fairly mediocre one, when you consider the significantly more meaningful reasons an individual might have for wanting to return), but he very quickly reaches a point where he feels selfish and unsympathetic, perhaps because his motivations were so trivial (and before you say anything, think about it. What if his motivation had been to save a sick child? Or for love? Or any number of other emotional but less selfish reasons?). That's not to say his motivation wouldn't have been sufficient had the story been written differently, but when it's at the expense of another's chance for life... It just drains sympathy from the character.All-in-all, this is a low point for Pixar, and I'm not even a huge Pixar fan!",Soul
339,dashtag1234,Beautifully Animated with a Deep and Moving Message,8,30 December 2020,"Soul is the latest Pixar movie from director Pete Docter (Up, Inside Out). Once again, Pixar brings a moving and deep story with beautiful animation. The story is really about a jazz pianist who feels like he's lost in his life after being sent to this weird alternate life thing.

Every facet comes together beautifully to create an emotional symphony, resulting in a heartbreakingly optimistic narrative. It feels like too much for kids, but the script allows it all to come together beautifully with the emotionally powerful third act, including a heartwarming tear-inducing score and a relatable, well-explored story about the meaning of life.

CocoI suffer as I write this. If you followed my reviews, you know that I love Pixar with passion. I would be the first on board to be positively biased to anything that they could possibly make, and ever since ""Soul"" was announced a year ago I was 1000% convinced that I would absolutely love it...but I didn't.
I love Pixar so much, it feels painful to criticize them, but I can unfortunately say that this was among the worst Pixar films I've seen. Please note that it is only one of the worst among only the Pixar movies, in comparison to the perfect animation that they have been creating over the years. 7/10 is still a very good rating but considering my Pixar average was around 8,5 - it is quite a downgrade. Everyone seemed to love it, both the critics and especially the audiences, so I doubt that anyone will have as mixed feeling about this as I did; you could probably just skip this review and enjoy ""Soul"" very, very much. But for those of you who are interested, here we go:
""Soul"" tells a story of a musician who has lost his passion for music and is then transported out of his body into the ""realm of souls"". He then must find his way back with the help of an infant soul learning about herself. It began extremely promising, we are lucky that a studio like Pixar exists, unafraid to tackle complex and challenging ideas within the mainstream movie industry. With ""Soul"", they decided to go for a metaphysical exploration of life itself, both before and after we're born. And I would be foolish and narrow-minded if I didn't applaud the effort and artistry that went into this film. With the kind of modern-art portrayal of ""inter-realm travel"" and all the creatures within the ""soul realm"" they just exceeded their own standards by any stretch of the imagination. The animation team really did a wonderful job as always. But.
The film just doesn't know what it wants to say. The main message is: ""The purpose of one's life is life itself"", but I strongly disagree with that. This statement alone might seem harmless, but it goes with a storm of other presuppositions that ""Soul"" is trying to feed us. They suggest that it is basically okay to live without a purpose or a meaning to your life, which may seem like comforting thought in itself; but is actually a discouraging, daunting and harmful one in disguise. You can't live without a meaning. It can be whatever you shape it to be, but it is an absolute necessity; otherwise, your life is a moving train wreckage going nowhere. You need to have goals; you need to strive for something. It doesn't need to be the biggest thing in the world; you define your own perfection, but to say that it's basically unnecessary to live a meaningful life is just wrong. With what ""Soul"" seems to be suggesting, we should discourage children from following their dreams, it practically advocates leaving the dreaming to the pros, which is an extremely dangerous and plainly stupid idea. ""Yeah, you're not good at something, but just enjoy life."" It's like - no. Adopt some responsibility and get better at it. Create your own purpose, shape your own life. Happiness comes and goes, but the feeling that you are at the right place and your life is what you want it to be never disappears. Am I really the only one to think that?
My biggest disappointment this year, and I truly wish I liked it better.",Soul
347,AW_McGOWAN,"Black Identities Make ""Soul"" An Animation Breakthrough Beyond Pixar",7,14 January 2021,"""Soul"" is a first in many categories for Pixar. It is the animation studio's first film not to receive a theatrical release; it is its first feature to go directly to Disney+; and it is its first project to have a black lead and a black director.Jamie Foxx stars as Joe, an aspiring jazz pianist stuck working as a middle school band director. While he treats his job with dignity, he truly wants to play music for a living, and on the same day that the school offers him tenure, he lands the gig of his life playing with renowned jazz musician Dorothea Williams (Angela Bassett). During his elated walk home, though, he accidentally falls into an open manhole and wakes up in ""The Great Beyond,"" transformed into a little blue caricature aboard a celestial escalator heading towards the afterlife.Unable to accept his untimely demise, Joe jumps off the escalator and falls into ""The Great Before,"" where unborn souls undergo mentoring before arriving on Earth. Hoping to avoid the Great Beyond and find a way back to life, Joe poses as a mentor and gets assigned a notoriously cynical soul known as 22 (Tina Fey). Joe must help the skeptical 22 find passion in living and meanwhile figure out his own return to Earth before his gig. An intimate adventure spanning the grounded real world and the fantastical afterlife ensues, culminating in a vital revelation regarding life and its subtler joys.As a Pixar movie, ""Soul"" closely resembles ""Inside Out."" It has existential themes that all audiences can relate to, and it relies heavily on personifying immaterial concepts. Likewise, there is no clear villain, and the animation department takes artistic liberties to creatively fruitful ends. It is thus no coincidence that ""Soul"" and ""Inside Out"" both come from writer-director Pete Docter.However, Docter (whose previous Pixar directing titles also include ""Monsters Inc"" and ""Up"") did not conceive ""Soul"" all on his own. While he originally wrote the screenplay with Mike Jones, African American screenwriter Kemp Powers eventually joined the development team. Once they discovered Joe would be black, Powers became co-director, and the movie took on a whole new importance.Powers is the first black director to helm a Pixar film, just as Joe is the first black protagonist in a Pixar film. While the movie is not about race per-se, Powers's keen directing ensures that is not color-blind either. In a flashback sequence, when Joe's father brings him to a jazz club, the young hero's father remarks that jazz is part of their heritage. Later, in scenes where Joe talks with his family and community members, their culture and vernacular are distinct. All of this aids the film's sense of place and identity.Furthermore, all of the black characters are casted appropriately. This is significant as animation frequently miscasts white actors as colored characters. That is if animation bothers to depict any colored characters at all. Historically, cinema tends to white-wash cartoons and siphon minority characters off to sidekick or one-off roles. Within Disney alone, ""Soul"" is studio's first black-led animated movie since ""The Princess And The Frog"" hit theaters over a decade ago.Because of this breakthrough in representation, it is an even greater shame that ""Soul"" did not get a theatrical release. Released exclusively on Disney+, it will not get to tout major box office returns that validate its inclusive choices. Even more upsettingly, black children will not get to see these identifiable characters grace the big-screen for the very first time.Hopefully, ""Soul"" will not be forgotten for being a direct-to-streaming product. On top of its importance regarding race and identity, it is as touching, imaginative, and fun as all other Pixar movies. Rather than being a cash-grabbing sequel in the vein of ""Toy Story 4"" or ""Incredibles 2,"" however, it follows ""Onward"" as a definitive return to the originality that defined the company early on.P.S. It should be noted that ""Soul"" is not a musical. Music plays a big part in the movie, but the overarching message transcends the beauties of song. Nevertheless, jazz enthusiasts will certainly relish in this movie's groovy tunes.",Soul
348,tarekali-19909,the most imaginative and philosophical movie Pixar has ever made,9,26 December 2020,"Soul in my humble opinion is the most imaginative and philosophical movie Pixar has ever made. It delves into the meaning of life, the great Before and After, the purpose of our existence and the spark of our soul. The journey of self discovery is one we must all undertake, some sooner, some later, some never. All this is well addressed in Soul, in a very metaphysical way.
Pixar animation just keeps getting better - reflections of lights on the glass panes of pictures, mottled rust on aging metro rail pillars, hazy sunlight filtered through autumn leaves. Just such a delight to watch this bustling realistic world of New York unfold. Soul is probably the most musically authentic of all Pixar movies, diving deep into Jazz and other genres.
But at the end the message remains paramount - see the forest beyond the trees, see the ocean beyond the waters. Life isn't one big moment, it's lots of little moments, treasure them all.",Soul

More than a movie, it is a lesson. I don't think I've felt touch by an original story in years. Everything in this animation movie was made with purpose.

353,monsterhunt-94296,Pixar is back,9,31 May 2021,"Soul is a new Pixar film directed by Pete Docter, the director behind Monsters Inc, Up, and Inside Out while also contributing some other talent to many films in Pixar's filmography. For me, Pixar has kind of fallen off recently. Onward was a pretty good quest movie, Toy Story 4 was a solid conclusion to Woody's character arc, Incredibles 2 was a fun sequel with some interesting elements... but it's not the same as early Pixar. When describing their recent filmography I use words such as ""solid"" and ""pretty good"". Nothing has really went above and beyond, nothing has ever reached the incredible level of storytelling in films such as Monsters Inc, Wall-E, and The Incredibles. When the first trailer for Soul dropped, I was a little skeptical. The story about a passionate jazz musician was interesting but the little blue people looked too similar to Inside Out, and although it was definitely a Pixar twist on things I just thought that the Pixar twist was less interesting than the base story itself. Fast forward all the way to yesterday, and I see positive review after positive review, claiming this was like the beginning of the Pixar renaissance. I was slightly more hopeful that this wouldn't be another ""pretty good"" family flick.I am here to tell you that this most certainly is Pixar's best film in years. The last act of Soul is some of Pixar's finest storytelling *ever*. I was very worried that this film would go all in with this Soul world and completely forget about New York City after the first 15 minutes, but boy was I wrong. This film balances the two worlds very well and has a solid plot to tie the two together. The Soul world (which I will not name for anyone who doesn't want to know) is very atmospheric and creative to the point it reminded me of a Ghibli film (this is a phenomenal accomplishment). One of my faults with this film is that I think it does get a little too exposition heavy when it comes to this soul world. I think too many questions are asked and answered when it could've took that same route as Ghibli and just let the beauty and atmosphere sink in without necessarily explaining every single detail. The film has an incredible score, with the difference between the jazz of New York and the ambience of the soul world being very apparent in the score. The animation is Pixar at its best, the way they can mix the cartoonish and exaggerated character designs of the humans in with this photorealistic environment in New York is fantastic. The cinematography here is also really good with some shots that mimic a handheld camera, and I think it's really well implemented.Where Soul shines is it's writing and story. The characters are all well written, and this might actually be Pixar's funniest film. There was only one moment in the film where the comedy felt out of place, and considering the comedy was a big worry for me going in I was pleasantly surprised. The messages delivered are simple but grand and impactful. It's nothing that's necessarily breaking new ground but I think that it's just done so well. The runtime also flew by, it doesn't have a breakneck pace but there are plenty moments of dramatic tension and reflective beauty. Soul surprisingly tackles some darker themes in a presentable way and I think that in this time, after all everybody has gone through this year, this film is something everybody needs to see. The film really gets better as it goes along and there is one sequence near the end of the film that rivals the opening of Up as Pixar's best visual storytelling. I believe Soul is a simple masterpiece that everybody should watch. 8.5/10.",Soul

Parents beware though, it is not for kids. There is no violence or disturbing scenes, but the themes are strictly adult.Soul is great on every level: the message, the animation, the characters. The scenery is a love letter to New York. The spiritual plane is drawn imaginatively, with a dash of light humour and a couple of nods to modernity. Did you know that the accountants in the afterlife are from New Zealand :) ?The characters are relateable and likeable.

He lives for it and he could not be more excited for a gig he landed in the Half Note Club. However, he falls down into a sewer and his soul gets separated from his body. As he is being sent to the Great Beyond, he ends up in the Great Before where departed souls mentor young souls to find a spark so the new souls can go back on Earth. He mentors 22, a soul who was rejected by thousands of other mentors. He needs to find out what the spark is that he is looking to give her as well as get back on Earth to commit to the gig.Soul was one of my most anticipated films of 2020. Just looking at the poster made me want to see this film as soon as possible. The trailer made me even more interested. Also, I think we need more original IPs from films because they can unlock great ideas and create unique worlds to explore. Not only does Soul does this, it does so in the most clever and smart ways possible.From the beginning, Soul does a terrific job separating the real world and the world of the spirits. The real world looks and feels more realistic than any other animated movie I have ever seen. The movements are there, the set designs and backgrounds are filled to the brim with detail and the character designs are perfect. These are some of the best human models I have ever seen from an animated film. The spiritual world is even more interesting. There are a lot of interpretations on how souls enter and leave bodies, but it goes into what a soul can do after they die in the human world. It shows how they cannot feel or eat the way humans do. The world also shows some frightening images of what happens when a soul becomes lost. Sometimes, it is not even when they feel they have no purpose, but when they get caught up in an activity that holds their attention. This terrified me. I have always been someone who is unsure about my future and purpose. I honestly saw myself in these lost souls a little bit. The movie does a fantastic job building this world. It is one of the best I have ever seen in a Pixar film because it is clever and it utilizes a terrific message.This is a movie that is about life. It is not about purpose in life and it is not about trying to make a name in yourself. Just enjoying life period. The small things in life help give you a reason to enjoy life. This could be things like the enjoyment you get out of watching movies as a hobby, eating delicious food or playing a video game you love, it helps make life worth it. I love this movie's message and it is delivered in such a subtle way, almost as if it were a puzzle piece missing in the story.The story takes several engaging twists and turns. None of them feel forced because of the pacing. The film is slower than most animated films, but it also has much better plot and character development. The story is about an idea on what the afterworld is like and how a brand new soul interacts with a world they have never been in before. I was surprised by some of the twists this movie had and some of the direction it took. However, it did have some animated film cliches played straight which felt frustrating to say the least. The script allows Joe and 22 to build their chemistry and the two characters work beautifully together. The humor is witty and often hilarious. I cracked up during the scenes with 22 and her other mentors. The humor is so subtle compared to other animated films. That is what really surprised me. There are a couple dirty jokes here and there, but the humor lands almost every time. Overall, the story is great as it goes deep into what to look for in life and why.The characters are amazing as well. I love 22. She is a mischievous soul, but she is constantly funny and heartwarming. She is never malicious about being a troublemaker. She just can never find a spark or see any appeal in Earth. She is someone I would love to hang out with. Joe Gardner is a decent guy with compassion and some selfish desires as a soul. He clearly was not ready to die as soon as he did and I could not help but root for him to get back to Earth. It is a difficult situation where he got stuck in. While he had some insensitive moments with 22, I understand why. He not only had a huge opportunity taken away from him, but his whole life which felt like it was just starting. If I were in Joe's shoes, I would probably react to everything like he did. Joe is a very relatable character and one most sympathetic protagonists along with 22. As for the villain, I was not crazy about him. He just seemed kind of there as an obstacle. The movie is not about the villain though. It is about the journey that Joe and 22 take. The voice acting is amazing. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey kill it here. They bring their characters to life. The main characters are some of the best characters in Pixar, but I think the supporting characters could be better.I cannot finish this review without talking about the stunning animation. This movie blew my mind. Just from the Great Beyond scene. It felt like I was in the world. It felt like I was being sucked in this afterworld. It had a hypnotizing effect if that makes sense. The color aesthetic is insane. The use of light and dark colors are perfect. This movie does not look beautiful just because of the animation, but also because of the cinematography. There is so much stunning imagery, that it is easy to fall in love here with visuals alone. The real world looks clean and crisp. The city looks realistic and some of the human models look like they could pop up in the real world. Visually, the movie is a treat and the script backs up these wonderful visuals. The musical score is fantastic as well. Even the little bits of the score when they are exploring the Great Before is really good. This movie nails all of the technical qualities.Pixar's Soul is amazing. It is filled with soul (pun intended). It is original, beautiful and thought provoking. I thought about what is driving me to continue in this world and whether I want to go to Great Beyond yet or if I want to live my life as long as possible. I think I would prefer the latter. Do not miss out on this one. It is a terrific way to spend some time off. My biggest disappointment is that I did not get to experience this gem on the big screen.",Soul

372,kane_1371-117-231060,"Just underwhelming, for shame.",6,26 December 2020,"Soul is yet another one of Pixar's buddy stories which seems to be the only thing Pixar has been doing in the last decade or so.
Here we go starting the 20s hoping for some new stories and new messages.
Soul could have been unique story about a passion like Rattatouile or a love letter to its subject matter like Onward.
While Rattatouile and Onward both were in their simplest form buddy adventures they had twists that made them unique in the way they told their story.
Even Boss baby had more going for it and that is saying something because at least in there you had the amazingly surreal scenes that constantly made you question what is real and what is not.
Here we get a very very basic buddy adventure story that is so Disney and so safe you can't really help but to forget it in a few weeks if not days.
This movie will unfortunately fall in that category of many just ok, just entertaining enough to make the time pass animated movies made which is just for shame.
In fact the movie is so forgettable I forgot in my first writing of the review to say how Pixar tries to tie in cheesy old memes into the movie.
Why Pixar?
Why?
I wonder when will Pixar and Disney get with the program.
Every time a special movie like Onward which is imaginative or Monsters Inc comes out these studios have 10 more mundane mediocre films ready in line to come out.
For one thing most I saw from this movie before release had a heavy emphasize on the jazz music to the point where I honestly thought that this like Onward is a love letter to its subject matter i.e. Jazz.
But oh boy was I wrong, Jazz music is the most none important subject as none important subjects could get.
They literally could have replaced it with anything else and I mean anything else and it would still fit in no problem.
Even the ost is not jazz, a few scenes have some jazz inspired music but that is minimum and far Inbetween.
What I can say for positive is the voice acting.
I really liked everybody in this, it felt like everyone liked the time they spent on the project.
Also really nice art style in most parts, I don't really care for the art style used when depicting earth but the rest was nice enough although not too imaginative.
It seems that Disney and Pixar just don't care.
They are cruising on name recognition alone at this point and the occasional cult hits that normally don't do well in theatres but creates the buzz that these guys might actually be back on form.

The visual effects are for the most part great, the detail and photorealism in the models which still maintain their stylized look is just beautiful to watch. My only two concerns are, 1. the character art, meaning i am not particularly fond of the stylization (but this is pretty personal), and 2., facial animations, they just look a bit off and out-of-sync at times.

378,G-Joshua-Benjamin,The best looking animated movie I have ever watched. Which is good and bad.,7,30 December 2020,"As amazing as I thought this movie was, I just felt that the things I didn't like about it stopped it from getting a perfect score. It almost felt like the first half of a movie.I am not sure if there are spoilers in here. haha So I just clicked yes. Just in case.I had heard about this movie for a while. I was excited to finally get to check it out. Here are the things that I did and did not like.The movie looked amazing. I actually wondered for a bit if they had real video of a city and added it into the animation. So, when I say it looked amazing I mean it.I loved the piano stuff. I got into jazz a few years ago. I will have to learn those parts on the piano myself. It totally took you from your life into another. The kind of thing you can just close your eyes and see your past to.The difference in the way that life and after looked was cool. It was easy to tell the two apart.A realization that one of the characters has at the end really makes you take a look at your own heart and soul. It really hit home for me. Someone did something in 03 that ended my life. I remember seeing my dad and God. I decided something that would affect me. Though it was changed for reasons that are not important right now. It just, it was like I was watching my bio. Not every part. But some of the big things.Here is what I did not like.First, the music. Now, I loved the jazz stuff. But not all of the music was jazz. Which I find odd. I just think that in a movie like this it should have only been that.Second, the voice of the main character. In a movie called soul in which the main character loves jazz and talks about it, I just feel like the voice should have been different. Denzel Washington would have had a good, deep voice with a lot of feeling. Tommy Lee Jones, Seth MacFarlane, just to name a few. The voice just didn't fit the mood, hear or soul of the character. It just sounded too young.As great as the movie looked, there were two parts in the movie. Both looked great. But part A of the movie looked so amazing and unlike anything I have ever watched that when it went to that other part, I just kept wishing I could spend more time in the first. That also kind of made it feel like two movies. One based on life and a kids cartoon. I mean, I get the point and totally dig it. But I just think it messed up the thought processes.The story was good but was it great? We never get the time to feel anything for any of the characters for the fact that we don't get a lot of time with any version. If the movie had went through the main characters life starting from him as a kid and let us see why he loved jazz I think it would have meant so much more. Say they started the movie when he was 5. They could spend like 10 or so minutes there. Then jump to him at 15, then 25 and finally come to his current time. Getting to see the people in his past would have helped you understand his soul much more. The end was just like, ok here it is. I just felt like the ended kind of made everything, I don't know, almost pointless.All of that being said, I loved the movie. I will buy it when it is out. I would love to buy the soundtrack but it's not all jazz.Also, there are a bunch of special features. I watched one about how they made they designed the way stuff looked. I am excited to watch more.",Soul

It made me reflect on my life, my purpose, and doing what makes me happy. In other words, thank you Pixar for giving me an existential crisis. Here I am watching a ""kids"" movie thinking about why I exist and the meaning of life.But this strength is also its biggest weakness since I wouldn't be surprised if kids were bored watching this. It's a mature movie, not in that sex, drugs, and rock n' roll way, but more in the way that makes you think about the bigger picture. It's an extremely thought-provoking story, which will intimately resonate with everybody in their own way.The various animation styles come together to create something truly unique. There's the life-like animation of our world and then the astral cartoony style of Soul World. Everything in this movie is beautiful to look at, and Pixar's animation has become practically flawless.Some moments don't land as well as they could have since the movie blows right by them. This mostly has to do with Joe's life on Earth (his students, friends, etc.). Even the ending felt a little rushed since there were so many loose ends left unresolved.But regardless, not only was the story and animation incredible, but the MUSIC! The score just made my soul want to dance, and now I need to learn how to play a friggin' instrument. This idea of getting lost in the ""zone"" and how they visually illustrated that was nothing short of amazing.Overall, Pixar has done it again! Beautifully animated, thought-provoking, and music that touched my (pause) soul, this is a movie you will me thinking about long after the credits roll.Score: 8 out of 10

It takes a while to settle into the narrative and make a connection with the characters. But once it clicks, the movie takes you into an emotional roller coaster ride.
Soul is everything I expect from Pixar - a powerful well-explored story about one's soul and the meaning of life. From production design to writing and direction, Pete Doctor, Mike Jones and Kemp Powers create a new level of cinematic experience. With outstanding voices of Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. Complemented with a heart- warming, tear-inducing score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, along with incredible Jazz music by Jon Batiste.
At the end of this crazy year, spent mostly sitting or working from home, not meeting family and friends frequently, the movie is what one needed most. It makes one appreciate life a lot more - the little things, the tiny moments that we easily forget to remember. Soul is one of the most moving films I've seen in a long time.",Soul

I recommended this movie to someone before I even watched it myself and the answer I received was 'I don't have enough time'. After watching it just now I daresay if you spend 100 minutes watching this work of art to rival the titans of animation history, you will become so compassioned and brimming with the urge to live your life that you will make up for the time you invested in this film one hundred fold.How? Where is Pixar getting all this innovation from? (chasing lost souls in the realm between souls and humans aboard a ship commandeered by people so entranced by their doings that they are disconnected from life?!?!?! AMAZING) I'm still puzzling over the fact that they were able to deliver a truckload of unprecedented content that has never come to screen and manage to pack an emotional sucker punch, all while discussing the meaning of life. And none of it was forced for even a moment!I am still in utter awe at the masterpiece I have just witnessed. ""Up"" and ""Inside Out"" were both amazing, but in terms of being deep and making you think, ""Soul"" takes home the prize in my opinion.And I would like to end this review with a minor mention of perhaps the best part of this must-see film. No spoilers. If I had been told that my favorite part of a Pixar movie would soon be a three or four-minute segment involving a barber talking to a man getting a haircut, I wouldn't laugh it off because anything is possible with Pixar, but I would be at least a little surprised.

Plot wise, good. The story is unique enough to keep you hooked. Animation and overall art design are nice, smooth and fresh. Music is on point. I gave an 8 as I expected a more epic kind of ending. Anyways, about the message, I think the movie tried to remind us that when we grow up, we may feel life is less exciting. Thus, some of us cling to what we call a dream to make ourselves feel like having a purpose. But then after achieving the so-called dream, we get lost again, especially if we sacrificed so much time and attention meant for people and things around us. That's why along with going all out for our dreams, we should also enjoy everything that life offers, even if those are just ""regular old things"".

So when the most of the entire decade of 2010 was cinematic trash i cried myself to sleep after every watch. Crappy sequel after crappy sequel and even its lone bright spot coco I thought that Pixar will never fine its footing again. Well 2020 may have been one of the worst years of all time but pixar ended it with a bang! Soul is not only funny but entirely mind blowing at its end showing us what truly is the purpose of life. I watches it with my grandma and thisbis NOT a movie for kids not for anything inappropriate just because the plot and its themes are incredibly deep i found myself juggling the trail of the story and trying to followit and ultimately understand its message. Pete docter has proven himself to be the leader of pixar going forward after this film. It is funny it is heartwarming it has plot twists it has drama it has emotional moments it has relationships it has an amazing so soundtrack it has beautiful animation it has representation it has EVERYTHING (The only reason im rating this a 9 and not a 10 is because of the movie is too good for itself it is too artsy and not very contemporary But it that does not take anytbimg away from the film itself it just is a personal nitpick and an example of the bigger they are the harder they fall.

403,thedivinewoman,An animation for the grown ups.,9,12 January 2021,"Pixar have done it again. Another wonderful piece of work that is deep and meaningful and wonderfully entertaining.
I do question what age group this is suitable for as far as children go, it could be quite dark at times, but, I would highly recommend this for all grown ups from the music to the message to a great story.
It was great to see black characters portrayed as real people, not the caricatures that many non animated movies seem to do, it was a story about a man who happens to be black, perhaps film makers should start writing more of these than the ones that revolve around gun violence, drugs and bad language.
Going back to the music, for older kids it's a great way to introduce them to different types of music than what they usually listen to. As an 11 year old I was introduced to Emerson, Lake and Palmer and via their music to Aaron Copland and Modest Mussorgsky, I absolutely idolise Aaron Copland 45 years on. All it needs is a trigger like this movie to turn them onto jazz. Kudos to the divine Jon Batiste for his work on this movie, superb.Like Coco before it, there is a use of music not in the mainstream, I loved the music in Coco, but, the film was lacking a bit for me. Not this time, this film was near perfection. Thank you for streaming it as part of Disney+ for no extra money, the perfect Christmas gift at the end of a tough year.",Soul

Pixar has a reputation for making movies that both kids and adults enjoy but with Soul they have taken it to a new level. Stunning visuals and animation, likable characters, humor sprinkled throughout the plot, and an existential, inspirational storyline.Every Human has a soul, what happens when it splits?We get so caught up in our careers, aspirations & purpose that we lose sight of the small delicacies of life. We spend so much time doing other things or focusing on things that drain our life away that's sometimes we forget to look up and see the beauty that surrounds us. The SKY, the MUSIC, the FOOD we eat, and the once in a lifetime moments we get to experience.In trying to find our purpose in life most of us forget to live. We've become so obsessed with the idea of having a purpose that is bigger than ourselves. But this shouldn't be the case! Actually, our purpose is simply to be good people and live.Life is a journey. It's not so much about the ending result, but more so enjoying the process. Learn to live every moment of your life.Oh, I love to live.'Soul' is another masterpiece of animation and storytelling from Pixar. I'd recommend Pixar's ""Soul"" if you've ever had the following:
A teacher who made a difference
An interest in music
A cat
An interest in the afterlife
Trouble trying to make ""your thing"" work
A subway ride
A very special student
A struggle with a family member
A really weird friend
A loved one who's passed on
A time you've stood at the top of a mountain, or on a beach, or watched people walk by holding hands, or listened to your mom's laugh, or FINALLY learned that one thing you've been trying and thought, ""this is what it's all about.""Excellent movie, really makes you think.

408,BlizzyFoxTF,Inside Out 2.0 is not nearly as good as Pixar's best works,6,26 December 2020,"Pixar's 2000s streak of golden cinema is now a distant memory. Their products in the 2010s vary from the exceptional to the absolute mediocre. Among those, ""Inside Out"" stands out as not only their best effort in years, but also an all time crowning achievement in the genre as a whole. So what hopes that Pete Docter, one of the few subsisting minds left in the creative powerhouse that is Pixar's founding cast, can deliver another impeccable 90 minute film with a blueprint so similar to his 2015 masterpiece?Soul pales in comparision to Inside Out. By a lot, for that matter.The most troubling thing about Soul is its pacing. This is a recurring problem for many of Pixar's recent works, like Coco. Scenes do not hit hard enough because there is no time to build them up. The level of investment in these characters is rather average because there is little time for development. Plot points are confusing and trivial because they are too hurried to make an impression, or contribute to the narrative meaningfully. The world building is poorly executed. The film opens with a salvo of expositions, lasting but a few seconds before being buried into the pile. Everthing feels shallow at the getgo, and as a result all these colourful scenary and technical marvel are squandered by the film's breakneck pace. Soul has an interesting story to tell, but its narrative is so exceptionally bad that the first hour of the film sits among the worst things Pixar has to offer, the trench of Pixar's illustrious oeuvre. It is really an example of how not to do a high-concept film, which is surprising considering its Pixar. The worst moment in the film is easily Joe's confrontation with his mother halfway through. His mother's change of heart was done so abruptly and so nonsensically that it makes me wonder why Pete Docter, a legend no less, would even let this lazy character arc to creep into the final product. Not even a kid would appreciate this montrosity. Also, you cannot argue that given how plot heavy the film is, it cannot be trimmed. If the film makes the bold decision to break away from their imbecilic Pixar formula and stop forcing in mediocre jokes every two minutes, there is room for better delivery.Soul hammers hard on its themes and messages. While it is evident in Inside Out as well, it is done so much more organic there. In Soul, almost every motivation and thought process are articulated (except for Dorothy Williams' analogy). Characters burst into philosophical solioques and repeat the same ideas in case the 4 year old child does not get it. The themes themselves are okay. I enjoy them. I don't find it as emotional and profound as Inside Out's carthatic epiphany of coming of age blues, and its melancholic probe into the value of sadness among other emotions. Still, I cannot deny the relatability of Soul's meditation on human consciousness, purpose of life, and the value of process/journey (a theme so overdone that I will give it pass owing to it being a children film), which may be a stronger case for many others. That said, The abundance of themes can come as a detriment to the film. I never got really buy into 22 struggles, whose sense of self-depreciation eventually causes a meltdown, where I think the takeaway message around her character is rather shoehorned in and superfluous. It is quite thoughtful though that she tries to mask the true reason why she doesn't want to go to earth, which isn't because she hates earth but her frustration that she can't find a purpose. Not that the climax, once again, mirrors another scene from Inside Out (where Sadness rides a cloud). The Inside Out parallels are prolific throughout the Soul; the sense of deja vu is strong.Even if I look pass the weaknesses of Soul's storytelling, I still don't think it belongs to the upper echelon of Pixar films, which remains so colourful, memorable, revisitable so many years since their releases. Here in Soul we do not have characters that are nearly as iconic as the Incredibles or the entire cast of Finding Nemo, not to mention a villain as stellar as Anton Ego or Buddy Pine. Pete is a legendary director, but in this case he is not as deft and sharp as Brad Bird, nor as patient and deliberate as Andrew Stanton. The animation does not feel as ground breaking as Pixar's early CGI ventures, or as bravura and photorealistic as The Good Dinosaur. The writing is quite garbage, and the exposition smothers me for a good part of the film. Like Coco, it follows this newfound Pixar formula, marked by colourful but dull characters, bad jokes, reusable story structure, and a steadfast propensity to play it safe, sadly undermining the unhinged creativity that blasted Toy Story and Wall-E to the stratosphere decades ago.All that said, I like this movie. Surprising considering the length I went into critizising the movie, but it is only because Pixar standards are not easy to meet. I find the film's plot rather interesting and well rounded. The last leg of the film puts the film into perspective and does a great job at delivering a message whilst making you emotional. That part is also much slower and allows for several key scenes to sink in, which is a very nice change of pace. Pixar's take on NY city is quirky, fun and occasionally clever (metro sign). While it is nowhere near the love letter Ratatouille concocted for Paris (Joe plays the piano how Remy bites into food, quite the ripoff), I think it still does a very decent job. It is also nice to see Pixar's inclusion of the black community as the centerpiece for a major release. The only other occasion where black culture is the focus in any Pixar film is Samuel L Jackon's Frozone.I can go into great lengths on why I rank Soul below the studio's magnum opuses or even Pete's last brainchild from five years ago. However, I can't deny the film merits and overall charm. Pete Docter is a creative talent and his spirited delivery, for the better or worse, defines the film. You can see his passion seeping out of every frame. Overall, a decent Pixar entry.",Soul

Kudos to them for finishing the movie at home as well (you need to stay until the very end of the credits to see that).

For starters, Connie, the girl who played trombone. Her character is so poorly treated and used, I actually felt sorry for it. She was only used to progress the two scenes she was in, and the dropped like she didn't matter after she talked to 42? 22? Whatever the characters name was. Side not: isn't it sad that I remember Connie the side character better than I remember the name of the main character? The movie is just a huge mess with tons of loose ends that never tie up.

This movie has a lot offer beyond what trailers portrayed. It's engaging and funny.It does annoy me that we have yet another black character in Disney movie that spends a majority of the movie in an inhuman form. Nonetheless, I appreciate that this character also just happens to be black. By that, I mean that his blackness isn't cornerstone of this movie. It is implied that his music tastes were introduced to him because of his blackness (given the scene in which his father introduced jazz to him and the quote the dad said as they were heading into the venue). Otherwise, the main character is a man who loves jazz and happens to be black. As a black man myself, it's refreshing to see a modern film where race isn't a factor in the character's downfall or issues throughout the film.

421,schorschi100,Beautiful aesthetics and a philosophical story for grown-ups,9,31 December 2020,"I watched this movie after waiting with great anticipation, and boy was I right! Pixar has a double primer, namely the first black protagonist and the first films targeting grown-ups.
The story is a mixture of contemplation about the meaning of being alive and funny moments, combined with beautiful aesthetics. There are two levels, the world of the living and the world of the souls, both clearly distinguishable through different but perfectly harmonizing styles. Furthermore, there are living creatures (and their souls) and eternal creatures, which are also drawn with different styles (funny bubbly bodies vs. cubistic outlines, both of them matching their roles and their environments). I'm sure on a cinema screen it would look amazing, but alas, it is not possible to verify yet....
The story is easy to follow with some twists, which lead to an expected happy end (it is a Pixar cartoon after all), but not without a few unexpected yet comic turns.
The music is really good (although I am not really a fun of jazz and impro, but that's just my personal taste).
The only flaw of the movie, is that it is not funny enough (in a slapstick kinda way) for younger viewers, hence it may disappoint them. A classical body-swap situation is the only generator of laughs for the primary school and the teenagers among us.As a general recommendation: watch it, but perhaps without your kids if they are not at least teenagers.",Soul

426,sugarnspices,Just couldn't fully get behind it...,5,11 January 2021,"Overall, per usual, the graphics and message (which lacked even) for a Disney movie was decent. I just felt there was so much lacking in character development, the after life/beginning of life concept and the overall characters, that even them trying to really connect with us as the audience didn't do it for me.To start: we barley get to know ""Mr. Garner"", we see he is a music teacher, doesn't love it, but obviously music is his so called passion, or is it wanting his big break? He ""dies"" goes to the great beyond, but he is the only one in centuries to fight it, apparently. Goes off the beaten path and gets paired up with a ""soul"" that never has been able to find its way. Why? Even after being matched with the ""greatest and most best"" the human population has had to offer. Apparently bc this soul is just a spoiled, doesn't care/and or get it kind of...thing? Soul? I don't know. The soul is empty enough in its care free persona that you really don't care about it either. Long story short, they find their way back through to ""earth/life"" from some bizarre backwards journey with a hippie soul...But, what?? Mr. Garner is put into some random cat bc he is in a coma? I guess even though his family hasn't been notified, it's been long enough for animal therapy? Anywho, this lost soul apparently finally realizes life is great, just bc of the most simplest stuff. The lack of caring for this character doesn't make you care this annoying thing now wants to live. Overall the character development was so lacking you barley cared about either party, it was just more fun to see the cat/man navigate around NYC. ""22"" aka lost soul was probably my least favorite character I've seen yet in a movie. I got what they were getting at overall, but the last 10 min ruined the whole movie, way too out there, and real no connection between our apparent ""Hero's"" of the story. And the random ass Jerry's let Joey live again? Bc he helped some selfish soul live for 4 hours ??

428,janjeltes,Seriously mixed bag,5,26 December 2020,"There are a few superb bits in this film.
There are some very average bits in this film.
The underlying message is excellent. It's about finding yourself and your passion. What a superb message.
But, It's delivered in a package of forced diversity that 100% undermines they very message its sending. This film is literally ""tick the boxes"". Pixar started to lose the plot when Brave came out and it's been downhill since.
This is the odd bit. The main two characters are great. There's the occasional funny that all god-like mentors are Jerry (regardless of their voice type). I enjoyed the woman in a man's body.
Where it failed led and was very irritating was the background characters, generally speaking. The illusion was shattered constantly as I said ""subverting my expectation"" with each minor ""minority"" pushed to the foreground (eg. The doctor). You can always pick inorganic diversity, the old ""quota"" or ""token character"". This is purely pushing propaganda into kids and it's not funny, it's dangerous and it's insulting.
Tina Fey is one of my favourite female commedians and she didn't disappoint. I enjoyed her line ""I use this voice because it irritates people"" ... and she was spot on! Tuna at her worst (but secretly her best). Whilst a side note, you should see Tina go up against Zak Galifanakis. Raw and powerful, Tina at her best!
As for Jamie Fox, I love the guy or can't stand the guy. He's extremely arrogant but often sensible. In this film, he's on his game. He's very likeable as the lead character. He's absolutely one of the most talented actors today (and I'm not saying that because of his skin colour: he's often exceptional).
For parents, I issue a subtle ""woke"" warning. This film plays identity politics and its very annoying. However, if you get past the ""your gender and skin matter more than anything"" politics, the spoken message of the main two characters is the opposite.
Pixar are half genius, half trash. They need to dump the identity politics full stop. As a patent I'm very disappointed at how low Pixar are willing to go.",Soul

433,zachsnyderproductions,I absolutely adore this film,10,4 January 2021,"A life purpose is something I've thought about ever since I started playing music myself. Around 6th grade, I picked up the trumpet and fell in love. It wasn't the first time music was an important part of my life, but it was the first time I realized its importance in my life.For a while, I thought my life purpose was to do music. Whether it was teaching or playing, I just knew that I loved it and there was nothing else I wanted to do.But then I started making YouTube videos. I also liked to draw. Writing was one of my strongest skills in school. Making people laugh struck a chord. Long story short - sometime around high school, I realized that I enjoy doing a lot of things.Then college happened and the opportunities of what I could do seemed endless. Then I dropped out of college and started freelancing and now I'm here - paying my bills doing all kinds of creative work for other people, while I work on my own creative projects on the side.So what is my life purpose? I still love music. I'd still love to perform again. I'd love to create more music. I might even enjoy teaching again. I also really enjoy what I'm doing now. I get to write, I get to edit, make people laugh, create things from nothing, help other people create what they want to create. It's a lot.Life is a lot.Watching Soul helped me realize that nobody has a ""purpose"" in life. We're all just kinda bumbling around trying to figure things out. The important thing is that we're alive. That's the core of being happy.It's not about figuring out what you're meant to do for the rest of your life. It's not about making money or finding a meaningful relationship or accomplishing great things - it's about BEING.I've seen some people complain that the ending of this movie is a copout. (*SPOILERS) That Joe Gardner deciding to live is the safe way for Pixar to keep their hold on a ""happy ending"".I disagree.I think the easy thing Joe could've done was go to the Great Beyond. He had his moment with Dorothea Williams and that was all he had ever hoped for. After that, who knows what would've happened?A weaker man would've thought ""yeah, I had my cake, let's go enjoy eternal happiness.""Instead, he decided to live. And that's HARD.Those of us who deal with depression or anxiety or existential crisis over Pixar movies... we hope that one day we'll have our best day ever. But after your best day, things will never be that great again...Unless you make them great. You have to LIVE. You have to BE. Cause as soon as you've had your worst day, things will never get that bad again either.Joe Gardner realized that music is important in his life, but it isn't the only thing that's important to him. Teaching is important. Being a friend is important. Being a mentor is important. Being a song is important. Simply just existing on this Earth, feeling the sand between your toes on a beach, listening to your favorite music, watching your favorite film, talking to your favorite people - living, man.That's the meaning of life.It's to just simply BE and that's okay. It's more than okay. It's actually the best thing you could ever possibly imagine.---So anyways, Soul is pretty good. I watched it again with the family and I still frick with it. 10/10",Soul

441,sebastianschlicht,"Despite a few weaknesses, a touching Pixar film with class!",8,20 January 2021,"Even after some ups and downs, Pixar always finds its way back to its roots and delivers great movies. Not everyone loves Pixar, but the influence cannot be denied. In 2020, the coronavirus had a huge impact on the cinema landscape, among other things of course. It was actually a successful year for Pixar, as there were two films by the popular Animation-Studio. First ""Onward"" (in collaboration with Disney), which wasn't great, but entertaining and charming. Although the big Pixar project of the year should be ""Soul"", but the virus also took its toll in the second half of the year and ""Soul"" appeared on Disney+. In comparison to the remake of ""Mulan"", luckily they got rid of the absurd VIP ticket...
""Soul"" had a big marketing. Many years of work went into the new Pixar film and Pete Docter, who played a large part in the success of the studio (director of ""Up"" and ""Inside Out""), took over the direction. ""Soul"" deals with the topic of (surprise) souls. What makes a soul and how it is developed. As with many other Pixar films, the concept is not really new, but such a relatively complex topic is presented in an extremely child-friendly manner. Still, ""Soul"" is without a doubt aimed at an older audience. The setting, the topic, all of this certainly appeals more to parents or older people in general. The big question, of course, is: Is ""Soul"" as good as the other major Pixar-Milestones? In my eyes no. But it is definitely worth seeing!The jazz pianist Joe Gardner works as a music teacher in school. Again and again he becomes more aware that this is not the fulfillment of his dreams. But one day he gets the chance to do a gig with the famous saxophonist Dorothea Williams. But the fulfillment of his dream unfortunately has to wait when something unpredictable happens ...
Again: I don´t want to reveal too much here, because the film has some great twists. It should be clear that a part oft he story isn´t set in the human world.
The prologue of ""Soul"" is really great and throws you into a completely different dimension without a warning. The film plays with complex and interesting ideas. Like ""Inside Out"", Docter and his team work with wonderful symbols and metaphors. They create an exciting world that also makes the topic vivid for children. I especially like how the film incorporates jazz into its story. The music is important for Joe, the main character, but only for him. Everyone has different interests, stories and so on. And ""Soul"" shows that in a very nice way.The music by Atticus Ross, Trent Reznor and Jon Batiste (the latter was responsible for the jazz compositions) is impressive and one of the highlights in the film!The story has a few plot holes here and there, which I was able to ignore without any problem (most oft he time). But my problem with the film was the humor. It often seemed too simple and unimaginative to me. A few jokes pulled me out of the movie a few times and that's a shame. With Pixar, that was rarely a problem for me. The end of the film may also disappoint some because they surely would have liked the story to be resolved differently. But here I have to say that ""Soul"" tries to end ist narrative in a positive way and I can understand and appreciate that decision very well.Visually, ""Soul"" is one of the most impressive films from Pixar. Photorealism blends with the charming, traditional Pixar design. It's unbelievable what has technically been possible since ""Toy Story"" (1995)!
I especially like the differences between New York and the ""Soul World"" in terms of design and visuals which make the film a treat fort he eye.Conclusion: ""Soul"" is not perfect and could have been a bit more inventive with the jokes, but it´s without a doubt a worth seeing and sometimes also moving film. The soundtrack is strong, the visuals as well and with Pixar you can bring your children closer to more complex and difficult themes. ""Soul"" is no exception. A great work about the soul, life and the fun you can have with it!",Soul

Even with its complexity and density on a spiritual/emotional level it passes in a breath. Its moral is not that it is a vital revelation that will change your life, but I am very happy that it is a counterpoint to the bombardment we are currently experiencing of the pursuit of success, the pursuit of dreams and the obsession with success and leaving a deep mark on history.With another approach and line of argument, he continues the trend of 'Inside Out', of putting on a therapist's gown and looking inside ourselves. And for me, it is better taken than that one, which was already a good film. Soul', as I say, was very good, it has emotional moments in the style of Pixar and it leaves a moral that I love and that is the best part of the film (with permission from the OST). Even so, after seeing it, I have found out if it really leaves a mark in terms of message and content, if I'm going to bother my friends with it and if it will enter the list of essentials of the factory or if on the contrary I'll forget it easily. Time will tell.

This single mindedness led to him to a place of no return and suddenly he had to watch as his life being lived and realized by someone else. Only then could he see. There are more people that I know personally that need to hear this message more than the people that will watch this movie. Great story. Message: don't wait to live your life cause you might be missing it right now.,Soul
451,blatherskitenoir,"Pretty, but no ""Inside Out"" or ""Coco""",5,1 January 2021,"On a technical and visual level, Soul is an amazing achievement. The amount of detail they used to make the scenes, and the artistic choices are spot on gorgeous.
But, the dislikable characters and muddled storytelling at the most crucial parts left me detached and cold to the movie as a whole.Spoiler time:
In the Great Before, where all unborn souls come from, each soul is required to find their own ""Spark"" before they can be born. A Spark is simply the desire to live and be alive. This Spark can be ignited by anything, from food, to music, to witnessing someone else's life. What inspires it does not matter, it's the will to live and experience more which means a soul is ready. If you think this is confusing and complicated, it is, and it really isn't stated clearly in the film.Enter Joe, our deeply dislikable and depressing main character. Joe has lived a pathetic life and is now dead. Jazz-obsessed to the point of putting off his family and colleagues, at 50 ish something years old, Joe is an unhappy, part time band teacher, who still relies on his mother (whom he lies to) to pay his bills while chasing after bit gigs to make his 'big break'. Imagine ""Mr. Holland"" at his most annoying, and you'll have Joe.Any good he's done has been inadvertently accomplished, as he resents time away from his jazz fame obsession, and any joys he's experienced accidentally stumbled upon. Not a single family or friend realizes he's died.Anyways, our plot is born because dead Joe misunderstands what a Spark is from the start, because he doesn't want to face that his life has been somewhat pointless. Like basically all of us viewers, he misinterprets these ""Sparks"" as a person's reason for existence, assigned before birth, rather than simply the spark of life. His MUST be jazz.Joe desperately wishes to believe that the reason and purpose for his birth is to play jazz. It would make the rest of his meh, mostly empty life have meaning if his purpose was ""jazz"" and he spent his minutes in pursuit of it. He uses this to justify avoiding accepting death, and stealing an unborn soul's one chance at living (our other main character, ""22,"" who's quirkiness falls closer to irritating than charming half the time), all in order to go to one more crappy gig.Joe reminds me of those fat girls who desperately cling to the fantasy that, if only they lost weight, the rest of the their life and personality would magically transform, only to discover they're still the unhappy, meh them, but in a smaller body, and they Can't. Handle. It.The film's major weakness is that it needs to get Joe from realizing he does NOT have a purpose in life and reason for being born (the purpose of life was simply to live, which he didn't do much of, and that even ordinary lives are worthwhile if they are lived fully), accepting it and being ok with how his life went, and moving on into death, and the film can't do it. It doesn't have the time or tools. SO, it uses plot magic to jump Joe from the start of sort of, kind of, half-realizing music wasn't the point of being alive, to the end they want.""22"" is the more interesting character: an unborn soul who's been around since literally the dawn of human kind and still hasn't found the Spark to live. The best parts of the film are watching 22 find things worth living for (while Joe neurotically tries to rush 22 along and ignore it all). However, the bloat from Joe means 22's quest is secondary, and somewhat shoved in, and they do not adequately manage to convey what an ancient, but still young, soul with thousands of years of observation, but who still doesn't want to live, might be like. They settled on ""irritating preteen know it all"" and it doesn't quite hit the right note.""Soul"" is unable to balance and interweave these two opposite storylines, 22's journey to finding the Spark and desire to be born into life, and Joe's acceptance of his death, so we're left with a brackish mess, lumps of different colored play doh's hastily smooshed into shape for the ending, which panders to the audience.All of this may seem like complicated, deeply philosophical themes for a movie, and they are. Soul does a poor job of simplifying these complex concepts and telling us clearly, while lifting beloved bits from Inside Out as near direct copies. This film is directed at adults, and will bore small children to whining. Many adults will likewise be bored, or find it difficult to follow.It has many cute and charming individual moments to enjoy, but ultimately, it is not the next ""Inside Out"" and I imagine it will quickly fade to the back of the Pixar library.",Soul

Absolutely not. This movie is almost eye opening, and reminding us especially this particular Christmas that we should be thankful for life, and the simple things. Couldn't have been released at a better time than December. I personally don't think this movie is for little kids, because I don't know they would understand a lot of the philosophy, and also the struggles that the characters face in this movie. And there's some language as well. But overall, I recommend this movie to adults and teens, This movie goes beyond jazz... Just watch it!",Soul

Each person will get different things from it, but it truly hit hime for me more so. Though PIXAR usually caters their films both kids & adults so both can enjoy.

461,rustydalek-37911,Rather Soulless,5,8 March 2021,"I really wanted to like this one. Pete Docter's previous Pixar films, Monsters Inc, Up, and Inside Out, were arguably the best the studio had to offer, with a lot of heart and imagination. While there was imagination on display here, there wasn't much, if any, heart to the proceedings.For starters, Joe Gardner is depicted as being pretty selfish initially, but the resolution and character growth he receives is very half-baked and rushed, and we never actually get a scene where we see he has returned to his life and truly applied what he has learned. Additionally, all of the side characters in the pre and post death areas are largely dreadful, feeling more one dimensional than the emotions of Inside Out. The annoying hippy, the endless swarms of abstract line people, the creepy blue blobs that represented ""souls""... all of them outstayed their welcome. The fact that we never see or hear anything about 22 after she arrives on earth is not very satisfying either. Tiresome as she was, it's would have aided the rather rushed ending the film received if they had at least shown us a bit of her life.This leads to another issue the film has: the animation. The real world settings are largely pretty decent to look at. The people are animated reasonably well, but the realistic look of the animation at times jars with the fairly stylized character design. However, I have nothing positive to say about the hallucinogenic cotton candy nightmare that is ""The Great Before"". Not only is it populated a hideous bunch of blue blobs and ugly lines, but it's psychadelic colors are a pain to look at after a while.Another huge issue the lack of anything meaningful to say. The end result of the film is that Joe learns to be a less selfish person, a story which could have, and arguably would have, been better told without all the trippy visuals. The movie completely avoids any real discussion of the afterlife, the implication seems to be that everyone goes up to the same light and blips out of existence. The fact that Joe Gardner seems to be not only highly unusual, but possibly even unique in his desire to cheat death is highly unlikely. I also was annoyed by the depiction of historical, real life people as ""mentors"" who easily lose their tempers, specifically in the case of Mother Theresa. Try living the kind of selfless life she did before reducing her to a punchline, please. Also, the spiritualism is all over the place, one minute being largely secular, and the next minute having hippies randomly access the spirit realm because plot convenience. I guess that a vague, watered down idea of spiritualism is what the film is promoting, but as it largely avoids addressing any serious questions, who really knows. It seems to take the easy way out at every turn, and comes across as a confusing mess because of it.All in all, this isn't the worst thing to come out of Pixar in the last decade per se, but it's another disappointment from the formerly great studio that I could have done without. As such, I can't really recommend the film.",Soul

""Onward"" is over saturated with an unnecesary ambiance to tell a too basic message. Here, you lack of originality since the plot is mix of sub-plots from ""Coco"", stuff that feels like unused ideas from ""Inside Out"" and dynamic elements from ""Ratatouille"". And while in ""Coco"" they made bold moves in the climax, here they play safe, even made me feel like cheated since it's clear that they don't want you to cry, to feel sad, and I think that for better or worse, tears is an important part of the soul and they deny you of that in this movie.",Soul

Releasing it on that day of all days really captured the visceral nature of the movie.It's technically brilliant, from animation to score to story to voice acting and everything else. Made all the more impressive given that it was created during a pandemic.The story brilliantly sidesteps all the loaded questions about which afterlife is the real one, while giving us something meaningful at the same time. It could apply to anyone, including atheists, without being out of place. It gives children a pleasant view of the great beyond, whatever that is, and adults a new appreciation for simply being alive.A movie to be enjoyed on different levels depending on your age, and hopefully one that will be part of the Christmas repertoires for years to come.",Soul

I was a little thrown off by this movie and it wasn't quite what I expected- not in a bad way or anything. This movie is very deep and definitely more of an adult movie than for kids. This movie is very heartfelt but a slow burn that is probably not appealing for younger kids. I love the message of this movie and felt that 22 and Moonwind provided much needed comedic relief. I definitely think it is more of an adult movie than a movie for younger children, but I think children will grow to appreciate it as they get older.

I decided that it is best to stop watching and forget about it.Then I read that it got Oscar and that it is top whatever movie, but I still could not decide to continue. I read the plot on Wikipedia, which I never do, and decided not to watch this movie.Dying is not a subject you can play with in this manner. Coco is using human history and how we really deal with it with all details nicely and harmlessly depicted. You could enjoy and cry and understand. No, it is not over once you die, just the rules are very different and you have no autonomy any longer to do what you are pleased and yes there is some sort of communication with the living world.But here, it is all some cartoonish gamish bureaucracy that all it wants is have you counted in since you are dead. But you do not want to be dead because you have dreams!?You cannot not want to be dead once you are dead.I am saying that his dream about playing jazz is real. His death is not. He as a character did not deserve it. It would probably work much better if he was just abducted by aliens because this is actually how this movie sounds like.Incredible that Disney allow themselves to go this far. I know that you are going to say but it got Oscar, people love it.

493,ryanmoynihan,Soul,8,7 January 2021,"I haven't loved a Pixar movie this much since the ending to Toy Story 3 or the entirety of Wall E. These days I tread lightly walking into a new Pixar film, especially originals. Inside Out, Coco, all of the sequels and prequels were decent at best and forgettable at worst. For a long time it seemed like Pixar had lost its spark. That is until Soul came along.It feels strange to have this reaction too given the circumstances of the year of its release and how those circumstances have forced all of us to watch it from home. Distractions like pets or family throughout the house or my own cell phone could easily take me out of the movie in a way that I would rarely be taken out in a dark movie theatre with surround sound speakers (excluding other rude moviegoers of course). But Soul managed to beat out these odds and captivate me the whole way through.The animations and visual concepts are beautiful. The great beyond, the counselor Jerry's, the place where lost souls go and more. They all look so interesting, covered in soft blues and pinks. Pete Doctor and Kemp Power's vision of the afterlife is a warm place to be. And funny too! The story includes themes of unfulfillment and premature death without ever becoming depressing. And yet it never lacks maturity either. This feels like a movie made for the Pixar fans who are in their 20s or 30s or even older now. People who may be more likely to identify with Joe Gardner's conflicts as a middle aged man, disappointed with the monotony of life. We needed a movie like this in 2020, and it delivers.

And for an animation, everything was fairly... dark. The dark nothingness, falling, and seemingly getting nowhere were consistent themes and I'm not sure smaller children could see past it. But it is a fairly high minded concept so I'll look over it.A few topics brought up by the main character were never revisited like ""Who's Lisa?"". Like 22's spark. Maybe the kitty soul? Like the final thought process Joe must have had to decide he was wrong about his purpose. All undeveloped. And a few other backstories might have been nice.I feel the fuzzy overall plot but I don't really grasp the reasoning behind a few things. When it comes to interpreting life after death there's no right way to explain it but past movies like Coco and Inside Out have explained it to be much more intricate. Seems like your options are daycare or death. Little underwhelming.",Soul

498,Senryu-Cherry,We got soul and its all right- a life lesson.,9,29 December 2020,"What I liked
1. Explanation of the foundation of spirituality in a non-cheesy way
2. Good pacing
3. Great animation
What I didn't like
1. A little bit overstretching of the plot
2. Some unnecessary reference to astrology
This movie is an hour and 30 min long visualization of ""all we have is now"". If you are spiritual but not religious and ask questions: why we exist? What is our purpose? Is living on this planet worth it? Then definitely watch Soul. The movie tries to answer them with a simplistic relatable story.
In the end, it concludes: the meaning of life is our ordinary day-to-day activities and how we choose to live it. Keeping our senses alive to absorb what's happening around us and just breathing.A great reminder to end this one hell of the year 2020. My sceptical mind doesn't understand after-life, but I definitely agree with the moral. People, especially guardians/parents should watch it with children. One of the most mature and conversation-starter movie.",Soul

Please watch this movie before you see any trailers or hear any spoilers. I would recommend going into this blind. Here is why I love this movie.1. The score is beautiful and life affirming. The score is a very important thing to a movie like this with heavy visuals. This score by Jon Batiste matches the movie perfectly and adds so much to the film.2. The story is obviously extremely thought out and thought provokingly poignant. Im not going to say anything about it further so you get to enjoy it for yourself and form your own opinion. Each person would probably get a different message.3. The animation! Wow the animation is spectacular. When I first watched the movie I was awed by the attention to detail, the shadows, and the lighting. It is mesmerizing. It must have taken countless hours of work and it most definitely payed off.This is my #2 pixar movie after Coco and I hope everyone who is a pixar fan gets around to watching it.",Soul

NO SPOILERS, but a great storyline about a jazz musician finding/re-finding his passion. Then this other really cute storyline of a new soul afraid to venture out and finding her passion. Ok, that as close to a spoiler as I will get.Jaime Fox and Tina Fey are a voice acting gold combo! The storyline is really heartwarming and just tells us all, children and adult alike, to follow our passion and that's what makes life meaningful. Love the message and another cute set of animation by Pixar.NOW, I had to take away 1 star, just because on a personal level I dislike the type of jazz they played. The music choice takes nothing away from the movie, the message or the marvelous acting by the entire crew.

The voice acting was great - especially Graham Norton who I always enjoy listening to.The movie definitely took itself seriously at points, but only to carry the weight of its message.

529,helaxious,Goegeous yet very flawed,5,2 January 2021,"A quick review on 2020's Pixar film SoulWarning: a little bit of spoilers ahead,I'm going to score the art and the story of the filmArt, a straight 10/10 the visuals and the jazz soundtrack are brillant, i love the new york scenery, it really shows how talented the art team are, even though the soul world was pretty boringStory... 5/10
I've going to give the main reasons i don't like the story.Some details or elements weren't really needed, specifically 22's arc, it came so out of the blue with little antecipation, some other plot details too could have been easy peezy to erase from the filmThe souls world overstayed its welcome, with a big and not really needed lenghty introduction, and worst of all every single scene on the soul world is lackluster compared to every new york scene and thats a big problemPixar being the big known trusted family friendly studio that it is, decided to add a cornucopia of jokes but almost everyone falls flat, which is a sign of being rushed.
And my final big issue is that because of all of this, the main's character arc not being reinforced and feeling kinda dilluted, not much attention was paid to his arc and time was either being spent on an unfunny joke or on the a not very relevant soul world plot pointI really wanted to like this movie but this movie wasnt as good as i wished it could be..

It couldn't have been easy to come up with ""people"" that are not people and realities that are not earthly.The ending got to me. Good thing I have kleenex nearby. And I would like to add that I was especially impressed with how well they presented 22's emotional transformation.I was satisfied with Joe's ending - but was quite disappointed at not getting at least a cameo of the little one's new existence.

I actually Initially found certain elements around explanations of the universe and the soul a little complex but the film brings it all together perfectly and leaves the impression that the writers have thought long and hard about the concepts with typically stunning Pixar attention to detail.
And hurrah - finally a main character that celebrates black community and culture without racial stereotyping or making a huge point of it.

Compared with video game graphics, recent Disney movies feel like they are not up to par. However, this movie just blew me away! The graphics are slightly better here, and make me think that they used a different studio to complete the work... but what makes this film so good is the story! It's all about the story, no matter what medium you use to consume a story, it's always about the story!If you enjoyed films like ""Whiplash"", then you'll enjoy this one! It's similar to the genre of music in ""Whiplash"", but this time the main character is a jazz piano player, instead of a drummer. The instrumental sounds plays a huge part in connecting with the little one. I won't say anymore!I want to say the humour and direction of this movie, reminds me of ""The Simpsons"" or ""South Park"". Ok for kids, but it's really meant for adults. Like I said, it doesn't really feel like a Disney, but rather a different studio, like the people who made, ""The Secret Life of Pets"". After Googling, this was made by Disney and Pixar, but there is definitely an Illumination vibe here!Overall, a great success, with a heart warming message!

Coco, Inside out, and Monsters inc. are some of my favorite movies in general, not just animated movies. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with this one. The animation is gorgeous as expected, though i wasn't too keen on some of the stylistic choices which seem to collide with the whole atmosphere. The whole concept seems to be a bit too complicated for the message it tries to convey in the end, which in turn has been done in many movies over the years. Pixar's biggest strength are usually their characters, but for some reason these characters didn't really resonate with me, I usually cry like a baby watching their movies, and felt almost no emotions watching this one, and for a movie that has such a big connection to music, especially passionate music like jazz, the music seemed cold and distant, almost like I was watching ""the social network"" not a family movie. It has some really beautiful moments, especially depicting the beauty of life, and life on earth, but those moments are short, and don't come very often.

While playing fast and loose with the concept of birth, death and the afterlife, it often succeeds, but misses its opportunity to give life to itself with a truly worthy theme. Instead, Soul suggests that humans with a true purpose in life abandon their excellence in favor of acceptance and the world's view of carpe diem. In short, it's an attack on introverts and artists. While a somewhat entertaining film there are a dozen messages that are not especially positive for young viewers.

Sure, but you would only need a few million to be pretty sure of getting a handful of scripts like this. It is film making by algorithm, Finding Nemo on land. I'm sure you'll love it but you'll hate yourself for it later.",Soul

559,Mikee_Maher,Pixar always delivers!,10,6 January 2021,"Soul touches your soul without any doubt. It's easy for Pixar movies to make me shed a tear and especially in Soul. It was amazing to watch this film as it delivers a big message in life and also a big question which is what's our spark? what do we live for, and what makes us happy.
I definitely recommend Soul to anyone actually to watch you'll have a blast. N.B I love jazz music.",Soul
560,ceidt,23: Let's Try Something Else,9,28 December 2020,"Working with children takes a special kind of patience. Pixar has sought to inspire countless children through their many adventures, almost always asking even the adults in the audience philosophical questions about our identities. Driven to normalize our emotions through toys, cars, and monsters, and even emotions themselves, Pixar's new film, ""Soul,"" begins, literally, with:
""Let's try something else.""Life isn't going so well for Joe Gardner. He's doing his best, but he is actually self-centered. Sure, he works with kids, but he's just using his job as a teacher for part-time work to keep himself stable while he pursues a professional gig as the keys of a quartet. The opening scene allows us this insight, taking us on another character-driven Pixar adventure. Masterful first acts are somehow so enlightening that we can get to know a Pixar character within minutes. Pete Doctor is especially skilled in this area, as we all know. He's also the director of ""Up,"" which gave us perhaps the greatest prologue in film history, told in minutes, Carl and Ellie's life story. We see their hopes and dreams and obstacles and tragedies.Enough is shown to us about Joe to really feel satisfied and even excited when he gets the opportunity to sit at the piano for a new band. Very subtle spoilers follow......Joe soon finds himself without skin. He's blue and he glows, and he's not on Earth anymore. He's not in heaven, either. Or H-E-double-hockey-sticks. This isn't ""Dante's Purgatorio,"" it's Disney's! (Okay, Pixar's) He's in a place where everybody is missing something. The something is known only as a ""spark,"" which Joe assumes is, perhaps/maybe, our PURPOSE. Now, Joe's not actually missing HIS spark, but he finds someone else who is and is determined to show this someone else, known only as ""22,"" (I can hardly believe there have been 22 Pixar movies before ""Soul"") that they are about to find their spark (self-centered Joe insists anybody can find their purpose through music, just like him).First, we enter a great room, full of Pixar ""easter eggs"" like the lamp from the logo and the Pizza Planet truck that's been hidden in their movies ever since the first ""Toy Story."" Then, we're showed the museum of Joe's own life. From exhibits showing him eating pie in a restaurant alone to a statue of Joe waiting for his laundry, the theme seems to be summed up in a word: Mundane. He degradingly offers his opinion of himself with a harsher term: pointless.All the more reason to find a point...a purpose...a spark...to life itself.This is the story of ""Soul."" The plot takes a turn into ""the zone,"" a place where we can learn a lot about our lives. Joe, however, seems to know it all (and he will be proven wrong later). There is potential to become obsessed (paradoxically sacrificing experience for ambition)...and now we have reason to fear this state of madness...for we see ""lost souls"" hard at work fearing their existence, a place where we go seemingly just to cope with the feeling that we are never...enough. The darkness represents this scarcity. The shadowy figures highlight our inadequacy.Here, we get an ""untethered soul"" reference, alluding to the possibilities of new-age experiences for our Earthly bodies. Here, I wonder if sugared-up kids wouldn't squirm in their seats a little bit as our main character is asked to calm down. He sees himself in the hospital after listening to the environment his Earth body is in. He can even smell the hand sanitizer, reminding us all that we're still in the year 2020.""Soul"" becomes a character-driven race to discover what life is all about. In the end, we learn that it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. Joe has every opportunity and doesn't ask for much. But he is so self-centered (not an immoral guy at all, but a bit short-sighted, which might be why he wears glasses) that he is always focused on where he needs to go, rather than on embracing where he is. He certainly has access to ""the zone,"" where he can experience what is known as ""flow,"" and he can do this with music (at one point, he's so anxious that he feels like he can't focus on anything without a piano in front of him).""Flow"" is living in the moment. It's being in ""the zone."" It's experiencing something, an activity like eating or playing or exercising, to the extent that you forget about time. It's not uncommon to be catching up with an old friend and intimately listening to stories about their life in between ranting about your own and completely forgetting you two had planned to do something else entirely. ""Soul"" is a film that allows us this experience, which I believe is the purpose of movies. It's more like we're catching up with new friends.Beautifully paced, this Pixar adventure structures the story with a plot that takes us back and forth from Earth to the world of our souls and sprinkles in hilarity with wholesome humanity. I might have a few favorite scenes (the barbershop scene is arguably even stronger than the following example), but one that stands out shows us the anxiety (caring-too-much) of Joe and the depression (carelessness) of ""22"" arguing in an apartment. Banging on his door is a student of Joe's who decides music just isn't for her. Joe doesn't have time to think about someone else, but ""22"" can relate to her frustration of having to learn new things. Learning sucks! But then, the student practices something she's learned and impresses herself enough to keep practicing. A little inspiration goes a long way.Sometimes all we need...perhaps/maybe...is a little more experience.And Joe's best experience comes at the end, when he's alone again, with his piano. No spoilers, but the scene would be a beautiful addition to the museum of Joe's life we saw earlier. Jon Batiste (from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert) gets to work magic with his beautifully animated fingers on the keys. Jazz is a style of music that thrives on improvisation, truly living in the moment and experiencing flow. Jazz grounds our story.The montage that plays under the score merely shows images of Joe's life, perhaps/maybe even rejecting character development as the scenes refuse to contribute story, but my cheeks still became cold as tears touched the chilly air in my apartment. These moments offer little of the anxious Joe we know. All we really see is flow. (And we're also given some beautiful animation of leaves blowing outside, a train moving away from us, and aerial images of New York City).They mean to trigger our own memories, these ""mundane"" moments of life. Ones where we can still feel how the wind felt as we watched the clouds. We can still summon the emotions we felt while watching someone perform something they're passionate about. We can still feel the warm wet cloth our mother used to wash our arm when we were too young to do it ourselves. Our father showed us how to use the record player, took us to the jazz club where we first fell in love with music, and had us play piano for him perhaps/maybe for the last time...memories that will last us a life time . These aren't your memories (or mine), but take a minute to recall any memories that first pop into your mind from your own life. Those moments are yours because you were living in the moment. That's ""flow"" from your own life.The movie offers meditation. Flow. It asks us not to be who we are...like toys, cars, or monsters, or even emotions themselves...but to actually live our lives. Then, it asks us what we're going to do with our lives. And the answer is that we'll embrace uncertainty (perhaps/maybe)...and live every minute of it.",Soul
561,Chronic_Cuntlyf,I haven't enjoyed a new Pixar movie this much since the early 2000s...,8,29 December 2020,"I haven't enjoyed a new Pixar movie this much since the early 2000s, and this might be tied with Monsters Inc as my all-time favourite Pixar film. It's no coincidence that both films share the same writer and director (see also: Up, Inside Out, Toy Story).I could spend plenty of time talking about how good the animation looks, and it does look great, but even then, that's the least impressive element at play here. What shines most is the film's writing.Something that Disney and Pixar seem to have been suffering with for some time now is managing to come up with a story that feels new and original (with some exceptions, mostly by the same director), and while there are plenty of borrowed ideas to be found in Soul, they all come together to form something that's really a breath of fresh air.As someone who pursues music as a hobby, but is also plagued by not knowing what I'm doing with my life half of the time, I could relate to both of the lead characters in the film. What one character struggles with and learns from another, and vice-versa, felt like many ongoing internal back-and-forths I've had with myself. Plenty of scenes hit hard. But you don't need to be a musician or have any enjoyment of jazz music to relate to this film. It has a message that a much wider audience can, and for many, probably should receive. There are a variety of different ways in which we may not be valuing our own lives. Sometimes we get too trapped in our own head's and are stubbornly ignorant to our need for a change of perspective. This movie doesn't offer answers on ""purpose"" or the ""meaning of life"", but it does provide perspective. Which is probably better.And to top it all off, the original score (aside from the jazz music) was done by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. I didn't know it was them until I saw it in the end credits. But some of the more somber moments featuring piano, and the more electronic tracks that create a fairly digital soundscape for certain scenes somewhat feel like a mix of Sigur Ros and the more ambient NIN instrumentals. The film has plenty of emotional impact, and the soundtrack plays an important part in that.There were things that annoyed me, at first. Mainly in the comic-relief aspects of 22's character. Some visual gags and Family Guy-esque flashback jokes based around this character were irritating, but both of these end up paying off when they come up again later, in a much more mature and poignant manner. In fact, as the runtime goes by, the less jokey it seems to get in tone. A character I started off hating ended up being a favourite, and this rarely happens for me. Some of the best character development and chemistry between a small cast of characters in any Pixar movie. Both children and adults definitely have something to gain from watching this, but I'd almost argue that this one will have more of a lasting impression on adults. Highly recommended.8/10.",Soul
562,mayamax-42763,Pete Docter surpasses himself,10,26 December 2020,"Soul is not just a simple literal term as it preserves a transcendental content connected with the pure essence of life. Soul is not just a specific type of sound since the connections to it concern a multitude of musical genres. Starting from the metaphor and analyzing the Pixar trope, it generates yet another masterpiece with a unique and sublime visual impact. The depth of the writing, the sensational animation techniques, the sublime aesthetic design and of course the soundtrack elevates this film to the maximum. Pete Docter surpasses himself in the representation of the graphic style and reaches its peak by brilliantly painting a powerful message full of passion towards life and the achievement of one's dreams. The highly inspired Foxx and Fay are also magnetic. Having seen the wonderful Wolfwalkers before I thought that to win the Oscar Soul it would have to be perfect in every respect. Well, it seems that this condition has occurred and as has already happened in the recent past, the unfortunate Cartoon Saloon team will find on its way an unparalleled and unattainable artistic expression from my point of view.",Soul

It holds a mirror up to one of our worst tendencies--assuming what a person does is who they are.

It approaches philosophical and existential themes in a very approachable, comedic, unpretentious, and uncliched way. The switches between reality and the otherworld are done well, as are the many twists and turns of the characters. The directing is aptly edited and paced, and they take their time at the right moments, letting the audience really connect with the character's moment. The voice acting is great. Foxx was a great choice for the somewhat self-involved and perhaps misguided musician, and Fey was great as the snarky, melancholic, outcasted soul. I've been a fan of both for many years and their personal life stories blend will with these characters. The animation is stunning, and really enhances the believability of NYC. The only thing I would change is the ending - it would've been interesting to see Joe Gardner and 22 meet (either right away or many years later). That would've been a more satisfying ending in my opinion. But overall it was an amazing movie and will definitely leave you reflecting on your own life.",Soul

Even though this movie is mainly targeting the younger audience, it addresses the main issues of life and living that concern adults more. The film has a beautiful and powerful message plus, the theme of the film is expressed to the audience in a very original way. By knowing more of the main characters' inner worlds and their passion, the audience can empathize with the characters; thus, the story is conveyed much more beautifully and effectively. Other than that, both voice acting and animations are pretty good. In some scenes, the animation was so good that I thought it was real.Unfortunately, there are also some things that I do not really like about this film. I think the ending is too short, and it felt like it ends just like that. Events are also very predictable, but the thing that really annoyed me is that there is a character who is pretty mysterious to the audience because after her name is said in a scene, the film does not mention her anymore.In conclusion, although some things bothered me, the movie has a good story and approaches a beautiful subject very well.

The humor was not at the forefront like other movies, and that's what I like about it. It really feels like children's movies have matured with this movie. About the movie itself, story, music and everything, I loved it. There's not really much else I can say, which isn't a bad thing. Rather, I feel like it's just me being speechless.

For me, the high points of the film were: the voice acting, animation, music, the character of Joe, and the overall message. My biggest gripe was its conception of the soul world, the mechanics of which were tedious to sit through and frustrating to unpack. I had no interest in Tina Fey's abstraction-blob character of 22 - none whatsoever - and pleaded for the film to get back to the far more interesting atmosphere of Joe's life in New York City, richly textured in both style and substance here. I wish the film had taken place more, or entirely, in that setting, even if that meant reworking other aspects of the film.The film has its merits, and I would be willing to give this another watch, but I still feel like this could have been better.",Soul

596,karolinecelis,Relatable and fascinating film,7,5 April 2021,"This is not a bad film and not only it's a good Disney film from Pixars I grew up watching. I'll share few things about myself and get into the actual review.In April 4, 2021 I am 22 years old, 1998 person, and found out my purpose in life through astrology. I started learning astrology since 2017, and alter I gotten into spirituality, and when I found out about this film on iMBD for Disney movies, and had thoughts about my soul purpose in life on earth. My actual purpose in life with a spirit dwelling inside of me is to actually nurture people, and not only I am interested in nurturing people, actually I love art. My purpose in life is to care for other people, and through healing.Now to the review here are few things I recognize..
22 is annoying because she complains earth is boring, life is meaningless, and so forth. Although she's relatable which I do adore, except for drowning into negativity.Acting is really good and love representation of African American people of different body shapes, and sizes.The animation and art style as an artist I am deeply drawn into the art style.A few things that turned me off or feels unrealistic.I am feeling unsure spirits/souls of human beings are suppose to remember their names, and past lives. Just kidding. Actually the reason why this turned me off because in spirituality the reason why people in this world forget their past lives. For the reason their spirit doesn't want to remember their past live, and how they died, and so forth.Joe could be more cautious of his safety, work as teacher to teach kids music part time, and make music by playing instruments if he wants to do as living. And how about the money?What could be improved is if the education system in the movie was better if schools in the film were honest. For example, course on what kids truly want to do in their life by choosing one career/profession, take courses related to their career, and so forth. The reason why this is so important because it's relatable in way in real life many students are unhappy how the education system turned.Lastly, the characters which represents the spirits I was kinda skeptical about spirits having personality. Are the spirits that are given personality traits before going to earth before reborn as human again? In spirituality spirits of human beings from their past lives plans on wanting to find a family based on their needs, and before they're reborn.Spoiler: 22 mentioning she doesn't have body on earth. What if she's lying and doesn't wanna remember how she died and what really happened to her?So what could be better for this animated film is if only the spirits doesn't run away from death, and accepted death. Also 22 is kinda secretive and shady so there's something about her is off. It almost sounds someone took her life or took her own. Because in the movie 22 states she has no body. How can she have no body? It almost seems she forgets of doesn't want to think about how she died. I think that's the question I have about 22 is how she died, and what was keeping her from living her life on earth as human, which could be the reason she's tired on living on earth.Overall, not a bad Disney Pixar film and I am deeply interested in this film. Because of my interest for psychology, astrology, numerology, sociology, and spirituality I am way into discovering, and looking deeper into life, and the human psyche.",Soul

Probably the best from ""Pete Doctor"" or you can say Pixar. I really liked the way they portrait the ""Astral projection"".Initially it was giving a strong ""Inside Out"" vibe, tot it could have be the undeclared sequel to it (glad it wasn't), this is really another level. Really it was s feast. Wish I could watched in on the big screen. Highly recommended.",Soul
604,aweynand96,Pixar is growing up with us,9,28 December 2020,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie in the comfort of my own home last night, and it became evident within minutes that Soul wasn't targeted at my little brother. I watched it again, and in this room were college students and parents and members of the workforce, all of which were unambiguously enthralled - yet the kids weren't. Didn't this studio make Monsters Inc? It's not the first Pixar film to appeal to adults, but it certainly feels like the first that really isn't suited for the G-rated audience. I'm not disappointed.With the originals, Pixar isn't nearly as formulaic as many other filmmaking studios, but their movies follow similar devices. There is always a villain, and quite often the villain is redeemed by the end, or otherwise revealed to be a distraction from the true antagonist. So what happens when there is no villain? Where is the conflict?Soul points its finger at the audience. A child can't pick up on this, but an adult will. Soul knows you've been hyper-focused on achieving your goals, and with your blinders up you've missed out on simplicities that make life special. It knows you may have lost sight of the privileges of living because they become monotonous and forgettable. When you're grown up, ambition and drive often cloud your world. Soul knows this.The wake-up call that this movie delivers is nothing short of magical. No doubt this effect is carried in part by gorgeous animation and striking music, and a storyline so littered with earned laughter that it's mind-bending how enjoyable every moment proves to be. It's bursting with creativity, akin to Inside Out yet sand-sifted so only the very best ideas are put to film. You might not even notice how famous the lead voices are, but they're pitch-perfect. This film is a jewel.I've hardly even touched on the plot, but it's a pleasure going into Soul almost totally blind. You'll follow Joe, a bored middle school band director who's getting no younger. He's no dope behind the conductor's podium but he's not exactly Terence Fletcher either, desperately hunting for the next Charlie Parker. He wants to BE the next Charlie Parker. Or rather Duke Ellington, in his case, since he plays the piano and not the drums.Less adept filmmakers would get lost in the maze of these genuinely thought-provoking ideas, but Soul comes together like a skilled jazz band. There's much to unpack here - what makes life worth living, what makes you YOU, and how to handle not being able to answer the first two. Yet somehow by the end you feel exactly what Soul meant for you to feel, even if it's slightly different for everybody. It's something I won't forget for a long time - so thank you, Pixar, for growing up with me.",Soul
605,IMDbabe1807,"Beautiful, especially for adults",7,1 January 2021,"Soul explores passion and purpose, and reminds us all that it is not just what we do, but our spark for life which makes us who we are. The story is truly heartfelt and manages finds a perfect balance between serious moments and others of light-hearted humour. The animation is (as expected) breathtaking.Disney has already set the bar high with films like Inside Out which wonderfully explore psychological concepts and emotions in understandable way for both children and adults. Soul explored similar areas, alluding to deeper concepts such as death and depression, although I feel that the portrayal of many of the abstract concepts may be confusing or missed entirely by children. Nonetheless, Soul dared to go further into the spiritual dimensions of life and death in a way that I have never seen before.Soul is a truly beautiful and heartwarming story, which can be enjoyed on a significantly deeper level as an adult viewer. In times such as we've been all living recently, the meaning of this film is ever more poignant, and I know it will continue to bring hope and joy to me every time I watch it.",Soul
606,LunaLevina,Better than expected... a unique view about the soul,7,27 December 2020,"I liked it, while I expected it to be a bad movie. It was because of the trailer when they showed the souls. I thought it was a cheap design and wouldn't want to watch these figures all the time. But it turned out very differently and I was surprised. It's not Pixar's best movie, but very enjoyable. I love the realistic buildings and objects, while combining with the well made characters. I also liked the theme about the soul. I was surprised halfway the movie.Although the movie wasn't bad at all, I can't give it more than a 7/10. I hoped the formula of making a story would be broken by Pixar, but it keeps existing. You know the outcome of the story long before. Also the movie was missing something I can't put my finger on. Again, it was nice, but not more than that.",Soul

The boredom I associated at first with this transition was the only thing I disliked about the movie.The best parts are the message the movies gives. The scenes where 22 ""jazzes"" in Joe's body are inspiring and make you question what habits you've fallen into in your own life. The end where Joe saves 22 will be relatable to anyone with depression, who had felt stuck in life, or unable to live up to the expectations of others. It pointed out how our idols can quickly become lead weights, that life is more than our accomplishments, and that our spark for why to life can be as simple as a falling leaf.Thank you Pixar for reminding us all to find our spark in these trying times.",Soul

this movie is quite sad and solemn too. the lost soul scene with joe and 22 at the end of the movie really resounded with me because 22s thoughts were so real - i know that i, and a lot of other people feel this worthlessness sometimes too.

I would have loved this animation very much if it was only about the struggles of a musician and band drama. Joe is a lovable character and the soundtracks are great. I loved the parts about being happy even if your dream changes because of life circumstances and the humor was also good. But the whole ""Enjoy the little things in your life"" and ""Pizza is great, life is great"" yada yada is such a worn out cliché. The most amusing part was where number 22 was going towards India, yeah honey I would love to see how you are going to enjoy your life, your best bet would be to be born in a family where you have a toilet in your house or not be born as a Pariah or not be ***ed by gangb**gers. Forget pizza and freedom for a long time. How about all of those kids who have to work in factories from a young age or kids who are sold as slaves or billions of people who sleep hungry every night? can they ""enjoy the little things"" too? The moral of this movie is such a tired boring ""only sheltered fortunate people can relate to"" concept and based on the sales of watered down how-to-be-successful books I have to say that these concepts really sell well, hence the raving reviews.

It's a bit more abstract than other kids movies and Pixar movies, and so it may be a bit harder for children to grasp the message and the whole picture. However, it will really make them think and make the adults think even harder. The message will stick with you for a very long time and it could really change your outlook on everything. Don't take your life for granted, go where life takes you and don't worry about reaching your peak. The peak will come to you when you're ready. Sometimes, it's not even about the peak. I feel like there's still more things that I have missed because there so many beautiful aspects to the movie and so a rewatch may be in order. There's much simplicity in this movie as well as complexity, so much that it bought me to tears. This is well worth a watch, Pixar never ceases to amaze me.",Soul
638,IsThatJoseph21,I enjoyed the movie up until the ending,7,26 December 2020,"Soul was an entertaining movie, but I didn't like the ending. Before I elaborate more on the ending, I'll go over the parts of the movie I liked. This goes without saying, but the animation here is amazing. As time goes on, Pixar's animation gets better and better. Somehow, Soul managed to surpass Toy Story 4's quality of animation. Another aspect I liked were the characters. I enjoyed all of the character interactions in the movie.Now that I got through the positives, it's time to get into the negatives. I found Soul's ending to be rushed and disappointing. At the end of the movie, Joe is about to go into the Great Beyond, but at the last second, the Jerrys change their mind and give Joe a second chance at life. I get this is a children's movie and all, but I found the ending to be such a cop-out.I think a better ending would be if the Jerrys decided to make Joe a mentor instead. I feel like that would make more sense. Yeah, it would have been depressing to show Joe's funeral to children, but Pixar hasn't shied away from heavy emotional stuff before. I mean, look at the montage scene from Up. Jerry was willing to sacrifice his life to help 22, so it's not like he would have been upset at becoming a mentor.Plus, he was a teacher on Earth, so he already has plenty of experience with helping others. It's even shown that he gives music lessons to one of his students after school. Those lessons are not even apart of his job. It's something he does out of the kindness of his heart.I also think my new ending would add more weight to the story. Like I said before, Joe was willing to sacrifice his life to save 22. If Joe couldn't go back to Earth, then his decision would be much more impactful.Overall, I thought Soul was a finely animated movie with a decent story and interesting characters. However, the ending was very rushed and disappointing. I give Soul a 7/10.",Soul

645,cyrese-65547,Pixar's Redemption,10,25 December 2020,"Coming into Soul, I started out really skeptical. I grew up loving Pixar, as they were the masters at the craft of storytelling and were leading the charge in being the most creatively inclined out of all the major animation studios in the Western Hemisphere. But I've noticed a sharp decline in Pixar over the years, which culminated in Pixar's film released earlier this year, ""Onward"", which was a bit of a disappointment to say the least. So yes, my expectations coming into Soul were not all that high. That being said, I feel confident enough to say that I think Pixar truly came back to form in what is easily a masterpiece. This movie is just art. There is no other way to describe it. It conveys a great message in a unique way that can resonate with adults while not talking down to children either. The movie was a love letter to not just Jazz but all types of music yet without it being a pandering mess and the animation in this film is simply beautiful, as we've come to expect from Pixar. There are no better adjectives I can use to describe this film, it's just simply beautiful. Wall-E was my favorite Pixar film prior to watching Soul, but now I can say that Soul has took its place. Dare I say this is probably Pixar's most unique and ambitious film yet and I can't wait to see where the lamp hops us over to next.",Soul

651,maztergamer,Best Pixar Film since Coco but it doesn't quite have a spark.,9,12 February 2021,"Pixar just released a new movie and if you know my thoughts on Pixar you know I had to watch it.
This movie is great in fact it is somewhat of a comeback from Onward. Which was not bad, but just pretty good. This movie is great, the best Pixar movie since Coco. I hope I am not hyping it up too much because it isn't all time great but it is great. I don't know if it will be a classic the same way Wall-e or Ratatouille is. One of the biggest positives is the fact this is probably the best animated Pixar film. Some of the beings look like they were taken out of a Picasso painting. Also there was this one scene where they zoom out from the city. It looks photo-realistic. They have come a long way.
The characters are pretty interesting. The main character (his name is Joe) is a band teacher who loves jazz music. It is his ""spark"". On the way he meets a soul who is called 22 throughout the film. Soul 22 doesn't want to go to earth. He/She can't find a spark. Soul 22 doesn't know why someone would want to live on earth until he/she walks in Joe's shoes (literally).
The story is the most important part of a film and I am going to unpack the story without spoiling it. The story is good, great even, it just doesn't have a spark (pun is intended). You get to see Joe go into the great before, meet 22, go back into the world as a dog, 22 gets to see the beauty of life etc. When I left this movie I ultimately didn't feel anything. This might make some people mad but the ending in this movie reminds me of the ending of onward. Not a bad ending but just disappointing. Maybe I have come to expect Pixar to have a specific kind of ending that makes you cry and all that. I could see why you would like that kind of ending but I found it a little uninteresting. And it is not like I can't like an inconclusive ending. Spirited Away is my favorite movie of all time and it has an inconclusive ending. But the thing about Spirited Away's ending is that it isn't abrupt. In Spirited Away Chihiro says goodbye to Haku and then meets her parents and you see them drive away. I don't want to spoil anything so all I will say that it seems like one thing is going to happen and then another thing does.
This movie is great, it just doesn't have a ""spark"" or what I like to call the x factor that turns a great movie into an all time great movie.",Soul

With Soul, it seems as if Disney/Pixar created this for adults who are struggling with who they are or what they really want to do in life. In my view, the overall meaning to this film is that happiness can come from anywhere or anything if you have the right perspective.How we choose to spend our time, how we want to treat the world, and how we plan to develop our own purpose is what really defines us in the end. The powerful messages in Soul could not have come at a better time after all that this world has been through in 2020. Learning how to appreciate the little things when all of the bigger events have been cancelled or postponed due to a global crisis is truly important for all of us right now. Soul helps you see that meaning in a very unique way. Please watch this movie with the whole family and I really hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",Soul

I admit with all the ""diversity"" ""lgbqwhatever"" and ""ethnic"" push I was very jaded going into this. I had expectations I am pleased to say were wrong. Why? I did not leave my politics at the door. I originally gave this a 1. 2020 and their push anything through agenda there are many stinkers. Soul was not one of those. Upbeat, though centered around death, it is a nice story for all ages. I personally only failed to give it a higher rating as one would think they would have went more into the ""history of jazz"". All around I would definitely recommend checking Soul out if you have not already.",Soul

Tons of A+ stars. Cute script. Tried hard. But this was no Coco. This was no Ratatouille. This was no Up, Wall-E, Toy Story. I made the mistake of reading the reviews before watching it, so perhaps my expectations were too high. I thought it had a good message and moral to the story, but it was slow and forced in places. To be honest, I think there was a lot riding on this movie in terms of 2020 being a difficult year. If I had to guess, I'd say a lot of the reviews were planted. They just don't ring authentic, and they sound too much alike. Cute but not a standout.",Soul

After that they lost interest and their bodies wanted todo something else.Adults could enjoy it, but you would never choose this movie for you and your partner only.

668,mbficas,Inside Out but Even Better!,9,25 January 2021,"Soul is my favorite recent Pixar film, possibly favorite Pixar film period. It has great characters all around, and a compelling premise and execution of premise that drives interesting scenarios for the characters to find themselves in, and some really funny jokes. I'll hone in on those jokes for a moment because they're really what sold me on the film early. The movie has a whimsical quality all Pixar films have, but the jokes themselves are some of the darkest the studio's made in a long time, suited to a place where life isn't a concern yet. It's all delivered by wonderful characters who have just the right amount of earnestness or coldness in their delivery respective to what character's laying the groundwork for the joke.The voice acting all around is very good, giving the world a sense of realness that the animation kind of lacked for me. In the world before life all the characters look great, but in the human world, everyone just looks too caricatured for my tastes. You get used to the designs quickly though, which helps.The characters themselves are amazing. The main characters are a lovable jazz musician who wants nothing more than to make great music for the rest of his life, and his companion, an ancient soul stuck in the lands before life by virtue of not being able to fill out her personality fully. They are joined in the script with beautifully animated gods representing ideas so abstract and large humans could not possibly comprehend them, each characterized in an incredibly understated manner that makes them seem huggable and mysterious and powerful all at once. There are characters so great and so funny merely by their presence I'd consider telling you about them a spoiler. Make no mistake, great characters are the uh, heart of Soul.Since this review is getting long already, I'll leave out going into detail about the moving unconventional ending and well detailed character arcs that feel truly natural. I can fully recommend Soul to anybody.",Soul

An animated movie about, of all things, the meaning of life and how purpose is more than passion. Despite the potentially heavy topic, it comes across with the airy, lighthearted humor that Pixar has perfected over the years. It will easily stand the test of time as one of their greatest works (in a crowded field of masterpieces).I have long believed that Pixar has been slighted by the Awards circuit due to the Academy's long standing prejudice against animated movies. Soul would be more than worthy of breaking through and delivering best picture of the year. Especially now at a time that we all need to reminded that life is more than what we want it to be.",Soul

Which made this movie almost unbearable to watch.
What he understood as being an EPIC piece of piano and sax work = was noise for me.Technology has also far outpaced the animations in this movie. They feel like they could have been made 20 years ago, and yes that bothers me. With current technology it should have been way better. It would have made the characters more believable, the narrative more engaging and the soundtrack perhaps a bit more bearable.
Toy Story is 26 years old guys... think about it... We came from Toy Story (1995) to Soul (2020)I do give 8 points to the performance of 22 (Tina Fey) and Jerry (Richard Ayoade) but sadly needed to substract 6 points for the abysmal performance of Jamie Fox (where the hell did they found that guy)Look, Jamie Fox as actor, he ain't too bad, but there is a reason why in over 30 years he only has been chosen to cast 1 characters voice in an animated movie, that being Nico in Rio(2), which isn't a classic right ?
Do a better job in casting, you had it spot on with 22 and Jerry... then why Jamie Fox ???All by all in 100 minutes it caused the following

Almost every theme had been done before by either Pixar or Dreamworks and done a million times better. The real world sequences were the best parts leaving the majority of the film (the other worldly soul sequences) with a great deal to be desired.... Some extremely questionable choices of supporting cast too... Massively overrated!!! this really is a 4 star movie and that's being generous.

There is not a Pixar movie that does not move me to tears. Tears of joy. Tears of being touched in the heart. This movie ""Soul"" is no exception.This is a movie for all ages. I am sure adults would find it relating to themselves. This movie touches on a serious topic, the meaning of life. This topic can be vast and difficult to understand. But this movie brings out one very important and yet simple concept of life. It is to live in the present moment -- Enjoy the here and now.I am a psychotherapist and I have been bringing mindfulness concepts to my clients at times. But when I watched this movie, I am amazed of how Pixar can bring all these concepts so seamlessly into a movie that are suitable for people of all ages and of all walks in life. I will suggest some of my clients to watch this movie as homework assignment!!!Living a mindful life is really about embracing each moment of your life. Maybe it is smelling a rose, dipping you feet into a bowl of cool water, spending time with your friends or family whole heartedly, listening to birds chirping..... It is when you are really into the things you are doing, you are truly in heaven and you are truly living you life. Yes, really it is as simple as that but most of us are always buried in irrelevant issues that we think are relevant.........What a reminder this movie has given to all of us!

Soul also easily have one of the best movie opening title ever! But in the end, all that is just the topping for the great story and the important message this movie has...

705,MouazHajBakri,"And yet again, another Pixar masterpiece",9,4 January 2021,"Soul, written and directed by Pete Doctor, Kemp Powers, and Mike Jones (names to remember) is harmonious with Pixar trends in ots last century. The visual representation of philosophical existentialism; the embodiment of the psychological foundations of character into colors; The exuberance of emotions through a magical interflow of enchanting scenery and music, all of which projecting freely to the extremes of what has been or could have been achieved so far through animated pictures.A simple way to approach this fascinating piece of art is by asking a straightforward question, who is this movie for? and the simple and most logical answer is ... everyone. Soul is a woven melody of the philosophy of purpose, meaning, life, and death; the psychology of passion, joy, fulfillment, and maturity; and it does not abide by the simpler rules of prior Pixar pictures but rather dances freely between several premises with elongating dynamic rules. Simultaneously, this picture, as most of Pixar's, embraces an identity of colorfulness and humor; light humor, one that reach all age groups. And through this universal approach, there is an extraordinary bravery in embracing seemingly darker themes of sadness, purposelessness, and death to adopt their naturality, their necessity; qualities that neither the young nor the old should be terrified of.What strikes the most is not the philosophical depth, because the ideas are there, in books and history, even Soul itself is hilariously self-conscious about their source of ideas as they reference the names of those whom the writers of this picture are inspired with. What strikes the most is the limitless imagination of the creators who were able to materialize such philosophical meanings and use their beautiful imagery to dance between physically manifested thoughts through a cheerful, intense, and complex plot; a plot that was made with musicality in its details, ""jazzing"" with enthralling attention and care. Soul is a story of passion and a theatre of life; a gift of beauty, one of which that sink deep and hold within memory and character; it's one of those that can truly change.",Soul

Jamie Fox and Tina Fey's character interplay is believable, and makes the otherwise unbelievable, believable too. I cared what happened. All the voice acting was superb. Graham Norton dances through as a guru of sorts, and is a hoot. Pay attention to the piano playing, it's Jon Baptiste, quite literally.

This movie plays much more like a meandering animated movie made for adults than a children's movie. Pixar movies routinely tackle heavy topics and find ways to make them enjoyable for parents while being fun and relatable to kids (ex. Inside Out). It's hard to see how Soul accomplishes any of those goals because it has absolutely zero humor and not even any fun or exciting jazz scenes. Yes. The sentiments expressed are nice but the movie is boring.",Soul

While the dialogue and voice over acting was well done, the general storyline and animation was a huge disappointment. At times, I felt like I was watching a computerized version of 'Casper the Friendly Ghost'. I often found myself yearning for a flashback to traditional Pixar imagery-- which did come, but always too late.

Not buying it. Film is too messy and all over the place. The afterlife is so basic it's so philosophically insulting. The turn over of 22 from being so skeptical about the earth to being so excited to go to earth is just silly. Sure she feels sparks from pizza, from trees, leaves. Yea like she was for sure going to get that kind of life that she wanted. This film is blind to the sufferings happening all over the world. Encouraging you to be grateful of the small things? Not buying it. Also, what kind of mother doesn't know that his son was in the hospital going through a comma? Lol.The forced ""happy ending"" is also pretty cheesy. Oh and when lost soul of 22, got her sparks back from that leaf, ew, what a way to disparage depression.The only entertaining bit is the cat to be honest.",Soul

Its philosophy of life and afterlife is just so basic that it doesn't interest thinking adults yet too complex for children. It's been faking so well at being deep (it's not, it's so basic).The leading character has an interesting point of view but how he realizes his old ways of life to that new revelation of little sparks wasn't explored deeply that it felt so flat I wasn't buying it.How 22 shifted her views of the earth to one cheerful, optimistic one is also silly. What kind of skeptic does that over little things in life? None. Skeptics would know that there's no guarantee in life. There's no guarantee 22 would be born into a family that could afford buying pizza for example. This is just such a silly approach to ""being grateful in life"".When she lost her soul, so deeply, the only thing that brought her back is that little leaf? Not buying it. Corny at so many levels and felt so forced and basic. Also a gross understatement of depression. It's telling people as if people who got lost in life can easily be pulled back with finding their sparks. That's just silly. It doesn't work that way most of the time.It was also ironic that one of the afterlife staff was talking about the character being basic but the afterlife itself and what they do were also so basic.It doesn't make sense how the character still chose to go back to earth. It was a very forced happy ending. He didn't have many attachments there and he would want to go back just to enjoy the small things? Not buying it. This kind of life philosophy felt like being shoved down your throat but let's face it, everyone is living their life differently. Being grateful of small things and little sparks is not the only philosophy of life there is. Focusing in the now is not the only way of life. It might work for those with fortunate lives but doesn't mean everyone should survive life using the same philosophical approach. Some are about finding balance, some are about finding purposes, some are about being successful, some are about gaining knowledge, and maybe some others are about focusing on the little sparks. Kinda ironic that the film that is supposed to tell you how to live your life fails to realize that there are many ways to live your life. This is just disappointing how Pete Docter's feeling of dissatisfaction after winning Inside Out made him delve into this idea.How about the billions of people who haven't got the chance of tasting success? It's insulting for the director to pretend as if he had been walking on their shoes.Right when I felt there's nothing else more annoying, the spiritual mumbo jumbo comes into play. Yeah, a deluded man with a sign is somehow your key to finding your soul. Not buying all this spiritual mumbo jumbo.Also what kind of mother doesn't know that his son was struggling for his life in the hospital? Lol.This was so promising at first but Docter's choice to explore two characters at the same time just didn't work. His approach of this little spark philosophy is not something you can easily buy esp. if you don't have privileges in life and this film is blind to every struggle, injustice, that are happening all around the world.You tell a person with life struggles and who faces a lot of disadvantage in life to be thankful for the little sparks in their lives, while your life is obviously better and nowhere near that, that's just wrong. They would probably be laughing at you.Apart from the entertaining cat scenes, this film was just a lost soul, not knowing where to go or what to be. It just missed the third and fourth layer that are usually present in a top-notched Pixar film. Disappointing.",Soul

The only problem with the movie is the lack of comedy, it has some hilarious scenes, but I think they aren't as many as the previous Pixar movies, I think that will make it a little boring for the kids, I didn't watch it with one of them so, I don't know, maybe they'll enjoy it, but in my point of view as a teenager, the film is excellent, It deserves 10 out of 10.",Soul

First is how the writers created the ""problem"" that needed solving in the middle of the movie and drove the plot forward, I thought they could have come up with a better and more original idea. The second is the logic of what happens to a character at the very end, it doesn't make sense using the rules the movie makes for itself.

727,press-31193,SOUL and the Cinematic Empathy Machine by Maria Elena Gutierrez,10,12 April 2021,"In Disney and Pixar's Soul, jazz pianist and music teacher Joe Gardner finds himself transported to The Great Before, a fantastic realm where unborn souls are prepared for life on Earth. Coming to terms with his new existence as a disembodied entity, Joe becomes mentor to another soul known only as '22.' Together they return to Earth on a quest to discover just what it is that makes life meaningful.Pete Docter, who directed Soul alongside co-directorKemp Powers, has frequently used cinema as a way of exploring metaphysical questions. Soul, which explicitly asks where human personalities come from, is the next fascinating step along this investigative path.Docter and Powers join a tradition of filmmakers who have examined such philosophical ground. Members of the 1950s French movement known as La Nouvelle Vague were haunted by deep and difficult questions, as were Italian directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni, Liliana Cavani and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Alfred Hitchcock built his career on the psychological thriller and, through more recent years, Christopher Nolan continues to thrill audiences with his uniquely mind-expanding movies.Nor is it any surprise that the medium of animation has become a potent tool in the quest to find answers to these questions. Sophisticated animation techniques, evident in Soul's seductive blend of 'real world' imagery and its surreal visualisation of TheGreat Before, allow filmmakers to present extraordinary visions of outrageous worlds and concepts. These same techniques allow Soul's engaging cast of characters - especially Joe - to express emotion with such a remarkable level of subtlety that the audience is afforded a glimpse into their innermost hearts - into their very souls, in fact.The film's two visual styles prove that modern animation is a vibrant, ever-evolving art form. In contrast to the brightly-lit three-dimensional reality of Soul's New York City sequences, The Great Before boldly mixes in characters that are uncompromisingly two-dimensional, in the form of the ethereal Counselors. The lighting design varies dramatically from the fluffy softness of TheGreat Before's central Zone, to the nightmarish Astral Plane where Lost Souls roam, to the stark interstellar escalator that carries newly departed souls to the Great Beyond.The music of Soul, which combines jazz songs by Jon Batiste with a new-age score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, plays a big part in defining the two worlds. By its very nature, music has the capacity to move away from the binary access of rational language and transport the listener into a space of emotions. In this respect, music itself is a representation of the soul and, indeed, the most beautiful sequences in Soul are those where the music comes front and center, especially the epiphany sequence where Joe sits at his piano and reflects on all the mundane miracles of his life on Earth.The simple ordinariness of Joe's epiphany is what gives Soul its power. By leaving the story open, Docter and Powers invite the audience to ponder their own life choices. By putting themselves in Joe's shoes, they gain the confidence to ask themselves the same question that inspired the directors to make Soul in the first place. Do I have a path? Am I living a meaningful life? In this way, Soul forges a emotional link between storyteller and spectator, proving that the medium of cinema remains exactly what it has always been - an empathy machine.a",Soul

731,guillermomirp,"Beautiful, great pace and story, but...",7,26 December 2020,"While watching the movie I was sensing that finally Pixar did get it right. It's been long 10 years of crossing the desert with horrible movies. Only Coco was at the same level as the classic ones (Toy Story, Up, Wall-e, Ratatouille,...). And this one was pleasant to watch. I've enjoyed it very much.
Pace is good, with great twists that makes it unpredictable, the editing and sound is also superb. One get immerse in the movie and feels the feeling of the characters.Then it all goes well, the movie ends, and I continue feeling that I've watched a great spectacle. Good story, good emotions, good music. It's an adult film wrapped in animation.Yet... after thinking about it... it looks like the scope of it is very narrow. The movie is forgettable. I could watch it again, sure. But I don't feel really moved or captivated by it. I won't quote its lines or hum its songs.I think the reason is that the message itself is too big. Like a small mouth trying to say a big word. It's fundamentally about a transparent question to life itself. Why do we wake up every morning? why we do what we do? what do we want to do with the time we have present?And the answer to that is weak, and full of stereotypes:
Be good, enjoy little things, live every day at its fullest, finance people are bored and money is bad... well, while the movie gives a quick to the heart of finance (trading) the main character gets a ride in a taxi without the detail to paying for it.
Life is what it is, but unfortunately (as the mother said) dreams will not buy you breakfast.The problem is that the movie is the positive, beautiful and captivating side of life. A clean street where you can sit while watching autumn leaves fall. But there is a tedious and difficult side, where if you take a step out for a walk, you better know where you are going. Else, life will wipe you out.Now, you could say the movie is what it is, and it's pointless to judge it from that angle. But... nor Toy Story, Up, Walle, or Ratatouille, felt like I could judge them in that sense. Those movies are perfect, round, and make sense by their own. The message fit the framework. Here it does not.",Soul
732,pejv22,A great way to end 2020,7,27 December 2020,"Visually striking and carrying beautiful message about little things in life, Soul is a perfect movie for the end of this year.
This is really meant to be seen on a big screen (which I had a privilige to) and I think it requires at least one more viewing to fully grasp and appreciate everything it has to say.
Trent & Atticus score was really subtle and perfectly incorporated into its transcendent world.
I was surprised how funny it was and humor was perfectly dosed throughout the movie.However, I really think it was too short and that it needed more time to let it breathe and show us more story about its characters. Because of that emotional punch in the end was good but not great for me.I was also expecting to see a little bit more innovative concepts in the Great Before in a way Inside Out did, but neverthless some of them were pretty cool with great potential.Both Inside Out and Coco were better in my opinion but this was pretty close to their perfection so 8/10",Soul

The musical sequences in this were very fun and the emotional beats, for the most part, hit well. The main problems I have with the movie are most of the second act as well as the climax of the film. To put it simply, and without spoilers, the second act felt messy and aimless in some places and the climax of the movie kind of fell flat, at least for me.

We were all very excited to see the new release from Pixar after their recent 'Inside Out' film that we also greatly enjoyed by us.Unfortunately 'Soul' never quite got going for me, in the same captivating way that other films from Pixar had in the past. The first half hour was particularly slow, which may have put me off a bit for the remainder of the film. A lot of the comedy was clearly expressed towards a younger generation (or two!?) than some of the old nods to adults sprinkled throughout their films. Overall I never really got that invested in the storyline and found it tedious to watch the film to conclusion.There were some sections that I did appreciate however, especially some of the musical interplays with their animated world.My family was mostly mixed in their post film exchanges, and I could see how this might be a divisive film.I wouldn't tell you to pass on this film, but it doesn't get the same must see recommendation that I'd be happy to give most of Pixar's back catalog.",Soul

By which I mean the purpose and message behind this film is far more captivating for adults than it is for kids.There's plenty of silly action for the kids, just like Up and Wall-E - they'll be entertained throughout (though maybe some of the dialogue will go over their heads). But the adults will come away from this with a profound sense that they've watched a powerful reminder of what life is for, and why you shouldn't get obsessed with insignificant hang-ups.The soundtrack is beautiful, and like all Pixar films the visuals are incredible. But like the aforementioned films, the story is incredibly touching. It's the kind of thing you'll enjoy as a kid, but watch it again as an adult and you'll see and hear a whole new meaning.I've only dropped the 10th star because I'd appreciate a Pixar films without all the usual tropes to keep the kids attention - ""nearly-there nearly-there"" moments, last second failures and scrambling over inanimate objects, which just feel a little frustrating and I dare say boring when they happen in every single Pixar film.

Some just turned self-blinded somehow thus losing where they're.To be objective there's still a narrow distance way behind the Coco in 2017, which I must say is in my heart peerless as yet. But it still combines the multiple elements and projects them so vividly and marvelously within somewhere near 90 minutes. Brilliant making and production, attractive scenarios, insightful connotation, and above all, enchanting scores touching the heartstrings, as you feel it exactly.

The humor is sometimes dry and off beat but it got me laughing out loud many times.The cast and characters are diverse and I'm glad that this was a story about a black man's experience without being BLM propaganda.

The characters remain too stagnant for having so few of them, and the message of the movie is almost too saturated and obvious that curiosity and inspiration stay in bed waiting for the next time Pixar comes out to play. Additionally, Pixar has remained a powerhouse for a long time because they have created movies that keep children entertained while simultaneously inspiring and challenging the parents watching along with them.

760,joeycotten,A Pixar continuation,8,1 February 2021,"Has Pixar become the preeminent philosophical voice in America? Has a company best known for making kids movies become the one that's best at asking life's tough questions?From the beginning, Pixar's depth has been a big part of their success. The emotional complexity of Toy Story was stunning for audiences expecting a shallow cartoon. From there they continued this tradition over the next 20 years.But things have changed for Pixar these past few years. From Inside/Out to Coco, Pixar went to another level of complexity, both in broaching difficult life circumstances and in using unique frameworks to explain the why behind those circumstances. This was most evident in Inside/Out; who would have thought to try to make a cartoon with emotions as the central characters.This trend has continued with Soul. This animated film takes on what is means to be human. What is it that brings meaning to our life? The story is told from the perspective of a middle aged African American man who is obsessed with jazz. How the plot unfolds is incredibly unique, with a very interesting interpretation of how before and after life works for souls. It makes many insightful criticisms of 21st century culture, and even though the ""before and after life"" is cartoonish, the structure seems believable. The animation is nothing short of stunningly beautiful and the jazz background is fantastic.In the end, I'm not sure if the ""pre/post world"" answers the questions asked by the story in a satisfying way and the ending seems conveniently simple.

767,alecalbury,A film that could save lives,9,26 December 2020,"Pixar do it again, a wonderful blend of light-hearted comedy and a poignant message. Everything in 'Soul' is pitch-perfect.The plot might be a bit too convoluted for younger viewers, but overall it's an imaginative and uplifting film that continues the Pixar tradition of speaking to all audiences in a meaningful way.I might go as far as to say this is a new favourite, because ultimately the message of the film could save lives. If you've ever suffered from depression, anxiety or general ennui, then 'Soul' might help you through it.Additionally, the film is genuinely hilarious, the vocal performances are well-suited to the characters, the animation is flawless and fascinatingly dali-esque but the real star of the film is Trent Reznor's original score. The music for the film is absolutely spot on, drawing out the comedic and emotional beats without laying it on too thick. The soundtrack album will be an interesting mix of old-school jazz and ambient electro and I can't wait to listen to it all again.A brilliant film that I recommend to all, only one mark down for the intricacy of the concept (which to adults will be a plus really but for younger viewers it might put them off)",Soul

769,rubenjwong_88,Not for kids a too shallow for adults,6,11 January 2021,"Here's my review about Pixar's most adult movie ever made.I had big expectations for this movie but I was quite disappointed.
The animation and music were pretty good as expected, my trouble with this movie is how it fails to capture the younger audience and their shallow attempt to simplify such a complex theme for the adults.
The ""deep message"" is at best the quote of a cheap self help book, they didn't take the time to develop the characters more because they were trying too hard to make it funny through the ""Body Swap"" cliché I didn't expect.It's not a terrible movie but I definitely won't watch this again.",Soul

771,helloamazon,"A variation of Pixar's ""Inside Out"" targeted at Adults",8,27 December 2020,"I will keep my review short: This movie is the most ""adult"" film yet from Pixar (having watched all of their theatrical releases since Toy Story 1). I'm not sure kids will appreciate or even get the somber notes and adult themes (the meaning of life, life after death), even down to details (key emphasis on Jazz music).It feels like Pixar's ""Inside Out"" reimagined for adults (but not like ""Inside Out 2.0"", the setting in Soul is too different).As such, it was maybe a blessing in disguise that Soul wasn't released in theaters and got a smaller home release due to the Covid pandemic in 2020. I'm not sure this movie would have met Disney's box office expectations given the huge budgets of Pixar movies.It will be interesting to see if Pixar goes down this more experimental and adult-oriented route in its upcoming movies.I watched Soul back-to-back with the new ""Sonic"" (2020) movie by coincidence. The video game-inspired Sonic CG movie felt a lot more like a Disney ""feel good"" family movie than Soul from Pixar - which doesn't make Soul a bad movie, it's just very different from what you may be accustomed to from the latest Pixar sequels and core Disney franchises.Summary: I wouldn't watch Soul with pre-teen or even teen kids. This is Pixar for young adults and adults.8/10.",Soul

Not only it is entertaining, its very thought provoking. At the end of such an year, many of us are lost, filled with such negativity, either obsessing over what we lost or what we never had in the first place, Soul reminds us to be thankful for what we had all along, and to enjoy these moments while we still can. 2020 and corresponding pandemic reminded us that world can change so suddenly, and a lot of lives are over so suddenly, its is very important to live every minute of it, and cherish it.",Soul
773,Niik_Flix,Complicated & too similar to Inside-Out,6,19 January 2021,"Watched this with the typical anticipation for a solid Disney movie. But was deeply lost in trying to understand how their idea of life after death was supposed to work. I enjoy movies that think outside the box, like Inside out. But unless you have a solid idea and can explain almost everything entirely, then it becomes overwhelming, frustrating, and boring. This just left me annoyed. And apparently your hobby/passion is your purpose in life? However, what does that say to kids that can't pursue their passion because of a physical limitation? I found myself having philosophical arguments in my head while watching this. It wasn't a bad movie, but I feel they got a little too abstract whilst tackling the very serious topic of life after death.",Soul
774,herriwood,This film was beautiful from start to finish,10,26 December 2020,"I thought it was beautiful. There are some good bits for kids but I think there's more for adults. The detail in the musical instruments was incredible and there was an authenticity to it, that stunned me. I think it was a really lovely, thought provoking idea and I think they did it so perfectly. I loved the design of the counsellors and the little souls waiting to be assigned were adorable. It was so nice to see this done without a religious bias and all that claptrap. It was balanced and beautiful. The Great Before and The Great Thereafter was so well thought out and clever. GREAT to hear Graham Norton! And a standing ovation for the writers and Jamie Foxx.
I think if your kids get bored because it's not laugh a minute, shame on you, you've not raised them to be content and enjoy good honest storytelling. Whinging parents because the tv didn't keep their kids under control, the parents deserve the bad review. Don't blame this film for your bad parenting. The film is stunning. Amazing job Pixar!",Soul

This kind of questions this movie is trying to unser with a nice philosophical ways, this movie is teaching us a greater lesson this is how me and you should live , life is not about big achivements and succes, it's about the little things that happens every single day this is what make being alive so great things like walking, eating pizza or making peace with the ones you love.
The animation was great like usual from pixar, the voice acting and the soundtrack as well, the kids can enjoy it but i think this movie is forthe older crowd, it's for everyone that could not find his purpose in this life to everyone that's feeling depressed and to everyone that's need a little spark to light his life and push for the change",Soul

The only reason I took a lot of breaks while watching it it's because I needed to cry sometimes.

792,rudayoub,"It's like a prequel to inside out, but not really",10,30 December 2020,"The story is about a jazz pianist who dies right before his dream gig, and ascends to the dimension where personalities and souls are made, which are then sent over to earth to start their life. He was put in a position to mentor one of these souls.
I expected it to be a more straightforward story about his jazz career, but this isn't really about him. He was just a tactile and relatable representation of all the other souls being created in the dimension.
The lost soul he met along the way does not want to start their life on earth and has been avoiding all mentoring and advice, since nothing had worked. Will he be able to help this soul, and in return help himself?
A very touching story that anyone can relate to. We're all alive for one reason or another, for a passion, for a hobby, or for the love of another person.
A lot of reviewers saying this is going to go over a young audiences head... okay? Did it go over your head as well? A one dimensional action movie is probably more suitable for you. If you liked inside out, hell even despicable me, you'll enjoy this for sure.",Soul
793,cmoreland-50752,"Great Idea and Message, Mediocre Execution",7,28 January 2021,"I wanted to love this movie. I loved the concept. The message was such a nice breath of fresh air---there are waaaaay too many movies these days who's message is that someone's ""purpose"" in life is equivalent to their passion, ie what they are good at. Essentially saying that what you DO is who you ARE. However, the movie ""Soul"" begs to differ--that the purpose of life is not just to ""do what you are good at"", or any of the ""follow your heart"" garbage that claims to bring you happiness. I loved that about this movie. Its message was much more along the lines of ""life's purpose is to LIVE. To learn, grow, have relationships, fail, succeed, and become a better person. A wonderful breath of fresh air.Where this movie lacked is in its plot structure and pacing. The plot was very convoluted -- there were too many different events pulling the audience this way and that, too many non-distinct characters, and too many rushed-through lines. As an adult, I had a really difficult time keeping up in the first 45 minutes of the film, so I can't imagine a child being able to catch even half of what was happening. There was just too much going on, and as deep as this movie had the potential to be, it tried to fit way too much in too little time, making it feel rushed and confusing. Even the voice acting was lackluster. An example is the scene between Joe and his mom--it had the potential to be really emotional, but Jamie Foxx unfortunately did not build this moment enough and it totally fell flat.Love the effort and I LOVE the concept of ""Soul,"" I just think they needed more time to go through and make script and plot revisions.

828,cameronthorne,A Family Fantastic,7,25 December 2020,"Since Toy Story, Pixar has been a revolutionary animation studio - creating classic movies like Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Wall E, Finding Nemo... practically every movie they have done. Although Pixar commonly does new, exciting, and original movies, Soul seemed different. It was a matured concept, had a message suitable for anybody at all ages and has a different look.The ""look"" for Soul was visually stunning and fit perfectly with the jazzy theme - being great accompanied by the wonderful score. Pixar was more playful with Soul, much like how Joe is a playful musician. They played around with colours more often and made many other choices (other than the beautiful animation) to make Soul more aesthetically pleasing.Although Soul is another Pixar marvel, like any movie, there are a few issues. This movie had a strong start but the second act lost track of some charm and was probably the most childish portion of the film. However, it finishes off as a strong, tear jerking, emotional film providing Joe - and the audience - with a new worldview.Soul is a must watch film to watch with the family but can also be enjoyed individually at all ages. Definitely one of the best Pixar movies of the past decade. A family fantastic.8/10",Soul
829,qamarghraba,Pixar's favorite,10,16 January 2021,"This movie moved me to a whole new world filled with emotions and feelings, well executed especially the deep quotations that you well step upon through out the movie, additional to that I want to spot the light on the diversity in this movie, brown nurse, in few clips you can see women who wear the hijab, and of course the main character is black.
Overall it's a must watch movie for all ages.",Soul

832,lemonjelloUwU,"Very Sweet, Thought-Provoking Movie",8,3 March 2021,"I went into this not expecting much since the past several Pixar movies I've seen have been okay in my opinion. After hearing from many people that it was a thought-provoking, possibly tear-jerking film I decided to give it a try. I ended up loving it and even teared up near the end. It does a good job of getting you to think and consider: If you died today what would the memories of your life look like? What would your life have amounted to?Besides its philosophical questions, Soul was an overall unique movie. It was colorful, there wasn't really a villain, and it was a very calming film as well. Really, the best word to describe this movie would be ""artistic"".
I loved 22. She was just a sweet little thing and had me laughing throughout the movie. I also loved the different concepts of the spiritual worlds. This was such a unique movie that it is definitely going on my favorites in the Pixar list. I loved it and highly recommend watching it.",Soul

It makes you see the world in a whole different view. The voice acting is brilliant and the animation is top notch as expected. Overall this movie is Brilliant.

836,PranitPalSinghGulati,Excellent film by Pixar! Must watch for adults and kids who are close to become pre-teens. Not recommended for ages below 9. Made tears come out of my eyes.,9,27 December 2020,"I am about to be a pre-teen in few months and this film touched my heart. It talks about life and death which will interest you till the end. Pixar's excellent animation has made this film even better. Adults and kids who are close to becoming pre-teens will love it. Joe Gardner and 22's relationship is up to the mark and it explains your life is not wasted and you have to live every single bit of it. This film made tears come out of my eyes. The voice cast was excellent. Jamie Foxx as Joe and his voice builds up the character a lot. Tina Fey as 22... her voice dubbing has been so good since Megamind and she does live up to that voice dubbing. Other's voice is also great. Coming to the negatives- this film has a twist which is not revealed in the promotion instead just small hints. I hated the twist a little because it is annoying in the start but emotional in the end but still they ended the twist by starting the third act which still keeps it on a 9.5 but this film is not for kids under 9 as it focuses about life and the kids under 9 can only understand when they are 9 or 10 years old. So not recommended for ages under 9. Overall, an entertaining film to watch and enjoy with family (only above 9 age kids).",Soul

841,jmrtjtj,Soul is Definitely More Mature Than Any Other Disney Pixar Film but it has it's Purpose,9,2 January 2021,"By scrolling through these reviews I see reviews talking about how their younger children are bored within the first 20 minutes or so. That's because Pixar have made this movie for a more mature audience. The aspects of this movie are quite deep and dark in some ways that may not come across the younger audience.Soul has quite a complex plot that younger children might not understand this will most likely get bored and leave. The movie is mostly for people who have more of an understanding of life and death. This movie creates a fantastic storyline by showing life and death in a different and mature way that makes us believe something as fictional as this could actually be real.Overall, this movie is fantastic and authentic. It's more for an audience who understands life and death. When I first saw this trailer it didn't really interest me but when I heard that it is more mature than other Pixar films I was interested. Luckily I read reviews because this movie was a delight to watch and I highly recommend it to everyone. It has a powerful message and should be spread throughout the world.",Soul

To wit, a movie like Ratatouille where a gourmet kitchen and it's politics are sweetly explored.The opening scene of a school band practicing gave me hopes that something like The school of Rock kind of exploration of chords, scales, instruments and unknowns of the world of jazz and blues might be revealed to us normies.Alas, what we get is a very Inside Out movie.5 stars because I found the part about being in the zone and the work ethic very interesting.

I realized I hadn't laughed once. Sure I had smiled a few times at the low key humor but never was a joke thrown in my face that seemed like it was just thrown in there to make sure the film didn't lose the kiddos. Admittedly Pixar doesn't usually go out of its way to ensure kids laughing every second but this film REALLY doesn't have that on it's mind.This is a lovely story about a grown man discovering his true gifts in life and it left a big smile on my face. A very sweet and inventive film that will hopefully leave most of us adults with something to think about when the credits role.,Soul

I've noticed every latest pixar-movie has about the same setting: a kid with a gift or a talent but somehow their parents refuse to aknowledge it causing a family-issue that gets resolved at the end.
Coco: miguel likes music, his family doesn't, he flees and through an adventure at the end, the family comes together...
Brave: merida has a very freefought personality, causes family-issue and at the end she and her mother come together...
Inside out: riley experiences sadness through the actions of sadness, flees and at the end the family comes together...
Soul: son has a gift for music, mother wants a steady job for him instead of fooling around for his dream, when he plays the gig she is proud of him...
Onward: dad is dead, tries to ressurect him, adventure, at the end the family comes together..
The family theme is all over the place and the same setting is used every single time.

Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey were great in their roles but I can't help feeling that this movie missed along the way. Joe Gardners realization at the end is beautiful but by the end of the movie you might have turned to your phone, I did and had to rewind a few times.

It gets trippy almost right off the bat! I was honestly shocked and weirded out at what I was seeing. I give it four stars only because the concept is solid and as Pixar always does, it pulls at your emotions. In my opinion, this movie needed more time.

Unfortunately, it lost my interest quickly when the writers got lazy and leaned on the tired old ""body swap"" movie trope. Even worse was the body swap was with an animal. This painfully old routine consumed most of the movie, and by the time they moved past it there was only 10 or 15 minutes left in the movie. I suppose this movie might connect with people running around wondering what their ""purpose"" is in life, but I'm not one of those people, so this movie was a swing and a miss for me.

And this is where the comparison ends.What Toy Story 4 lacked in storytelling (especially the ending), Soul has got it! This is the first time since the original Toy Story trilogi, that Pixar has managed to make a serious emotional movie, without it taking itself too serious, that is.All in all, this is one of the most beautifully animated movies of all time, and the best animated movie since Into the Spiderverse, which it in my opinion beats in both storytelling and animation.",Soul

The movie has its moments but it doesn't quite carry the emotional weight that Pixar movies are known for. It would've also been nice to see some of the minor characters reach some sort of development, because there was definitely room for it. But disappointingly, they were only used as props to aid the protagonist in his journey to self discovery.Nonetheless, it's still a great movie. There are a lot of things it does right like the animation, score, character design, voice acting and ethnic representation. So overall, the good outweigh the bad.

893,kaegonyoung,Welcome Back Pixar,10,8 January 2021,"This movie is what Pixar and it's fans have wanted for a very long time. Coming into this movie I thought it was going to be more for kids but it has been a long time since I've seen a Pixar movie aimed more towards adults. Kids can still watch and enjoy the film fine but the complexity of the story and beautiful animation is aimed for a more adult fan base. I love this Pixar when they aim the movies more at adults just like the incredibles or inside out. The animation is beautiful I never expected 3D animation to look so good the environments are beautiful as well as the lighting. The comedy is alright I only really remember a few jokes but in a movie like this it's not what you should be looking for. The cast is well done Jamie Foxx as Joe is perfect I never knew that Jamie Foxx could do a role like this so well. I thought Tina Fey as 22 was going to be extremely annoying, but like Jamie Foxx she played the part well and I fell in love with the type of performance she was going for and when the events near the end I teared up which is something a Pixar movie hasn't done for me in a while.

The reality was just the opposite as the Studio used all of the ""best"" parts in the trailer.My advice...avoid watching ""Soul"" so that you don't find that you just wasted two hours of your life on absolute drivel.",Soul

896,acjacobsford,Beautiful; Perfect Pixar,9,26 December 2020,"Pixar is strongest in terms of emotion, and they delivered once again. This movie made me cry twice. Now, I know crying doesn't mean it's a great movie, but it does point to good writing and probably some beautiful music.
I enjoyed the humor in this. It wasn't forced, or formulaic like most big movie companies give us. (I'm looking at you Marvel). But if course, I love me some cynicism and it probably feels unfunny for some people. Tina Fey's character doesn't fall into a rut of being the comedic relief. I appreciate that. Too often a character is shoved in with no other purpose than to be funny or get in trouble. Soul 22(Fey's character) gets a full, rounded personality and character arc, all the while being the funny character.
My mouth was hanging open for the first 20 or 30 minutes of this movie. The animation was amazing as always. I was fascinated by Pixar's representation of the ""afterlife"" and ""before life"". The hair raising awe I felt towards the swirling ""great beyond"" was awesome. Well done. The character designs of the people were, a tad bland, but I'd believe that's on purpose, for their lives were supposed to be bland. My only complaint is the design of souls, boring kinda. Again, it ties into the story, so I won't hold it against them.
I'm gonna compare this movie to Coco and Inside Out, but please don't believe I'm doing this because I think Pixar stole their own ideas. No, and anyone who compares these movies like that is an idiot. Pixar simply expands on their previously touched upon messages.
In Inside Out, they explored family, emotions and a bit of psychology. In Coco, Pixar examined art and family, passion vs. duty.
In Soul, they expanded on those ideas. The looked at the relationship between art and how we live our lives. With a dash of family and existentialism.
Whenever the main character played piano I found myself closing my eyes and remembering school band. Thinking about the feel of an entire ensemble playing together. But also the soft notes of someone warming up. Practicing with a friend. I think this movie hits that nail on the head.
The scene where I first cried, maybe where we all cried, was when Joey went home after the performance, and played his piano. That part made me cry because it was beautiful. That scene is Perfect Pixar.
I like that the, what I call, ""Important Moment"" didn't happen during the concert. The ""Important Moment"" of a movie, especially a movie like this, is a moment the audience watches a character triumph. Whether it's them leaping off a building to join the fight (I love you Spiderverse) or something simpler, like watching them playing the piano only for themself, it's the turning point of the film.
I loved this movie, please watch it, especially if you are an artist, like me.",Soul
897,dalehitchy,Overrated,5,31 December 2020,"Pixar have some of my fave movies. Toy story, monsters Inc, inside out, and coco.

Its not funny, and I didn't feel emotional like the movie was trying to make me feel.Pixar movies are usually great for all members of the family but I don't feel that many young kids would love this movie.

909,fduncan-97411,An experience to savour.,8,3 January 2021,"Soul is Pixar at its finest once again. Before seeing this film I was sceptical that it was merely going to amount to a happy wholesome experience with a fulfilled main character by the end. But to my surprise it wasn't, which is why this is Pixar's most mature film yet. The message is that you don't need a purpose and certain thing to define yourself to enjoy life. It is about the simple pleasures in life and experiencing every single one to the fullest and about what it means to be alive and have a soul. It's so refreshing to see a more mature and adult Pixar film. To see a character who achieves everything he has ever wanted but to not be wholly satisfied by the opportunity is brilliant as it took his bond with 22 a knucklehead soul who didn't understand people as she walks a mile in Joe gardener's shoes creates an interesting dynamic where she realises what it is like to be alive and experience life in the best way you possibly can. After Joe has achieved his greatest goals it is followed by an absolutely astounding sequence of Joe looking over his life and thinking about his life and the beauty of it that he hadn't seen previously because of his fixation of his dream to become a jazz star. This sequence is by far the best scene in the film and it is so immersive and encapsulating. The animation in this movie is excellent and crisp. The balance between the real world and the soul is good, they didn't lean to heavily on one or the other. The voice acting is perfect...almost. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey are excellent at creating real characters who we can relate to as an audience because their insecurities are something that everybody understands and often feels themselves but, I have two problems with the voice acting. Richard Ayoade and Graham Norton. They don't feel fitting and connected and it is almost lazy and feels as if they just used celebrities for the appeal of recognised voices whereas with Joe I didn't feel like I was watching Jamie Foxx do a script read of a character I was watching Joe Gardener a character and a person but the connection between character and voice actor is lost with these two. This is really the only reason why it is not a 9 and is an 8 but after a few months I will rewatch this and I imagine I will find it to be a 9 after all. Overall this is an absolutely astounding film and I would recommend all to watch.",Soul

But this film(although sadly not in the same tradition of what Pixar's previous 22 movies have), Soul might had made this awful year more meaningful, which is now playing on Disney+(instead of theaters, but I didn't care), and is without a doubt the year's best movie, Pixar's best since Inside Out, and worthy of being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture(since it'll be a huge crime and very guilty if it doesn't get a Best Picture nod)
That has a strong and soulful story that has a bold and powerful message, on top of some hilarious bits to brighten up the mood, the animation is Pixar's most creative yet, and the characters are so lovable that they'll be remembered for years(with 22 being Pixar's funniest character since Dory from Finding Nemo), on top of a great score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that should go for the Oscar

Seeing the epic score on IMDB, I expected a beautiful, intelligent, adorable, funny and moving piece of work. It was both beautiful and quite intellectual, but I never got to the point where tears would form, or a smile suddenly spread across my face. Instead, the movie ends before we get to appreciate how the journey has affected the main characters.
The story deals with some aspects about the meaning of life and living it to its fullest, but it does so through types of characters and life situations that I (a male North-European well educated family father in my 40'ies) could not especially relate to.
Would I recommend seeing this - yes! Not sure that the quite mature theme will appeal equally well to the whole family, but he technical quality and brilliant conceptualization of difficult topics alone makes it worthwhile.

I liked the narration, animation and concept as a whole.

The destination was alright, but the journey felt a bit bland, as the scenery and characters are so mediocre. He likes jazz and the secondary character likes nothing, but learns to enjoy more things as the story progresses. But that's it. These two have nothing going on for them apart from that. They are flat characters. Acting supernice and overexcited most of the time, which gets annoying quickly. This reminds me more of something like dispicable me than a good disney or pixar movie. In for instance the movie Up we got two characters Carl and Russell contrasting each other well whilst going on a journey. Carl is old and grumpy, living in isolation whilst missing the love of his life. Russell is young and tries to please everybody, perhaps because his parents are divorced. He's annoying to Carl, but their journey is endeering, funny and organic. In Soul they just don't make an interesting duo at all and aren't even interesting individually.

Sometimes we just stop noticing small wonders around us being too absorbed in our worries. And what we consider our life's goal is sometimes merely a fixated idea in case it brings us only pain or anxiety. No matter how many problems you have, your life is still worth being loved; you just gotta be more grateful and attentive.It's a good film, well-made, with a certain amount of cliches, but what can we do? The atmosphere reminds of such films as Inside out and Coco The only thing I didn't like about this film is that it was trying so hard to be sentimental and moving that it wasn't convincing at times.For some people it might seem too naive, too touching and that's why a bit unattractive, especially because of the cliches.",Soul

I'm not sure how this film will play for children as it's actually pretty sophisticated. The story parries between metaphysics, spirituality, and mid-life angst. In a year where many have been forced to spend time alone introspecting, or more time in close quarters with their immediate kin, Soul highlights the necessity of modern humans to live in the moment, rather than swiping through the images and recordings of their lives. This is a film where not once did I pick up a second screen to fiddle with, a habit that's been impossible to kick with movie theaters being closed down. I was fully engrossed in Soul from the very first minute. The imagery and the story are just so highly original and deftly American (we focus on individuality so much Stateside). The soundtrack is incredible as well, oscillating between good ol' Uptown jazz and synth-driven electronica, which actually seamlessly blend together in harmony. I teared up a few times during this film, reflecting on my own life in tandem with the characters. I seem to have roariously laughed more often than a lot of other reviewers, but I personally love slapstick humor and quick, childlike wit. I can't wait to watch this film again with my loved ones.

958,tobias-62442,Somewhat Over-Rated and a Jazz Disappointment,6,7 February 2021,"This is decent entertainment, but definitely not a great movie. The visuals are very good, but the story line is a mixed-bag, and the last 5 minutes are abrupt and feel like a big cop-out.
From a jazz--music point of view, ""Soul"" is disappointing. As one critic wrote, this will not turn anyone on to jazz who was not already a fan. At the performance where Joe performs with Dorothea Williams at the Half-Note the film jumps from jazz song to song with just a few seconds given to each. Perhaps the filmmakers were trying to make sure that no non-jazz fans get bored, but the result also guarantees that no one's estimation of jazz will improve in the slightest.
The plot is too metaphysical and convoluted for a child under 12 to grasp, concerning what happens before we are born, when we live, and when we die, and why.
In the laughter department the film is weak. Indeed my only laugh came when watching the cat try to open the door to Joe's apartment.
Lastly, the end is a big disappointment. What happens to the two main characters is largely left unanswered. The writers' inability to answer these questions make the ending seem abrupt and unsatisfactory. Previous entries by Pixar, such as Toy Story, Ratatouille and The Incredibles, are in a different league. My rating is 6.5.",Soul

It is unlike any other film Pixar has ever produced - yet still tends to stick to its lighthearted nature and quirky characters, but I'd go as far to say - although it is suitable for all ages - I think this is more for adults as it discusses beautifully the ideas of philosophy and existentialism (what it means to be alive).Without coming across as too predictable and soppy here, but with everything that has happened this year, this film was the perfect reminder of what it means to be alive: whether it's listening to a busker in the subway, or sitting under an old sycamore tree, or eating delicious slice of pizza - it reminds us to make the most of our lives, and every little piece of joy that comes with it. The soundtrack, screenwriting and breathtaking animation (possibly Pixar's most challenging, painstaking and rewarding piece of work to date) made this movie a masterpiece for me, possibly the best Pixar film ever made.",Soul

Pixar have seemed to embrace a wackier form of art direction, mixing and matching more realistic with very minimalistic elemts and it works to great effect. The film looks beautiful, the animation is on point,and the detail is only of what is expected of Pixar and a bit more, just to be sure. The characters are likable and relatable and really well written. The whole film is really well written, not being predictable and completely creative. My favorite thing about this movie is the adaption made by the Pixar team. They really have learned from their mistakes, I was thinking Terry would be bad villian like Otto from Wall-e, but he was the perfect length and whimsy to not be a nuisance to the plot, but more of a fun addition. My only complaint is the length, this movie could be alot longer, but this just leaves room for the sequels to build off of. This movie was really good, good job Pixar.",Soul

967,donmcvey-1,Didn't get this at all.,5,27 December 2020,"Had some lovely moments and the animation was beautiful in places, but the whole concept seemed half-baked. The jumping around 'dimensions' was a complete mess and the idea that souls were made in some kind of vague factory thing seemed to rubbish the entire idea that a soul was indeed unique. As daft as it sounds, it was all completely unbelievable.Pixar are usually masters at putting incredible concepts into a form that makes sense in its own universe. With Soul, it's like they hadn't worked out the details of how that universe worked at all.The worst thing about it though was that I don't want to show it to my kids. They won't get the main premise (it's an intrinsically adult theme) and I reckon would be thoroughly bored. The main character is also completely lacking in charm or likeability, which is surely a 1st for Pixar.Pixar can't knock it out the park every time, but this really is the worst film they've made - just didn't feel like Pixar at all.",Soul

A job, a fantastic carrer, goals...yeah It's all great, but that's not what life is really about. This movie teach us that life is much more than that...a simple walk in the street, eating your favourite food, which might be pizza, gazing at the stars, having fun with your friends, family, watching a movie, etc...happiness doesn't really come when you reach your purpose, but It's all in the ""journey"" to reach that purpose, so don't waste your life on things that you are not passionate about, rather do what you like right now, and even if you don't have a purpose in life...It's ok you can still be happy!!

It's just that after the many masterpieces that Pixar released, and the strength of their themes, it hurts to see this one miss the mark.Most of the characters are likeable, and the animation is gorgeous as expected, but the plot is overly cheesy and predictable. The themes the movie tries to tackle are existential in nature, and the question that lives at the core of the experience is a powerful one. The problem lies in the fact that the answer ends up being pretty shallow. I'm not going to go into spoilers here, but I hope if you are reading this and have seen the movie you will understand what I mean.One major gripe I have is that I do not like the main character. He's generally selfish and lost in his own ways. And while his redemption does come in the third act, I feel that it doesn't undo his actions in the movie.Overall, would I recommend this?As a kids movie I don't think so. Unlike other Pixar movies that manage to be great for kids and adults alike, I feel like this would not be enjoyed by anybody under the age of 14. The themes are heavy and complex, but unlike other Pixar movies they are not simplified enough for children to appreciate.For adults, yes I would recommend this, but only if you are ready to go in with an open mind and not high standards.",Soul

Not to sound pretentious, but it's more than a movie - it's a life lesson on how to live. It'll teach you that life isn't about careers, goals, passions, or achievements. It's about living, right here in this moment, exactly where you are. The voice acting, animation, soundtrack, writing - all phenomenal. It is officially the greatest Pixar movie ever created in my book. Kids will enjoy it, but this one is for the older crowd. It's for anyone who's ever felt like their life has been a waste.

1002,Bert08,Loved it almost to tears (and I'm a big man with a beard),8,26 December 2020,"Before explaining why I liked this movie, I'd like to point out that the main idea of the movie is *NOT* that you need find your purpose to have a happy life. It's the exact opposite! I'm not saying this just to be a professor, but because it's really important and that's why I loved the film so much. You don't need to be fixated about something to find a meaning in your life. You need to savour it and learn to enjoy the little moments instead of waiting for something big to happen to reach happiness. It's so profound and refreshing. A movie just about a guy waiting for his big moment and feeling fulfilled after having reached it would have been dull, boring, trite and most of all wrong, like pretty much all ""self-help"" advices.
Instead the opposite idea is presented and if you just pay attention to the dialogues -and the story, really- you'll understand what I mean and most importantly what you might apply to make your everyday life better.
But back to the movie I've got to say I almost cried as the end was approaching as much as I was going to turn off the tv when the movie started. The whole initial setting reminded me too much of Inside Out, a film I quite disliked, so I was worried it was a copy of it (it kind of is in the beginnin).

There's a brief scene at the jazz club in the 3rd act, but too little way too late. My son and I are are jazz fanatics and were massively disappointed.

Shortly before he can fulfil his dream, things turn out differently and he finds himself in the ""Great Before"", a place where the souls of living beings are made.This is one of the most unusual films Pixar has made. With a budget of 150 million dollars, the studio has relied on a mix between photo-realistic and simpler, stylistic animation to tell the ambitious story in a really entertaining and effective way.

The pacing and overall feel of the movie is quite monotone and the messaging could have been more overt.Sure it's 'nice' but I expected something more like Coco and a bigger emotional connection with the characters. Sadly this movie just lacked 'Soul' for me.",Soul

1030,Loptimus06,Pixar Strikes Again,9,19 January 2021,"Pixar has struck again with yet another masterpiece, this time with the new movie ""Soul"". It is easily one of the year's best films for many reasons that include its excellent animation and its story. ""Soul"" follows Joe, a middle school music teacher who has lost his passion for music. He is transported out of his body and must find his way back from the Great Before rebranded as the You Seminar with 22, a soul learning about themself. The themes in this film of finding out what life is about are brought into animation with amazing storytelling that results in success.Directors Kemp Powers and Pete Docter has brought many magical stories to the world of Pixar, including ""Up"", ""Inside Out"", and ""Monsters, Inc."". ""Soul"" is no different. The only cons in this movie are just little things. The movie also has many fun parts that sometimes counter the emotion. The directors of the film brought this story to life with amazing animation and great voice acting performances by Jamie Foxx as Joe and Tina Fey as 22. They capture the essence of the characters with many emotional elements alongside many fun elements that are sure to keep most viewers laughing from time to time.The animation in this film, along with the character models that are used, are great, and the background settings of New York City and the You Seminar (a place where souls find their spark before going to Earth) are amazing and fit right into the theme of the film with the use of color. The themes of jazz used in the movie fit perfectly with the animation and the end result is magical. Throughout the film the animation is excellent, and it is also a constant reminder of the difference that has been made by the evolution of animation throughout the years.The music in this film captures the many elements of jazz and matches alongside the visual elements of jazz shown on screen. The film includes jazz compositions by Jon Batiste, and an original score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose that deliver both down to earth elements and themes of music, along with out of this world elements of music in the score that all together have powerful emotion.Overall, the movie is amazing, with fantastic animation, great voice acting performances that capture the essence of the characters, powerfully emotional musical elements, and a story that lives up to the powerful and amazing storytelling that Pixar always delivers. The rating that I would give ""Soul"" is a 9/10 and I would highly recommend this movie for people to watch. ""Soul"" is available to watch on Disney+ or in limited theaters.",Soul

In the end for Joe, it did not matter that he didn't accomplish his dreams to the fullest, what mattered was the life he's lived.

But here I finally saw something else. Sometimes you just need to stop, think about what you do and just enjoy your life, so simple but it's true.Not everyone has a possibility to just sit down on the pavement, take a leaf to your hand and just relax, watching people enjoying everyday life, going to work, speaking to children or kissing in front of you.Strange thing, many of us are fixed on the idea of living fast, cause we don't have much time, but actually, by running though your life you can forget the main trick of it, which is feeling the moment as it is. Finding yourself in this whirl of emotions, anxiety and routine is the purpose, it's the spark, not what you can come to world with.Everything from decorations, voice acting to jazz vibes resonates with reality. Sometimes you catch yourself in the happiest moment ever, but it's possible your soul will be playing in minor tommorow. Despite that it's up to you, what to play next...",Soul

1066,nicholaspsolla,Pixar's Soul Is Simply Touching,9,30 December 2020,"Pixar's Soul breaks the conventions of modern movies by straying away from concepts, themes, tones, and story beats that have been adopted by modern media to the point of redundancy and has created a film that instead of focusing on creating a narrative that can be understood by children, chooses to delve into the complex and vast world of finding yourself and your passions. The movie demonstrates the difficult task of finding purpose and never skips a beat when talking about more dark tones and themes. Through stellar animation, comedy, characters, cinematography, and above all, storytelling, Soul is one of the best examples of how to write and craft a narrative that could be understood and enjoyed by children and parents alike while giving many emotional, deep, and rich moments of character and moral in recent times.Soul is undoubtedly one of Pixar's finest outings in the last couple of years.

However, though I think this is one of the best works Pixar has done... I don't think this is the best film the studio has ever made as I have heard EVERYWHERE.

Nothing over the top from anybody (always a treat to get Richard Ayoade in my opinion) but nonetheless was glued to the screen.

1078,zaire-68029,Soul Inspiring Pixar Family Movie,7,25 December 2020,"Soul is a modern day 'its a wonderful life' unlike other pixar movies its not too heavy on gags or action scenes,
so may struggle to keep the attention of younger viewers, the film moves at a gentle pace and is the maturest pixar movie to date.
Its theme will definatley strike a chord with older viewers with its theme of all of us making a difference to the world in our own little way.
Jamie Fox is good, Tina Fey is better, but the British talents of Graham Norton and Richard Ayoade are the real stars of the movie with their brief cameos.
In terms of a pixar movie, this seems better suited to the small screen with none of the gravitas of their previous movies and none of the marketing/merchandising possibilities of previous adult themed pixar movies such as Inside Out. Pixar have proved once again they can make mature intelligent thought provoking movies, their technology can take us to other places and worlds, that live action movies simply cant, the challenge now is whether they can drop the requisite of it being a kids film and give the writers and animators free reign to take the stories ob further, then we may have another ' Matter of Life & Death rather than a Soul to review, and cinema may have a few more classics to add their libary.",Soul

My first thought is - it's a little too complex for children. We had to stop a few times and explain why souls were lost etc, and some of the graphics (the ones used for the counsellors) were a little too abstract and 'weird'.
The direction of the movie seemed on course to explain that Joe's 'spark' was teaching (a lovely idea seeing as I work in education myself) but it changed track in the last 10 or so minutes, and went on to say living is the spark. Not a horrible concept, but seemed pointless to have him as a teacher.
22's journey was enjoyable - how she discovered her love for life, and then her descent into anxiety and bitterness when Joe took her badge and left her behind. I do feel her story was left unfinished - it would have been nice to see her in a glimpse in the future. Though, with Pixar films, it'll probably turn out that she's Boo from Monsters.inc or Riley from Inside out.
The ending ruined this moving for me. I geared myself up to have a little discussion with my children about how Joe was ready to move to the beyond and how he wasn't scared or unhappy, and I was pleased to be able to have this little teaching moment...until they bottled it and gave Joe a second chance at life.
I literally felt the wind leave my sails, and ultimately my children were confused as I'd been gently explaining that Joe was going to pass over (whilst on the conveyor belt).
Even after we had finished the movie, my 7 year old asked me what his spark would have been (he thinks it's maths lol) and I had to explain that 'the spark' wasn't a purpose but was being ready to live, which was kind of explained in the movie but obviously not in depth enough.
So, overall, a lovely movie. Maybe just not for kids.",Soul

1104,josephmartinelli,Pixar's Best Movie In Years,10,16 April 2021,"When Soul was released late last year, It seemed that the movie was getting constant critical praise for it's story and themes. Having finally gotten the chance to watch it recently, I have to say that all the praise this movie got is rightfully deserved. The way this movie makes the viewer empathize and connect with characters is pulled off brilliantly. I think any adult can easily relate to Joe, who tries to find his purpose in life while getting his body back. The movie's visuals are some of the best I've ever seen as well, though this has always been one of Pixar's greatest strengths. I particularly like the wire frame-like design of the counselors. I also enjoyed the Jazz soundtrack to the film, I feel it really adds to the emotional depth to the movie and demonstrates Joe's connection to the music. While doing research for this movie, I read that there was originally going to be a scene where Joe and 22 met up on Earth. Personally, I would have liked to see that, but I'm completely fine with the ending that was used in the in the film, allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions. The only flaw that I could think of is how children may not be able to relate to this as easily as adults, but even then, I can't give a movie like this a lower rating because of something small like that.On a final note, when I say that this is Pixar's best movie in years, it's just my personal opinion. While I have yet to see Onward, Toy Story 4 and Incredibles 2 didn't really impress me as much as Soul. Toy Story 4 is a great movie, but I'm unsure how I feel about the ending. While Incredibles 2 felt disappointing to me, which is sad, because I love the first movie and we had to wait almost twenty years for a mostly forgettable sequel.",Soul

If you let them grow and flourish then they'll have a new chance and consequently some new things will be given birth in you. But if you repress them, they will become the dark monster souls and they will show up in you as complexes and finally they will die inside you.

But the movie was trying so hard and so focused on it, it felt forced and the plot sometimes became nonsense in terms of logic just to support the main idea. The concept of ""trying to find spark"" doesn't make sense at all, for example if none can feel nor taste then no one would find the spark of cooking. The ending is the same trying too hard to be deep, but ended up felt like an unfinished story without any satisfaction of anything, more like, an acceptance of mediocre-ness from Joe. No follow up on 22 which at this point I don't even care if she decided to be born or not, she seems just fine messing around in the ""great before"". If we were to respect whatever life anyone chose, like the barber, then why cant the film respect 22 to not be born, it's a kind of life itself.Barely any children enjoyed watching it because it was too bland, which doesn't seem like Pixar at all. Their movies are expected to be enjoyable by kids and adults alike, while each subject would view the movie differently.",Soul

A journey to escape my quotidian life. And yet through film I could feel that my life was unique. A fingerprint in the cosmos. What I have longed for quite sometime is for a film to explore the afterlife. Though not a discovery of the kind of narrative that I hope to one day encounter, secular justice unfolds in this masterpiece. I do not wish to give spoilers so I will leave any readers with this. Have you ever felt a longing for something more than unplugging? Have you wondered what your soul or ""the Great Beyond"" would be like and how it could interact with life? Well, this touches ever so slightly on that philosophy. For me, this is a contender for my favorite animated movie and perhaps favorite film.

The story, while an interesting concept, was slow and didn't make sense. Souls are given their personalities in some weird dimension instead of people grow into the person they are through life experiences. The main character dies and doesn't want to die, like he would have a choice, and decides to escape back to his body but gets stuck in the body of a cat. The story is lacking and my kids weren't interested in this at all. They literally left the room.

1120,madandy197,"Well animated, but extraordinary difficult to follow",4,2 January 2021,"I must admit first of all that had I based my opinion of the film on the 1st 30 minutes it would be getting a 1, this is certainly the type of film you can't go into half hearted you really have to concentrate to understand the plot points and even then its a struggleFirst of all this isn't a movie for kids, I don't care what anyone says unless your kids happen to be particularly smart and have a deep understanding on what goes on around them I wouldn't generally speaking recommend it. You'll be spending quite a while to conceptualise exactly whats gone on and even then may not understand it.Its heavy going from the start with the individuals souls been taken very early on. I think the main problem with this is it skips from scene to scene with a complete lack of context which causes people to get bored and switch off. Perhaps this is the type of movie to take more than just the one watch to understand, but for my taste I just couldn't get into it.Theres a profound message in this film in that life isn't just about the spark, the passions that we drive for but also the most basic of lifes pleasures that we miss whilst living our daily lives. It's a good message but my problem is that this is a particularly heavy going film, borderline morbid and depressing in parts to the point it felt uncomfortable. Maybe it was meant to be like that? There's a balance to be struck and it certainly wasn't itI didnt understand the interactions with the accountant, felt unnecessary and filler to the story, never that with moonwind again felt unnecessary. It also felt rushed and incomplete in parts for example it would have been nice to see if Joe and 22's relationship in the human world actually came together, instead a rather abrupt end that left a little bit anti-climatic compared to the core message. It also felt like 22 offered a lot more to Joe than vice versa for the sake of story telling.At the moment the average imdb rating is 8.2/10 which is putting the film on the pedestal just a touch lower rated than toy story... really? Its a profound film, but certainly nowhere near the level of class and quality that is toy story and I'm actually offended its that close , seems almost suspicious to me, but maybe covid has brought people's standards down in regards to films, games, TV etc 🤷‍♂️",Soul

Many questions were left unanswered, but that does not take away from the creative brilliance involved in the making of this movie. There's no feeling of artificial ""HEARTFELT"" or corporate ""FEEL-GOOD"" here. Soul is the real thing.Don't be fooled, however - Soul is not a kids' movie.

1124,ian_watts,A spectacular fail,1,24 July 2021,"Pixar obviously got over-confident after getting it so right with Inside Out. But the afterlife? Yikes, what were they thinking! Their view of what could be beyond this life is so unnappealing and simplistic it had me wanting to stop 20 minutes in. I also have to echo other reviews here that there is no story here that a child would want to follow, something Pixar usually does so well and is really at the heart of all of their films. They were on the money with Inside Out because it was based around personality and love, things that we all have tangible relationships with and can confirm how accurate their interpretation was. But wow, Soul is a huge wizz in the wind with some downright juvenile conceptions of what could be beyond this life. And all that just to make the point of 'appreciating the little things', the jazz movie I thought I was getting would have been a much better vehicle for that. Stick to this world Pixar.",Soul

It's a four year philosophy degree that reaffirms life, crammed into an hour and 46 minutes with breathtakingly realistic animation.I suspect younger kids (the typical Pixar audience) will be bored to tears by the plot.
It's a LOT to process.This truly is a Christmas gift for grown ups after this no good, horrible, terrible year.
It is a Pixar movie for adults; adults who want to contemplate the philosophies behind life and death using animation as their medium.The negative reviews seem to come from people who weren't in the mindset for a deep, adult, more dramatic than comedy, animated, film - which I respect, because you don't expect something this heavy from Pixar.If you're looking for a lighthearted, no real depth, typical Pixar cartoon - and those are great, not knocking that at all, there's definitely a time and place for it - but if that's what you want, you will be unhappy with Soul because that is not what it is.Want to contemplate your place in this world, what inspires you, what truly makes you happy? - as it all relates to some of the greatest philosophical debates of humanity?

But still, compared to other Pixar movies which also deal with a more complicated subject, it actually did not move me to tears ... maybe the hype was too much and my expectations to high ...or the fact that I was watching it with my 8 year old kids who seemed to have missed some of the subtleties. ( they are super enthusiastic and ""passionate"" about almost everything right now, but especially learning music, that they didn't really understand the struggle that the characters were going through)
I intellectually know where this should touch me, but then there were a few moments where I almost got a little upset. For example I feel that ""entering the zone"" when you do something you really love ... its the greatest drug in the world! I am sure everybody would agree. I find it not 100% believable that the main character would stop chasing that - even if he later on realizes that ALL the everyday live moments also have their magic. I feel that one ( the ability to live in the moment) is actually necessary to feel the other ( getting into ""the zone"") !
But if it has made me think about these topics now, that is already a great outcome. I also loved how they managed to steer off any religious associations, which wasn't easy no doubt.",Soul
1134,Hyejin_95,A journey towards rediscovering one's purpose,10,27 December 2020,"This is my first time writing a review but watching this movie was a very touching experience which I would like others to hopefully experience as well. I feel that this movie touches upon the core of our very existence which many of us tend to overlook amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life. It takes us through a journey with two characters coming from different starting points: one who's main purpose to his existence has been his passion for jazz, and one who is yet to taste and experience what it means to live. From my perspective, what really makes this movie special is its ability to take us through such deep and abstract concepts through characters which we can relate to. Both Joe and 22 may really represent both aspects of ourselves: one which is swept and lost by the need for a goal or specific purpose; and a more pure side which finds purpose through simplicity and living 'in the moment' as opposed to the past or the future.I also cannot forget to comment on the amazing graphics, script and animation which really bring out the unique attributes of each character. The script is also ingenious with reference to alot of well known proponents from different fields whom have left a mark in our world; together with a pinch of humour that brings a certain lightness to very abstract underlying topics. If you are still doubting whether to watch it because of its seeming complexity just give it a try as the general premise itself and the storyline are enough to sweep one away into reflecting about things which might be taken for granted - life itself!",Soul

But rather than concentrate on the Great Beyond, the story takes life at face value and seeks fulfillment in even the smallest victories and thorniest of fears. However, we can't always relay on dreams. The character Joe Gardner discovers dreams don't always live up to their expectations.

1147,UlrikIrgens,A Could-Have-Been Masterpiece,8,3 January 2021,"Soul is a great movie. The fantastic voice acting, the beautiful animation, and the intellectually deep themes come together to create a definite, in my opinion, surprising win in a time where Pixar hasn't produced too many winners. From all the promotional material I saw, I really was led to believe the movie would stay, for the most part in the afterlife realm. Luckily, I was led astray.From the trailers, I sort of felt reminded of Inside Out and Coco, and I feel that the final project sort of does what those movies did but in a more hesitant manner. There are multiple occasions where I can draw lines connecting this movie with one or the other. What, in the grander scheme of things separated them for me were the deeper and more subtle themes and messages. The movie does feel like one of the most intelligent Pixar movies ever and at the same time a more adult animated film.I mentioned why my expectations were set low for this movie, but in the prologue, I got my hopes up. We were teased by a movie we did not get, a movie which I would have much rather wanted. Seeing Joe in his normal life, start a journey to work in freestyle-jazz made me really get my hopes up for a new Ratatouille or Wall-E. I was hoping for an animated Whiplash. My hopes were set for a renaissance of Pixar. I didn't really have much against Onward or Toy Story 4, it's just that I really never felt Pixar reached back up to the 2004-2009 era, except for maybe Coco. They did, and still do produce great movies, but in my opinion, never really to that standard.Overall, I'd say that Soul is a great addition to the Pixar lineup and definitely worthy of a watch, sadly it doesn't reach quite to the standard I've set myself for a great Pixar film.",Soul

1156,SSFilms269,I could have sworn terry was voiced by a male,9,1 January 2021,"Time for another Pixar film, after onward becoming one of my favourite Disney animated films, it had a lot to live up to. And boy did it live up to it. This film was everything a Pixar film was meant to be, happy at times, sad at times, beautiful animations and a heart wrenching narrative.
I went into this film blind and having done so, I didn't know what to expect, I saw the posters and by the name I was expecting a musical theme, and it was executed perfectly. Personally, I don't know much about the industry, but I feel that Pixar displayed the ups and downs of it incredibly. Some of the highlights in this film include the very first scene when Joe plays the piano for his class, this scene sets up Joe's love for movies, and makes his realisation that his dream is it all that he thought it to be, even more effective. This brings me onto the next scene that stands out to me, the scene where Joe plays with Dorothea, for me, even though the whole movie led up to this point, with Joe even saying that he would die a happy man if he got to play with Dorothea, it felt wrong, and the movie presents this so well, the music makes you somehow feel guilty for 22 and how Pete conveys this is the kind of movie magic that only he can make, it remined me of *that* scene from Up. Now the film took a very different route than I thought it would. it turned into a freaky Friday style film, which I'm kind of grateful for. The film taking place in New York is much better in my opinion. Each Pixar film carries a theme, Cars is to value friendship, an universal theme is that humanity does not have a monopoly on personhood, and The Good Dinosaur's theme is bad. Ok but still, the theme for Soul is spelt out clearly; 'Live life to the fullest'. And the film delivers this message so well. In conclusion, Soul was another piece of art, like *almost* every other Pixar film. The adventurous setting of the great before was brilliantly executed and the characters develop wonderfully. Now its time to re-watch to find the Pizza Planet Van.",Soul

over all, the animation was beautiful and enjoyable, but:
it could have been 1-longer 2-more thrilling and 3- not oversimplified
so that the concept has a deeper impact on the audience and for the animation to not be a little bit boring.

1195,hugecrockpot,Fine.,7,22 January 2021,"Well, Soul is pretty much exactly what I thought it was going to be. Frustratingly impressive, kind of baffling in a way. It gets so close to being something really good but because Pixar has to be Pixar it stays to their formula, nearly to its detriment. If this was a 15 minute college project this would be a masterpiece, but it isn't. It is backed by hundreds of millions of dollars, a small country worth of producers and talent working to erect this project. That's where the line between art and artist starts to blur, the level of expected quality starts to raise the more financial backing and talented people are behind something.It is probably in the better half of stuff they've released past 2010, but for a company that at one point was a shining beacon of creativity to the world of animation it's still sad to see them so caught up in doing the same thing over and over. I'd say if it didn't have this assumed checklist that every movie by them has to follow, it would be a pretty excellent movie. I would say the soundtrack is probably one of if not the best I've heard in a Pixar film too date.It is depressing. I wish this movie could break from being handled by a studio as reviled as Pixar, if it was made without this name attached to it and the baggage that follows the name it would be a truly fantastic piece of animation. Does it have issues other than the checklist? Yes, but they are so small and forgivable that it really wouldn't change my thoughts. It's the coupling of the small handful of small issues with the overhanging, dreary storm-cloud that is the checklist the movie follows is what makes the small nitpicks standout. And I can say confidently that this is why these nitpicks stand out so much. There are many other studios and movies made by huge companies with massive budgets that I love, pieces of art that I can admit the flaws of and still enjoy the same. Ghibli is a name that comes to mind, and in a way I could very well have a lot of the same flaws with a Ghibli movie that I would with Soul. The biggest difference between say Howell's Moving Castle and Soul is that I can feel the heart behind Howell's Moving Castle. Each frame of animation feels impactful. Even though the story of Howell's might be a train-wreck at some points, I still love it the same. I think it is safe to say that many people including myself have come to expect a level of quality from Pixar, hence why I think it is fitting to be so critical of the miss-steps in direction.In short, is it a good movie? Yes. Is it better than most of the machine churned sequels this studio has dedicated itself to creating? Yes as well. But does it capture all of the spirit and creativity that wanted so desperately to be? No. I'd love to say this was the second coming of the original Pixar movies, bursting with life and love, something that I could confidently say changed animation forever but this is a fiction I can only play out in my head.This could of been something fantastic. I want to restate this as the main point behind my criticisms. The number rating I gave this movie isn't out of the technical skill shown, but out of my personal experience with it. I am honestly very frustrated, not because this movie sucked or that I hated watching it, but that I did enjoy watching it and that it was a massive show of talent from almost everybody involved, but ironically enough there doesn't seem to be much soul behind a lot of aspects of the movie. Looking past the beautiful music, stunning animation and visual style presented, and the talented voice cast, the rest of the movie just feels passive. It passes, it hits the bullet points, it is just. Fine.",Soul

The development each character went through is just phenomenal and the plot was the least Pixar like. It's just so good. It had its pacing issues but it owned it's story. How they went to new York and and it still didn't feel that off
I still think that it could have done some more setup for what was coming next. Some stuff went by very fast. But I still like it and the message was deep. Very deep and masterfully done.

1233,dikshadua-33907,Another Stunning Masterpiece By Pixar,10,4 February 2021,"I love watching animated movies. I just like their humor, delivery and storytelling more than normal ones. Whenever I feel like watching a heartwarming, light and humorous movie after a long time I turn to Animated ones. Pixar has never let me down in this respect. The first ever animated movie that I watched was Up by Pixar and it just left me magically fascinated and speechless. I was a little kid back then and now time and again Pixar releases movies be it Inside Out, Coco, Wall-E or Toy Story that deeply moves me and leaves me in tears every time and I love it!!!
Soul is yet another masterpiece and the fact that I watched it after 3 months of its release is the only thing that's bothering me. I can't describe how much I loved. The first thing I am doing after watching the movie is to write this review to cathart my feelings about it. I am so grateful that this movie exists and so grateful to pixar studios for making it. If you haven't already! Please Oh Please watch it!",Soul

It isn't very funny but that is fine because if it was a comedy it would negate the film because the film is a character drama that can be enjoyed by all ages. The animation is the best I have ever seen. Soul is a exceptional experience that everyone can enjoy with characters for any type of person to relate to. The message is amazing because this film is the anti chosen one movie, chosen one stories can be fun but they imply that your worth as a person is about how powerful you are or how important you are, but this movie says no you are worth while just because you are alive. The takeaway from this movie is of course ""the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are"".",Soul

I've been struggling with my mental health for most of my life, and this movie really really resonated with me and helped me feel a little more hopeful and less alone. Not every Pixar movie has to be solely for young kids in my opinion. I'm glad deeper topics like these have been given a spotlight for once, and I wish I could go back in time a watch it as a kid myself. I wonder if hearing the messages in this movie back then would've saved me some heartache in the future.",Soul

1262,darrin-funk,I didn't expect much and received less,2,11 January 2021,I gave this 2 stars for the pixar animation.The film's message is a load of hedonistic secular mumbo jumbo that is surely aimed at convincing people there is no point to life but life itself.,Soul
1263,npshive,Bait and Switch,3,26 December 2020,"Some trailers reveal the entire plot of the movie; others are misleading. This was one of the latter. While this is an original, mildly entertaining and somewhat thought-provoking picture, it is NOT a Hoosiers-like inspirational story about a struggling teacher guiding his struggling students to greater achievement and appreciation in the field of music. Indeed, the students only appear in the opening scene (with one student making a single appearance in a very minor subsequent scene). As for the music, it is only a minor plot device, appearing in only three scenes and only involving the central character and his struggles.Nor is this a movie for young children, preteens, or -- I would venture to say -- teenagers. The leading character is a middle-aged teacher who would rather be playing music instead of teaching it, and through a series of mishaps he finds himself traveling between the present life, the after-life, and the before-life (yes, really), guided or accompanied by a bizarre series of mysterious characters who range from the condescending to the irritating to the sinister.There is some depth to the story as the leading character and his primary companion search for both life itself and the meaning thereof, a plot we've seen before in different forms but nonetheless, as I noted, somewhat thought-provoking, but young viewers will at best be out of their depth on this, and at worst will be freaked out, and it wouldn't surprise me if some of the more obtuse characters and images cause nightmares in young children.Decent enough acting and an interesting enough plot to hold your attention, so if you don't mind the cliches it's not a complete waste of time, but keep the kids away from it.",Soul
1264,NaturalBornCamper,All of us Pixar fans couldn't wait for it to finally end,5,26 December 2020,"I don't understand where all these people giving a 10/10 rating came from, were they paid? Were they absolute Pixar fan-girls and fan-boys with opinions we should ignore?We watched this movie with the perfect Pixar audience (my mom who watches every animation movie, cried with Monsters Inc and others, my 10 and 11 year old nephews, my girlfriend who cries at every slightly touching movie, my sister that laughs easily and myself who is a kid inside an adult body.None of us laughed a single time, my sister fell asleep, my gf and mom were bored (and didn't even tear up obviously), my nephews were bored and started playing with their toys, and I couldn't wait for it to end.The worst part is that our father recently died in part because he worked too hard, stressing himself to the point of getting an infarction and all of us kids quit our jobs and realized that we should enjoy life, take it easy and not stress ourselves with work. So I was CONVINCED it would appeal to us, have deep meaning and make us feel touched. Yet with all this... nothing.We often watch Pixar movies multiple times over the years but if there's one thing I can be sure of, it's that this will be one of the only Pixar movies I will never watch again.",Soul

The story was anything but pixar quality, i have no idea what they are on about.
Any scene with a ""soul"" in it was bizzare, bonkers and sadly, boring.

I can't really explain how much this movie resonated with me. I have been into soul and jazz music ever since I can remember. Recently I have become more and more interested in the journey of one's soul and I would definitely watch a sequel if there is one.We should ask ourselves. What is 'the great beyond'? Do old souls simply become new ones or do they vanish forever? I'd love to see Pixar's take on this one as well.Apart from the above, I have to say the music was just fabulous, the movie was really beautiful and I would definitely watch it again, perhaps sharing the experience with someone else.",Soul

1274,zoegreen-194-798504,Confused by all the good reviews,3,4 April 2021,"I was so absorbed in the first 10 minutes of the film. Then everyone became a blurry blue blob and the movie became the emoji movie inside out crossover. Annoying teenage girl voice who finds everything boring. Guy becomes a cat. The big message is that your spark for life isn't a specific passion but a ""spark"". I mean, yeah, I already figured that when it was called a spark. That's what a spark is. I wanted to watch the nice character design man pursue his jazz career but I had to watch a formless blob and then a talking cat. It didn't feel deep to me it felt very surface level. ""I'm depressed"" "" Don't be depressed, your spark for life came from this leaf""
""oh great! I'm ready to live now""
This is all it took, a leaf. A soul who was one of the first ever made and has met almost every influential person ever and has been to the hall of everything multiple times. I guess there weren't any leaves in the hall of everything? It wouldn't made more sense for it to be the pizza since there is no smell or taste in the hall of everything. Just a leaf. Not the smell of the leaf. Ok.Also how come it was his time to die but there were no problems with his body when the soul entered, he had no injuries? Why was he even dead? He fell down a drain - that's how he died. No broken bones?It felt like the film was constantly trying to make a point but it didn't. Not for me anyway.",Soul

The ""sad"" parts were a little too drawn out, and the ending felt a bit rushed.Much of this may be preference in regards to the ""sad"" feeling it left me with. I felt the same with with Inside Out, so if you walked away from Inside out loving it - I would bet you'd love this one as well.",Soul

1313,daniel-schoetz,Does what Pixar does best,8,6 June 2021,"This movie does exactly all the things that Pixar does best.It has gorgeous animations, especially the backgrounds and surroundings look hyperrealistic at times, without losing the charm of an animated film, there are some scene where the animations get quite trippy for a childrens movie. The characters brim with life and the dynamic between the two main characters is well written, they both complement each other great and help with the others development, but also the lesser fleshed out side characters help to create a living world (or 'intermediate world' in the case of the immensely cute unborn souls.)
It gets pretty dark and deep concerning life & death for a childrens movie, but Pixar showed time and time again, that they want to appeal to a greater audience and it pays of well here. The plot makes you think about your own life and maybe even reconsider some choices you've made so far. Fittingly, they used an adult as theier protagonist, which is not usually common in childrens movies, but helps the movie give a more mature vibe.I think it's not surprising that the soundtrack to a movie about a musician is appropriatley deliberate put together, if you like Jazz you're gonna fall in love with this movie, if you don't like Jazz ... you should give it another try for this one.All in all well spent 100 minutes, a movie for the whole family with great music, emotion, characters and even some good laughs.I'd give it a 8.5/10, if that was possible, but since it isn't I decided that 8/10 is the better fit.",Soul
1314,paulorbit-247-281560,Pixar is pixel perfect,8,28 December 2020,"This was easily one if the best animation efforts so far. A great example of the ACES work flow where coloring, brightness, contrast and color gamut are so spot on, you are easily sucked into the movies as if you are a part of the experience. This is where animation excels and where Soul has set the bar extremely high. However I did find that the story was a bit too heavy on the adult and darker undertones of missing out in life, to suit the overall happy sunny animation feel of it all. The Jerry's looking like the Apple migration assistant...if that was on purpose, it was a brilliant find. In the end it left me with a message... ""Don't let life pass you by without noticing, and follow your own path...""",Soul

It's about living, right here in this moment, exactly where you are.The voice acting, animation, soundtrack, writing - all phenomenal. It is officially the greatest Pixar movie ever created in my book. Kids will enjoy it, but this one is for the older crowd. It's for anyone who's ever felt like their life has been a waste.

1335,mth_rr,Soul: Pixar's Latest wants to help you understand.,10,1 January 2021,"Pixar has gotten their formula down on how to make heart touching stories one after the other. It's like they know someone on the inside when it comes to how the world and the whole ""life"" thing works. When I watched Inside Out I was blown away by how it all made sense, the 5 emotions, the memory vault, the train of thought, the pit of the lost memories, etc. For example, how Bing Bong had to be left behind in the pit for Joy to get out and move on, which directly represented how we leave childhood things behind in order to grow up in real life. It was all masterfully connected with everything that goes on throughout a person's life. There is no way to verify if it's all true, but if there was a way, it would be darn accurate. But given the benefit of doubt, it seemed coincidental that they thought of that and made it into a story.
After watching Soul I am sure they have access to the BTS on the whole ""how life works"" thing.
Soul starts with a music teacher struggling to get his students to get interested in music. Joe (Jamie Foxx) is trying all he can to enjoy life in his 40's being a high school teacher, while his, somewhat failing, dream, is to play the piano at a Jazz club or a be a professional musician producing music all the while struggling to admit that in front of his mom, who wants a more professional career for him with health insurance and such. However, just when he gets his first break to play at a local Jazz Club with the famed Dorothea Williams Quartet, he meets with an accident and dies.
That is when the main story starts, instead of accepting his death and moving on to the great beyond, he fights to go back to his life and do whatever he can to play with the quartet at least one. Here we are shown the in-between world or they say the Great Before. Here all the souls are born and shown interests which will eventually give them personalities as humans. Here in the Great Before they mention a place called the Zone, which is described as a place where every time a person is caught up in an action that he loves from the heart and forgets everything that is around him or her. I have seen musicians, chefs, painters, carpenters, etc. get lost in their zones and have always envied them. The Zone is a real place. Again I want to mention here what I said in the first paragraph, Pixar knows something we don't. The way they described the Great Before makes all the sense. Here, Joe is given charge of a rather rogue soul named 22, who just doesn't see the point of living and doesn't want to go to Earth. Joe takes 22 on a journey that helps change her mind and eventually helps ""Believe.""
Soul tells this beautiful story in a such a fun way that you forget that it's an animation, all the while keeping music, or more specifically jazz, at the center. It has such a perfect and surprising ending that I don't want to call it a movie, it rises above all mediums and becomes a story. And I think at Pixar that's what they strive to be. A story is more powerful and meaningful than a movie or a show or a play. It is complete, and it is relatable. Whether you're a teenager or a struggling individual in your 30's, 40's, 50's or even 60's, you will know that the story is speaking to you. It doesn't compel you to make changes to your life or give motivational monologues. It simply helps you understand.",Soul

They have such well crafted characters and such creative ways to make a point that I did enjoy the movie. And in true Pixar style they deal with a big topic (death) in a very engaging way.That said, it's not as good as good as Inside Out or the best of Toy Story movies. It just isn't. The movie does feel like they forced a happy ending and kind of had to just wrap things up at some point versus having a great ending.",Soul
1339,assadhelu,Pixar at its finest.,9,28 December 2020,"Soul will go down as one of the best animated films not only in Pixar's or Disney's but in animation history itself. The movie accomplishes everything an animated movie should and it sets the bar very high for new animations to come.First of all, the concept. Pixar has demonstrated all over its history that if they can do something good, it's world-building. The studio has established itself as probably the best world builder in the entire industry, let alone animation. Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Coco, Inside Out are arguably the best imaginary worlds Hollywood has given us; and this feature is not the exception. The movie employs truly philosophical yet simple concepts for the audience to reflect on and they managed to ""translate"" those for the public to understand. 'The Great Before' and 'The Great After' are beautifully portrayed versions of the after life and its opposite equivalent; the way souls acquire personality and the role of 'the spark' allude to the very essence of every human being on the planet, the way we became unique and different from each other; the 'lost souls' are nothing more than stress, anxiety and depression that very often overwhelm us; in conclusion, this is a movie that deals with the themes of life and death, in a way that not other movie had done before.The animation is top-notch, just marvelous, it's the peak of animation so far. The level of detail is scary; the wool of the sweater, the sweat from the jazz band members, the reflection of the hands in the piano, etc. It can't go any higher without becoming live action.
Script and direction go hand-in-hand, Pete Docter (who did both) tells the story in a way that we understand the concept of the film and the storyline at the same time. It is a complete roller coaster, from laughing to crying to a very satisfying happy ending and the editor managed to take us through that roller coaster in just 100 minutes. Furthermore, cinematography is just breathtaking, the shots from the Earth and the Milky Way aswell as New York both at day and night and the winner in my opinion, the band gig scene; it really makes you feel like you are in Manhattan listening to some live jazz. Finally, the cherry on top of the cake, an excellent score by living legend Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.The most important thing about this movie is its message: live your life at its fullest, because you don't know when you will stop living; and when you do, you don't want to regret anything or stay with desire of doing something. The little things in life are the most important and the very fact of living through every day, is the mere purpose of our existence.",Soul

Like the sunlight coming trough the windows and leaving rectangles on the wall. Or birds that I haven't heard in a while singing in the early spring. Or when a girl has really nice makeup and you tell them that and they smile. Or a hug. Or when parents laugh with/at each other and you could tell they still love each other. Or when you see a kid playing with a chicken and holding it while driving a toy car. Or walking in a forest and being mesmerized by all this ecosystem that has its own rules. Or when you find a gif of how neurons make connections. Or when someone looks at you with love. Like I was just staring at the comet Neowise last summer and I was crying because we don't get to see things like that very often.Actually, I just really needed a positive movie, given that everything is pretty stressful right now... or always if you have anxiety.

I didn't connect with the main character, it could have been universally relatable, just like we are used to when it comes to Pixar. But it is more of a niche character, which is where I am guessing all the 10/10 reviews are coming from. Also, at times, the music felt like a soundtrack from a 60's sci-fi movie.

At first, about the half of movie, I thought it talks about dream, passion, life is about finding one thing you are into, but it's not. Instead, the meaning of life is life itself. The spark is not your advantage or your destined job, but it's your determination to start a life. The fish fable is quite interesting.

The climax was built subtly, and even the plot was heading towards a direction that I couldn't expect, not specifically plot twist or a surprise it just wasn't conventional , and let's talk about that animation IT WAS AMAZING, typical Pixar

Pete Docter's capability of presenting plot inventively with characteristic animated figures is quite professional as always. It's more like to be a movie served as a wake-up call for those adults who are still struggling for life and need the moment to be enlightened. The story shows a narrative gift, delivering the message that life philosophy is somehow hidden in the monotonous daily routine. This is a movie that teaches people how to live in the moment instead of pursuing the goal of an ideal future. It reminds me the article I ever wrote about Chinese drinking rule--a culture of moderation. ""Too much drinking will mess you up and excessive joy leads to sorrow. It is the common sense that works for everything. "" We sometimes have to learn how to face an unsatisfied consequence after pursuing a target with all our might and may find one day that the niceness kept in our imagination is somehow not so wonderful as we expected.

1406,cartoonteevee,Soul Review,10,26 December 2020,"Soul ReviewSo.. I just watched Soul on Disney+ and it is so good. If you don't want spoilers, stop reading this.Soul really surprised me. It didn't even feel like a movie. It felt like an experience. While Pixar had already covered life in other movies like Coco and Inside Out, this movie is better than both of them because of how creative it is. The before life was really creative because of how it worked. Being mentored to learn about earth in the hall of everything and make the souls get their spark was really neat. The joke with all the councillors being named jerry never got old and made me laugh all the time. The way Joe entered this world was really creative, entering a coma and teleporting to the gate to the great beyond. Trying to take 22 around the hall of everything to learn about earth was really funny, seeing them try out all these things and then choosing not to like it was very cute. The second part of the movie where 22 and Joe enter different bodies and wonder around earth trying not to get in trouble, learning more about life, and terry trying to find them really changed the way I felt about the movie. Connie showing 22 how amazing music is was very inspiring. I would also like to give this movie extra points for not doing the ""main duo separates before the climax"" cliche. Turning 22 into a lost soul was a very creative idea. Also, I really liked the idea of ""The Zone"". Just getting really into something that makes you feel like you are elevating to your own world is really relatable. Being able to see the humans through the zone as souls was a very good idea to get Joe back to rescue 22 and give them their spark and send them to earth. I don't want to make this too long, so here are my final thoughts on the movie:Story: 10/10Characters: 10/10Humour: 9/10Pacing: 9/10Concepts: 10+Feel free to disagree with me all you want!

1411,ellepaxton,"Disappointing, Disengaging, & Depraved",2,26 December 2020,"I was really looking forward to this film from what the trailers had shown! I adore Pixar and music has always been a large part of my life!
The humor wasn't bad... it was certainly laughable in the moment, but nothing terribly memorable or quotable like other Pixar films of the past.
Throughout the movie they also like to degrade and make jokes about admired historical figures... which was a little uncalled for...
The film wasn't engaging for the kids watching with me. They either fell asleep or walked away before the movie was half over, not something you'd expect from Pixar. Even Toy Story 4, which was a flop, was more engaging!
The repeated use of Hell didn't bug me, but seemed a little excessive for a movie with a target audience of children and families.
Pixar tries to make a film about life before earth, life after earth, and the spirit world. A major leap for a bunch of Californian atheists... one that they did not land. The concepts were confusing, far too complex, and just straight up false nonsense. Way to create even more confusion, and then sell it to the children!
The movie also glorifies drug use. There are these characters that ride around in a hippie pirate ship ""rescuing"" lost souls. Their spirits are separated from their bodies, which are back on earth, high as a kite. These characters are glorified and looked on as heroes.
There were a few jokes that had me a little peeved as well, generally about race...
The trailers also focused a lot on music, a theme that was only lightly brushed over in the actual film

1415,udc-58106,Very good,10,29 December 2020,"I understand the unsatisfaction viewers may experience since the end is very abrupt. But that's life. This movie is about how life is unpredictable, you don't know when you will die and what happens after death. We don't know what happened to the other souls who died and entered ""the beyond"". Because no one knows, me, you, Pixar or Disney what happens when we die. This abrupt ending actually made sense to me. I would really love to know what happened to Joe and 22 but no one can say for sure. Maybe that's for a part two of this story? And does it really matter that we don't know for certain what happened to the main characters? - Atleast we know everyone was happy in the end. This is why I leave this movie a 10/10 rating, simply because the thoughts behind it are deeper than you might notice at first glance. Even though the whole switching bodies thing are very overdone, this movie used it in a way that wasn't boring or something that I personally have ever seen done before. The context was ""new"" (even though the concept of life after death isn't) and it made it very enjoyable. It brought some light onto a tough subject, making it perfect for a kids movie.",Soul
1416,oac-90045,The Best Pixar Film of the Decade,9,30 October 2021,"This film gets so many things right. While some may argue that Inside Out or Coco are better, Soul just made me think a bit more. When I made my Pixar ranking these three was the hardest part. Soul, Coco and Inside Out are all worthy of a nine out of ten. This is because all of them have different concepts and the concepts are quite creative.Soul starts off with Joe falling to his death, only to beat the odds and escape the clutch of death. He joins up with a soul called 22, who cannot find the interest to come to earth. I think the ideas are what makes this film good. However, this movie surprised me in many ways as well. This film is more intellectual than Inside Out and Coco and this is mainly shown after they get out of the soul world. I was worried that this film would end up being less mature than it promised. However, after a few wacky moments, this movie shows how it's story is the most mature Pixar film since Ratatouille. Then, Joe finally gets the gig of his dreams, but he doesn't feel it. This reminded me of megamind and his growth through the story. However, this also leads to the best scene in the entire movie. I love movies where the protagonist accomplishes his goal but then finds there is more to life. This scene is the montage where he plays jazz and realises that all the little moments in his life had importance as well. Despite this, the climax and resolution weren't as great as the first and second acts. Coco and Inside Out have a few problems with the first and second act but soul's first and second act are really good. It's just that the resolution doesn't live up to that of Inside Out or Coco. Soul is still amazing though, and probably the best Pixar film since Toy Story 3.",Soul

1429,superbromdb,Overrated beyond belief and very underwhelming,6,27 December 2020,"I could not disagree more with the 10/10s here. This movie was not only missing an entire third act, but it was so predictable that it soiled the emotional and existential aspect of the movie. The concepts the movie envisions are just slightly more mature versions of Inside Out concepts.There's so many unneeded moments in the movie. Such as the kid who plays the trombone, what did she add? What did his father passing away present? What did it change?I don't agree with many other reviews as I don't really think there are any subtle moments or details. It's either overdrawn moments or over explained bs. It either doesn't allow one to comprehend the movie as it doesn't give any insight, or over explains it and doesn't leave anything to the imagination. There's no happy medium.The movie presents a cast of predominantly black characters, of which I think is amazing. As especially during these times it's a wonderful thing to amplify black voices. Yet this movie doesn't fully accomplish that task. Why make the characters with such over exaggerated features and not give them an identity or culture? All they really do it go to a stereotypical barber shop to ""talk things out"" and that's it. They don't even dive into different genres or music and explore other peoples perspectives! Not even a culture in music, just jazz.Another example of an easy target that they missed was his father. Why was he not present? It didn't add anything with him not being there, and he was mentioned literally twice. I feel as thought if he was present he could add to the movie as a foil to his mother, who was very against him pursuing music.And wow, this movie is predictable. And while I am understanding that predictability is in the eye of the beholder, a movie attempting to be this emotional falls flat on its face when it tries to accomplish a lot with its broad topic but be so damn predictable. I found myself saying out loud what was about to happen, and it happening. Yet again, no subtletiesThe plot. While the plot is complex in of it self, the only portions I really found myself enjoying were when 22 was becoming used to her surroundings in a human body. Other than that...eh? Those parts were by far the highlight, but I was never questioning what was going to occur. I knew shenanigans would occur with him being a cat. I knew he would return to his body. I knew he would play the gig. I knew that when he was about to die, he wouldn't.The animation is yet another double edged sword. I found some moments to be absolutely overwhelming gorgeous other times, I was underwhelmed. I wasn't impressed with 22 and other souls. I found it hard to deduce their emotions as they were predominantly resorting to gesticulating instead. Which didn't really work, as throughout the movie, hand movements and such aren't really used, except for in the beforeOverall, I'm disappointed to say the least. I was expecting this emotional roller coaster that amplified minority voices and dived into the hidden culture of music itself and jazz. I desired something that would show me what life was all about, and how to live it. I wanted a third act to sum up this gorgeous, emotionally empowered film that had this home made feeling. What I got was a movie with a lot of good animation, decent voice acting, all over the place story and predictable plot. Seriously, this movie made me feel nothing.

1437,santiagogtrigos,The best movie Pixar has done i a while.,9,5 February 2021,"I´ll like to start saying people who say that this movie is bad because it´s not for kids are not seeing the big picture. This only shows Pixar real versatility.Now, the movie has some really strong subjects; life, dead, passions, vices, happiness, and a lot more. To the point that you may take this movie as a journey and not be fixated on the story itself. I found myself several times thinking about things said in the movie, and I think that a lot of movies don´t really get that deep, specially Pixar.The story itself is not bad, I think is something simple and fun to watch. A man pursuing his dream to be a jazz player, but as he gets really big news something that everyone considers terrible happens to him. And this is why you need to put yourself in the shoes of the main character, and I repeat myself, if you only watch the movie with the intention of being entertained you may be, but most probably you will not.Regarding the last paragraph, that´s why a lot of people don´t like this movie for kids because they may not get the message or be entertained, the movie has it´s fair doses of colorful images and funny characters, but as I said, that is not the point, It´s not like ""Onward"" with a simple story full of characters and jokes kids would like.Also, the message they try to transmit it´s really powerful, and the more you think and cosider about it the more you´ll like the movie. This doesn´t mean that you need to analyze each second and each word, the movie has really good scenes for you to think about the life of the characters or even yours.So, is it a movie worth watching? Yes, a lot.",Soul

I got what I expected, Soul is beautiful and touching, I'm definitely going to watch it again. The story, the characters, the message are all amazing, however the best of them all is the setting - it was very creative and fun to watch.

Story gets deeper as film progresses and becomes an important call to action; appreciate life as if you are experiencing it for the first time. Don't take the small things for granted.The way in which Disney gets this message across is done beautifully through vivid imagery, imagination and stunning fresh perspective. Although the film is reminiscent of ""Inside Out""...I don't truly see that being a bad thing, as both are undoubtedly in my list of favorite animated films.Overall ""Soul"" ask audiences to be more appreciative of their own lives and live life a bit more curiously with excitement.

Right now, I think it was not that bad at all. Animation was beautiful. The plot was not SO fascinating, but not that bad. It is a film needed for a who is to obsessed with achieving dreams.

I must admit throughout the movie there were ALOT of great moments to where I almost got emotional about seeing the depiction of color in a new and ambitions way. But let's get honest here, a story is only has good as it's conclusion. The ending of this movie was HOR--RI--BLEEEE. I watched this with my someone I trust and we paused the movie throughout to see the potential direction of the story and it feel flatter than a pancake. I honestly couldn't believe the movie was over. The story raised a lot of questions and didn't provide any answers. I honestly can't see why people are raving about this movie when it obviously was not well executed. i didn't intend on making a review but i keep trying to see the success of the movie. Most people don't care about story. I don't want to give out spoilers but there were some things revealed about the protagonist that was never addressed. It seems as if the screenwriters didn't agree on direction on story because the the story takes one direction and then changes in a heart beat. So yes, it had ALOT of potential but it missed the note for me. The way the movie started with the horrible band class was something I was going to overlook if the movie was good. But can't overlook it now. It was a really horrible way to start and end this movie. DISAPPOINTED.",Soul

1460,cynthiawang-84152,A Fantastic Piece,9,18 January 2021,"This is an astonishing piece on artistic presentation. The best film I had seen recently. It is not usual for a Pixar movie to use such ""radical"" art, such as when Gardener falls through the Great Beyond and the Great Before and when Terry blends into the scenes. They are very surprising yet professionally handled to present this largely conceptual world to us.
On the other hand, I agree with those who argue that its narrative is rather messy and rushed. While I didn't realize this when watching, it does appear strange when reviewing the story that 22 helped Joe to resolve a bunch of his life problems in merely one day. Moreover, from my personal taste, I do feel that the ending can be improved by having Gardener walk into the Great Beyond. I think it makes the story more realistic and profound. But considering that this is a film targeted at the children audience, this ending is understandable.",Soul
1461,kstamey-29081,I haven't seen one this good in a long time.,10,10 January 2021,"Pixar always does an amazing job with their movies, but the story building and character development we so intricately bonded together in this movie pushed the bar for them.

The second time was okay. The third time, TOO many plot holes. Why three times? Because the movie was that boring. I couldn't focus the first two times, there was no emotion. SPOILERS Joe just kept wanting to get back to his body and then when he performs, he's happy when everyone is applauding but then he's all of a sudden sad when he walks out of the club? How depressing. I'm a performer and his actions did not align with each other. Also, NOW he wants to sacrifice his life for 22? Made no sense whatsoever? And don't get me started on a White led voice voicing a Black body. Pixar why why why? It's already bad that Joe only spends about 8-10 mins on screen as himself and then falls down a man hole and then he turns into a soul BUT then, he turns into a cat? Very upsetting to the black community, and to top it off you have a White voice speaking for him? This is coming from a Black person, bad move Pixar. Meh, I'm over this film. This film is not uplifting. The only message this movie really has is to just enjoy life but even that's a basic message, we all have something we can be passionate about, what a horrible movie. Lastly, it felt like too much was going on in the movie. The animation was beautiful but that's it. Music was fine. Coco is a much better film and actually for kids. The people I watched the film with including a child, got very bored.",Soul

Along with the stellar voice acting and chemistry by Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey.The one small complaint that keeps this gorgeous movie from being perfection is the ambiguous ending. If there was a few more minutes added after Joe returns to his body.

So the thought of what actually happens before is so great.
It might be an animated movie but the story in my opinion is on a higher level.

The animation is absolutely stunning, I love how it looks lifelike but still has distinguished characters. This movie is amazing, Pixar did a very good job. Although I would not recommend this to someone who is extremely religious because it kind of challenges the theory of afterlife and purpose, this movie is great. Younger kids might not be as interested in it but I would say 11+ would be pretty interested.

However, the characters and their purpose were in my opinion rushed onto the screen which made it heard to connect.

But as much as Joe can be liked he is a single note held together by his loved for jazz, untethered to the land of the living and forgotten by the land of the metaphysical realm. After all, to the Jerrys he is just a missed count.
I would have loved for the movie to have included a conversation between Joe and his dad as Joe ascends the escalator to the other realm. A simple reaffirmation that Joe should keep on living would have added a bit of depth to the movie. But there is nothing calling for Joe from either side.
On Earth, Joe has his mother. But Joe's mom is strong and independent, the need for her son is only based one her love for him and her hopes to stabilize his life. She has a life to live, with or without her son. I wished the movie made their love more concrete. For one, what mom leaves their son return to their daily routine after recovering from a coma? I know for a fact that my mother would have not slept a minute and would have never left my side for months after.
Joe has no person on Earth that he needs to live for. No love interest, no children, no real purpose. I wished the movie would have given him a purpose in his love for his mother, his desire to teach, his lover, anything. But no. The movie just makes his purpose his love for Jazz, the Jazz that gladly replaces him when he fails to appear for his big break. Joe is replaceable, forgettable, and easily removed from the land of the living.
In the metaphysical realm, Joe is also out of luck. The movie has no desire to welcome Joe to the land of the dead. I, myself, have a couple people up there that would probably encourage me to keep living (a few that may be too excited to welcome me, as well); so, the movie missed a moving moment in which Dad could have talked to Joe and lead him to find his real purpose. Or maybe Dad could have encouraged Joe to join him and to let go of Earth and Joe would have to make the choice of saying goodbye to his dad once more. Either way, it was a huge missed opportunity by the movie.
And finally, did they seriously equate the desire to live to eating a slice of pizza?",Soul

But this explores more heavy themes like the meaning of life, knowing how you want to be known for, and it doesn't have that third act break up thing that's in every. Single. Animated. Movie. EVER! and this didn't have it, and the characters are so loveable, Joe is a loveable Character that you can love and has Character development, and the barber man in that one scene has something in that one scene that i won't spoil cause it's so amazing.

I went in not knowing anything not seeing many trailers if any just knew it was a Pixar movie so I had to watch it and it might be one of the best Pixar movies ever. This movie delivers a great message I feel most people are in need of with the pandemic being stuck inside and not knowing what the future holds. This movie hit you right in the feels, I'm 24 and it dealt with finding your purpose and its A message I feel a lot of other millennials are dealing with now. It shows you to enjoy the little things in life. The soundtrack is also phenomenal the music always flows with the movie and complements the scenes perfectly.

1521,nevesenk,Truly complicated questions can't be simply answered,6,31 December 2020,"Pixar has always been my favorite animation studio (along with Ghibli) and today I was lucky to watch ""Soul"" in a movie theatre: I can't say that I did not like ""Soul"", but it has a number of problems, which makes the overenthusiastic reviews from critics seem unjustified to me.""Soul"" touches upon complicated philosophical issues (the issues of life and death, as well as the search for purpose and meaning of one's own existence), which, I felt like, are too difficult not only for children who will probably fall asleep in the cinema, but also for the authors themselves, who seemed to be confused, trying to understand what they want to tell the audience in the end.The answers and solutions to the (insoluble) existential questions offered by ""Soul"" seem to me somewhat unsatisfactory. Digging deeper than commercial animation filmmakers usually do, Pixar's scriptwriters have reached a level where any attempt to answer a question clearly and unequivocally, will look naive.In ""Soul"" there is A LOT of things that can get more and more confusing the more you think about logic of the world created by Pixar, but it gets even more embarassing when you realise what it lacks: for example, themes of love and loneliness, past which the storyline deftly maneuvers. It's difficult for me to agree with the formula ""love of life"" = ""the ability to enjoy little things and what we call ""routine"""" (A slice of pizza? Riding a bike?) = ""happy life."" I think this formula obviously lacks at least love, friendship and a sense of belonging to something greater than one's self.It's possible (and sometimes even useful) to speak simply about such complex things with adults and children, but to claim to be true in this case means to impose a point of view and even show a share of ignorance, leveling thousands of years of the history of the development of existential philosophy.However, it's still a unique and enjoyable animated film that was fun for me to watch. I think it is better to stay at this level of perception and not try to unravel the tangle, which neither Nietzsche, nor Sartre, nor Kierkegaard, nor the authors of ""Soul"" managed to do successfully.",Soul

It is an inspiring life-coaching lesson for everyone on this planet, maybe grown-ups particularly. We tend to believe we have to be obsessed with something to make life meaningful. We are proud of our passions, careers....but our lives are supposed to find sparks, even though they are tiny little things. Ex. Talking patiently into your mom to get her support for your dream; having a sincere conversation with your barber; even observing a fallen leave dancing onto your palm.

You'd think that since the movie centered around jazz, the music would be beautiful and moving. It wasn't. And the characters just weren't very interesting.While the overall message was positive, there was no ""meat"" to it.

Repeatedly, the movie suggests that Joe's true calling is that he inspires others. First, the young woman with the trombone, then the drummer, and finally 22, the hardest soul to inspire. In any normal movie all of this would be a set up to the conclusion where Joe realizes what he was meant to do all along. It would be a promise made, promise kept. Except this doesn't happen in Soul, and you're left feeling like something is missing. Which perhaps is the whole point. Life makes lots of promises, and we expect to see some of them fulfilled. If one watched Soul while expecting nothing of it, it would still be visually beautiful and emotionally resonant.

Reality is not what we have been told it is and the complexity of the film helps parents teach that lesson to their kids. That being said there is some stereotyping in this that seems to probably fly under the radar of a majority Caucasian company. The target audience is probably white upper class millennials with kids who maybe have never seen a PoC before and are flirting with agnosticism or atheism.As Pixar's first film featuring what you would imagine a white person would describe to you if you asked them to describe a PoC living in NYC it does pretty good at giving what it promises.,Soul

Yes, the main character is as ordinary as I am. His mother is probably the same as your mother. Dislike you to study outside back also did not plan to start looking for a stable job, still have to rely on her half a lifetime of hard work in exchange for your relative stability. And you drift so long so hard to get a job with social security after what dreams to mention with her, she can only show you the dedication of everything done in front of you, so you are discouraged. Yes, how familiar. Just like me, or you, every day of our lives.
When you long for half a lifetime of a certain goal is finally achieved, in addition to the thrill of getting at that moment, the rest is destined to be endlessly lost. Because in the future, I will live with what goal? Why else should I run to each day with enthusiasm? I don't know.
The question that was posed made me feel a certain intense emptiness. It was so familiar that I began to imagine that other people, like me, were asking themselves one day when they stopped working, ""Oh I'm so good at painting, I was born to do this, but I actually began to wonder if I was really going to keep doing it for most of my life with it as my goal.

It discusses failure and purpose in a charming yet moving way, never once breaking this message.It is incredibly well written. Some may worry about there being a ever present, loud political message but this is not the case. It is simply about the internal struggle of someone who thinks they are a failure, hand and hand with another to guide him. Please watch it, I may not have done a good job expressing its quality but it speaks for itself. Go, now!",Soul

What a great lesson it gives, that the time when we were kids and we used to enjoy it all without the worries and hassles of the world and as we grow old, all the stress, the charm to be someone and the aims to achieve someone, it takes us away from how to actually live a life. Life isnt all about reaching goals, or achieving something, its about doing something you love, alone, or with someone. Much love from DubaiMachines",Soul

1595,deepanddipyo,Soul review by Manideep Bhattacharyya: Pixar's latest is profound but the story lets it down,8,5 July 2021,"Soul was already a notable Pixar movie in that it's the first from the animation giants to feature an African-American lead character, but then 2020 happened and it's now set another first for the studio.On October 8, Disney confirmed that Soul would skip a cinema release and be released straight to Disney+ on Christmas Day, becoming the first Pixar movie to debut on the streaming service.It's an unsurprising move given how the cinema landscape has drastically changed in recent months. However, that doesn't stop it being a disappointing one considering the landmark lead role and the sheer scale of imagination that's gone into Soul.As he did with Inside Out, director Pete Docter (along with co-director Kemp Powers) has crafted a world unlike any we've seen before, tackling big questions about what it means to be alive in a family-friendly way.It's heady stuff and may not be the festive viewing you'd want, especially in a bittersweet early moment where Joe reflects on his life to date. Soul might not ignite an existential crisis in you, but it certainly leaves you to reflect on your own life. The touching message it leaves you with also hits a bit differently in this current global situation.Soul might not be as successful as Docter's previous Pixar movies, but even with its flaws, the Disney+ move automatically makes it the best Disney+ movie yet - although you will wish you'd seen it on the big screen.What lets Soul down is that outside of the impressive world-building, the story doesn't quite hit the same unique heights. After its incredible first act, things start to stall in the second act after a critical story point (no spoilers here, but you'll know it when you see it).It's perhaps a necessary one as it moves Soul into broader, family-friendly territory, yet it also makes the story feel looser and become a series of set pieces, rather than a cohesive whole. It doesn't help that Soul becomes a twist on a much-used trope, so you miss the freshness of the rich world that Docter and Powers worked meticulously to build.Even though the movie doesn't live up to the impressive opening, Soul still manages to deliver some emotional beats as it builds to its climax. There's not the gut punch like Up's opening and Bing Bong's death (""take her to the moon for me...""), but a touching montage highlights the movie's message, backed by a gorgeous piece of music.There won't be a dry eye in your living room and when you've recovered from that, Soul hits you with a perfect final line that'll set you off again. It somewhat recovers the lull of the second act, but also makes you hope for what might have been.Soul doesn't hit the high benchmark that Pete Docter set with his previous Pixar movies, but even if the story doesn't match the world-building, it's still a profound, inventive and often-hilarious look at what it means to be alive.And right now, we might need that more than ever.",Soul
1596,gregthegrey-05789,"Enjoyed it, no where near Pixar's best.",6,26 July 2021,"Enjoyed it but no where near Pixar's best. Also the part where the lead character asks the new soul why it sounds like a middle aged white women was off putting, why bring race into a film like this?

I've seen all kind of comedies and I don't get tickled that easy anymore, but this movie did the job. The story is well paced and well executed.But I have to point out the similarities with Coco. But protagonists are members of a minority group tah have a strong musical passion and they are prohibited to pursue their dreams by their mother who both work in the garment business. Close before their breakthrough they landed in the afterlife where they find a comic relief who want to help them to get back to the world of the living before the protagonist vanishes from this in-between world. There are also pets involved, one dog and one cat. In the end both got to get to the living and their passion for music is accepted by their mothers.",Soul

Excellent start to this movie.I hit pause and go make dinner. Come back, hit play and all of a sudden I'm watching some existentialism BS. No more movie about jazz.

Do we just live in a world where the societal pressure to love-love-love any Pixar release is so daunting that one dare not admit that the film was tepid at best? As a musician who made my early college living in jazz bands I thought the music was pretty cool, and there were about 30 funny minutes in the film, but for the most part it was contrived, cerebral nonsense. The message was OK but not exactly novel. I just feel like because it was Disney/Pixar and maybe en vogue with the SJW crowd that it is being measured with waaaaay too low a bar.

I cant get behind that as a message to give to kids.Sure its ok to be a hairdresser or whatever you choose to do, but the idea that thats all predetermined is bananas.I also felt the story was quite disjointed. Plot points seemed quite forced (eg. the cringeworthy scene where 22 explains why she has chosen him of all people to help her decide on what to do, or the accountant....counting because thats what he does and so he must fix the problem, the throwaway refence to another person that slipped through the gaps and caused all sorts of problems...i thought the main character would learn something from that experience, instead it was never mentioned again) it felt like there were threads the story could have taken and developed but when we got there the story veered in a different direction.

I liked the music, but it isn't going to convert anyone to love jazz.
I liked it that the characters were mainly black, without it being a political statement. No reason for them to be black or not to be black.

This film starts with the basis of a man who ""has already lived a life"", and who is in the doors of give ""meaning"" to that life (a big gig oportunity). The feelings involved are complex, adults, this is a movie for those who have grown up with Disney and that golden age of Pixar (and his brothers), and now are open to give their heart to a new story. This movie is for those adults who still cry with these animations (or hide the tears). This movie is for those who seem to have lived a lifetime and discover that they are not halfway there, that they can change direction at any moment.

1677,jaja-ex_oh,The new Disney direction which fails the original audience,6,5 June 2021,"It seems that Disney is at the crossroads of making movies with heavy, moving topics designed for teenagers and adults whilst also creating the more light-hearted films with relevant life lessons for children that I personally grew up with.There are a few exceptions in recent times which do a brilliant job in combining both these parallels (Inside Out) but Soul is not one of them.Sombre tones, heavy links to depression and lifelong regret form the essence of the story. It's not a bad film - it's actually quite good and as an adult, I was movedIt's not however an animated film I would show my 5 year old son. Lifelong regret is not a concept I would expect nor want him to understand at such an innocent age. I certainly think there are lessons around making the most of each day relevant for all age groups which Disney can explore in future 'exceptions'. It's a shame that Soul is not one of them.",Soul
1678,catpapafilippou-72861,a gift to the new generation,10,13 January 2021,"There are millions upon millions of children's movies based on multiple ways and sentiments that fill life with meaning; Love, Friendship, companionship, sense of belonging etc. But this one stands out because of the way it portrays the meaning of living in and of itself. The simplicity, and simultaneously the multidimensional tapestry life is. I have never seen a movie that contemplates the concept of mortality and views walking down the street through the lens of beauty instead of mundanity, in such a whimsical and playful way as this one. I am simply elated the youngest generation gets to witness this.
The voice acting and the writing were impeccable and so was the soundtrack, especially since you never expect to hear jazz in a kids movie. Sometimes we search or strive to define what the meaning in our lives is, but this movie answers the age old question in a wistfully inverted way. Life and meaning have a certain sort of contingency that some would argue is easy to miss. Life exists within meaning. And it's not the spark that makes it worthwhile but the how we interpret certain freedoms as simple as waking up in the morning. 10/10",Soul

However we watched it as adults (1 from the ""greatest"" generation and 2 from the ""baby boom"" generation) and also found it difficult to understand. That being said, the animation is phenomenal! We all agreed the line from real to animated is so thin that actors must be very worried. The dialog is fun and snappy. The characters are charming. So it isn't the details that put us off. It is in the underlying premise. It seems to be in finding ""the spark"", but we never really even learn what the writers think the ""spark"" is, even at the end of the movie.

Probably this COVID situation, lack of good movies and everyone wanting to be connected with ""something bigger"" is making this 9 / 10s ratings.
Let's be fair, the way some ""non physical worlds"" are presented it's great! BUT...
First half an hour is boring, the discovery of life from 22 is really interesting and we start to like it... but then it ends a abruptly and as a cliché.Advise everyone to see it... but in 2019 would be another xMas movie.Stay Safe Everyone, cheers from Portugal!",Soul
1699,footballfever-38238,20 minutes too short,5,2 January 2021,"As many others have mentioned, the themes in this movie are targeted toward adults. Watched it with kids and they quickly lost interest. There are definitely some slow parts as well.The story had an interesting premise, though the conceptual similarity to Coco and Inside Out made it feel a little stale.Themes aside, my biggest gripe with Soul was how incomplete the ending felt. Right as you were just starting to kind of connect with the characters, the movie ends. Joe's character and the relationship between Joe and 22 needed way more development. The time used on the ""accountant"" felt very unnecessary, other than as a way to separate Joe's soul again. That time could have been used to immerse the viewer deeper into Joe's world and to create more shared experiences with 22.I also really wanted Joe to recognize how 22 helped him create authenticity in his relationships with his mom and barber, in addition to helping him see how to appreciate life. Joe never said thanks or showed appreciation to 22 and that really turned his character off to me. In fact, Joe doesn't really do anything to help 22, but 22 does a whole lot to give perspective to Joe.The great Pixar movies use plot twists to completely change the lens through which the audience views the story. Soul doesn't. The plot is easy to predict and I found myself waiting for the punchline well into the credits.Overall, this movie needed 20 more minutes to develop characters and their relationships, and complete the story. As it sits, it feels incomplete.",Soul

1704,teamtress,"Just as existential as we expected, and a new peak of Pixar quality in my opinion.",10,26 December 2020,"This movie is absolutely beautiful and I love it so much. It's a perfect Christmas present from Pixar, especially considering the delays on everything.The fact that we never see what's actually in the Great Beyond (the movie's afterlife) solves the problem of differing beliefs conflicting by not saying ""this is the one concrete form of afterlife"", and leaving it up to the viewer's beliefs. It also leaves the mystery of what's after death, because yes, some believe in a Heaven or Hell, but even if you try for Heaven, you won't really know where you're headed until you pass away. This unknown even plays into the plot a little, but not too much. (Not saying how, for spoilers' sake.)I loved the Great Before (ahem, You Seminar, they're rebranding) looking both like a giant environment and a moving, colorful painting, all with that ethereal feel that is perfect.As well, the material plane of Earth is beautiful in its own way, and I am amazed at how fast Pixar (animation as a whole, but Pixar especially) is getting to photoreal everything. I'm glad they appear to make their characters more cartoon-shaped, to differentiate from real-life footage (and also because of the dreaded Uncanny Valley being closer than ever with the photoreal environments). They also perfectly depict how differently it's seen from the points of view of Joe and 22: Joe sees how beautiful it can be, especially when there's music involved, like at the Half Note; 22, having never been in a human body, is overwhelmed by the sudden noise, light, and people everywhere, which also makes absolute sense.The story is amazing as well, with perfect characters that have equally amazing character arcs, great jokes for kids and adults alike, really deep themes and moving moments (and, as we all expected from the trailers, it is really existential), and a great message for everybody.The music, being a big focus of the film, is beautiful as well, and fits the characters and theme well, with the ethereal, other-worldly music in the Great Before, and the jazzy music in the Earth sections of the movie.A Pixar movie with an African-American lead is LONG LONG LONG overdue, and I would say the jazz-music theme is well picked for that first movie, given the history of jazz and the large role African-Americans play in it. I am not the person to talk about this, being a white male, but I think they pulled it off well. Aside from Moonwind and the therapy cat owner, the cast members that aren't black don't play human characters. It was a smart move to keep the focus on the black community, on the side of things where that's meaningful (since race isn't really a thing in the Great Before).Overall, this is an amazing film in every way, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone and everyone. The fact that it had to only release on Disney+ is a major shame, but I understand due to the current circumstances. I would say, though, that Soul is a great reason to get a subscription if you don't have one and have been thinking about it.Absolutely beautiful work, Pixar!",Soul

It got deep pretty quickly, which I was not expecting, but it is a movie for kids and adults alike that is filled with meaning, laughter, wit and an all-star cast. As most Disney movies do, this one has quite the message and it really does hit the 'soul' in a way that I would compare to Inside Out. It got heavy at times, but not long enough for me to dwell in sorrow; one optimistic scene later and I was quickly put back into the mindset that in the end, things would hopefully work out alright or, at the very least, the way they were meant to work out.This movie immediately went into my top 5 for Disney movies and potentially my top 10 in movies overall.

It provides the audience with an impeccable writing (which seemed a little confusing at the very beginning but then became a clear a concise story), a delightful humor (pixar style), the special voices of Jammie Foxx, Tina Fey and Daveed Digs, and a lot of jazz.However, this is not enough to deserve a 10. In order to achieve the perfect score, a movie must have a soul. It must be alive. It must result from the writer's sincere will, passion and emotions. Something magical, touching and intangible must be present.I know that it seems a vague exigence, but Disney has done it perfectly: a flawless masterpiece with a blue magical soul.The movie reminds us that life is the greatest gift we have and teaches us to love every aspect of it. As human beings, we are inclined to love many things, but we use to forget to love life itself.Watching this movie particularly in 2020 made it even more special. A hard year hallmarked by a tragic pandemic that has driven people into self-isolation, boredom, and looniness.I know that it seems crazy to say that a movie made for kids is so deep.

1720,ivan_urso,Joy of life but lacking of intensity,7,25 January 2021,"The main concept in this film is the joy, love and the beauty for life. The imagination and the idea of afterlife are very clear and detailed but in my opinion is lacking of intensity and I was expecting a stronger emotional impact than what I received.
So for this I vote 7/10",Soul
1721,augustnoliveri,Fantastic,10,18 April 2021,"A true gem by Pixar, this movie is sweet, funny and SOULful. There isn't much to say except that it's a great movie.",Soul
1722,jessew-30064,One of my favorites of 2020,9,12 March 2021,"Simply put, this movie is one of Pixar's best and one of my favorites of the past year. Definitely a more serious film than most other Pixar movies and a great performance by Jamie Foxx. What can this guy NOT do? If you have Disney+ it's a must watch.",Soul
1723,kristoffgrmz,Boring,4,22 January 2021,It's the worst Pixar movie ever. The message is very good but they can not find a better to tell the story. It's a complicated movie for kids-5,Soul
1724,osakahentai,Breathtakingly beautiful!,9,13 January 2021,"Definitely one of Pixar's best movies of all time! Amazing performance from Jamie Foxx as always and a heart-warming story. The animations are on point and the whole cast basically did a great job! I loved watching ""every minute of it""! 22 is awesome!!",Soul
1725,sophiethornepedersen,"Beautiful, relevant and tear-worthy",10,26 December 2020,"I just watched ""Soul"" with my mom and younger brother, and we all had the same exact reaction when it finished: WOW, what a wonderful message!This movie is raw. It somehow manages to hit you in the gut while simultaneously patting your shoulder, reminding you that the small things in life truly are what matter the most. It's about not putting all of your work and effort into ONE thing when there's so much out there to love and cherish with both heart and soul...Grab your moment and don't let it pass. You never know how, when or where your last moment will be - so you owe it to yourself to make sure that it was all worth it, however, whenever and wherever it ends!",Soul
1726,labhijitsingh,One of the best movie I have ever seen in years.,10,25 December 2020,"I really loved this movie man. This movie is so inspiring that it makes me motivate to work on the things I loved about, to work harder on the think I love.

I recommend you to watch this movie.",Soul

1728,salmatarek-56314,A must watch movie!,9,1 January 2021,"What an incredible movie!!!! Another perfectly made Pixar film. It teaches all of us that sometimes we can get lost in this twirling life as we constantly search for our passion and careers. Sadly though, we actually stop living and enjoying life itself. This movie takes you back on track and teaches you to live in the moment and appreciate all what life gives you.",Soul

1730,danomano-43265,Pixar's best work yet,8,1 January 2021,"When I say I have been waiting for this type of Pixar movie is an understatement. Coming after Onward which felt like Pixar keeping it safe, Soul is a refreshing take on the world and Pixar's most unique work yet. The story is heartwarming and unpredictable. Most reviewers say that the bad thing about this movie is that kids will not enjoy or understand the meaning behind it but I think that is it's strongest feature. This is a movie that you will be thinking about the true meaning for time to come.",Soul
1731,mcdell-46437,Awesome FX,10,28 December 2020,"This movie was not only amazing, the artwork is revolutionary. The detail showed us so much more than other Pixar films. The cast was amazing and then storyline tugged at the heartstrings.",Soul

1734,ardylmz,Inspiring,9,22 January 2021,"One of the most inspiring movies I've ever seen. The subject is unusual for an animation movie but the development of the story is so good that everything feels so natural. This movie makes you consider who you really are and what are you doing with your life. The movie gives you and opportunity to realize and fix the problems in yourself. Besides all of these, the animation technologies are just wonderful and realistic.",Soul
1735,carlosrulestheworld,Good visuals/story missed the mark,6,27 December 2020,"Soul is worth the watch because of the clear, beautiful imagery. The story lags in the middle and misses its mark. I was satisfied with the ending and the characters arc- until a last minute switch deflated the ending for me.",Soul
1736,danielsanzmoreno,Pixar did it again!,9,25 December 2020,"Another exciting movie bringing joy to our lives. That's exactly what the studio has been doing since it began in business, and this project isn't an exception, a story that fills our souls with emotions. Life is completely worth it, as this movie is!

1738,junkyjunkmail,Worst Pixar Movie Ever,1,19 March 2021,"By far the worst Pixar movie, absolutely boring, the kids got up and said they didn't like and had no interest in watching it.",Soul
1739,ppelucca,Pixar's greatest so far!,10,23 January 2021,"It never ceases to amaze me ... pixar can take animation and breath life into storytelling. This animation-film-movie whatever term floats your boat, SPARKS life affirming value into the question of what it means to have a life. I believe anyone could benefit from the storyline. If you liked Pixar's Inside Out, you will love this movie. Not one wasted second of time. Thanks to all- at Pixar, continue the greatness!",Soul
1740,bobsolo-88636,Moved to tears,10,27 December 2020,"Best Pixar film since Wall E, absolute masterpiece.

1742,bradenallan,Masterpiece.,10,27 December 2020,"(Spoiler free but still would watch the movie before reading this anyways) This movie is honestly a masterpiece. It is beautifully animated, the world in its own way comes to life as you follow the main character throughout his journey. The story is an extremely motivating and emotional story in which all the main characters have a motive and are very well explained. I never felt like I was ever lost in the middle of the movie, the pacing was perfect. The story is so good that when walking away from the movie after finishing it, it had me questioning myself, I know I am not alone with this. The concept and execution of the movie is well done, the main thing of the movie is a very cool concept itself that just really works with the tone of the movie itself. This movie is very inspiring, and while many movies have inspired or impacted me, this one is probably at the top. It is a masterpiece.",Soul

1749,Atlantic-guy,One of the best,10,5 January 2021,"""The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves."" This is a quote by Alan Watts, a British writer, which I believe demonstrates both the long and the short versions of the point Soul tries to make , that being said, In my judgment, this animation doesn't promote laziness and in fact, indicates the very fact that if you wish to knuckle down to get what you want then do it.However don't obsess over merely getting to the destination , because It's super easy to miss the beauty of the journey; the journey of life.This is a type of animation that kids enjoy and adults understand. The voice-acting is immaculate. It's loaded with gorgeous shots and scenes. The narrative is gripping and It's got some excellent comedy. Absolutely rewatchable and for sure one of the best animated features of 2020.",Soul
1750,vaderthegamer,An artistic masterpiece,10,26 December 2020,"I felt pixar peaked in the 2000s with movies like wall-e, the incredibles, rattatoui, up etc. But I was wrong. Every now and then, this company hits a home run in the modern era, with coco and inside out. You can add soul to this list.Some say that the movie lacked narative and a proper ending, but it fit with the movie's theme of life can be meaningless if we let it, so we must live every second of it.Every movie has flaws, but if you can make me feel for a blob of pixels on a screen, you know you succeeded.",Soul

This is such a deep movie I cried.",Soul

1758,heba-06125,What is it really to be alive!,9,5 January 2021,"It's never about goals, jobs, expectations or even dreams. It is about living the exact moment as you own the whole world. The title itself ""Soul"" recreates the meaning of fulfilling your soul of what you think is guaranteed. The last scene made me think of the moment when God gives a soul to earth ""the mother"" as a pure gift, to be the road to happiness and finding the meaning in new things.
It's very emotional and yet important movie to watch with an open heart, conceiving countless possibilities.",Soul
1759,finnnosbaum,"Incredible, Incredible, Incredible.",10,26 December 2020,"YOU are Joe.YOU are mistaken if you think this is anything like other Pixar movies, or possibly a worse one because it went straight to Disney+.I'm a 16 year old male, and this is the first movie that's made me bawl since I watched Finding Nemo as a toddler. In other movies, I've had some tears here and there, but no thought or piece of media has moved me like this. I struggle a lot with existentialism and purpose; I'm not the only person I know that would consider myself a heavy thinker. This movie has taken so much pressure off of those thoughts, my future aspirations, and my struggles with self-identity. This movie has turned the saying ""Enjoy the little things in life"" into so much more than a cliche. EVERYONE needs to watch this movie.",Soul
