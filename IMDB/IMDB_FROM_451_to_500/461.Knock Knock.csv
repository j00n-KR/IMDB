0,Leofwine_draca,Roth disappoints again,4,29 January 2018,"KNOCK KNOCK is a typically bad taste offering from horror director Eli Roth, who has singularly failed to capitalise on the promise he showed with the excellent HOSTEL back in 2005. His films ever seen have left me disappointed more or less, and KNOCK KNOCK is no exception. It's a loose remake of the little-known '70s thriller DEATH GAME and a three-hander in which nice guy family man Keanu Reeves is menaced by a couple of sexy but psychotic teenage girls. Don't go in looking for depth here, as you won't find it: this is a film all about sex, violence, and lots of the little bad taste moments that Roth loves. He pushes the boundaries of taste at all times but fails to make a decent film in the process. Poor old Keanu spends his screen time being humiliated while the female stars go way over the top and are just plain irritating for much of the time. The worst thing about this, though, is the anticlimatic ending, where you realise that very little has happened of note overall. And to end things on a social media joke is just stupid.",Knock Knock
1,SnoopyStyle,hot crazy chicks,3,13 July 2016,"Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is home alone after his happy family left for the weekend. He's trying to work when Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) knock on his door. They're lost and soaking wet. He calls Uber for them but the aggressive flirts have sex with him. As he tries to make them leave the next morning, they turn out to be less than stable.The idea of hot crazy chicks as horror villains could be fun. Reeves is playing a relative douche which is hard to root for. The girls are not scary. Their characters border on being comical. They keep threatening as underage but they don't look underage. The first time I took as a comedic hollow threat but it's annoying when it keeps coming back. Eli Roth seems to be going for a different kind of horror. I would be a lot happier if Evan punch out the girls and chop them into pieces. This way is a lazy, silly 'Fatal Attraction'. The part with Louis gets too annoying. Everything is too broad, and too obvious. This is not scary nor thrilling. One could almost see this as camp.",Knock Knock
2,Prismark10,Hard Candy,3,9 June 2016,"Keanu Reeves stars in the remake of 1977 film, Death Game with elements of Funny Games thrown in and maybe having a subtext underneath of the dangers of inviting in foreigners.Reeves plays Evan a happily married architect whose Spanish born wife and kids have gone to the beach for the weekend while he has to stay behind and deal with work commitments in his beautiful house.Pretty soon in heavy rain two nubile young women (Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas) knock on his door, their clothes soaked wet and showing off their bodies. It looks like they have ended up lost looking for a party in the neighbourhood, the gracious Reeves invites them in even offers to dry their clothes but the girls start to make their moves on him offering themselves to him how can he resist even though he does try but, it is like being offered free pizza.Soon the Izzo and de Armas are playing bizarre mind games as they tell him they are underaged and he has committed a crime, they have filmed him having sex with them. This is a sleazy, erotic dark thriller as Reeves becomes desperate. He does not want his wife to find out that he has cheated on her and he does not want to go to jail. The women turn increasingly violent towards him and their behaviour becomes deviant even leading to death.Director Eli Roth might had been aiming for some kind of lurid black comedy about the dangers of marital infidelity but the material is just too ridiculous and their are not many laughs to be had in alleged underaged sex and misandry.",Knock Knock
3,claudio_carvalho,Unfunny Games,3,5 December 2015,"The family man Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is a forty-three year-old architect married with children with the artist Karen Alvarado (Ignacia Allamand). When Karen travels with their children to a house by the beach, Evan stays at home since he is very busy in his work. During the stormy night, two young women knock on his door asking for help since they are lost. Evan invites Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) to come in his comfortable house and asks for a taxi to them. They start a conversation and soon they seduce Evan that has sex with them. On the next morning, Evan finds the girls in the kitchen and realizes that they are deranged punks and they want to punish him for cheating his wife. ""Knock Knock"" is a film with a moralist and feminist violent story. The plot recalls Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" (1997), with the girls trashing Evan's house and torturing him. The story forgets Louis and the conclusion is funny when the boy says that daddy gave a party when he sees the house totally destroyed. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Bata Antes de Entrar"" (""Knock Before Coming in"")",Knock Knock
4,nogodnomasters,DADDY HAD A PARTY,6,30 October 2018,"Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) has an idyllic life being an architect married to an artist (Ignacia Allamand). On Father's Day weekend (and not his birthday) she packs up the kids and goes to the beach so he can work at home alone. This sets up the film for two young ladies to come visit ad become Evan's worst nightmare.I had a flashback to a similar film and couldn't for the life of me think of its name. When I saw that Colleen Camp was in this film, I remembered she was also in that one, playing one of the young girls raising havoc. The 1977 film ""Death Game"" was the basis for this film. In fact I think they should have named Colleen's character Donna (same as in ""Death Game"") instead of Vivian. Eli Roth did a good job in providing work for his wife and Latin American cuties, but he didn't make the film any better.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",Knock Knock
5,kosmasp,Who's there?,6,30 April 2016,"It's Keanu Reeves, revived as John Wick. No wait that's a different movie. But a movie that helped him come back to the sights of different filmmakers and producers no doubt. And maybe something that helped either this movie or him starring in it. There are worse ways and roles a man has to play than being seduced like he is in this movie.But everything comes with a price. And though it is established that he had some issues with being faithful at the beginning, what he has to go through can not be described as learning experience. But how can this all end? I wouldn't say it's too surprising (the alternate ending would have been, though I don't think it would have fitted the mood of the movie), quite the opposite. Whether you like that or not, is up to you as viewer. Also if you want to pass moral judgement on any of the characters involved in this ...",Knock Knock
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Why didn't I believe the bad reviews.,2,12 October 2015,"I read through lots of the reviews, and thought these guys are being harsh, it can't possibly be that bad can it?.....well the answer is yes.In brief, Keanu Reeves plays Evan, an architect and former DJ, seemingly with the perfect life, he's successful, he has a beautiful wife and two kids. On the morning of his birthday his family go off to the seaside leaving him alone. He's hard at work when he gets a knock at the door, two rain soaked teenage girls, claiming they're lost, looking for a family. Reluctantly he takes them in, they flirt with him, and end up seducing him and sleeping with him. Next morning they've trashed the kitchen, and refuse to leave, behaving rather oddly. The girls claim they were under 15, leaving him guilty of rape, he manages to kick them out. Not done with him they later break in and tie him up, and then the real torture starts (more so for the viewer then Keanu.)There are times when the acting becomes rather woeful, the scene with the neighbour, is like something out of a budget horror movie, it was shambolic. The torture game show part too, just horrendous, I mean could he not have overpowered them?Evan says the following 'I'm so f***ing stupid,' he wasn't wrong.There aren't many good points unfortunately, I believe when they thought of this film, someone fantasised about breaking in and seducing Keanu, then made a bad film around the one concept. One of the main problems is that there isn't a single likable character in the film, who really cares what happens to any of them. It's a shame are there was lots of potential.Fair play to Keanu, he's playing a character of 43, I had to google his age, playing this he was fifty, he doesn't even look 40. He's ageing very well, there i've found a positive.The film flopped badly in the UK cinemas. The moral of the story is believe the reviews on IMDb!!",Knock Knock
7,lee_eisenberg,Dear Eli Roth: please stick to collaborations with Quentin Tarantino!,2,21 July 2017,"Before I start the review, I want to address the concept of horror movies. The idea is that they're supposed to scare us. Some are authentically scary (Psycho, The Shining), while most are kind of silly. Guilty pleasures, if you will.But every once in a while there comes along a horror movie that leaves one depressed. Depressed at the knowledge that someone decided to bankroll something so awful. Eli Roth's ""Knock Knock"" is one such movie.I learned of Eli Roth from his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino. Roth directed the Thanksgiving segment of ""Grindhouse"" (Tarantino's collaboration with Robert Rodriguez paying tribute to the B movies of the '70s), and then co-starred in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as the Bear Jew (who bashes in the heads of Nazis). When he does that, the results are masterpieces along the lines of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"". If ""Knock Knock"" is any indication, Roth's own movies are crimes against humanity. The movie itself is one disgusting long exercise in torture porn. Avoid it.",Knock Knock
8,BA_Harrison,Knock Knock is a joke.,1,13 August 2017,"I like Keanu Reeves. He's starred in some of my favourite films (Bill and Ted, The Matrix, The Gift) and, by all accounts, he's a stand up bloke in real life. For those reasons, I'll cut him some slack for his godawful performance in Knock Knock. We all make mistakes.Eli Roth, however, doesn't get off so lightly. He's the biggest hack working in the horror film industry today, his attempts at shock cinema are childish in the extreme, and his braggadocio is thoroughly annoying. Just once I wish he would back up his arrogance with something worthwhile, but, if anything, he gets worse with each film he makes.The atrocious Knock Knock stars Reeves as Evan, a family man who is almost as perfect as the actor in real life: loving husband, doting father, and talented architect. One rainy night, while Evan is home alone hard at work (his wife and kids having gone to the beach for the weekend), there is a knock knock at the door; Evan goes to see who it could be and is greeted by two young women (wearing very little and soaked to the bone), who claim to be lost. A good samaritan, Evan allows the girls, Bel and Genesis (Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo), into his home to dry off and to wait until a taxi arrives; as they pass the time, the young women initiate sexual banter with Evan, eventually seducing the poor man into a wild threesome.What follows is a masterclass in terrible film-making, with clumsy writing (a whole neighbourhood out for the night. Really?) and woeful acting from its three main stars, who seem to be in competition with each other to see who can turn in the worst performance. As the unhinged girls toy with Evan, Roth's script leaves the viewer wandering what the point of the whole exercise is: it's not scary, it's not suspenseful (largely thanks to the terrible acting), and it doesn't work as a morality play, Evan obviously a decent fellow who, in a moment of weakness, understandably crumbles as two hot and eager young fillies soap each other up in the shower before offering themselves to him on a plate (a scene that earns the film at least one point).Roth, either unaware of how dumb his film is or simply not bothered, blunders on regardless, giving us a train wreck of a movie that even he will find hard to beat in terms of sheer crappiness.",Knock Knock
9,michaelRokeefe,Could've been a daydream; nope...nightmare,4,12 March 2019,"Directed and written by Eli Roth, KNOCK KNOCK finds a hapless young man named Evan (Keanu Reeves), becoming a random victim of a home-invasion. Instead of a big bad wolf at the door is a couple of stone-cold foxes. The perfect gentleman helps two storm-worn young women into his home only to be tied and tortured. Woefully violated complete with blackmail photos taken of him, Evan is in the middle of a rapid twisting cat-and-mouse orgy of violence. These two hormone charged lasses, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) are not ladies.",Knock Knock
10,hitchcockthelegend,Just say no!,5,5 April 2016,"Eli Roth directs and co-writes the screenplay with Nicolás López and Guillermo Amoedo. It stars Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. Music is by Manuel Riveiro and cinematography by Antonio Quercia. Reeves plays Evan, a devoted husband and father of two, who while he is left home alone, is visited by two young women soaked and apparently lost. Letting them in to his home as an act of kindness, things quickly spiral out of control.You do wonder if Eli Roth sits at home looking at the reaction to his movie and giggles like a schoolboy. It's invariably a distinctly average film, but it does get a reaction from the audience, something which Roth is gleefully aware of. Pic is actually a remake of Peter S. Traynor's 1977 movie, Death Game, which starred Sondra Locke and Colleeen Camp, both of whom lend their names to production for this release.At times it feels like we are part of one of Roth's wet dreams, or conversely one of his sick jokes. Yet as the cast struggle to instill acting gravitas (the girls actually become more annoying than frightening), and Roth chooses psychological themes over blood and guts, there's a deft whiff of a moral fable hanging in the air. While also of note is the nods to film noir, both in story and visuals. It isn't enough to save the piece, but it's interesting enough as an aside to the chaos inside the house. 5/10",Knock Knock
11,Hey_Sweden,"A garbage movie, but I confess it did make me laugh.",6,12 June 2020,"A remake of a 1977 cult film called ""Death Game"", ""Knock Knock"" follows the same basic premise. A husband / father (Keanu Reeves), alone for the weekend, actually answers his door in the wee hours of the morning, giving shelter to two attractive ladies (Lorenza Izzo, Ana de Armas) who were supposedly on their way to a party. Then the fun-loving babes simply refuse to leave, openly seduce Keanu into an act of indiscretion, and proceed to make a shambles of his life.At the very least, ""Knock Knock"" offers two high-spirited performances by Izzo (married to co-writer / co-producer / director Eli Roth at the time) and de Armas, who do look like they're having fun. The second half of the movie sees the two of them turn Keanu's whole existence into a twisted nightmare. As part of their game, they aim to ""punish"" him for being a failure as a husband and father. They eat much of his food, total his house, cause the death of a supporting character, etc., etc. There's just no end to their shenanigans.Keanu actually goes for broke for once, seeming to channel his inner Nicolas Cage, giving a performance that is pretty damn funny in its ridiculousness. It's not really a ""good"" acting job, but it does entertain. This viewer would agree with some that have seen this that his ""free pizza"" speech is a highlight.As dark comedies go, this is pretty trashy stuff, but it was good for some amusement for yours truly. Therefore, I can't really hate it as some viewers do.Colleen Camp and Sondra Locke, who starred in ""Death Game"" 38 years previous, are among the producers and executive producers here; Camp also appears briefly.Six out of 10.",Knock Knock

13,FlashCallahan,I think dad had a party........,6,12 October 2015,"Evan seems like the perfect guy. He's an architect, lives in a beautiful California home, has two kids and a lovely talented wife. One afternoon, the wife and kids go to the beach but Evan has to stay home and work. It's raining, he's alone, listening to music, and there's a knock at the door. Two beautiful young girls, are standing in the cold. They're drenched, lost and just want to come in to dry off and use the phone.......He then makes a choice that will bring his idyllic life crashing down....A remake of the little known film Death Game (which starred Colleen Camp, hence the weird cameo from her) which wasn't very good to begin with, Knock Knock should have been a taut, tense thriller, with Roth hopefully bringing back that nasty humour he had in Cabin Fever.But after a quite good first act, setting up Reeves paranoia, the film just goes way over the top with the girls antics, trashing of the house, and narratively speaking, it's as messy as the house ends up toward the end.Which is one hell of a shame, as the film had so much potential, the house is beautiful, and as one of the characters says to Reeves toward the middle of the second act, his performance was pretty good.Then the girls return.It's well known that Reeves is a star, a bona fide movie star, but it's also well known that he isn't the best actor in the world, and when he is in terrorised mode in this, it's some of the worst acting the mans ever done, it's almost as if the films trying to parody itself, but the girls are just too bonkers for the film to be self referential.And I'm sorry if I have offended any fans of Reeves, I like the films he's in, he made films like Speed, The Matrix, John Wick, and even Johnny Mnemonic as iconic as they are today (the last one for different reasons). But he's not a thespian of Branagh standards.So it starts off really well, but instead of focusing on the threats of prison, and Evans fear of being known as an offender of sorts, Roth goes for the girls in skimpy clothing acting mad for the last twenty minutes, which ruins the impressive build up.Great references to Fight Club though.",Knock Knock
14,gradyharp,"'This is what happens when you break the rules of the game, Evan. We have to punish you!'",2,19 June 2016,"Knock Knock: Seducción Fatal is the full title of this little film written for the screen by Eli Roth, Nicolás López, Guillermo Amoedo based on a story by Anthony Overman and Michael Ronald; Eli Roth directs. Five years ago this film would have been one of the many porn hours on late night television – and I suppose that is a comment on how far we have become relaxed in our standards of language (more F bombs is this 'story' than any film in recent history) and in your face sexuality on the screen. There is most assuredly an audience for this (Keanu Reeves fans who will watch anything he is in, people hungry for young naked women with fine bodies, midnight home intruder tales, etc), so why did it flop when released? A question worth investigating..The preponderance of Latino actors and crew may be due to the fact that it was filmed in Chile.The 'story': 'When a devoted husband and father Evan (Keanu Reeves) is left home alone for the weekend (his artist wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and two children head for the beach on Father's Day!), two stranded young women Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) unexpectedly knock on his door for help. What starts out as a kind gesture results in a dangerous seduction and a deadly game of cat and mouse. Evan falls into temptation and the seductresses wreak havoc upon his life, turning a married man's dark fantasy into his worst nightmare.'If you really want to know the details of what happens, watch the film – or not. It is an assault on the ears and eyes – but is fairly in keeping with today's relaxed sexual mores. Grady Harp, June 16",Knock Knock
15,trashgang,nothing to offer,4,3 November 2015,"Eli Roth, he can confuse me big times sometimes. Then he delivers ultra gore, The Green Inferno (2015), and on the other hand he delivers...Knock Knock. I didn't watch any trailers so I didn't know what to expect. Also it was well promoted and even now stills are popping up on our telee on daily base. The fact that Keanu Reeves was in the lead did me finally pick this up after seen John Wick (2014) which I found great in his performance and story. You can see it coming, I should never had opened that door to go see Knock Knock. It's over 90 minutes of the same again and again. It do build up rather good but once the girls enter the house it's downhill. Using explicit words doesn't make a movie. Even as not that much was explained it's easy to understand that the two girls are doing it for fun. Did ring a bell, A Clockwork Orange (1971) also did a home invasion like so many other flicks like The Strangers (2008) which did gave me the goosebumps. This here wasn't intend to give you the creeps but for an Eli Roth flick I found it rather a weak flick. You can see it coming from miles that the threesome is on the way and it does, maybe for many that will be the moment of the flick itself because it's juggtime. Could have so many potential but I found it too much of the same again and again. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 1/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",Knock Knock
16,deloudelouvain,Not worth watching,5,1 February 2016,"I honestly expected a lot more from this movie. I normally do like movies with Keanu Reeves but this one is for sure not one of his better ones. He acts okay and tries to save the movie but it was just not enough. The other two main actresses Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas drag the movie down. I thought they were annoying, and not only because of their characters. The story itself is quite boring and leaves you with unanswered questions and that I do not like. It's also categorized as a horror movie and I absolutely don't get why. You could maybe call it a thriller, even though you won't be thrilling a lot, but certainly not a horror movie. Knock Knock is just a disappointing movie if you ask me.",Knock Knock
17,christopher-underwood,a well made and provocative film,6,16 January 2017,"Having seen some of the very many overexcited reviews/rants on this film, a couple of things first, Reeves, who I don't particularly like is fine in this and Roth has directed it brilliantly. It may be slightly overlong but that's not the problem. The problem and what I would really like to know the answer to is what was Roth's point. He was involved in the writing and producing as well as the directing so it is fair to aim this his way. The main thrust is that within the film Reeve's participation in the girls' seduction means he doesn't really love his family and deserves all he gets for his 'violation'. This seems so ludicrous that another possibility appears possible and that is that Roth has contrived this piece to illustrate how easy it is these days for everything to appear to be the guy's fault when often it is not. Recent overdue protection for raped women and abused children could be faulted for bringing about a situation where women can exploit matters. But why would they? Much derision over the film and more surprisingly a large number who find it hilarious. I didn't smile too often, but it remains a well made and provocative film. Just difficult to enjoy.",Knock Knock
18,MovieAddict2016,One of the worst films of the year.,1,17 October 2015,"A film like Knock Knock defensively positions itself as a comedy to cushion against any criticisms. If someone is offended or disgusted by the subject matter, the film's fans can simply claim that it is in on the joke of it all, and that that's ""the point.""Some ""meta-bad"" films earn this cushion. Last year's The Guest, starring Dan Stevens, would have been quite poor if sold earnestly, but it had a devilish sense of humour about itself, and paid homage to '80s films with a wink and a nod without just becoming a giant piece of garbage.Knock Knock is a giant piece of garbage. A giant piece of garbage made by a man who has little to no evidence of talent. I've always felt that Eli Roth looked extremely creepy, something Tarantino capitalized upon by casting him as a sociopath in Inglourious Basterds. It's not fair to judge someone's personality or self-merit based upon their looks. However, it's fairer to judge someone based upon their art, and Roth's -- consumed with body-horror, torture porn (remember he helped jumpstart the craze with Hostel), and grimy sexual antics -- seems to paint a disturbing portrait indeed. The fact that he cast his considerably younger wife in the lead role of this film, and then put her name above the title next to Keanu Reeves, is Hollywood nepotism at its finest. As a critic, I try to remain objective, and there are truly few actors or filmmakers I just downright dislike; there are some whose personal lives may disappoint me (e.g. Polanski), but I separate the art from the artist. But Roth's art is vile, and goes hand-in-hand with my perspective of him as someone who gets off on all this filth. I don't think there's ever been any kind of true social or political commentary to his work -- which the best gross-out horror films tend to have, including the film he attempts to shamelessly rip off here, Funny Games.No, Roth gets his kicks from getting his wife naked on camera, having Keanu Reeves -- who looks regretful in every scene, and not because he's in character -- bullied, bloodied, raped and tortured. The dialogue is terrible, the cinematography is shoddy (it basically went straight to video, which is what you'd gather from the way it's shot), the story is stupid which would be OK if the film had something clever to say, but instead Roth presents this all in a transparent attempt to shock and outrage while being too lazy to have any commitment to the material, instead hiding behind the ""irony"" angle and playing it out as a borderline farce.Reeves, who gained so much goodwill with last year's John Wick, gives one of his worst performances here; Roth's wife, whose name I do not recall and don't care to, is a coarse screen presence; and Ana de Armas just seems like she's being exploited here.I only gave this a chance because of Reeves, but I should have known better when I saw Roth's name attached. It is a great mystery as to why this man continues to have a film career.",Knock Knock
19,KineticSeoul,"Well it was at least amusing to a degree, despite it's stupidity",5,10 October 2015,"So the main reason why I wanted to check this movie out was because it has Keanu Reeves in it. One of the most liked bad actor in the business. Despite the premise not being all that original, I wanted to see how Keanu would play the role of the guy getting tormented. Watching this movie was like watching ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"". Except instead of the 2 girl that knock on the door of a stranger getting tortured, it's the other way around where the roles are reversed. And reminded me of the movie ""Hard Candy"" except nowhere near as engraving. This is another exploitation by Eli Roth, that is more about the amusement factor over intense suspense factor. For a Eli Roth movie, surprisingly it's not as brutal or gruesome as I thought it would be. As a matter of fact there really isn't much blood in this movie. Sure, there is elements of human nature that did get slightly interesting, but it contradicts itself quite a bit. This movie is mostly a amusing silly parody. Especially Keanu Reeves who actually looked like he was trying to parody himself in a movie he is in. This is a pretty bad movie, not awful but a ridiculously bad movie. And I think that was the intention of Eli Roth, to make a bad movie that could become a cult flick. I give this movie a 5/10.5/10",Knock Knock
20,Hellmant,Not nearly as memorable as Roth's other (more grisly) horror flicks!,8,19 October 2015,"'KNOCK KNOCK': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new 'home invasion' torture porn flick, from director Eli Roth. It tells the story of a happily married architect; who's left home alone for the weekend, while his family is on vacation, and is visited by two seductive young women. He later learns that they want sex, as well as a lot more. The movie is a remake, of the 1977 B- movie thriller 'DEATH GAME' (written by Anthony Overman and Michael Ronald Ross); this updated screenplay was written by Roth, Guillermo Amoedo and Nicolás López (the same team that also wrote the recent slasher flicks 'AFTER SHOCK' and 'THE GREEN INFERNO'). The film stars Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo (Roth's wife) and Ana de Armas. It's well made, but not nearly as memorable as Roth's other (more grisly) horror flicks!Evan Webber (Reeves) is home alone for Father's Day weekend. His wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand), and children, went to the beach; for a planned family vacation. Evan stayed home to nurse an injured shoulder, and catch-up on work. While working, and smoking a little weed, he gets an unexpected visit; from two much younger women, named Genesis (Izzo) and Bel (Armas). The girls have been out in the rain, for apparently quite a while, looking for a party. Evan lets them come in and dry off; as he also calls them a cab. When the two women attempt to seduce Evan, he has a very hard time resisting; and things only get worse from there.I've never seen 'DEATH GAME'; the two lead actresses from it (Colleen Camp and Sandra Locke), both served as producers on this remake (Camp also plays a small part in this film). I don't know how 'KNOCK KNOCK' compares to it; but I can say, I don't like this film as much as Roth's others. It's nice to see him doing something slightly different though; this is an erotic thriller, with very little violence (Roth's other movies are packed with excessive gore). It also doesn't seem nearly as intentionally humorous, as Roth's other (more gory) features. The femdom aspect of it, is intriguing though; and it's nice to see two psycho female villains (rather then a male one). The acting is decent enough, the story is interesting and Roth's directing is good; the film just isn't that funny, or overly disturbing (compared to Roth's other movies).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rHh87mlE5WQ",Knock Knock
21,thesar-2,Nobody's Homefor Unfunny Games,3,28 November 2015,"I will give this movie one huge kudosno spoilers, but the LIKE in the ending made me crack up to the point I was finally enjoying this viewing.In the end. Took that long.But, to start from the beginning, let's imagine a world where entire neighborhoods are on holiday forthe Father's Day weekend. I had absolutely no idea that stalkers who focused on one family man were lucky enough to have an isolated target in the middle of a grand suburb. I'm getting ahead of myself. Whatever redemption Keanu Reeves, one of the worst actors in the history of cinema, created for himself in the awesome John Wick-flick was wasted here. At least, he knew how to backtrack to what made him famous.It's the story of two increasingly annoying party girls who, ah-hem, knock-knock on this father's house one father's day weekend when he's alone. This leads to that, that leads to a fatal attraction. I know the girls are supposed to be pretty and willing, but damn, they are annoying as fvck from minute one. We've seen all this before, but this time they never convinced that he was a bad man that cheats on his wife with these two valley tramps. Personally, I wouldn't have answered the door in the first place. This would be the simplest ""How This Should've Ended"" video. But, because this dad's a moron, he continuously allows these scummy chicks to dominate and torture him. I'm assuming at some point, lost-along-the-way-filmmaker Eli Roth, wants us to side with the Satan Spawn Sluts and say he's a bad man for cheating. Nope. They're simply one step below Eve and any rational wife would've forgiven him long before she takes a knife to their throats.I was hoping this movie wouldn't have made me mad (with all the choices the dad makes and I wouldn't have made one of them,) but damn, it was so irritating on how many plot holes this had and how many better decisions could've been made. Not to mention, the terribly obvious foreshadowing and that Reeves did one of his worst performances to date immediately after his strong action film, John Wick. Tisk.Don't get me wrong, I like sex, as well, but I'm more suspicious and weary of my partners than someone that accepts it from two idiots that ""happen to come in from the rain.""Director Eli Roth, whatever you had before this and the equally terrible and preceding The Green Infernoit's gone.

22,FeastMode,my notes,2,1 July 2019,"This movie is absolutely terrible. laughably awful. literally. i was laughing at so many parts that weren't supposed to be funny. at certain points i thought it was trying to be a B-movie, but then it would try to get serious. most of this movie made no sense. but the worst part about it is the acting job by keanu reaves. it is abundantly clear that he can't act at all. he was lucky to get a bunch of roles without any scenes that required him to show emotions, like the matrix. there were times he was trying to cry but couldn't and just ended up moaning and wailing. there were a bunch of outbursts that made me laugh so hard. just to be clear, i did not hate this movie experience. it was actually pretty enjoyable. so bad, it's good.

i did like how dark of a twist this movie took, even though it really didn't seem to make sense. how crazy the girls got and how they ended up screwing his life up so bad was kinda cool in a dark way.",Knock Knock
23,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A promising opening descends into a gratuitous, stupid mess",4,27 April 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Architect Evan (Keanu Reeves) lives in a nice, swanky house with his wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and their two young boys. One weekend, Karen takes the boys away with her, leaving Evan on his own. He gets a surprise one night when two young women, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) knock on his door, claiming to have broken down and in need of a shower and a taxi. Initially pleasant, after luring Evan into a night of soaring passion, they then refuse to leave and subject him to a relentless, psychopathic barrage of violence and humiliation.Playing like a variation on The Human Centipede set-up (and, by the end, astonishingly much more horrible than that film), despite not having much opening development between the main character and his loved ones, Knock Knock does manage to generate an interesting premise for the beginning. As soon as the girls arrive, knowing that things are going to take a sinister turn, it's intriguing to see just how this will play out and why. But after that, it just goes to pot and ends up leaving a really nasty taste in the mouth.With elements of Phone Booth and Hard Candy chucked in to the plot, this skirts around the issue of young girls looking older than they are, and suckering older guys into going with them, an issue that's been playing in the media lately. But rather than using this as a plot device for some deep thought, it just degenerates into a relentlessly gratuitous and nasty piece of work, like a long winded, less grounded version of the superior British flick Cherry Tree Lane. Izzo and de Amis are a pair of seriously deranged, psychotic devil women, who just serve to distract from Reeves, who is as wooden as ever.By the end, it's just started to become annoying and stupid, with only the theme from the end of Fight Club playing over the end credits to remind you of something better. You think of those two girls up the north of England who battered that woman to death in her house, and when you're expected to be entertained by something as dispiriting as this, it puts things in perspective. **",Knock Knock

Now the women won't leave, and Evan is forced to atone for his sins. There have been a ton of home invasion movies like this one, usually the same thing happens in all of them. This one is different, in a good way. Part Fatal Attraction, part Hard Candy, and all tense and creepy. The most disturbing part of this movie is that it isn't that unbelievable. Nothing is really over the top or cheesyuntil the end. This is more psychological than straight horror, but the pacing and the events really work well together and I found myself really enjoying this movie quite a bit.

29,Reno-Rangan,Be cautious of the two slices of the free pizza delivered to your doorstep.,5,14 November 2015,"Another flick that sets in an isolated place with the limited cast. A low budget film, which was a remake of the 'Death Game'. After playing a strong character in his previous film, Keanu Reeves is back exactly opposite to that one. Yep, remember what happened to the two men who break-in into his house in 'John Wick', but here it is like what if he's not able to handle them or to do anything about it kind of Circumstance.He played a normal family guy, a father of two children with a beautiful wife and a big house. The trailer itself revealed half of what the movie's. But the rest of the film is not bad at all, and that does not count as I'm praising it. The movie was average because of the writing was too loose. Not only predictable, but aimlessly moved and the motives were never explained. So the mystery remains mystery.It was one of those films that leaves behind us to suspect the possibilities. A broad open for a sequel, but likely there's very less chance for another film. The girls were so good looking and performed well. The theme aimed for erotic-crime-thriller, but did it achieved? I don't know, the original was released in the 70s, which might have been too sexy for that time, but in the present world, it is not that special or effective, just like 'I Spit on Your Grave'. You could watch it to enjoy your moment, but it would be a cinematically impressive with the great writings, actings, with twists and turns and all.5/10",Knock Knock

At this time two strange and beautiful young women knock on his door for help.When I watched the trailer of this movie my expectations were not so high but I wanted to watch something more interesting than this. The interpretation of Keanu Reeves who played as Evan in this movie was not the best and I believe he did not reach his true potential. That happened of course not only because of the plot of the movie but also because of the cast of it. The direction of the movie which made by Eli Roth was not something extraordinary because there is not something more to show.Finally I have to admit that I expected something better from this movie and of course from Keanu Reeves.

31,zkonedog,Wish It Would Have Been Taken Seriously,3,28 February 2017,"""Knock Knock"" isn't a great movie. It isn't even a good movie. However, perhaps the most disappointing thing about this entire experience is that it is filled with enough interesting themes that it truly could have been great if given the chance.For a basic plot summary, ""Knock Knock"" tells the story of husband and father Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves). Evan is married to beautiful wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and has two wonderful children (played by Dan Bailey and Megan Bailey). One weekend, Mom and the kids head to the beach house in order to leave Dad to his architecture work. Just as he is getting into it, however, there is a knock at the door. Standing outside in the rain are two of the most beautiful young women (girls?) one could ever see--Genesis (Lorenza Izza) & Bel (Ana de Armas). At first, they seem like two innocent friends needing a bit of help on a stormy night. What Evan slowly begins to discover, however, is that the pair isn't nearly as innocent as they seem.The obvious problem with this movie is that director Eli Roth either doesn't know how to make a serious movie, or doesn't care to partake in that particular activity. I was not familiar with him before this film, but a quick check of his previous works turns up almost exclusively this kind of dark, grisly fare. So, this movie was going to be done in a certain style (half shock, half parody) with him at the helm.Sadly, this film had so much more to offer had it been taken seriously. I don't care if you are a male or a female watching (although I think it will have a bigger effect on males), there are times during this viewing experience where you will be thinking about issues of morality and infidelity. What??!! In a horror movie?! Yep. That is why ""Knock Knock"" can legitimately be intriguing at times. It really plays off the red-blooded male fantasy scenario of ""two young hot chicks"" in an environment where ""no one would find out"" in terms of promiscuity. Those themes may be uncomfortable to many viewers, but they are real and true for most people, and thus great fodder for the big screen. It's just that director Roth uses those themes only to turn the rest of the movie into a farce.It also doesn't help that Reeves doesn't quite seem like the right leading man for this role. Nothing against Keanu personally, but I wish that a different choice would have been made. Maybe a guy who would really make me believe that he both loved his family AND could get sucked into a one-night-stand sexual encounter. Reeves couldn't pull that off here. His two female co-stars are very convincing (not to mention incredibly sexy, which in a movie like this is also important to the storyline, not strictly eye candy), and are great at reveling in their craziness. I just wish (minor spoiler alert!) that they weren't written as ""pathologically crazy"" and rather would have had a more serious tone to work with.So, to me ""Knock Knock"" is first and foremost a wasted opportunity. It has the ghost of some great themes, but due to direction/style it never really explores those areas to the fullest. Instead, it almost makes a mockery of them instead, using shock value instead of real emotions to get the point across. I'd give this film 2.5 stars as an exact rating, but it was just too disappointing to give it anything more.",Knock Knock
32,Floated2,Full of surprises,7,30 December 2020,This film's purpose is clear what its intention are meant to be. There seem to be a large amount of unnecessary negative reviews and low rated scores. However this film was as expected if not slightly better.This isn't anything Oscars intended but is quite an enjoyable invasion torture type thriller. There are some predictable moments but things which still keep you in your feet waiting for what next to occur. The three leads all do good work but this film seems lower than what Keanu Reeves would do. Preferably fur a lesser known actor. Knock Knock came out after the first John Wick but have not looked up how long this film was filmed in advance.It somewhat ends abruptly and surely could have ended differently but it was the right ending (letting the girls leave freely without getting caught/dead/arrested). This ending typically wouldn't occur in more mainstream films as most writers and studios want to secure a more happy ended.,Knock Knock
33,leonblackwood,Awful acting from Reeves and a terrible script. 2/10,2,25 October 2015,"Review: I really didn't enjoy this film! Keanu Reeves acting was awful and his constant whining got on my nerves. The girls were also nuts and they seemed to go a bit overboard at times, (understatement). Anyway, Reeves plays Evan Webber, whose a happy family man with 2 kids, a beautiful wife and a impressive house. While his wife takes there kids for a short break, Evan decides to stay at home because he has to catch up with his work. Whilst designing on his computer at home alone, 2 girls turn up on his doorstep, in the pouring rain and they ask him if they can use his Internet to find the address for a party in the area. The somewhat puzzled Evan, invites them in and he makes them feel comfortable by giving them dry clothes while he dries there wet ones. From there I would have thought something suspect was happening! Anyway, after loads of flirting from the girls, they finally get down to business (wink wink) and when he wakes up in the morning he realises that the girls have taken over his house. Like most men, he regrets the sexual acts that he performed with the girls the night before, so he quickly drops them home and he cleans up the mess that they let behind. The crazy girls then go back to his house and completely destroy everything whilst tying him up. They tell him that they were underage so he's unable to call the police and they threaten to tell his wife about what he's done. Now, if these girls have done this type of thing before, how the hell have they got away with it? I must admit, Reeves should have used his head by physically putting them in the cab but he was thinking with the wrong head. The thing that made me cringe the most, had to be his acting. Right from the beginning when he was playing a family man, it just didn't seem natural and his weird outbursts made it even worse. Also, when he was given the chance to hide, why didn't he pick up the phone and call the cops outside? Anyway, I won't carry on slating the script because it's holier than a vicar. The two girls played there part well and I really didn't know what they were going to do next but the overall movie was pretty bad. Disappointing!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Eli Roth who teamed up with Quentin Tarantino to make Inglorious Basterds, Cabin Fever, Hostel I & II, Grindhouse and the Green Inferno. He's also had a successful acting career in movies like Jurassic Park: The Lost World, Hostel, Southland Tales, Death Proof, Rock of Ages and the disappointing Man with the Iron Fists so he had enough experience to correct the awful script in this movie. It's not very often that a Keanu Reeves movie makes such a low amount of money at the box office but after watching it, I can completely understand why. He should just stick to action movies because he made a right mess of Bram Stokers: Dracula, with that weird accent and annoying puzzled look on his face throughout the movie. Budget: $3million Worldwide Gross: $2.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mystery/thrillers starring Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. 2/10",Knock Knock
34,Ed-Shullivan,Honey ... I'm Home !,6,14 June 2018,"This would be a husband and fathers worse nightmare. Is Evan (Keanu Reeves) responsible for the predicament he got himself into? You bet your a## he is. Evan is an architect who is happily married to a successful sculpture artist named Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and admittingly they have been going through a dry spell in their boudoir. So when Karen and the two kids go away for the weekend to a cottage without their daddy/husband so that Evan can finish a big job at home that he has been working on, the family all are in a good place.Then there is that innocent knock on the door later in the evening where Evan is faced with two attractive nubile and very wet and hot looking young ladies who just want to get out of the pouring rain and use Evan's home phone so that they can get to the party that they have somehow got lost and instead landed on Evan's front doorstep.A warm smile and handshake introduction, leads the ladies into a few giggles and then before Evan knows it he is in the shower with the two ladies getting his stick licked and just like Samson who loses his strength when he gets his long hair cut so does Evan after the ladies whack him over the head, tie him up, and ironically cut his hair as well.This is a remake of the 1977 film Death Game that originally starred Sondra Locke, Colleen Camp, and their victim was Seymour Cassel. In fact Colleen Camp reappears in this remake half way into the film as she plays the older, frumpier masseuse who shows up to give Evan a massage but she is quickly turned around by the two younger and aggressive women Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas). Bell displays some really bad memories with her ""daddy issues"" as she coyly plays with Evan's head. She actually plays with both of Evan's two heads if you get my drift.After terrorizing Evan in his own home, destroying his neat and tidy home from top to bottom as he remains tied up, and then assaulting an employee of Karen's who dropped by to pick up one of Karen's sculpture, we the audience wonder what will happen when Karen and her two children return home form the cottage.

36,videorama-759-859391,"Hard Candy, but an out there, strange, and different candy",5,5 November 2015,"Knock Knock is a film that truly had, ""Are you f..king kidding me moments?."" On the whole, I was expecting a much bigger picture, as in terms of plot. I saw much wanted to know, why these two sexy honeys were terrorizing our poor. overacting thespian, Keanu, where always towards the end, I wanted to smash the screen. For part we believe, while those girls are theatrically playing their torture game show, for Keanu, a much an unwilling participant, is to do with Evan's (Keanu) predatory acts of past, that he is a pedophile, and this movie starts to become a another Hard Candy, amped up with vengeance, where it looks like they've even borrowed the same house, from that 2006 movie. But that motive was quashed. The reason is simply, they are two hot psycho bi..hes who just want to get off, where in one mind, after seeing this, I thought, well, hey that's different, where the other I was kind of disappointed as in that shot down motive. Regardless, Roth manages to still induce a nasty aura of moments, into the scenes, by camera work, or what's happening, in the story itself, which we know is true Roth. Honestly though, he puts too much into it, with sudden, impulsive touches, where he's trying too hard, but that's how our likable over enthusiastic director is. Don't forget, he gave us that wonderful horror shocker masterpiece, Hostel. Reeve's acting truly has laughable moments, and there's a few, where now I can really see why he sucks as an actor, while also being voted worst actor, in the top ten, but the character is there though. He just doesn't show a range of emotions to it, like he should, or isn't very changeable, when seeing him in a few other flicks, as though he's winging it. A corpulent Colleen Camp, also overacting, appears briefly, playing a friend of the wife's, providing just another laughable ""are you kidding moment?"". Again ref: Hard Candy, neighbor scene. The girls are hot (especially Belle) and funny too sometimes. Take Knock Knock for what it is, certainly something different, but also quite a stupid movie to behold. Sorry Eli.",Knock Knock

38,jtindahouse,Roth's class shines through,8,13 October 2015,"Eli Roth is one of the best filmmakers working today. He's notably a member of the ""Splat Pack"" - a group of filmmakers notorious for the overly violent and explicit style of their films. 'Knock Knock' is quite unlike anything Roth has done up to this point though and it caught me quite off guard. This time around he's gone for a more thought-provoking style, and whilst it's far from perfect, it contains a uniqueness that all his films have and which brings an added layer of quality to the story.Roth has an ability, possibly superior to any other current director in the horror genre, to build tremendous characters. One of his earlier films 'Hostel' is known as one of the most brutal, hard to watch films ever created. However what people rarely mention about that film is that nearly the entire first half is taken up purely with character development. He takes the extra time to make us care for the characters so that later on when they meet their fates it has that much more effect on the audience. 'Knock Knock' has that same endless patience for the first half, and whilst it is undoubtedly a very different film to 'Hostel', the same affect is utilised. This is a very similar film to 'Funny Games'. It catches you off guard with with its almost complete lack of motivation. Is it more disturbing to know why someone is ruining your life, or to have no idea whatsoever? Probably the latter. It's not a perfect film. The ending wasn't as cleanly done and memorable as we are perhaps used to from Roth films. The ethics behind the girls actions are questionable but they're a good conversation starter so that probably remains a good thing. Keanu Reeves in the main role actually impressed me. He plays ""likeable"" just so well that he's ideally suited to a role like this. Overall a good film but I hope Roth keeps churning out out-and-out horror films because he's just so damn good at them.",Knock Knock

He plays a husband and a father who has to stay home and work on father's day when two hot young chicks come to his door and persuaded him to commit the ultimate male fantasy, that of course turns into his worse nightmare.The movie goes very extreme in the consequences of being accountable for your actions and leaves you with this incredible ""WTF"" taste in your mouth that truly messes with your head.Elit Roth's tendency to be very over the top and campy with writing and directing seems to work best when he's being less gory and just destructive with his form of Torture. The movie beats you over the head with it's dumb dialog which adds to the camp and only makes it more amusing, which I'm sure was the point.Plus, Neo himself was most excellent in this flick. I don't think I've ever seen Reeves act so lively in a film in a long time. He's usually so dry, but he really got into the spirit of the movie. Most Non heinous.This movie was worth seeing just for the sheer ludicrousness of the whole set-up. You won't be able not to enjoy yourself.",Knock Knock
40,stevendbeard,Stretches Believability Just a Tad,6,13 October 2015,"I saw ""Knock Knock"", starring Keanu Reeves-John Wick, The Matrix movies; Lorenza Izzo-The Green Inferno, Aftershock; Ana de Armas-Faraday, Blind Alley and Ignacia Allamand-The Green Inferno, Aftershock.This movie is directed by Eli Roth-The Green Inferno, Hostel 1&2, Cabin Fever-and based on a 1977 movie called 'Death Game'. Keanu plays an architect married to Ignacia, an artist, and they have two lovely children. Ignacia and the kids are going away to the beach for the weekend, leaving Keanu alone at home to work. That night, it starts raining pretty heavily and Keanu hears a knock at his door. When he opens the door, he sees Lorenza and Ana, dripping wet. They tell him that they were going to a party but got the wrong address, lucky Keanu, and ask to use his phone; theirs are wet or have dead batteries-does it really matter? Anyway, after Keanu calls for a cab, which will take 45 minutes in this downpour, the blonde and brunette soaked girls ask if they could dry their cloths in Keanu's dryer-they don't want to go to their party all wet, now, do they? While sitting in the robes that Keanu furnished them, they start talking about jobs-they say they are stewardess-and sex-they enjoy it with no strings attached. Next thing you know, the girls start coming on to Keanu and of course, he tells them that he is a happily married man but eventually, he gives in. He has sex with both of them-he is only human. The next morning, they are still there. He offers to take them home and after some coaxing, they let him and he thinks it's all over. But, it's not. They come back, knock him unconscious and tie him up. Then, the fun begins. They threaten to tell his wife about what he did-they claim they are under aged-and they tear up the house and then threaten to even kill him. I guess the lesson to be learned here is to not mess around on your spouse, no matter how tempting it might appear to be. I can see why this movie is in limited release; some of the situations were stretching believability a little. I mean, come on, Keanu was in the Matrix! He knows how to fight. He could have taken these two girls, easily. But of course, then you wouldn't have a movie. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.

But if you're going to see this movie anyway, then at least you can be forewarned.The tragic thing is...this was almost an amazing movie. A real 10 out of 10 if you like to have your raw nerves played like a mandolin.This thriller is SO uncomfortable. From its first, cute little family scenes which are sweet without being sickly, the build up after meet the antagonists and then the 2nd act where hell just breaks loose...we are dealing with both bodily threat and being confronted with losing our perfect lives and dealing with our own imperfection of people to be punished as once for our charity and our vulnerability to unlikely temptation.I so wish things were different and I could recommend this movie the way its style and substance deserve to be.But then the ending....THAT ENDING!!!!!!!Bad movies with bad endings are ten a penny. I don't get mad at them. The writer tried their best, I view it, I review it, I critique it and we both move on, no hard feelings.But the issue here was not that it was too happy, or not happy enough or that it was absurd, over complicated, simplistic or inconsistent. When you invest SO much emotion in a character, a good guy, someone who is pleasant and likeable without being a mary sue and who also shows human flaws like the rest of us getting dragged through figurative hell...you need some type of closure.Now in this movie you KNOW who the good guys are. You KNOW who the bad guys are the second you see them. And that's fine. It's that kind of movie. Some movies gain a lot from keeping that ambiguous and pulling the rug from under is at the last moment. It can be spectacular .But this movie is not one of those. This is a battle between an embodiment of good and embodiments of evil. This is its set up. We see it coming for miles. We are able to masochistically sit through this torture porn (and I mean that in a the best possible way for 99% of its run time) to finally see how we're going to finally over come this.And then the ending comes...Well, I'm not going to spoil it but ""insulted"" is too mild a term. ""Disappointed"" does not do it justice. I do not like it when people use this word as lightly as they do but it felt trolled by this ending.If it had just been a bad movie, ironically, I wouldn't have felt so scathed. It could not have been contrived to be more insulting to the viewer. It's like Eli Roth appeared on screen and said ""thank you for taking the time to view my work.

43,sauravjoshi85,Another crap from the Universe of Eli Roth.,2,7 June 2021,"Knock Knock is an erotic thriller movie directed by Eli Roth and stars Keanu Reeves, Ana de Armas, Lorenzo Izzo and Aaron Burns.I have been following and watching the movies directed by Eli Roth and barring his very few movies most of his movies are pointless, senseless and crap including this movie.I came to watch this movie only for Keanu Reeves and to be honest for me this movie is disappointing, unsettling and disgusting not only as a viewer but also as a father and as a husband after seeing the innocent and loving father's life getting destroyed and that too just for the sake of fun of two psycho immature girls. This movie is a very bad portrayal of women empowerment. The movie serves no sense for the brutality and torture suffered by the father.There is no plot or storyline in the movie and was just made to make sure the viewers gets suffered and annoyed with this torture of 1 hour 39 minutes.Acting is decent but still I am not been able to understand why Keanu Reeves chose to work in this movie. Ana de Armas and Lorenzo Izzo were effective in generating lots of hatred for themselves in the movie.The screenplay of the movie is average and at some point of time you'll start feeling to get the movie fast forwarded as it's very difficult to watch the entire movie in one go. The climax of the movie is senseless and pointless and doesn't servers any purpose.I came to watch the movie just for the sake of Keanu Reeves in it but is utterly disappointed. This is a very pathetic movie to watch which will not only leave you unsatisfied but also very angry and inconvenienced. Please ignore the movie.",Knock Knock

So Roth is proving to be a very good director who has moved on from just doing Horror films & is trying different genre's such as in 2018 he released two completely different movies one was the excellent Bruce Willis starring Vigilante Thriller Death Wish & the other a fun family fantasy,A House With A Clock In It's Walls.Knock,Knock is a solid Thriller",Knock Knock
45,3xHCCH,Keanu's Most Wretched and Embarrassing Role!,3,22 October 2015,"When I saw the name of Eli Roth as director of this film, I should have taken that as a warning that this was probably going to be a bad movie. Roth's previous work either as director or writer were mostly crazy violent and gory just for the sake of being gory. Unlike his other films though, like the dreadful ""Hostel"" or the awful ""Aftershock"", this one had a known movie star in the lead role -- Keanu Reeves. It was because of Reeves that convinced me that I could give this film a chance.Successful architect Evan Webber is an ideal husband of an artist wife and a model father of two. One day (ironically it was Father's Day), Evan was left behind at home because of work while the rest of his family went on a beach vacation. That night, two sexy young ladies show up at this door lost and soaking wet from the rain. Evan kindly admits them into his house so they can get dry and call for a cab. However, these two liberated girls had kinky shenanigans in mind for Evan, and then some.In spite of the fact that the script and the acting were already pretty cheesy from the very start, the premise of the film actually seemed promising at first. Things do get interesting when the girls came into the scene and turned on their charms in an attempt to seduce the faithful family man. After that key scene though, the rest of the film turned south and just got more and more ridiculous up to the very end which unfortunately did not come right away.Keanu Reeves is one enigmatic star whose career definitely had its ups and downs. In the beginning, he was able to balance his comedy (""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure""), romance (""A Walk in the Clouds""), drama (""My Own Private Idaho"") and action (""Speed"" and ""Matrix""). Since the turn of the millennium though, his career turned for the worse, with no really memorable roles to speak of. His last two films, ""47 Ronin"" and ""John Wick,"" brought his name back up for the better. However, ""Knock, Knock"" knocks him down again with a performance so dismal it will be long-remembered for all the wrong reasons. Keanu Reeves' wretched portrayal of Evan Webber is simply beyond embarrassing. Reeves playing monster with his family at the start was just the first of many cringe-worthy scenes for him in the whole course of this film. As his character was threatened with death later in the film, Reeves' impassioned appeal for his life was so hilariously delivered with the craziest of words, it actually had me laughing out loud in spite of myself. Finally, when a scene came when we see Reeves' head on the ground with only his comical facial emoting, I totally lost it laughing. I cannot fathom how a star of his stature could have allowed himself to suffer such shameful indignities.We can't really expect much from the other relatively unknown actors in the cast who also came up with similarly ludicrous performances. Lorenza Izzo (Eli Roth's wife in real life) and Ana de Armas (the hotter blonde vixen) played the two seductresses Genesis and Bel with such loony, over-the-top abandon. Aaron Burns played the gay friend Louis, who was more concerned about the artwork than people. They did look like they were having a lot of fun doing their inane scenes (even though the situations were not supposed to be funny).What was on Eli Roth's mind when he wrote and directed this? Were all the outrageous scenarios and lousy hammy acting done on purpose to somehow make this film stand out? Was this all an elaborate warning about logging out of Facebook once you are done with it? Anyway, everything was so exaggeratedly bad it was actually uproariously funny. It was definitely not what I expected going in, but I did get a good laugh out of it so I won't call it a total disaster. 3/10.",Knock Knock
46,valleyjohn,One question. Why?,4,15 November 2015,"If there was ever any doubt that director Eli Roth is a misogynist then Knock Knock absolutely confirms it. His portrayal of woman in his films have been appalling in the past but what we see in this movie is staggering . This is the story of family man Evan Webber ( Keanu Reeves ) , who while his wife and kids are away , has a knock on the door from two young woman looking for help . The turn out to be Evan's worst nightmare. Despite Keanu Reeves typically wooden acting I actually didn't mind the first forty minutes of this. It's only when the girls start to go nuts that film immediately falls apart. The problem is Why? What is the motive of these girls? It's never explained despite a spurious "" catch a predator"" line ( which makes no sense ) as to why these girls terrorise Webber. Eli Roth not only turns these female characters into nasty , violent , sex machines he also treats the audience like idiots . This is classed as a Horror film but I would describe it as horrible.",Knock Knock

48,Seraphion,"Flawed concept, but let's just daydream",5,28 October 2015,"Well, the story's basic concept is very much flawed even from the very start. The thing is, even in developing countries like here in Indonesia the rich's housing complexes always have security enclosures that don't allow anyone to enter without checking in to them and stating who to meet with inside. Then there's the thing with, Evan getting to be so stupid as to let those girls just waltz inside in the middle of heavy rain. And there are more things of how this movie is really stupid concept-wise. But if we let ourselves, and our already disappointed perceptions about this movie, to loosen up and continue on with the movie, we can see that the movie don't really categorize as a horror. It's more of a psychological thriller actually. Only the music is gearing the movie to be a horror, but that's about it. The acting overall is quite a contrast. Keanu Reeves did quite a weird performance here. He succeeded in breaking apart his own cool image as last year's John Wick; one scene even did this literally as Keanu is dressed in a Wick-ish wardrobe. His acting seems weird because he really nails the anger part of Evan's frustration but he really lacks on the fear side, also all thanks to his action personal image. Lornza Izzo did better than the other Eli Roth movie, the stupid Green Inferno. She really nailed the crazy psychotic girl part here. On the other hand Ana de Armas didn't really shine as her performance is very much shadowed by Izzo's.",Knock Knock
49,Easygoer10,So bad it's funny,2,1 January 2019,"Liked the film when it was actually believable (about the first 15 minutes). At that point, however, one realizes it to be completely unbelieveable. In other words, what is intended to be ""scary"" becomes so obviously not scary it becomes laughable. This point was truly pounded home later, after ""the asthma attack"" and subsequent playing ""keep away"" with the (life saving) albuterol inhaler. Once this occurs in this (or any) film, it becomes ridicilous to the point of impossibility, and one cannot believe it, no matter what is said or done by his family when they return home. Therefore, rather than them having ""blackmailed"" him, they have actually incriminated themselves, as they posted pictures on the internet and a host of other errors. It would simply be a matter of time before the perpetrators would be caught, arrested, and without question, convicted of who knows how man crimes. Remember, they had done this many times, and with today's DNA typing, the photos, etc., they would never leave prison, unless they were parolled at an extremely old age (if they were lucky). All this would hinge on the possibility (a very gpod chance, too) of receiving death penalties, depending on the state or country they were in, for they had committed capital offenses. VUDU has this movie for rent for $3.99, but it is on sale to own for only $1.99. I wouldnt buy it even for that low a price, except to laugh at, in all the ""not intended to be funny"" parts. This occurs whenever a film is so disingenuous. Seriously, however, the best part is the silver lining (career wise) Cuban actress Ana de Armas got, for the next year (2016) she was in ""War Dogs"" (an okay film), landed another good role with Keanu Reaves in ""Exposed"", and then ""Hands of Stone"" starring Edgar Ramirez starring as legendary Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran (1 of the greatest boxers in history) and Robert DeNiro as his equally legendary trainer, Ray Arcell, who came out of retirement at age 72. She made one other film ""Overdive"" with Scott Eastwood (Clint Eastwood's son). He's an up and coming stuntman-turned-actor), but the film is not that good. Best of all, the next year (2017) she landed her best role yet as ""Joi"" in Blade Runner 2049, directed by 1 of the top 5 living directors (imho), Denis Villeneuve. Her star is really on the rise, as her next scheduled film to be releasrd is ""The Informer"" in March, 2019.",Knock Knock
50,Matt_Layden,"Knock Knock, Who's There? Crappy Movie. Crappy Movie Who?",5,5 November 2015,"After the less than stellar box office return of Hostel Part II, Eli Roth blamed the internet and swore off making films for a long time. In fact, he hasn't directed another movie since then. He's produced, starred in and wrote a few, but never touched the camera again, except for the sniper film that plays in Inglorious Basterds and the Thanksgiving segment from Grindhouse. Almost ten years later and we have not one, but two feature films from Roth. The Green Inferno, which was actually completed in 2013, but held up until now, and the erotic horror thriller Knock Knock, which is a remake of 1977 film Death Game.Did Roth coming back from ""retirement"" encourage me to see the film? Was it the deranged sexual element that would draw me in? No, it was Keanu Reeves my friend. Everything else didn't matter to me, I wanted to see Keanu Reeves in movies again. He did a kick ass job in John Wick, now I was going to see if he would be able to play a helpless cheat who is terrified for his life. A role that is really against type for him. Can Reeves pull it off? The man has been labeled emotionless in a lot of his film roles, so this would seem like it would require him to dig down and actually act. Now, he does manage to scream, freak out and indeed, act terrified at times, but there is always and I mean always, something off about his performances. Maybe it's his monotone voice or the deadness behind his eyes, but it doesn't always come off well. Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoy a lot of his work, but a great thespian the man is not. It looks like the man is trying here, I'm not too sure if he pulls it off too well.Reeves plays Evan, an architect who has to stay at home for the long weekend and work, while his wife and two kids go to the beach house. One stormy night, he hears a knock at his door, two young beautiful women are stranded and need his help. While inside, they manage to seduce him, despite his constant resistance. The next morning he finds out that they won't leave, not without playing a game with him being an unwilling participant.So the premise alone seems like a typical invasion torture horror flick, with the added element of sex and the intruders being young hot women. Once that is out of the way, the film offers nothing new or insightful. Roth, a man who knows a thing or two about the genre, tries to amp of the suspense a bit, but falls into the same generic traps all these films do. Knock Knock isn't sexy enough, nor terrifying enough. I guess it must just feel weird to direct your wife in a naked threesome with Keanu Reeves. The question people will be asking themselves is, will Reeves live or die by the end of the film. I won't spoil how it ends, but the build up to that final situation is decent enough to make the film almost watchable. The denouement is completely wrong though and adds an unneeded comedic joke that is literally the very end of the film. You go through this long torturous journey with Reeves, only to have it end with a one liner? Really odd choice that left me scratching my head with disappointment. I wanted some kind of answer to what would happen next, but never got it. Roth leaves a little hint here or there, but I guess I wanted something a little more concrete. What the film does accomplish is me, never opening my door to anyone. Not even two young, beautiful, wet women who beg me to let them inside so they can have sex with me. That's just for my dreams.",Knock Knock
51,vengeance20,Knock Knock,6,27 June 2015,"I realistically knew from first seeing previews of this on Facebook/YouTube that this was going to be a messed up film! The trailer established that perfectly!The film premise is simple. Evan is a family is loving caring father living in a happy marriage. One stormy night on fathers day, 2 young bimbos show up at Evan's door shivering cold & supposingly lost. They then seduce him, sleep with him & then turn on film. Simple. Though that wasn't a bad thing.They then turn on Evan & ""play a game"" by destroying his house, torturing him & basically ruining his life. The film was mediocre. I mean I liked the fact it was messed up & was horrible. But it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The ending I felt was just designed to p!$$ the audience off! As it was a lose ending ending as it were. It just left me with loads of questions. Why were they spying on him? How did they spy on him? How did they know who he was? Why ruin his life? And the list goes on & on.The film was dark & twisted as I said & didn't fail in that department. Like when Louis got his head hit on the sculpture & how the girls vandalized the entire house. Though it was predictable & had some really annoying parts, but aside from that it was watchable to a point.The ending was bad & just utter crap! There's no way you can post a sex video on Facebook. Furthermore they knew what they were doing from the start & they ruined Evans life because they enjoyed it. Also I would've loved to have seen Evan get back at the girls & kill them or pin something on them etc. But it was just an empty ending that just didn't cut if for me! Evan didn't get them back & they got away with it, so the ending led on to believe! Hated it!! Anyway they'd get caught somehow, their faces were all over the net at the end of the film! The realism was just stupid too!Overall it was OK but not that good. The ending was just a complete F**k up! Why end it like that Eli!? Just why!? Grr!6/10",Knock Knock
52,quincytheodore,Knock Knock overstays its welcome with repetitive plot and silly antics,4,21 November 2015,"After the success of John Wick I was interested to see next Keanu Reeves' movie. I believe Knock Knock can now be certified a disappointment, a sentiment shared by many others. It's a juvenile attempt at thriller that goes literally nowhere. This is not a thought-provoking drama, far from it, it's a shallow use of home invasion theme and despite having attractive actors performing clandestine meetings, it looks so bland and boring.Evan (Keanu Reeves) is a loyal husband, who is also home alone at weekend. Two beautiful ladies come knocking for help, and eventually they seduce him. This is basically the entirety of the movie. It wants to be charming or seductive, yet it ends up insipid. Certainly there's no dangerous game of wit here, even if the two shady ladies are meant to be flirtatiously menacing.The premise could have worked for a brief period of time, and admittedly the characters look the part, but it rehearsed the same angle until the end of movie. Keanu Reeves looks confusing throughout the movie, he's just baffled like Mark Wahlberg on The Happening. There's no depth on his emotions, and this is a clear miscast. There might be some thrill, a little hope that he would break free in a clever way, although even this aspect is overly streamlined.Knock Knock is ironically a timid drama, and it overstays its welcome with repetitive plot and silly antics.

The whole thing is pretty generic 'horror' stuff, with most of the generic elements one may expect; the establishing of a happily married man with kids, plenty of silly choices and characters, and the seemingly inescapable 'clever' use of modern day gadgets and stuff.The really big trouble here is, though, that the original given has been watered down once again (after the Spanish remake had done the same, but still had something to say). 'Knock knock' has no particularly clever message for anyone with half a brain.So then, the cast could add something to the whole, maybe, and keep the viewer interested somehow? Well, the two leading ladies are cute enough, they try their best with the meager dialogue and plot which they were given, and Roth even dares to have them do some rather steamy action, wíth a proper amount of nudity. So, kudos for that. But then, Keanu Reeves... he really did a terrible, terrible job, although I don't know if it's for a lack of trying or a lack of talent and / or charisma; I've seen him do decent enough stuff in the past, but this just didn't come off right - at all.4 out of 10.^ That doesn't mean I never liked any of Roth's work, au contraire, but it was only just about gory, fun and interesting enough (and it's been a while since I've seen those...).",Knock Knock

It is not really worth writing a review. But the sex scenes where great. I only wish you had done away with the fast cuts.I don't know what you were thinking casting Keanu Reeves in this film. He played another one of those vacuous and empty rich American liberal males.Anyway, you really seem to want to be politically incorrect. I noticed this in The Green Inferno as well. Over here, you have two female rapists and sadists running amok. It was a pretty good idea. These two women were rapists. But the fact that the male almost willingly has sex with them indicates that this was another pathetic attempt to criticize the male sexual urge. It was a very interesting scenario. But you were simply aiming for the shocks (nothing wrong with that but the shocks and thrills were nothing to write home about) rather than provide some sort of commentary.Anyway, I am sure Vikram Bhatt and Madhuri Banerjee would remake this.

57,IonicBreezeMachine,"Eli Roth remakes a movie that wasn't even that good to begin with, and somehow makes it worse",4,27 March 2021,"Set on Fathers' Day weekend, successful architect Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) prepares for a weekend of work while his wife and kids enjoy a weekend at the beach. On his first night home during a rainstorm two young women Bel and Genesis (Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo) arrive at his doorstep asking for help. After he allows them in the two seduce Evan resulting in a threeway. After Evan's infidelity, the two reveal their true intentions wreaking havoc on Evan's home and life and subject Evan to increasingly intense psychological and physical tortures which may culminate in his death.Directed by Eli Roth Knock Knock is an uncredited remake of 1977s Death Game (though the original director and stars are executive producers). Knock Knock hits all the beats from the original while also updating the premise with references to contemporary society and technology. I honestly didn't like Death Game when I saw it because I found the plot repetitive and the characters annoying, but I did give it props for being a well made attempt by an inexperienced director and having a chilling performance from Sondra Locke. Knock Knock is certainly more polished of a product in terms of film making in comparison to its more grind house level predecessor, but while the package has been glossed up the content is considerably lesser this time around.The opening 40 minutes are easily the best part of Knock Knock as we establish Evan's sexual frustration and hectic family situation that build up to the seduction. It's honestly really well told and is much better here than it was in the original 1977 film where the wife and kids were basically non entities for much of the original film's runtime. The film is also well shot with great looking establishment shots of the house.Unfortunately beneath the coat of polish that's been applied many elements have been downgraded in terms of quality despite a supposedly more experienced director, Roth, helming the remake of a film that was made by an amateur. Keanu Reeves is a good actor, but only if given the right material. Reeves in Knock Knock does have a fun brief shining moments such as scene midway through the movie where he's trying to rebuke the advances of the seducers, but it feels like the role was written with someone like Nicolas Cage in mind and they just shoehorned Reeves into the role because they couldn't get him. Reeves still sporting his John Wick doo just doesn't sell it as a workaday family man and doesn't sell a role that he just doesn't fit into.Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo start off well enough as the seducers when they first arrive in the movie, but around the halfway point where they reveal their true intentions they become absolutely insufferable to listen to. Not only do they act like oversexed brats with middle school level vocabularies, they have this unearned sense of ""holier than thou"" moral superiority that makes them extra aggravating. While movies with killers with prideful moral superiority complexes can work, such as Kiefer Sutherland as The Voice in Phone Booth or Tobin Bell as The Jigsaw Killer in Saw, those movies at least had some level of self awareness that their killers were hypocritical scum doing ex post fact justifications of their actions. Knock Knock is more confused and feels like it muddled its intentions much like Nicolas Cage's Wicker Man remake where they replaced the Paganism/Christianity dynamic with a fundamentally confused masculinity/femininity dynamic. Roth tries to update the very 70s counterculture girls with updated equivalents for the digital age, but it comes off more as an excuse for Roth to amp up the annoyance of characters who were already pretty grating to begin with.Knock Knock is Roth at his worst. While it's not as bad as his worst movie, Hostel Part II, by virtue of at least being unintentionally fascinating in some confusing choices it's still an unnecessary remake of a very flawed movie that is not approved upon save for technical details. It's not completely without merit thanks to some decent cinematography and brief moments of good acting, but if you have a choice between this and the original, stick with the original, for all its flaws it at least had the excuse of an inexperienced director.",Knock Knock
58,carbuff,"Dark as being in a cave on a moonless night, but surprisingly effective thriller",8,21 April 2021,"I don't get the super-low ratings. ""Knock Knock"" was coming off of streaming, and, admittedly purely out of prurient interest, I decided to give it a go.As an actor, I find Keanu Reeves even more wooden than Ben Affleck, which is like saying that oak is more wooden than maple. So, I didn't go into this expecting much from Reeves, which is pretty much what I got, but his character didn't really require more anyhow.I thought that the plot kept building tension and suspense very effectively, and I couldn't tell which way it was going to go ultimately. I'm a guy, and I don't know if the low-ratings are due to some people who are put off by the apparent woman-hating, or, on the other hand, the man-hating, both of which are essential to the plot. Frankly, the script feels equally like it could have been written by a militant lesbian feminist or a men's rights fanatic--maybe a couple of them threw in together. In blunt terms, ""Knock Knock"" is downright misanthropic and unpleasant through and through.Also, possibly so many people didn't like it because there really aren't any truly redeeming sympathetic characters. Basically, I'm giving it a high rating, since it's very effective as a soft-core porn/horror/thriller, albeit an extremely misanthropic one. I would just consider it to be a different and unpredictable ride as far as films go. I'm thinking that the market for this kind of flick is pretty small, and it must have turned off a lot of people, hence the low rating.

And it does have a welcoming dose of dark comedic moments as wellActing-wise it's... okay, Keanu Reeves tries to do something different with his acting this time, I think that was Eli Roth's idea, he's far more energetic and over the top than we are used to seeing him as, I'm not sure it was the best way to play the role but can't hate on him for trying something different...

We are Talking about Two Pretty Hot CRAZY CHICKS that go NUTS. And take this MARRIED MAN AT RANSOM IN MOST FILMS IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

66,billygoat1071,Outrageous Ordeal,7,27 October 2015,"Knock Knock is Eli Roth's second movie this year and we see that the craft has been better compared to the other one and he is handling the erotic thriller territory than just another torture porn refuses to be an exploitation film. And to be honest, this turn is far more interesting. The film builds an atmosphere and lets the audience dive into it. The self-aware humor works better as well. And then it eventually gets obnoxious, I believe that's the entire point of it, but what kills it when it's trying to say something directly important, except it's not wise enough earn that sentiment. It's still reasonable that it catches your attention from beginning to end, but the final note is not as strong as it hoped to be.The film opens showing us that the main character has a happy family and eventually it will all fall apart once the two girls enter the picture. But how these psychos tear this guy's life down has an entertaining slow burn. Regarding this as a hospitality went wrong, how these two girls win Evan (Keanu Reeves) over is not just some typical seduction. They interact with him like he is being demeaned into mid-life crisis. Right after he gives in, it's fully revealed the two girls are downright psychopaths and they're clever enough to give Evan a serious excuse to not arrest them. It's an intense conflict, not by physical torture, but by wrecking one's own dignity. And it gets out of hand until the two girls become too obnoxious rather than dangerous. While that's the movie's sense of humor, it also messes with its potent themes. This is mostly concerned on the ending, which could have been powerfully uneasy when it stops there, but the film wants a final punchline which foolishly leads itself to a safer direction.The direction knows how to manifest a very, very atmosphere, even if the conflict are just insane hot girls, it doesn't always become predictable. And the acting is just priceless, this movie gives people a reason why to love Keanu Reeves even more. This is a role where he finally gives in, by broadening the single insane moment he had in John Wick to the entire haunting experience he had in this one. He comes close to Nicolas Cage's The Wicker Man performance, except in this context, it seems more appropriate and just equally enjoyable. Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas are ultimately campy enough as some of the most outrageous characters you'll ever see.Knock Knock is probably the most entertaining of Eli Roth's oeuvre. Sure, it doesn't contain the amount of violence and gore he is known for, but in this unlikely turn, I think this movie has more intriguing and really outrageous choices to bring shock value. Then again, the final punchline just kills the momentum, underwhelming what you're already experiencing. Besides, it's starting to get annoying once it gets too far, and there isn't really much about it in the end. Keanu Reeves's total madness is kind of magical to witness, but the movie itself is just designed to have fun until it finally get on your nerves.",Knock Knock
67,dilipbts,Knock knock,8,29 July 2020,"The message of the movie is pretty interesting, and one I do agree with.Everything else seemed pretty cheap. The beginning was interesting, but it seemed to drag on for more than half the movie. Felt like watching a cheap porno. The second half, the torture was not particularly terrifying and the actions of the characters were neither here nor there. Also Keanu Reeves was not very convincing in the film.Hard Candy did a much better (and terrifying) job of exploring the shallowness of man(kind), so I would suggest that over Knock Knock. Overall though, the movie was an interesting watch and definitely different to most films currently out there. So, if you're bored with the regular thrillers, this might just be for you.",Knock Knock

I can't imagine the actors were anything but embarrassed when they were making this thing.",Knock Knock
69,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Annoying, uninteresting, and poorly acted, Eli loses further points as a director",3,26 October 2015,"The joke among horror and film buffs is that Eli Roth is not a great film maker. Not having seen many of his movies, we could never really attest to that fact. If Knock Knock is any indication of his talents as a writer or director then we might have to believe the naysayers.Keanu Reeves plays Evan, a loving and caring husband who is left alone for a long weekend to work while his wife and two children take a mini-holiday away. Two women knock on his door in the middle of the night, they are lost and soaking wet and need help. Ever the kind man, he lets them into his home, but what was initially a good- natured action turns into a game of dangerous seduction.There really is no way to put this nicely, so I will put it bluntly: Knock Knock is a poor movie, even a bad one. It seems however that most of the responsibility for the substandard execution should fall on the director's shoulders.Right off the bat, the acting in Knock Knock is awkwardly bad. The dialogue is drawn out in an unnatural manner for real conversation, and the interactions are pointless. Almost any subject our key players talk about could easily be interchanged for something else with no repercussion on the remainder of the film. With no merit to the dialogue, there is no hope for the characters or narrative to feel like it is evolving, and that is bad writing. This is clear by Evan's two female tormentors coming across more as annoying brats than twisted sociopaths.Sometimes slow pacing works in a film, because it builds tension and sets a longstanding tone for the film, creating a mood that captivates the audience. Knock Knock is not that type of film, and while slow, it completely misses the mark in creating anything, let alone tension. This film could have been some creepy horror version of Wild Things or even a version of Hard Candy, instead it is nothing of merit.This whole review may sound harsh, but considering I went into this film open minded and completely without expectation and had such an adverse reaction to it, I think it is justified. Knock Knock is goofy, no scary and the only time I had any reaction to the film was with Louis's line ""Bitch, I am from Oakland.""Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Knock Knock

Eli Roth, going from bad to worse, reunites with the same actress (Lorenza Izzo, now his wife in real life) and most of the same crew in what gives the term ""horror movie"" more than one meaning.Basically, it's the same plot as Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"", but done completely wrong here. The script is awful and the movie is boring beyond belief - it just goes on and on and like the character in the film, you just wish for this torture to be over. The entire plot can be summed up in one sentence and couldn't hold even a short, let alone a 100 minutes film.If all that wasn't enough, the movie has one of the worst endings I've ever seen.Sitting through this film is almost impossible and I'm still trying to figure out what on Earth made Keanu Reeves participate in this abomination.",Knock Knock
73,HelenMary,not very psychological for a psychological thriller,4,8 July 2019,"Billed as a psychological thriller, with a fairly tell-all trailer, this wasn't as scary as I expected and I never the saw the original (Death Game). I had put off watching it for fear of seeing sexual assault (which I don't like to watch as ""entertainment"") but it turned out to be okay from that point of view. The writing was careful that Keanu's character, Evan, was complicit, and consenting to whatever happened to him sexually, albeit under some duress of blackmail (a grey area); but some reviewers hold that he WAS guilty and had some sordid secret but I didn't see that, except the fact he went along with the blackmail because he had cheated on his wife. If roles were reversed, men coming into the home of a woman, it would be an unthinkable film.So, Evan is a family man whose wife and two children go away for the weekend and two bedraggled young women turn up at his door seeking shelter from the rain, and things go awry when they try to seduce him. Being cynical and judgmental it seems a little tenuous that a man can only hold out for 40 minutes against some pretty obvious flirtation, especially when he does so well at first, and there's an Uber on its way.You have to suspend your disbelief a lot during this film; it is surprising (and a few reviewers have mentioned) that Evan is a physically imposing man... Keanu Reeves is a big man... but he doesn't seem to be able stay away from two small women. Evan is clearly not John Wick or Johnny Utah! He doesn't fight back as you would expect a man to, but you have to suppose that he is still labouring under the fear that he IS doing something wrong, and shock that this is happening at all, and they are girls and you can't fight girls (in this scenario - it's okay Evan!)Sadly, the film is poorly made, despite very good acting performances from the three leads. There are lots of sloppy edits, overly long travelling shots and camera/sound crew are visible in reflection in a number of scenes. Also, the film doesn't answer all the questions it poses... as a psychological thriller, there isn't much psychology. The most explanation of things is unspoken (or under breath) communication between Evan and the dog, Monkey... and what happens to Monkey?!The ending is weird, and not expected. That isn't to say that it's a twist, I was just incredulous, like ""Eh? WHAT!?"" There was no satisfying denouement, I was left quite angry at the end, and I couldn't quite express that without more expressions of shock at how ridiculous it all was.I didn't enjoy this film, despite good acting. I wondered what the point was. Two girls... and... why!?!? The take home morals of the story are to have weapons hidden ALL over your home... and keep *it* (not the weapons) in your pants.

74,coreyjdenford,Knock Knock...run.,1,14 October 2015,"This is my review of Knock Knock (spoiler free). Eli Roth's chiller didn't leave me chilled it just left me bored out of my mind it started good but then it just started to fall. After the first hour I thought to myself ""what am I watching?"" Here are the points in which I think you must stay away from this film:1. Bad acting: This film has a well known actor Keanu Reeves who is good in a lot of films but this film isn't one of them. The two women Lerrenza Izzo and Ana de Arma were worse than him. 2. No story: This film has barely any story or non at all.3. Bad directing: This film has a well known director Eli Roth but this is probably his worst film yet with really bad camera angles.Finally I had really high hopes for this film considering some critics said that was Eli Roth's best film since Hostel I one on the hand don't agree.

So many questions, so little respect left.I'll sum up the movie for you: A family man does a good deed, then gets raped and publicly shamed, then buried by two 'oh so empowered' female twinks. And it's implied that it's somehow his fault that he got raped. The end. Now imagine this movie's scenario but with the genders reversed and tell me would it make it into a movie?

Reminded me of a remake but could not even be bothered thinking about which one. Have heard there is an after credit scene but why you would sit an extra 2 minutes in the theatre to watch it is beyond me. Eli Roth is pretty useless at direction I think and gets less than nothing from his cast.

81,troyputland,Knock Knock doesn't get the reaction it intends.,5,20 October 2015,"Eli Roth is a master of suspenseful horrors. Unfortunately Knock Knock doesn't follow the likes of Hostel and Cabin Fever. Keanu Reeves is Evan, a devoted husband and father left at home to work whilst his family are away for the weekend. He's an innocent, good natured soul who answers the door to two young women who need help. A seductive game of cat and mouse commences as soon as he lays eyes on them. Things take a turn for the worst when Evan caves in to their sexual advances. Knock Knock's most interesting aspect comes from its very different gender roles. Reeves is the 'damsel in distress', sympathy untoward from his moment of passion. The young women, Genesis (Roth's wife Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) are in control, yet ironically out of control. This Strangers style film struggles to get the reaction it deserves. Serious moments are funny when they shouldn't be. The plus side for director Eli Roth is the women reach the maximum level of annoyance whilst Evan conjures up low amounts of courage, throwing our emotions in to disarray. Knock Knock is a hard one to judge. It'll make you feel dirty and awkward, even if there's nothing to hide.",Knock Knock
82,ginocox-206-336968,"Plenty of energy, decent production values, but muddled script with murky theme",4,8 November 2015,"Movies can increase our awareness and understanding of complex social, political, scientific, historical and other issues or they can misinform and perpetuate misconceptions. Unfortunately, filmmakers often deviate from the dry facts of reality to sensationalize. Pedophilia is a serious issue with profound implications for both public health and law enforcement. Pedophilic disorder has a specific definition among mental health professionals, as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Jurisdictions may define a dozen or more forms of child molestation, depending on the nature and severity of the act and the ages of the perpetrator and victim. Yet people often use the term pedophile as a catchall term to refer to a hebephile, ephebophile, child molester, or other sex offender, even though the psychological and criminal implications may be vastly different. Physical attraction to two sexually mature females played by actresses who are in their mid-twenties has nothing to do with pedophilia, even though the characters may later falsely claim to have been underage. The film does a disservice to its audience by presenting and perpetrating a muddled view of pedophilia and by suggesting it is primarily a form of criminal behavior rather than a psychological disorder with profound psychological implications for the victims and severe criminal consequences. As an example of what Blake Snyder calls a monster in the house film, one expects to learn that Evan (Reeves) committed some act of child molestation. The typical plot for a horror film is that a sinful act unleashes a supernatural force that seeks vengeance against the guilty but spares those who repent. But Evan seems completely innocent and the intruders apparently chose him and their prior victims somewhat randomly, although they apparently monitored his activities closely before choosing him. This weakens the moral of the story. If the film had somehow demonstrated that many ordinary men would be inclined to a sexual liaison with a prepubescent child, it would be an alarming revelation, although not particularly credible. Instead, we are given a muddled cautionary tale about marital infidelity in which a forty-three year-old man succumbs to the deliberate efforts of seduction by two attractive girls who look to be in their mid-twenties, the age of the actresses cast in the roles, but later engage in psychological torture by claiming to be underage, impregnated and experienced in murder. The motives of the two girls are unclear. They seem to have daddy issues and issues with marital infidelity. But it's not clear if they were molested as children or as teenagers or how that relates to their current activities or even how they managed to meet one another and develop their scheme. Considering that their threats to murder Evan are a sham, they seem strangely unconcerned about the accidental death they cause to another character. Despite the muddled story credited to five writers (never a good sign), the production values are solid and the three main performers deliver unabashed and energetic performances. It's a remake of a 1977 exploitation film, which I haven't seen. While the production values are vastly superior to typical 1970s films, the script is a muddled mess. Nice job of trashing the house, though.",Knock Knock

The villains destroy everything, even kill a man, all the while you're thinking ""they wont get away with this, the ending will be sweet.""The ending is not sweet.The idea is you're supposed to weigh up who made the most mistakes: A guy cheating on his wife,... or maniacs who destroyed someone's house, belongings, work, and kill a man... and they want you to laugh along and love the maniacs.The acting is superb however.",Knock Knock

Keanu Reeves stars in the film as a hopeless victim of infuriating torture to leave you unsatisfied and angry at an extreme level. But what is good about the movie?The fact that it's engaging enough to drag you out and supply you with horrible feelings is indeed fairly powerful, but Knock Knock would only be likeable if justice was included. Seriously, a sequel of justice and revenge is needed for the audiences without a single question. So unless you're feeling ready to spend 98 minutes watching an innocent man's life being ruined, simply avoid this one.Although the power of this movie is appreciable, it's really unfair power.

Eli Roth, a director who only cranked out 2 movies (Hostel Part 2 & The Green Inferno) in the last 8 years. So he had plenty of time to think about the script for this movie which he wrote and directed. Turns out the plot is a rather simple one: A fancy architect (Keanu) stays alone in the house to work for the weekend while the wife's away with the kids. On a very rainy night 2 steaming hot girls ring his doorbell (well actually they knock coz otherwise the title wouldn't make much sense innit). He invites them inside where they need to take off their wet clothes and put them in the dryer... If you're reading this and you're thinking to yourself: this seems like the plot of a cheap soft-porn film you're actually partially right. The first 30 mins Keanu tries to stay loyal to his wife while the girls try to get into his pants and eventually he buckles and has a threesome. But as this is a Eli Roth film all hell breaks loose after that. So here the rub: the 'all hell breaking loose' part is very well done. You'll wanna kill these bitches yourself as you'll feel as powerless and frustrated as poor Keanu. So a job well done there Eli. But...all the while you're watching the film you're thinking it's gonna lead up to something but it simply does not and in that sense it's somewhat of a letdown. The film get's a rather unjust low score on IMDb probably because of this.

90,FallenEye,2 Beauties and a Monster.,4,12 August 2016,"Knock Knock is carried by 2 things, perhaps 3. 1. The first 40 minutes were what you'd expect from an erotic thriller, and it's done well enough to grant a solid 6/10 rating.2. Ana de Armas's beauty is not a joke. She is, seriously gorgeous. So much so in fact, that her beauty takes the rating from 6/10, right up to 8/10.3. Lorenza Izzo is also a pretty face to look at, that adds more than just 2 cents, whenever she was on camera. Her acting, for a movie of this nature, could've been worse. Her performance and allure, take this picture to 8.5/10.Now for the anchor.1. I personally, love Keanu - because he is good at what he does (or doesn't do I suppose), however it is popular knowledge that his roles in the past have generally demanded not too great of a necessity for him to, well... Act. Funny enough - given how feeble of a tale this is, Knock Knock required a certain amount of acting prowess, that Keanu, sadly could not deliver. Actually, convert this movie from a Thriller to a Comedy, then I assure you, it would've garnered a much more positive response. This, drops the rating from 8.5/10, to 5.5/10.2. The story, is so thin, that, it had to constantly keep forcing in some way, these 2 girls being able to over power Evan over and over again... Especially after how Evan was so quick to let them know, that he could over power them both. From 5.5/10, to 4.5/10.3. The ending. I would've preferred to see, just how Evan attempts to worm his way out of the hole he dug himself into...

91,mistoppi,"If you feel disgusted, this movie did its job",6,3 July 2016,"The first thing I can say about this movie is I'm glad it's over. I didn't exactly enjoy watching this movie, but this is not the kind of ""glad it's over"" that's result of a really boring, bad movie that mostly made me frustrated. I wanted to see this movie because it is directed by Eli Roth, yet I had no idea it would be this twisted and sick. And when we're talking about horror movies, twisted and sick isn't a bad thing. And the biggest reason for the relief when the closing credits start rolling is the fact that you feel so hopeless during the whole movie. Evan tries his best yet he can't do anything, and all that. While you're watching you think ""Even if he is left alive, how could he ever overcome this"", and all that.While Knock Knock is just 99 minutes long, the structure is amazing. The film is very slow, yet that 99 minutes doesn't feel too short. The whole situation develops slowly: at first it's seemingly normal, then turns weird, then turns disturbing, then it's just twisted and you experience all kind of feelings in the ""What The F**k"" - spectrum. And that's the most wonderful thing about this film. Every other good technical detail feels kind of blurred after this really f***ed up story in general.Since this film is a remake, it's hard to say which parts of the writing come from the original movie, and what comes from Roth, López, and Amoedo. The dialogue is good. I always say good things about horror movie dialogue: it's natural. Well, maybe not during the most stressful scenes, but when nothing bad is happening, the dialogue is natural, relaxed, and extremely realistic. Another interesting thing are the few humorous moments. The thing is, their timing makes them so bad. They shouldn't be funny but that's why they make you laugh or at least chuckle: they are so horrible, ironic, whatever is the right word.There are a lot of weird, awkward moments. One semi-annoying scene was when Bel and Evan discussed music, and Evan talks about how diverse his taste in music is. That's like one, two lines, but it feels like it's the writers patting themselves on the back, because they know weird bands or artists they can use in the movie. While all of that chit chat type of dialogue is quite unnecessary, that felt even more gratuitous.It's hard to say what score Knock Knock would deserve. I was mostly so disgusted and confused it was hard to concentrate to if this is good in the most objective way possible of reviewing a movie. Thinking about the story, cinematography, and all those little things, Knock Knock is average. A viewer's opinion is mostly affected by how you feel during this film. And you without a doubt feel sick and disgusted or maybe even angry about how a movie like this ruined your night. Well yeah, the writers probably wanted that to happen. I don't think a movie like Knock Knock is made so you can enjoy it, it's a sick, twisted horror movie. It's meant to make you feel negatively, so this film definitely did its job.",Knock Knock
92,FelipeCarrillo,"Eli Roth's ""Knock Knock"" Is A Psychological Thriller With Common Appearance, But With A Disturbing Potential",7,14 June 2016,"Intervening moral issues of fidelity and sexual drives (usually, present in married men), Roth, Nicolás López and Guillermo Amoedo conceive a story with references - or possibly based - on ""Death Game"" film of 1997 with almost the same plot. With better performances, uses of technology, a story with appropriate plot twists and a better directing, this new version shows the multifaceted that could be the director, without the presence gore that characterizes him, OK, at least without so much blood.With a predictably moderate result at the box office, ""Knock Knock"" is a fresh and lush proposal to the commercial films and while it is not the masterpiece of the season, it is one of the independent films more entertaining of the year. Roth arrives with strength to the suspense genre, with one idea we've already seen, but with a view more modern and modified about itself, perhaps is a remake or maybe not.Keanu Reeves plays Evan, a happily married architect, father of two children, with fortune, love, DJ hobbies, a beautiful house, in summary an idealized life, what else can he ask for?. Then, his two children and his wife take a nice vacation to the beach - on the occasion of father's day, a big irony-, Evan and Monkey left alone at home working on his project. On a rainy and simply sinister night, two beautiful and stunning girls innocently knock on the Evan's door, under the pretext of help, since they have lost on the way to a party. This merciful man - though, after I watch this movie so many times, in the third time, I can see the desire of Evan, it is logical, he is a man - allows them to enter for one call or maximum one coffee cup. Bel (Ana de Armas) and Genesis (Lorenza Izzo, the wife and constant contributor to Roth) are male sexual fantasy. After asking a taxi and have a talk about faithfulness and sex, things become dangerous and Evan's love for his family is thrown into the toilet.Evan has sexual relations with the two girls - something relatively impossible considering the age of Evan, but relatively possible considering that morning his wife not wanted help him, affirming that he took more than three months without having sexual relations -, naive and innocent of the hell that was to come. Once the guys begin to show their bad behavior, Evan feels in trouble and goes in a direction that will not help him. Things come up to the limit of gag to Evan, unintentionally killing a person and destroy all the house. The previous is made to give a lesson to all husband who believe to be faithful, but that ""fidelity"" word is what less used inside their mind.Idea is completely brand-new, however, its end leaves the audience unsatisfied, thrilled and even disappointed. It feels like a failed experiment, feels like a work that had a stupid ending, it is illogical to which after a great development finishes with a finish so poor and cheap in order to show a consequence.Moral themes is most used in dramatic and thriller films, but the issues touched in this film are substantially used them and share a better connection with the audience due to everyday life and reminiscence of them in life any common man. It is not a feminist film, it is not a male chauvinist film, Roth manages to get that balance of genre in order to do not be wrong about taking his project where it should not go.Ana de Armas and Lorena Izzo are fabulous in their roles, however, momentarily, they get rid of the psychology and strange behavior that had. The classification R, they gave to the film is opportune, since, in addition to having strong sexual scenes, profanity and violence, these girls transmit horror, a genre that apparently are not visible, but after seeing the work these two women, the horror reincarnated in the beauty. Reeves also makes a great role here, different than what he has done so far, revealing its full potential with his monologue ""free pizza"".Technological contributions make much with little, recorded in one house with fascinating interior design, Roth knows how to slide his camera through the corridors and walls full of art and paintings, giving a modern twist to a house of a familiar aura.Last Roth's film- and hopefully it is not the last, really - plays very well exposed moral issues, with photography and cinematography very well executed, but narratively falls short and not in its development, in its empty and simple end.",Knock Knock

Knock Knock,7,15 November 2020,"At first I thought the origins to this movie was probably Keanu Reeves was telling someone about what he did the previous night, and Eli Roth happened to overhear and said we could turn that into an erotic thriller, but no... it's another remake, of a movie called Death Game in 1977. However it was pretty entertaining on an uncomfortable level. The most uncomfortable was the beginning with Keanu trying to act like a human married male bonding with his family, but luckily the movie is short and it dives right it. There are spoilers ahead, however if you've seen the trailer, well... Starts with a guy named Evan saying goodbye to his wife and kids, they are off to a day at the beach, while Evan stays home to get some work done. Nighttime comes, along with it a rain storm and a knock knock on the front door, Evan opens up to find two very soaked young women asking about an address, he's like, I dunno dude, like wanna come in. Because Evan's a nice guy, and as the night goes on we find that these two girls are very kind too, well, sorta. Over the course of a few minutes while waiting for a new cab ride the girls, Genesis and Bel, seduce married man Evan into doing some very naughty things. Then he passes out. Morning comes and all is quiet until he hears some laughing to discover the girls haven't left yet, and by the look of things don't plan on it either. And when Evan decides to get tough and tell them to leave, they drop quite the bombshell on Evan that's probably going to slightly alter his lifestyle.

Bad storyline accompanied with hot nude women? Perfect for the casual pornhub viewer.For those of you watching that expect a storyline-don't expect too much. The film actually starts off promising, but devolves into a mess that's more focused on the sex angle than the actual plot at hand. There are several things that don't just make sense or aren't executed properly. For example, the whole idea is that the two women are punishing him because he cheated. But then why do they punish the wife by destroying her art? They also allude to the idea that one of the women was abused by her father, but it's kind of shoved in there and never developed fully. Also the scene where she dresses in the daughter's clothes is super disturbing.One thing I disagree with is the notion that these two women couldn't overpower one man. It's two against one and they have weapons, of course they can?Ultimately, this movie sucks on the plot front. Hard Candy did it much better.",Knock Knock

I also do not really like Keanu Reeves, since I believe he is a one note ""actor"" who can only play one role. Against my better judgment I decided to give this film a chance, and I wanted to punch every involved in this travesty. This movie is so freaking ludicrous, as to make any socially conscious man angry. Why is it that men are always portrayed as villains? Is it our fault that we take the initiative to get s#!t done? We are the inventors, the explorers, the ones who risk our lives to save the lives of others.Yet we have a movie like this one that spits on everything men have done to simply slight them, and why? This movie made me angry because it caters to the simple minded feminist mentality; instead of trying to place blame on any one specific group, these people need to look introspectively and deconstruct everything they have been taught to believe by those around them.

He's never really come across to me as much of an actor - he's just been very lucky to have made a couple of movies with good directors who know how to work around a lead ""actor"" who can't act to save his life. I had to laugh at one review here that said he gave a ""strong natural performance"". ROFL He really didn't. He was embarrassingly bad. The two girls were marginally better but all of it was excruciating to watch. There was nothing clever or interesting, nothing believable, nothing funny or shocking. The ""torture"" was really lame.

100,lnvicta,A morbid psychosexual thriller that flirts with both silliness and cinematic greatness.,6,24 October 2015,"After skimming through some of these reviews, I'm not sure what people were expecting from Knock Knock. It plays out like a cross between No Good Deed and The Loved Ones. The story isn't original of course but this is Eli Roth's take on a home invasion thriller and it's refreshingly sadistic. Two strangers knock on Keanu Reeves' door, he invites them in, their sociopathic tendencies start to peek through, and things escalate from there. The acting is largely impressive. Keanu comes across as silly at times but, for the most part, he fits the part of the innocent dad and he bounces off the chemistry of the two female leads very well.Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas really make this movie what it is. They have palpable charisma, and they provide Reeves excellent scenarios to react to. The dialogue could sound outlandish and childish if read in a different context, but Izzo and de Armas pull it all off with a straight face and their character's intentions progress to the downright sinister. It's actually interesting subject matter, and Roth does have something to say with this film, and I believe he accomplishes it elegantly with as little blood as possible.Knock Knock is not perfect - it goes on for a few minutes too long and sometimes Reeves reads lines as if he'd just shot up heroin, but it's intriguing and truly captivating once it gets going and becomes a psychological horror house in its finest moments. Callously covering up a dead body with papier-mâché? That's chilling. Being buried alive? Macabre. It's nice to see Roth hasn't lost his touch, and the humor is definitely there intentional or not. I highly recommend this movie to fans of home invasion thrillers. Just don't go in expecting a polished masterpiece; Knock Knock is depraved, raw and filthy in the best ways possible.",Knock Knock

102,Condemned-Soul,Sub-par horror entry with an insulting ending,5,29 August 2017,"The viewer is going to feel like they've experienced what Keanu Reeves' protagonist endured by the time the credits roll (minus the steamy threesome in the middle). It's torturous, we get that. But we get lumbered with a different kind of agony. A kind that involves watching all the mistakes unfold because the weak screenplay said so.So let's start from the beginning. Keanu Reeves is left at home on Father's Day whilst his wife and kids go the beach for a couple of days, leaving him with his work to get on with. He's happily married, living comfortably, and seems an all-round good Dad. During the night, a couple of young ladies (teenagers? Unsure on that) knock at his door, asking for brief refuge from the pouring rain whilst they await a taxi. Keanu gets seduced and their friendliness gets more friendly. He makes a mistake, and instantly regrets it when the nightmare aftermath begins. An act with unforeseen and devastating consequences.The first half is the best part of the whole film. It imbues the atmosphere with a certain dread, steadily getting ready to drop us into a pit of horror, but when it does, we instantly regret watching the film altogether. It degrades into a lengthy, dull torture episode filled with poor writing and lazy thrills, hammering home its message of wrongdoing until we are practically bludgeoned to death with it. Keanu Reeves is sadly miscast here, not able to bring the right amount of emotion that many of his scenes demand, though he isn't helped by some terrible dialogue. His acting skills are better off elsewhere. The worst part of the movie though is our female antagonists. They are so frustrating and irritating, we only pray that Reeves will unleash a gratifying, slow, painful death upon them at the end. Nope. Forget it. Unforgivably, it doesn't happen. We, as the viewer, don't even get a reward for putting up with such grating dialogue exchanges and pathetic sociopathic behaviour. A place in one of Jigsaw's many traps, or in Eli Roth's hostel dungeons of masochism would be apt end points for these two abominations, but no. We get an anti-climactic ending which leaves us annoyed, and quite frankly, insulted. Annoyed that we stayed and waited for a cathartic outcome for our bound and gagged hero, and annoyed that we even pressed play in the first place. 5/10",Knock Knock

These two women are two of the most obnoxious characters that I have ever seen in a film, and we are forced to listen to them try and do their best impressions of a crazy person for an hour and forty minutes.Roth uses ever cliché in the book to keep Evan in the grasps of his annoying captors. It gets to the point where the movie is just so dumb and unrealistic that it is actually physically frustrating. I found myself fighting to not turn off the film, I stuck with it hoping that there would be some big pay off, but nope. It all leads up to a very underwhelming and stupid ending. Imagine if the film ""Funny Games"" replaced the two twisted killers with two annoying females, and then you have ""Knock Knock""I am a big Eli Roth fan, I have been since I saw Cabin Fever. I have enjoyed every film he has directed and I even liked ""Aftershock"", a film that he wrote the screenplay for. I have defended a lot of his films to people who call him a hack, because in my opinion all his movies before this have had a nice charm to them that made them a little bit more than just gore movies. The charm and the gore is gone in ""Knock Knock"" and there is no way I can defend this one.It really does bum me out to write a review trashing a Eli Roth film because he is one of the few horror directors we have left and up until now he has done a pretty good job.

Even if, as the filmmakers seem to believe, he deserves it because he allowed himself (very unwillingly) to be seduced (by two sirens who refuse to take ""no"" for an answer), that doesn't explain, excuse, or justify why his loving wife and children need to be punished too.

This is not acting, this is plain crap that should not be viewed by anyone. Save yourselves by watching something..anything but this. I should have watched the Street lights and got more entertainment. What on earth were these actors thinking. Eli Roth, what a disappointment!!!! .. u owe me an hour of my life back!!! I don't get how a man could not fight back against these tarts, or why he let them inside in the first place. These actresses should go back to waitress. Worst ever!!!!!",Knock Knock

124,tstudstrup,"The girls are hot, everything else is not...",1,1 September 2016,"*SPOILER AHEAD*Eli Roth had one good movie in him: the original Hostel. Everything before and after sucks. Including Knock Knock. After John Wick, I started to respect Keanu Reeves again. But in this movie, he delivers a performance worse than... well everything else he has ever done. But his wooden terrible performance is not the worst part.No the worst part are the shameless product placement of Apples crappy phones, tablets and computers. How they even have to be mentioned over and over again + we have to see an app that can call a cab and that a wet iPhone can be dried in a bowl of rice. + of course Evan's (Reeves) DJ equipment. It made me sick. The second worst part is how ridiculous it is how easy it is for the two girls to overpower a man twice their size. How Keanu's art-dealer friend is so incredibly stupid that he actually kills himself, without those girls ever even touching him. The third worst part is that it's never scary. Just unintentionally funny and even boring once the sex scenes and the nudity is over. I don't know if Eli Roth was trying to copy Fatal Attraction, but I think he was more occupied with finding two hot girls, marrying one of them in real life and jack off to the sex-scenes, than he was with finding good actresses that could act as psychotic as they're hot.It tries to come off as a serious erotic thriller, but it fails completely. Evan (Reeves) is so stupid that he deserves everything that he has coming. It might have been a little scary if the girls had actually tried to kill him instead of just tying him up and torture him a little bit. Or if they had allowed his family to come home and then have the girls return and terrorize him and his family. Or Evan could have killed both girls in the end to cover up his infidelity. Only not get away with it in the end. Anything other than the actual pathetic ending. The fact that the entire cast, except Keanu and 4 other actors, are unknown European actors, that we've never heard of before and probably never will again, says it all. And how pathetic is it that Keanu plays a character 7 years younger than his actual age at that time. And the exact same age as Eli Roth. Again this is probably Roth's fantasy and since he could only marry one of the girls (the brunette) he made his fantasy come true by making a movie that would have been great if it had been actual porn. At least we would have seen more nudity and actual screwing. Instead of most of the sex scenes seen through a steamy shower window. And the bad acting would have been expected. Pathetic!! Eli Roth should never be allowed to make movies ever again!!",Knock Knock
125,cmovies-99674,"You could find really high notes, but there was also very low notes as well.",7,12 August 2017,"PROS: The one pro was how well the movie was built/progressed. There was this constant sense of illuminating fear, and so many wtf moments that you couldn't even grasp at what the characters intentions were, you were just sent on a roller coaster of emotions. This could be really good, but it could also be bad. In this movie in particular it was very interesting. The way the characters changed really highlighted the shear amount of insanity that was taking place. There was no point in the film where I felt easy. I liked that. The music, and the way the film was shot was quite captivating. You could feel that the director had a really good sense of what a psychological horror movie should be.CONS: A large negative in this movie was the acting. Keanu Reeves, who played EVAN, really had a hard time at grasping the role he was given. The way he moved around the set was nice, but other than that the delivery of his dialogue was very shoddy. The female actors were very OK as well. With the roles that they had there wasn't many limits, and I was frustrated that they stayed in the box as much as they did. The main female actors could've benefited from some sort of back story. You were given so little and that made it hard to understand there intentions on a deeper level. The other thing that was aggravating was the conclusion. It felt very thrown together. I liked the way that it revealed more about the characters, but I also hated how unplanned it felt.www.chorror.com",Knock Knock

Why on earth did Keanu make this film. Without him this movie would have been an immediate to video piece of junk. Written by a moron with child like mentality. Makes one wonder why he would do this filmThe whole premise is insane and has no point whatsoever. The girls seduce and almost force a married man to have sex and think that is okay and then turn on him. Wow.. what has happened to Hollywood to green light this type of junk. I want my 2 hours back and hope nobody else watches this crap. Even Ana de Armas is a waste of a pretty face and acts like an imbecile. No surprise it bombed at the theatre.Eli Roth must be pretty desperate to make a movie like this. At least Hostel had a decent premise and resonated but this one is terrible.

128,drael64,Really plot-hole filled and strange,1,18 October 2015,"The reliance on a publicly posted rape video (where evan, the main character was retrained, and clearly distressed) for some form of blackmail didn't make any sense, and only incriminated the girls.Basically, the girls, in this film, are invited in, out of the rain, to make a phone call/get dry and then they proceed to have sex with the family man, the main character. It's not a clever film. It's campy. So we have these campy, kind of annoying, obviously untrustworthy villanesses - who are so annoying and seemingly shifty, I am not sure any older man, unless expressly niave would be attracted to them - and the victim, who is hopelessly hopeless - couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, or reason his way through a crossword. The only evidence they leave, is that they tortured the perp, DNA all of the apartment, and a video of them raping the main character - which is supposed to be blackmail, but is just court admissable evidence against them. The family, finding all that, would just feel bad for the raped, and burgled husband, and presumably he'd get therapy.But maybe I am just missing this low brow, campiness, and it's supposed value, but the movie isn't sexy, scary or funny. If it was more serious, and painted the psychopath girls as more evil, or the main character as more scared or traumatised - perhaps, but as it is, the movie took a serious topic, and a moral question, and answered all of that with campy frivilousity. It strikes as a movie that could have been about the legal lattitude of women to be criminals - like gone girl, or the twistedness of a vengeful mind. But as a campy, sort of ""scream"" like comedic tone, it really doesn't work for the subject matter. Plus, the plot is unbelievable, in a number of areas",Knock Knock
129,arturmachado-29588,"""Funny Games"" With Girls",3,4 September 2017,"Keanu Reeves demonstrates once again how to be a bad actor - and the rest of the cast does not help. He plays the role of a family man who, due to unexpected work at the last hour, has to stay home for the weekend while the rest of the family is taking advantage of what has already been booked. Being home alone, in the middle of the night two lost and totally drenched girls knock at the door, far from where they should have gone and, very conveniently, without batteries in their cell phones. He lets them in to call for a taxi, but what started as a gesture of goodwill soon turns into a game of seduction provoked by the girls which, of course, ends up in sex. The next day, what was to be a unique night begins to turn into a psychotic weekend.I think this film is an allegory to modern Western society, in which women are allowed everything because they will always be forgiven for... being women; so they know they can be silly and evil and cause all kinds of psychological terror just for the pleasure of being silly and evil and provoke all kinds of psychological terror because in the end they know they always go unpunished, except in extreme cases, but even then comes a 'women's honor' defendant saying that if she went violent it is because she had reasons for it; but when it is the other way around, does that question even poses? Just something to think about.As for the film itself, nothing that has not been seen before in others of the 'home invasion' genre, but this time with girls. Wait... ""HardCandy"", but there it was only one. This movie could also be called ""Funny Games With Girls"" or ""Be Afraid of Teenage Girls"", titles that convey much better what the film is about.",Knock Knock

This started off painfully slow as it showed the happy life of a supposedly devoted family man (""I love you....no, I love you more...smooch smooch.....""). But then it does pick up when the ""girls"" enter. I think for an architect, he was either not very bright or very naive, as their psychosis was apparent from within several minutes of them being inside the house. Things got very suspenseful and then turned a little sadistic, which I did not like. But then it got better. Overall, some of the scenes were a little too sadistic for my taste, but I did like Keanu in this. It is quite a dark movie. The acting by the girls was good.",Knock Knock

It belongs to a very special movie category. It's a kind of movie which exposes an actor to his dedicated fans, it just shows everybody what a terrible actor he is.It also exposes the great job all the directors did to hide this terrible actor. If it wasn't for them, Keeanu would have probably ended up playing records on weddings and taverns. His performance is as stiff as a 2 weeks old roadkill covered in cement and thrown to the ocean.Furthermore, as far as the ""female"" actors in this movie are concerned, I can't really say anything about them except that they were just being themselves. Absolutely no acting there at all. Can't say if that's good or bad. It's a really weird idea to hire non actors and pay them to be bad actors. That's how the women felt like to me from start to finish.The script was taken off the wall of a public toilet, thank God we didn't endure that public toilet odor as we did with it's spoken words.This movie is a disgrace even to the old slasher movies which also featured boobs and sex, for the obvious reasons. Couldn't they just show us the boobs and spare us the rest of this terrible film ?The impact this film had on me is like someone farts in your car and you can't open the windows.

Evan lets them come in and what started out as innocent encounter turns into a bizarre time for Evan.

The ending shows no resolution and when the family comes back from the beach, the little boy exclaims as the wife opens the door, ""Daddy had a party."" Fade to black.

But how much do you want to bet, they all watched it all the way to the end? My friends and I laughed all the way through.This movie is like the car wreck everbody slows down to see. Nobody wants to see possible devastation. But they can't look away.The female leads are beautiful, sexy and they do a great job of acting, inspite of the ridiculous script.Yes, the plot holes are big enough to drive an aircraft carrier through.PLOT HOLES;
1) Yes, it's plausible a happily married man could be seduced by two beautiful and sexy girls. Yes, it's plausible he would be vulnerable to blackmail to try to keep his adulterous discretion a secret. But most men would never let it go this far. Maybe a couple hundred dollars. But that's it.2) How do these two little girls keep overpowering this big man? The Keanu Reeves' character is twice the size and strength of these two little girls. He's stong enough to grab them by the neck and pin them against the wall. But then he's all tied up and being terrorized, over and over again.
At the end they give him a chance to escape. He goes into the kitchen and grabs a knife and a pot. Then in broad daylight, he leaves his own house, and goes into his own backyard, trips over a bright red handtruck, laying across a sunlite beige sidewalk, drops the knife and pot --- next thing he's tied up again. How do these little girls keep overpowering this big guy?3) The girls confess in the end they do this all the time and the guys never say no (which is probably a little hyperbolic). How do they continually get away with it? Most men are stong enough to overpower them. The Keanu Reeves' character has now lost everything --- his wife, his kids, his marriage, his family, his house, his coveted record collection, his reputation, and probably his job. What does he have to lose? What's to keep him from telling the cops everything?
The house is trashed, he's injured, his wife's business associate is dead, and he's buried up to his neck in the backyard. He didn't bury himself.
And last but not least, the girls posted the video of them raping him, while he's tied to the bedposts, on Facebook for the whole world to see. Their DNA must be all over the house. The video clearly shows their faces.
The cops have everything they need to arrest them for breaking and entering, massive property damage, extortion, violent assault, theft (they stole the family dog), and negligent homicide. They could never get away with doing this over and over.This movie is stupid, ridiculous, and nonsensical. But it's entertaining in a B movie type of way.",Knock Knock

138,Krackoon,"Thanks, John Wick.",3,10 October 2015,"Thanks to John Wick, which I completely enjoyed, and Keanu Reeve's once in a lifetime performance, we're now stuck with the guy for probably another ten years.If you read the reviews, or the 'Knock Knock' forum here at IMDb, you'll see people asking 'was Keanu acting bad on purpose?' Why are people oblivious to the fact that Keanu Reeves has been acting terrible since the mid eighties? How does Nic Cage get so much heat for being worthless on screen, yet Mr. Reeves seems to slip by without anyone noticing? It's baffling, really. When I saw the trio of Eli Roth, Keanu Reeves, and Lorenza Izzo (who is the equivalent of Sheri Moon Zombie in every single Rob Zombie film,) I knew Evan Webber wasn't the only person in for a night of pure torture.We're lead to believe that 'Knock Knock' wants to be a slapstick home invasion thriller, but in order for that to be the case, wouldn't these actors have to be capable of being something other than awful? Some of you out there want to believe that the acting, the writing, the casting was done for the purpose of humor - I'm not buying it. If that's the case, I'm sure 'Green Inferno' will be one of the best comedies of the year, since we're to believe that Eli Roth's sole purpose of making films, is to make them terrible. Eli Roth is just Uwe Boll with a larger bank account - I remember the same being said about Uwe, but if you ask the man, he'll tell you straight, that he tries making the best films he can. He's just not talented enough to accomplish it. That's also Eli Roth's issue. No one wants to be bad at what they do.Random Ramblings of a Madman: Keanu Reeves has been known for his questionable work ethic, and his lack of professionalism for a while. 'John Wick,' as good as it is, does not erase the complete and utter trash that this guy creates on screen, nor does it make 'Knock Knock' a campy fun flick. It's actually one of the worst films of 2015. And I won't take part in crediting these people for ''trying'' to be worthless.",Knock Knock
139,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,Father's Day has never bee scarier!,3,22 September 2016,"Remember When We All Thought Eli Roth Was Going to Be The Next Wes Craven?Knock Knock (2016) Review/RantRemember when we all though writer, producer, and director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever, Hostel) was going to be the next Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream)? His early films, like Cabin Fever and Hostel, were fun, scary, funny, and Eli Roth had an amazing start and career into the world of horror films. Fast forward a few years, and I now have a love hate relationship with this person. Aftershock was in my opinion a decent film the first time I saw it. After viewing it again, the film is not as good. It is pretty much the cast of the Hangover in a very mediocre horror film. The Green Inferno, could have been so much more. However, from what he delivered, I thought once again it was just decent. I actually like Eli Roth; he is one of my favorite directors, seems like a cool guy, reminds me of myself in a way, he is a good writer, and has a passion for the art of film. However, Knock Knock is one of the worst ""horror"" films I have seen in a long time. Eli Roth was the master of horror at one point in his career. Now, he can make, star, write, and produce a movie and no one cares! With all due respect, what happened?! Who is to Blame?Ever since 2012, Eli Roth has collaborated himself with the same cast and crew of people. I do not know if it is his partnership with Nicolas Lopez that has lead to his downfall, or Mr. Roth himself. Aftershock, The Green Inferno, Knock Knock, the remake of Cabin Fever, have all suffered horribly, and the positive ratings just get lower and lower. They actually cannot get any lower; the remake of Cabin Fever has a zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes!Knock Knock is the worst film he has done! If I were him, I would go back to my roots of filmmaking. I am not going to get deep into the plot, because it is not worth talking about.The film is poorly written, the acting is atrocious (especially by Keanu Reeves), the young girls come off as annoying instead of horrifying, it is not scary, it is cheesy, and just bad. Instead of writing good material for Reeves that makes him interesting and or relatable, they take the easy way out. We are suppose to like him because, he has a nice suburban home, gets his family portraits done at the local Sears, we have many family pictures on the wall, the camera many zooms through the interior of the house showing you more pictures of the family, it is father's day and he is a father, we play sappy music, and from that we are suppose to like him/understand him? It is lazy, badly written, and the filmmakers saying, ""The audience will like him, because he has a family, and the viewer has a family too"". The only two things I liked was the song at the end. The Pixies – ""where is my mind?"" it made me think of the ending to Fight Club, a much better movie. Also, the actress Ana de Armas. She was actually a good actress, she tried, talented, she has nice eyes, and is easy on the eyes. I do not think this movie is worth viewing ever again! The movie is so bad, that we were literally laughing our butts off. I do not like ranting on movies and the talented hardworking people behind them, because I respect the art form. On the other hand, this is not worth viewing even on a bad movie night. This film could have been so much more; it could have been like Hard Candy's demonic cousin.

He can act, he shows emotion. I could feel his pain through the screen and the torture he was going through. I could feel what he was going through and hence made me hate the film.Second, the movie shows he has a injured shoulder so would be weaker around the girls. As another poster said, I really want a revenge sequel. I am just not satisfied with this ending. The movie would have been a lot better if after he is left to be found. He gets all John Wick on the intruders and gives the little cows what they deserve.What really bugged me about the movie though, is #spoiler alert# if they weren't planning on killing Keanu Reeves, why did they purposefully kill the friend. Although it's meant to come across as ""not their fault, he fell"", they knew he had asthma, took his pump, made him need it, and jump for it. He probably fell because he couldn't breath. That really bugged me.Also if Keanu Reeves was a bad ""dad"" and person as they suggest, why did they ruin all his WIFES art, I get why they would destroy his music but why all his WIFES and innocent children's things and write curse words over his children's pictures.I hated this film, because it made me cringe. I really wanted the girls to be dealt with and I really hate that they just walked away. It made me give this movie a 4/10 because its so frustrating and unsatisfying. Maybe if Keanu Reeves character was actually a bad person, then yea this movie would work, BUT NO, he was a good person on the most part (sure he cheated, but he didn't go out of his way to cheat. You are sympathetic towards Keanu. He didn't deserve everything that happened). The girls were annoying, loud, crazy, psychopaths.. argh I hate them.

This is how I feel about almost all of Eli Roth's films, which are mostly depraved, but force you to look at tough moral quandries.Even the most milquetoast individuals, portrayed very well in this case by Keanu, have insane fantasies that look something like the first 20 minutes of this movie. The rest of this movie shows what happens when we indulge those fantasies; usually depravity and horror ensues. Maybe you glance at your wife with a smile while you're really thinking about hooking up with the hot girl in the yoga pants...Have you ever followed that scenario to its logical conclusion? What would you stand to lose? This movie, while almost absurdly overdone, makes you wonder.There are also subtle winks and nods to the debauchery of Hollywood and how they ""use girls"" and toss them aside. This is interesting because it was right only a year or two before news about Weinstein finally broke out. You have to wonder if Roth was signaling some disdain with the perverse Hollywood crowd. Maybe that's a reach.

He has a nice job and a great home.Everything is turned upside down as two young women knock at his door while the rest of the family is away, seduce him and then pretend that he is a pedophile. As they keep torturing him and destroy more and more of his house and life, it becomes clear that they are deranged, evil psychos.Nothing that you haven't seen before. The surprise in this movie (and probably the reason why so many people hate it) is the message. The movie gives you the impression that it suggests that Keanu Reeves really was a pedophile, terrible father etc. and that he deserved whatever he got. This is furthermore confirmed by the two psycho-girls getting away with everything they done and the attempt to turn the ending scene into something silly and funny.This is just wrong. And this kept me from giving the movie more stars. But if you can ignore the questionable morale views of ""Knock Knock"" and focus on the story, you will find yourself well entertained. The performance of the young women was great. Sick and twisted beyond good and evil. Keanu Reeves was decent for most parts, but he got a bit too whiney towards the end.Anyway, the amount of tension was enjoyable.

Bad acting, confusing plot, with a few interesting scenes and scenarios.Well, unfortunately, you only get 1/2 your expectations.The premise is ridiculous, a father of the year candidate is 'accosted' by 2 unbelievably good looking woman (or are they only girls, sorry to ruin the hugely irreverent plot twist) who want to have sex with him and make super fun parties. The one true shining star of this movie is the charisma of its 2 lead actresses, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. Both take a terrible script and baffling directing choices and were the only reason I did not turn the movie off immediately.Reeves who is a perennial Razzy contender might finally snag one with his 'performance' in this film.An Eli Roth movie will have gruesome violence, mixed in with a sense of humour and push boundaries. This movie is lazy, and neither promises or delivers anything.We enter this movie with questions such as, ""What is going to happen?"" We end with the question, ""What the hell just happened?""

But since then he hasn't been able to find a role for a weird, stiff, plastic moron and yet he's made a career for himself. Hard to understand. The film is 90 minutes and the first half hour was the most excruciating period of time I've spent in a long time. You could honestly pick up a bum on the street, get him to read these lines, and he'd do a better job than Keanu Reeves. The only time he doesn't act stiff is when two young girls in bathrobes are dancing around his living room which is exactly when he SHOULD be acting stuff.

Then get a high off of ruining their victims lives for submitting to ridiculous temptations against their vows. Insanely unrealistic premise, designed to make men look like weak perverted creatures unable to succumb to the awesome sexuality that is women.
Another reason why this is ridiculously stupid is because the two women who enjoy flirting with send seducing Evan (Keanu Reeves), and then punishing him for failing to refuse sex that's literally forced on him is because these two women are leaving forensic evidence absolutely everywhere in this man's house. Besides the fingerprints, hair, and everything else they left behind in this house, I'm sure victims would have Ring cameras or other surveillance equipment in their well off houses.

Whatever ambivalence there was, it was made null and void by the absurdity of the situation.Even accepting the ""good, unsuspecting Samaritan"" premise, no man in his right mind would have bought those girls were 15! And who wouldn't have thrown them out long BEFORE they could have had a chance to work their sexual magic on him? Not to mention the defense would have had a field day with housebreaking, assault and battery, property damage...Bottom line: the movie isn't scary, isn't thought-provoking, isn't even morbidly gory (like other Roth's works)...

162,TheBarleyGuy,Further Proof That Eli Roth is Terrible,1,18 December 2015,"Holy sh*t do I hate Eli Roth movies. Ever since Hostel and Cabin Fever I've found his films to border on the unwatchable, and yet I watched this one (and fully plan to watch Green Inferno), knowing that I wasn't likely to enjoy them. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, or maybe I just like spreading the Eli Roth is not very good gospel to anyone who will listen. So, what about this one?It's not good, at all.We start the movie having Keanu Reeve's being a ""family man"" shoved into our faces for an unbearably long time as we take a tour of his house, which is plastered with photos of the family, evidence of children and family is practically wallpaper in this house, and then we see Keanu and his wife have an attempt to have sex interrupted by this extremely loving children who have prepared a cake for father's day, and they all spend a solid 15 minutes of the movie talking about FATHER'S DAY, and LOVING DADDY, AND HOORAY FOR DAD ETC ETC, until you feel like you just might throw up. They also introduce us to the family dog (who somehow makes it to the end) and to a VERY IMPORTANT WORK OF ART THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT (which is smashed with hammers, obviously). So, with that extremely subtle set up, Keanu is left home alone when his family goes on a trip without him (for some reason), and the movie actually starts.This has to be one of Roth's more gutless films, we've grown accustomed to his brutal gore and violence, but this one is surprisingly void of that. Instead, we have one death that is minor and Keanu even makes it all the way to the end, and the girls get no comeuppance either. After having a weird Keanu Reeves threesome, the girls reveal that they are 15 years old and Keanu is now a pedophile, which seems like it might be the bold line that this movie takes, sort of a Hard Candy type story, but even that turns out to be untrue when (spoiler alert) the girls admit to being in their 20s.The acting is awful, the story is garbage, and it's really hard to get yourself invested in the movie at any point. Even when you think the girls are as young as they claim to be, you find yourself wondering how the hell they were able to subdue a full grown Keanu Reeves more than three f**king times in the movie. In the end, because who cares, they post a video of one of the girls having sex with Keanu (while he is tied to a bed and protesting), as proof that Keanu is a horrible monster, on Facebook (becauseFacebook), and of course people start responding in horror and disgust. The girls leave him buried up to his neck in the back yard and run along scott free, while Keanu frees a hand (somehow) and accidentally likes the sex video instead of deleting it. Is is that a joke Eli Roth? Because it's not funny.Hands down, this is one of the most offensively bad movies that I've seen in a long time, and you're much better off to skip it. Check out John Wick instead, that movie is f**king awesome. Look forward to seeing your next one Roth, I'm sure it'll be a masterpiece.www.barleydoeshorror.com",Knock Knock

Well, forget about the fun part. The pivotal sex scene (NOT a spoiler since its central to the ad campaign) is shot in an arty way that robs it of any enjoyment for the viewer. I can only speculate that this was done because the director, Eli Roth, is married to one of the nude actresses (actually, we're not even sure it's really her in the scene due to the gauzy lens/quick cut way it was shot). So without any good sex as a ""reward"" or ""benefit"" we're forced to ask is the punishment in line with this night of illicit pleasure.The answer is a resounding: Who Cares? Reeves performance is so wooden and weird, I'm surprised he wasn't at least nominated for a Razzie. And all other aspects of the script, from the hokey, wholesome, loving family set up to the preposterous scam the young ladies are running leave the viewer with head- scratching, web-surfing boredom.

But... he was clearly attacked and assaulted. I'm sure he has a big bruise from being conked on the head and probably various scratches and other signs of attack. Probably more scratches than typical from voluntarily aggressive sex play. The evidence should support his story of involuntary fornication!The girls have admitted to being 18 or older. And the video they posted on his Facebook page shows him bound to the bed. He can always deny he's a fetishist and just claim that everything was forced upon him, which sounds somewhat plausible based on the condition the house has been left in. The vandalism should be easy to pin on them based off handscrawling analysis and fingerprints. Plus didn't the two girls effectively kill the assistant who came by to get the wife's art by withholding his inhaler? That's on them, for sure. Plus Keanu didn't bury himself in the ground up to his neck! (False imprisonment? Maybe even kidnapping??) They're going to have a lot of ""splaining"" to do if the cops catch up with them and they don't seem the type to be able to vanish quietly into the mists. I'd suggest double insanity pleas and maybe visiting the judge after hours if they get bail.Yes, it will take some mighty fast-talking by Keanu to get out of this mess with survivable damage. But he has plenty of time to work on his story as he gets dug out of the ground. Don't forget, in his defense, there's a record he called for a ride for the girls the night before to get them the heck out of his house, too.

Usually there's a element of camp to bad horror but Eli Roth is simply an arrogant maladjusted attention seeker with nothing useful to offer humanity. His psychopathic behavior appears to be consistent with the traits common to most criminals, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, the need for control, and predatory behavior. There is not a single shred of anything redeeming in his work. Seriously, what happened to this guy? Was it lack of attention during his upbringing? Bullying at school? Poor potty training? What created such a useless psychotic troll as Eli Roth? He makes his movies so people know he exists as an immature, callous, inconsiderate and pitiful human. The truly insulting thing is he stands there like a smiling, petulant 8-year old saying that's the reaction he wants.

With a storm beating down on the house for much of the movie, and with the movies later ominous tone, there wasnt much punch to anything. The only positives were the soundtrack.

180,pendenquejohn,Not as bad. Fighting the general consensus...,6,28 December 2016,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews on this movie and quite frankly most are a little bit exaggerated. Obviously, this is not the masterpiece that everyone was waiting for but I did find some strong points.The main one to me stands on the emotional aspect. It was difficult not feeling some empathy for the guy after some time in the movie. The whole event seemed to be taking place for an eternity and never seems to get a break. After all, he was the ""good"" man who got invaded by hot girls and made that singular error of having some fun with them.I would guess that this movie tried probably teaching a lesson to unfaithful guys in terms of the 'extreme' consequences he would cause by just having a little bit of fun. Then most critics say the acting was bad, however I kind of see what the writers wanted to do with the girls in particular. They are clearly deranged and bipolar -; certainly bordering lunacy. Them taking drugs would have been the icing on the cake and would have probably given similar result. Crazy people aren't predictable and that's probably the best result you can get from such people. There was no particular logic to what they were doing other than just screaming and being outrageous at every moment.At first, you have the impression that they were victims of sexual abuse in their teenage days, or that a boyfriend mistreated them somehow only to discover the whole moral behind their quest which seems to be being the ""superwomen"" that defeat cheating men.I do admit the delirium into which these girls were at times, made the film unsustainable at times but I tend to believe that this was the effect that the writers were searching for. I think they were really trying to play to the spectators (maybe too much?). Trying to understand the psychology of these girls is extremely complicated. They often navigated between teenage insanity, childish incoherent talk and mature adult craziness. It was complicated to keep track. Ana de Armas clearly had the childish role counterbalanced by her villain associate Lorenza Izzo which I felt had the most maturity.I feel the movie failed to explain to the spectator the history of these girls and why exactly they were doing that. They touted many times towards pedophilia to a point where one could believe that the family guy had a history concerning that. The movie stayed for the most on the surface and did not look to develop on these girls nor the guy.The main problem to me regards the fact that nobody still knows up to this date what was the main reason for which these girls crucify guys. The lack of depth does make the movie seem a little bit empty in that regards.The broad paint with which they painted guys at the end with the ""guys never say no"" is vastly false. There are lots of houses or areas in which people would have never accepted two random girls out of nowhere, especially if the area in which the family guy lives (being an architect), rarely see these kinds of occurrences. His wife did not satisfy him and he just subjectively saw an opportunity to have some pleasure.I would not call this an atrocious movie. I found myself to be somehow emotionally engaged and for that I'll give it a 6. That's quite generous to say the least but that was the main feeling I had as soon as finished watching the thing.",Knock Knock

182,Bryan_Roderick,Textbook Chaotic Evil,7,23 April 2016,"Knock KnockI'm at a loss for words with this film. Let me see if I can muster up some comparisons. Eli Roth loves to add in foreshadowing into his films. I wish things were not so predictable though, but Eli shows he can really write characters well.Genesis played by Lorenza Izzo, who was also in Green Inferno, show her range in that she can play both the innocent virgin in Green Inferno and the very definition of Chaotic Evil in Knock Knock.Bell played by Ana de Armas was seriously crazy. I mean textbook thrown into a vat of melted lead, crazy. I look forward to seeing her performance in War Dogs.As promised: the comparisons. I think the best comparison for this film is Scream, in that the villains of the movie are seriously messed up in the head and are willing to do the most extreme measures to see to their perfect ending and are truly methodical with how they unfold their diabolic plan.Ladies, you're gonna hate the first act. Just saying. My wife couldn't make it through the first act. Ann Frank could see what was coming. (Referencing: Clerks II)Verdict: Watch it. It keeps you wanting to know how it's going to end.

Although I found the acting to be good, unlike some of the other reviewers here, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

I bought this as a PPV at 8:15 on a Thursday morning, and I'm writing this 1 minute after I've finished watching, at 3:16 p.m. It literally took me 7 hours to get through this pig without being distracted by, say, trimming my eyebrows. Questions: 1. Why, after 30 years has Reeves not perfected his craft? 2. Why has he not made more movies that were ""accidentally"" good. The Lake House had charm. Speed had tension, and The Matrix had, well, everyone else that was IN The Matrix. John Wick was stylistically cool but when I quipped to my friend that I was going to ""look for a good Keanu Reeves movie to watch tonight"", his defense of John Wick over and over was that ""...it's a Keanu movie!"" I realized what he was telling me: he understood my joke of finding a good Reeves movie but even if I'd been serious, such an endeavor would be futile. This movie starts out bad, the scenes with his family have you drowning in sappy syrup. It gets a bit interesting when we are anticipating the antagonist's role and plan for Keanu's character ""Evan"". Then, although the young actresses don't perform poorly, the joke is on us as the movie falls off the edge of the planet. I mean, wow this was bad. Reeves over acts when subtlety is called for, under-acts when he should be pushing a plot device..... it'd be like a writer misspelling every other word or an orator placing emphasis on the wrong syllables every sentence.

195,PandoraProductions4,bizarre,5,30 October 2015,"Eli Roth specializes in weird and twisted films, and this one is no exception. It is hard to understand what Roth was trying to accomplish with it, though. Is it a commentary on ultra-feminism, or a morality tale about how men can never say no to you-know-what?It reminds me of the film Hard Candy, which I didn't much care for either, but at least that one made more sense in terms of the characters. In that film the man was a paedophile, and the girl was kind-of nuts, but slightly more justified in her actions.In this story, the guy (Keanu Reeves), is a perfectly good man, happily married, and a loving father. Yet the crazy bitches (I'm allowed to say that, it was in the movie) who invade his home, and seduce him, are the real predators.There's moments of black humour throughout it that really worked. The last line made me laugh out loud.I think that a lot of people will hate this movie. Indeed it is very frustrating to watch, as Keanu gets tortured by these psychos. But I believe that is what Eli Roth was going for, so I have to give him props for that.As I said earlier, the film gives a lot of mixed messages. There's lines of dialogue that seem to relate to the concept that all men are sexual deviants, but I do not believe that this is the actual point of the movie. (Roth's wife is nearly 20 years his junior, after all, so he's in no position to talk about paedophilia).I'm more inclined to think that this is a reaction to many of the so-called feminists and man haters out there.Or maybe it's just meant to be trashy entertainment.Who knows.",Knock Knock

197,ReelBrew,"With his family away for the weekend, a man falls prey to the seductive yet treacherous means of two women who construct a deadly game of cat and mouse.",4,8 December 2015,"If you're Eli Roth, you know a thing or two about pushing boundaries, or buttons, depending on how fragile your moral tolerance is. When Roth exploded onto the scene with Cabin Fever (2002), a skin peeling romp through the backwoods that called to mind the likes of Tobe Hooper, fans of the genre immediately cast a keen eye on the director. It wasn't until Hostel (2005) that the filmmaker began developing a particular flair and vitality, turning towards a style many love to hate. Casting an overtly misogynistic and sophomoric tone over his films, Roth has worked to separate himself from the masses, as well as critical favoritism with a rigid focus on torture, mutilation, and sadism. It's an approach to this subject matter that I have defended countless times, firmly believing that there's more behind sliced tendons, frayed nerves and severed limbs than grotesquery and abuse for the sake of being able to show it. In the latest entry into the home-invasion thriller genre, Eli Roth has managed to set his buckets of blood and intestines on the back burner for a slower burn that manages a spark or two before fizzling into mediocrity. Shifting focus one too many times, Knock Knock manages thoughtless provocation with its blind view on sobering acts that should turn thought-provoking corners like a skilled home- invader. What it does instead is cut itself time and time again on its many plot devices, bleeding out before it's able to successfully build on its taut story.Quickly introducing us to Evan (Keanu Reeves), an architect who would appear to have it all; a loving wife, two adoring kids and a puppy named Monkey in a house he designed. Yet it's apparent that Evan and his wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) don't get the intimate time they crave given her busy schedule as an artist and two children abruptly pouncing them before they can even get dressed. For a couple that's fourteen years into a marriage, it all seems like a dream come true for anyone who grew up with parents that didn't separate, and yet we're placed with a predicament. Left alone for the long weekend to work while his family departs for the beach, Evan is quickly sidetracked by knocks at his door from two innocuous women, Genesis (Lorenzo Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) that are lost in search of a party in the suburban sprawl of Los Angeles. Soon he finds himself quickly battling more than worker's block as a night of unfaithfulness leads to a treacherous game of cat and mouse with his new house guests.Quickly ratcheting up suspense, Knock Knock paces itself methodically due in part to Eli Roth's slow hand camera, floating around the house like a prowler after the lights have been turned off. We become familiar with what Evan has designed, a piece of his mind laid out and the inevitable framework for which our cat and mouse maneuver through. Once the pacing of the film breaks away from its Hitchcockian roots, we realize how small our maze is, as our chase inevitably ends short lived, despite an excellent score by Manuel Riveiro backing every false step. It's a redundant exercise that plays out in front of us, where unnecessary footwork takes precedence over dialogue. It's a shame too, since childish antics and games take a front seat to a potential psychological death-match that would have amplified the terror and enhanced the dialogue tenfold.Eli Roth is a director that isn't afraid to show the most brutal of acts, often laying his pieces out in front for everyone to bear witness to. From diseased skin being shaved off to an Achilles heel being cut like a rubber band all the way to limbs being hacked off, Roth tends to revel in illuminating as much as possible, and with Knock Knock that's no different. Evans home is strewn with photos of his loving family, almost to the point of absurdity. His wife's sculptures stand in the backyard like sentries constructed to stand guard of the house (or keep watch on Evan). Everything that rests within Evan's design has a story, a history or personal memory that exists for us to discover. For fans of Roth's films, it's a motif that is cherished and embraced....Read more at www.reelbrew.tumblr.com",Knock Knock

200,LasKeepsItReal,Don't expect serious performances as this film is over the top!,7,10 November 2015,"I recently seen the thriller movie Knock Knock and here is my review on the film. There will be some minor spoilers throughout this review.The film is about a seemingly happily married couple Evan and Karen living with their two children, Karen is an artist and Evan is an architect. When Karen goes away for a weekend vacation with the children so that Evan can stay at home alone to work on a project, he is interrupted one evening by a knock at the door. Evan is greeted by two young women who introduce themselves as Genesis and Bel and after being in a rain storm need some help in order to contact a friend so that they can get an address to attend a party. Before long the conversation turns sexual and instead of Genesis and Bel taking the taxi waiting for them outside they seduce Evan and have sex. It is not until the morning that Evan realises he has made a mistake and when he sees the ladies are not respecting his home he gives them little choice but to leave his home promptly. Genesis and Bel are not prepared to take the treatment from Evan lightly they turn into the femme fatales from hell when they return to his house with vengeance in mind.I think for the majority of the film it was very straight forward and i don't think the film was supposed to be taken too seriously for the most part besides one or two controversial aspects which are revealed towards the end of the movie. It was still fun to watch at times and Genesis and Bel do shine in some fun and sometimes exaggerated scenes in the film when they are either violent or when they explain their behaviour. There was also one scene which was not supposed to be comedic although made me laugh when Evan completely lost his temper with the ladies and tried to turn the tables on them knowing full well he was partially to blame for the ongoing situation.In the final scenes the fate of Evan, Genesis and Bel is revealed and i thought it was an interesting one, it could have gone down the typical road of similar type films although the director chose to include a modern theme.I would give this film 7 out of 10!",Knock Knock

202,maruugaa,best 8$ ever spent in my life,10,10 May 2018,"I impulse bought this dvd curious as to what a big-name actor like Keanu Reeves was doing in what appeared to be a cheesy horror movie, also because I enjoy cheesy horror movies.
Omg, this movie was definitely not what I expected.
It was not a horror movie. It was a comedy. In fact, aside from the Austin Powers movies, this is probably the funniest thing I ever saw in my life.
The script and acting at the beginning are so bad yet funny including lines like, ""If Daddy doesn't work we'll have to live in a box"", and ""Monster been waiting three weeks"", and ""I know when I'm married my husband will want to sleep with other woman so I want to get used to having threesomes now.""The comes the crotch-grabbing bubble bath scene, and I was keeled over in hysterics for the rest of the movie.All the weapons the Bel and Genesis use to torture Evan are household items, such as tying him to a cheap wheely desk chair with an extension cord and gagging him with a pair of underwear. At one point Evan trips over a trolley, and the scene he's tied up with a garden hose and being transported to the backyard by said trolley.I can't decide between 2 parts as my favourites:
1) The part where Louis is texting at the door and for a split second you see Bel roll Evan tied to the wheely desk chair draped in a sheet by the window, or
2) Where he's neck deep in the group and trying to delete the facebook video of Bel going at him and accidentally hits the Like button.The fact that this is a remake(meaning someone in 1977 thought it would be a good idea to make a movie about a man getting raped and tortured by two hot babes half his age, and then someone in the 2014 decided this need to me remade for the younger generations made me laugh harder. As did the fact that it somehow stars a big name actor, and that so many people went to see this cuz of John Wick and were greatly enraged by what it was.I actually made a lot of my friends watch this movie.Eli Roth truly is an artist.(also, there's an alternate ending that parodies John Wick for all you people who only went to see this because of John Wick)",Knock Knock

Twisted, dark comedy and underneath that, brilliant, biting satire. Roth and Lopez don't spare anything or anyone. And because of that, reading the audience's reaction in reviews and tweets is about as entertaining as the movie itself.

At first sight some people might think all the negative reviews are for we are all so used to him playing a savior and some hero, but he had already played a normal kind of slow guy in the wonderful Henry's Crime, and he did a great job, so this movie was unnecessary in so many ways. I think he was just bored and at the time this was the only offer. I wish he had stuck with surfing, as I heard he took as a hobby ever since starring in Point Break, instead of doing this obscene low point of his lovely career.The movie isn't the worst ever, but it certainly is one of the very worsts of Reeves'. Boring plot with predictable plot twists and amateur acting, good for some newcomer in need for money with no other interesting offers. If this wasn't a Reeves movie, as a huge fan of his, I might have enjoyed it more.

This movie takes a lot of cues from other home invasion movies but still had its own flavor.I think this movie is exactly what it sets out to be, and nothing more: a kinda trashy thriller with attractive people doing weird things. That's it. And I thought it worked for the most part. Anyone who knows Roth's work will see it in this movie-it's just that he usually employs gore to make us uncomfortable, but this time it's...the bizarre. I enjoyed seeing him make a movie that didn't rely on gore at all.I genuinely laughed in many parts, and I think at least some of that humor was intentional. This is a solid B movie, not too much of a downer due to the great playful acting by Izzo and De Armas. Keanu Reeves feels pretty flat at first but it gets a bit better as the movie goes on. As another reviewer mentioned, if you're familiar with Nic Cage's ""not the bees"" meme, there's a scene in this movie with similar energy and I laughed pretty hard.This movie is pretty ridiculous, but that's kind of the point.

The premise sounded interesting. OK. So Keanu's character is supposed to be a young father with an adoring wife and kids and a great career. The film starts with an awkward seduction attempt by his wife that is interrupted by the overly-zealous kids showing up at the bedroom door. Keanu wants to continue later but is shot down even though ""it's been threeee weeks!"" Uh, oh. I hope no willing women show up at his door. Conveniently. the wife and kids are leaving town for the weekend and Keanu is left home alone. (It's ok to picture him with his hands on his cheeks here because it's kinda like that) This is when 2 young women show up at his door during a storm, wet and giggling. ""oh, no one else is around."" ""oh, they don't know their own telephone numbers."" OOPSIE! I can see where this is going. This film has more 1-star reviews then any I've ever looked up.Between that and the terrible, horrible, no-good acting from Mr Reeves I decide it's best to just turn this thing off and end it now. I know the ending from the other reviews and also know that MANY people share my disappointment with Keanu's acting as well as the abysmal Direction by Eli Roth.

214,lorraineesimpson,Well ...,5,17 July 2016,".. having read some of the other reviews on IMDb and seen it's low rating I was unsure about whether to watch this or not. However, there was nothing else on TV so I thought I would try it and see. Actually it's not great but it's not quite as bad as some of the other reviews suggest. It's reasonably watchable - I stuck it out till the end really because I was curious to see what would actually happen, so it did keep my attention, but the whole things is slightly bizarre.There are just so many holes in the story I can't even list them all but the most obvious is where are the neighbours? Yes I know the girls checked and no-one else is at home but that was the night before! It's 12 hours later or whatever and they're running round the garden smashing stuff up and screaming ... where IS everyone? And the taxi driver - he just turns up, they don't come out and he goes away? No banging on the door wanting payment for a wasted journey etc? Maybe that's how they do it in the US but you would never get away with that in the UK! The girls themselves are a weakness of the plot - both attractive enough but even the most horny bloke would surely find them annoying and not quite ""all there"" from the outset? Yet we are supposed to believe that this happily married family man, faithful for 14 years is seduced by them. The trouble with that is neither of them are alluring femme fatales - they're just nuts! However, I guess that's the underlying message of the whole film. All men are ruled by what's in their pants. Even the most stable, loving and loyal man will take it if it's handed to him on a plate (and he thinks he won't get caught of course).So the acting is pretty average. I don't really rate Keanu as an actor anyway and this film hasn't changed my view. The girls are okay but then the script probably calls for them to be OTT. There are very few characters in the film anyway and I imagine it would be hard for any of them to play this straight-faced.There are some really unpleasant bits, particularly the whole ""daddy"" thing but the sex is not particularly graphic. I did quite like the ending - it wasn't really what I expected which I like in a film.

216,zuitsuit,A good concept ruined by someone's ego,3,30 June 2019,"The movie starts with a concept interesting enough to grab you but then Roth and some of the performances drag it down to an almost a comic level.
The reverse rape scene is a stretch to have us believe that he would be semi-erect with this psychotic person on top of him and destroying his life and his house.
The scene with the art dealer suddenly trying to act all hard and ""street"" and dropping repeated f-bombs only to comically collapse in what is one of the most convoluted death scenes in cinema was cringeworthy for all of the wrong reasons.
The ending is supposed to leave us disturbed but by that point I had already expected that there wouldn't be any heroes for shock value and I felt ""meh!"".
I get the sense that if the film's makers were a little more mature or serious about the story it could've been really good.

217,noirink-12054,Knock Knock,4,2 November 2016,"Who is there? The Potential of this movie!Strange movie indeed. Not by its premise, but by its execution. There is not much story in the movie. But it could have been a great opportunity to be a character driven ""Kammerspiel"" like the movie Carnage. The concept seemed to be perfect for a modern horror film. In which the man is the victim, first of his desires and then for his (western?) apathy to deal with the whole situation.But then we see to beautiful models ""playing"" crazy girls AND in comparison to Keanu Reeves, they seemed at least authentic.I liked the idea to see Keanu Reeve playing something different than the usual hero. But the result was a sometimes almost silly, wooden performance. The character also was simply not sympathetic to me. So one does not feel any compassion for him and his situation. I assume that his character should have been portrayed as a man torn between lust, regret and desperation. But there was no subtle portrayal. He just switches his moods from scene to scene. His final breakdown in the movie looked almost ridiculous. There were tears, snot and spit Keanu Reeves gave everything. But his hairstyle remained perfect all the time. EVEN as the to girls torture him. They approach to disfigure his hair with a scissor and it is ending with them cutting off a couple of his curls.

The story could have had some merit IF there were any trained actors in it...oh wait, there was...but you would never know it. I thought I was watching a poorly directed high school play.I realize that when actors become big enough they sometimes get the urge to try out experimental ideas (al la Johnny Deep)...but this experiment was a dismal failure.Still I would have expected that actor with the talent of Mr. Reeves would have at least TRIED to earn his (I am assuming) very large pay check.

I had my reservations, but I still went into this excepting something at least decent.What I actually got was horrible acting from Keanu Reeves, lots of plot holes and a bad script, and two girls who were the only saving grace in the whole movie, thanks to their charisma and energy. To make matters worse, the audience is forced to sit through what I feel was a constant slight against men, based on some of the dialogue and overall feeling throughout the movie. At times, the usage of social media ""culture"" is so obvious and shoved into your face, that you can't help but roll your eyes.

224,dwuksta,Reeves hits rock bottom,3,11 October 2015,"Movie about a married father(Reeves) being left alone for the weekend. Two girls unexpectedly turn up on his doorstep on a rainy night and they are invited inside. While waiting for their ride to turn up, the girls quickly seduce him. They then go on to become more trouble than they were worth and it seems he is unable to get rid of them.Right from the start it looked and sounded B grade, the kids were wooden and the direction and dialogue was very badly staged, we didn't see much of the family except for the first few minutes, as they were just used to try and set the scene of a typical happy upper middle class family. It all felt very weak and transparent, even Reeves playfulness with his kids was bizarre, then he continued his moronic monster act, playfully begging for sex with his wife, who was a successful, but actually quite horrible sculptural artist.The overall acting by Reeves was really terrible, I lost count the amount of times he pathetically wailed ""Please, Please I love my family"" and would start sobbing. Many times during the film he has a chance to retaliate or escape and failed miserably, it was painful to watch, not exactly suspenseful, more like ridiculous. The Matrix is one of my all time fav movies, and it was clearly a great movie whomever played the role of Neo, cause he really struggled to be convincing. the girls were attractive, and both believable as sexual hustlers praying on older men, but when they turned on him, it lost a lot of credibility, became even more ridiculous with stupid Jeopardy type games with Reeves tied up in a hair, trashing the kitchen like 3 year olds. The whole point of the movie was a payback for something that had never really existed in the first place, he was a pedo, then he wasn't a pedo?. The movie plot lines really had basis for their actions except to prove that men won't say 'no' to rape, from 2 attractive, young, sex crazed women...doubt that anyone was surprised with that outcome. 1 star for the Spanish pop song, 1 star for the funny phone call to the wife, 1 for Reeves role in 'Parenthood' that still lingers with me, great movie.",Knock Knock

226,drgreenthumb1001,This is basically a remake of Death Game,3,12 January 2017,"Unfortunately, it would have been wiser to spend the money digitally remastering that movie then what we have here.Which is a disaster.When I read about this movie in 2015 with Reeves starring as the protagonist, my initial instinct was to stay away, my instincts were right. Unfortunately, my instincts were overcome by my discovery of Ana de Armas, after seeing her in War Dogs & Blind Alley, my desire to see more of her overcame my better instincts...WE do see for a few moments MORE of her so there is that...lolKeanu Reeves is completely out of his element here. The scenes with his family are awkward and cringe inducing, it doesn't help the dialogue in the Family scenes are awful. I can applaud him for wanting to take on a different role. (he had to Executive Produce to get that role) I fully believe he took this role knowing that it was different then anything he had done, as in this movie hes not the strong hero, hes the weak victim, so fans of Reeves are going to hate how weak his character is as well as the original ending.The dialogue in this movie is so bad. Reeves and Roths Girlfriend deliver them so badly, like I said before, ""cringe inducing"".Eli Roth has lost his exploitative touch.Im watching Death Game as I type this and while the camera work in the remake is MUCH better, and the shower scene is 10x better, the tension isn't there because Roth toned his movie down. Death Game is a much better Exploitation movie during a pre-PC time when they did exploitation movies MUCH BETTER. The girls are much bigger psycho's, and they are a lot sexier as they do it! Roth in turns seems to be afraid to show much skin and had them overdressed after the threesome.In Death Game they literally kill someone by beating his skull in! Collen Camp and SOndre Locke weren't tiny little teenagers either, it was simply more believable they could overpower their victim together. They were also not shy and there is a dress up scene where they tease their tied up victim...ELi Roth had two sexy girls and only one of them played sexy psycho well enough. (HINT IT Wasn't his GIRLFRIEND!) Also, Roth decides to have the one victim die ""ambiguously"", which lets the girls off the hook, so to speak, in what I think was a failed, secondary plot line to show they did this somewhat routinely and/or lead into the now defunct alternate ending. Either way it was a WEAK death scene.Death Games shows the girls as true blue psychos while Knock-Knock gives off a more PG-13, misandry vibe, albeit with a much more memorable ending...I take that back I just saw it and in Death Games, the ending IS better! SPOILER ALERT!!!! They have the girls right after leaving get hit by an SPCA van, they had killed his cat earlier in the movie! Man, Death Game even did the camp better then Knock Knock!Something tells me that ""Alternate Ending"" in Knock, Knock was supposed to be in the original movie, whether as the original ending(Doubtful) or as an End Credits Scene (more likely IMO.) It also shows the girls as bigger psycho's as you see them torturing another man, but now they have switched roles, clothing, hair etc. It also lets you know John Wick gets his revenge.Instead Roth went with the Very Bad Things ending, except not funny, just horrifying. Too bad it took so long, and was such an uncomfortable and cringe inducing ride, just to get there.",Knock Knock

You think that there is a tantalizingly back and forth dynamic trying to figure out who they really are - what they really want - but in the end they make absolutely no sense. No answers. Nothing. It's frustrating on both ends of the spectrum.Nobody reacts the way you'd think that they would. Nobody behaves in realistic ways. It's just a disaster. They try to make it sexy but it flounders.

230,ghostjunk,Who's There?,6,16 November 2015,"Home alone for the weekend, a devoted husband and father gets an unexpected visit from two beautiful young girls needing help. But what seems like a harmless encounter quickly spirals out of control once he finds himself seduced into their twisted violent games.Inspired by the infamous 1977 exploitation flick Death Game, Eli Roth returns to the scene as co-writer and director, taking a modernized stab at the classic home invasion subgenre. But was his 8-year directing hiatus worth the wait? Well I'd like to think so! Knock Knock may not feature Roth's signature gore, but most audiences are sure to be disgusted all the same from his strange erotic approach to the psychological thriller. I was actually pleasantly surprised to see such a mature and sophisticated direction coming from this controversial horror director. Some of his die-hard fans will probably feel differently about this change of style, but you have to respect his willingness to try something new. Gore just for the sake of gore, or as they say to create ""shock value,"" has never really impressed me, and this is why I have never been too keen on most of his earlier films. But Knock Knock succeeds in ways his directorial debut Cabin Fever or the god-awful Hostel: Part II didn't by delivering genuine suspense through convincing characters. This is the same clever style he once carried through the original Hostel, minus the excessive bloodshed, of course.As Ana De Armas previously stated in an interview, it's really interesting to see a story that involves characters that all think they're the victims, regardless of their actions. Knock Knock definitely cuts against the grain in this way by challenging us to question the morality of who's truly innocent. This quickly skews any certainties one may have towards the characters, which eventually leads to an intriguing ethical dilemma. Obviously the actors themselves played a big part in the fierce tension brought to the screen through their exceptional performances. Hilariously enough, one reviewer stated that Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas' acting made them want to knit their eyelids shut. All right buddy Let's maybe take a chill pill and turn it down a notch. I've watched my share of dull movies and Knock Knock is far from one of them. Sure, the film might fall victim to a few minor plot holes, but none came close to distracting from the genuine suspense these characters create. The two lead femme fatales, far from conventional, offered some truly convincing over-the top performances through their psychotic actions and dark campy undertones. Keanu Reeves also delivers what may just be the best performance of his career as the easy-going family man who's forced to deal with a very destructive situation. Providing an impressive range of emotional depth that perfectly contrasts with the sociopathic personalities of the two young sexual vixens.More importantly, the film manages to shed some interesting light on social media and its disturbingly adverse potential. Most people wouldn't think twice about putting themselves online, but are completely oblivious to the lack of privacy of sites like Facebook. It's so easy to get sucked into socializing digitally in today's age, and I think we've gotten so used to it that most have forgotten how easily its power could be abused. Like it or not, we now live in a time where our personal business can be exposed to the entire world in a matter of seconds. In the wrong hands, this could easily become our worst nightmare. Roth resourcefully uses this nightmare to the film's advantage, creating a disturbingly brilliant form of social commentary that underlines this slick seductive thriller.",Knock Knock

Well i thoroughly enjoyed it and so did my husband. I'm so pleased because i had been looking forward to it ever since i had watched the trailer. I have actually enjoyed a few of Eli Roth's movies so maybe i am a fan of his film making style and that helped my enjoyment factor? To be honest i'm starting to feel that Eli is one of these directors that a vast majority of people just automatically dislike, a bit like the Adam Sandler effect (they will just automatically hate the movie without giving it a proper chance). This isn't a horror movie, well at least i didn't find it to be. It's more of a thriller and a comedy (some moments intentional but most moments probably not...). Now this film is definitely not amazing, it won't win any awards, apart from possibly another Razzie nomination for Keanu, but i enjoyed it for what it was - an entertaining movie. I thought the girls were brill and they were very hot, especially the blonde girl - Cuban actress - Ana de Armas. They were definitely over the top at times and some moments were definitely taken too far (I can see why they would offend some people) but i found them very fun to watch. Now...Keanu! oh dear! John Wick was definitely a fluke, he was back to his usual acting ways in this film but i loved it because i found him hilarious. I definitely laughed at scenes i shouldn't have been laughing at.

It is utterly disrespectful to viewers and have I paid for watching it, I would have asked for my money back.

From there we view Our main protagonist and his family. Cozy, loving idyllic, a happy family. And from there are movie begins... We are introduced to the femme fatals. Our antagonists. Or are they simply are voice of reason... The films conscious. This is the way Roth presents it... He allows us to view and justly decide if our protagonists is guilty or deserving of the torture he endures throughout the film. As someone who really does not care much for Eli Roth or his films... I feel i am being a little harsh with my rating. If you are a fan of his work and style of writing then you will have a much better time with this film than i did. My problems with Roth lie in storytelling. Visually he can create and guide us through an eerie hallway or cannibalistic rain forest.

255,DaleP1979,Could have been good.... but was not,1,13 March 2017,"I will keep this review short. I wanted to like this movie. I like Keanu. And honestly i don't expect his acting to be Oscar worthy.With this movie, I kept expecting some twist that shows the girls were getting revenge for something in the past, or at least some small glimpse that Keanu's character maybe wasn't the good family man portrayed in the opening. BUT you never get that. You never have a reason to think he deserves what is happening. He does make a bad decision, but he putt himself in a bad position by being a nice guy. He was honestly trying to be nice and help the girls. And honestly, the girls are never really shown to have any motive. They are just crazy.Aside from that, there were to many decisions that make absolutely no sense. For example, later on in movie, it is revealed that some how they have been spying on the family because they know conversations that were had. But...... how were they spying? How would they have ever had the opportunity to access the house to install cameras or mics? Their proof to the world that he is a bad guy was a facebook video of him tied up and being forced to have sex. They completely destroyed and vandalized the house, leaving tons of proof that they were there. They framed him for the murder of his friend, and god knows what they did with body. But they left him tied up.... so how would he have killed him? And last, he is left tied up and buried in the backyard! All the proof needed to show he was forced to do stuff and assaulted. Unless every cop, every friend, every family member are all complete morons and think he stabbed himself in shoulder, tied himself up, then buried himself.It just feels like Eli Roth did not pay any attention to what he was doing, or worse, thought we were to dumb to spot stuff.",Knock Knock

265,dougiesantarosa,Funny obtuse morality play misses its mark,1,20 October 2018,"This is a remake of the scummy sleazy 70s psycho-sexual B movie ""Death Game,"" where Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp portray nutso lesbians who put a smug Seymour Cassell through Hell. For a while, this version ""Knock, Knock"" is O-k as Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) - soaking wet skanks in hot pants and heels - show up at the front door, claiming to have gotten lost on their way to a party. They worm their way inside. Architect Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) playfully tries to resist their slimy slutty seducing give-and-take. Evan has to work, thats why he stayed behind in an empty house while wifey and kids go ahead to the beachhouse. Curious inquiries turn into flattery, flattery turns into light physical contact, light physical contact turns into rubbing up and erstwhile embraces. Throughout, Evan tries to politely navigate the situation, bobbing from chair to chair, trying to avoid these girls' clear advances. But he doesn't exactly kick them out, either. Here's a narcissistic guy approaching middle age, with a family, his days as a hard-partying DJ long behind him; surely he can't resist all this willing female flesh, can he? Eli Roth, who actually has a talent for comedy, expertly choreographs this game of sexually loaded musical chairs, all the while keeping us guessing as to Evan's true desires - even as the man seems to be playing everything by the rules. That's the good part of the movie. The girls lure Evan into the bathroom where he gives in and schtups the two flirty sirens, and things go downhill from there, as the film degenerates into a kind of torture-revenge comedy designed to punish Evan for fooling around. That's not exactly unexpected, of course. But the film collapses, because it doesn't convince us on a basic level: The characters are driven by convenience, not behavior, and their actions seem like they've been manhandled into place to make the plot work. Roth also never captures the dangerous tone required to make us feel in any way invested in what's happening onscreen. Even at their worst, those grindhouse movies he loves and references had an unhinged quality that made it seem like anything was possible, like in watching them we'd entered a world without any rules. Knock Knock, by contrast, is a disaster and inane. At no point do Genesis or Bel feel like actual human beings; they are unhinged one-dimensional lascivious cartoons with ridiculous, belly-laughing motivation. As soon as the morning comes, Genesis and Bel have transformed from seductive and coy young adults to infantilized and highly sexualized bratty teenage harlots. Our reintroduction involves both ladies filling the kitchen with breakfast supplies and throwing food around, laughing obnoxiously, and practically bouncing off the walls. Their initial disgust includes mooning Evan while he's on a Skype call and drawing penises on his wife's art. When a concerned neighbor stops by I was hoping for something a little more serious and dangerous, but they can't even do that, which is what makes their late turn into would-be murderers to be completely unbelievable and forced. It's so forced that Reeve's sputtering monologue of incredulity pretty much sums up the point of view of any rational viewer. They play dress up and appear to have some psychosexual daddy issues, possibly resulting from childhood abuse or molestation, but at no point do they come across as a credible menace. Then there's the conclusion and justification for their so-called act of payback and it's so lame and uninspired and a copout that you wish Roth would go back to American Horror Story or Cabin Fever.",Knock Knock

Before I noticed that, the story failed here & there but one never knows if it's for later plot-twist or maybe just my mood. However one shouldn't put so much blame for bad acting on the actors as ultimately, the responsible of a movie is the director; I don't care if his casting failed and by the time he realized the actors were not he expected the movie already started or worse, he neglected to direct them, the responsibility remains.The story wasn't the best in this setting but with afterthought, with a few modifications to it, but serious direction changes, the movie could have been respectable IMHO.Keanu Reeves is known for his intense roles, which he stay faithful to. I don't know why he chose to play in this mediocre movie and the mediocre one about samurais. If he spits on elitism to cater to one's career at the detriment of one's craft, I'm all for it (not doing something one love just to increase one market value must suck).

""Knock Knock"" was Exec Produced by Sondra Locke and features a brief cameo from Colleen Camp, the two women who played the pair of deeply disturbed yet ravishingly beautiful home invaders of a well-to-do suburban family man left all by his lonesome nearly 40 years ago.

Rather, it was a psychological thriller with a cringe-worthy outcome. The acting is superb...Keanu Reeves shines as do the supporting cast. Well directed and executed. It had my attention from beginning to end, and given my penchant for getting distracted with other things during a horror film, that is a compliment. But...this is NOT horror. I think that is why a lot of people hated it. Eli Roth's name is synonymous with the visually disturbing, so if that is what you are after, skip this one. I think this was his segue into something different, and he totally pulled it off. If you love psych drama this is for you. If you after jump scares and gore, skip it.

282,OvidiuStoin,Pay attention to subtleties,7,24 April 2018,"Reading other reviews for this title only saddens me as people prove to me once more how shallow they are and how easily they are missing the subtleties of things. Of course I am not implying that this movie is Oscar worthy, no, not even close, but it got me thinking and that was enough for me not to consider it a waste of my 'precious' time (I hate those people who always whine that they have wasted time and money for a movie bla, bla - every movie is a risk, it might be bad, it might be good, but obviously you didn't have anything better to do since you chose to watch it).""Knock Knock"" had kind of a ""deja vu"" effect on me, as I once met two beautiful girls (yes, one blonde and one brunette) that were shallow, immature and a bit crazy, just like the two female characters from this movie. Of course they didn't tie me up to a bed and rape me, but they were disturbing enough, so that made the psycho girls from ""Knock Knock"" seem realistic to me.Keanu's performance was laughable, yes, the man just can't act, but the reason for his character's fall into temptation made sense to me (his wife is very busy so their sex life was put on hold and the scar on his shoulder was a hint that he might have been into young girls). So there you have it, two hot girls are showing at his door, continuously hit on him, he tries to resist as much as possible, but he eventually gives in as the girls literally get physical and rape him (might be hard for women to understand, but having two naked girls grabbing your junk is hard to resist).Another problem raised by this movie is the power that women have in a court of law. A couple getting divorced, the mother will almost always get the children. Rape allegations, the woman will always be seen as the victim and win the trial. It's an actual problem and it proves that double standards still exist when it comes to man-woman equality.As for the motives of the girls, they weren't explicitly specified, but seemed to me that Bell was abused by her father (maybe step father) when she was still a child. As for Genesis, perhaps her family was ruined by a cheating father and that had a strong psychological impact on her. I really liked their performances, their craziness was believable to me.Yes maybe the ending was kind of stupid, but the fact that the girls got away unpunished is not what has bothered me. In real life most situations don't have a happy ending and bad people get away with their dirty deeds, so that added extra realism to the story.In order to enjoy it, just take it for what it is: a story about a horny ""nice guy"" father who stumbles upon the opportunity to have ""free pizza"", tries to decline it, the pizza flies in his mouth so he takes a bite and then tries to deal with the consequences (also shows how a prefect life can be ruined within minutes after making a bad decision). I know there a re plenty of plot holes and moronic situations, but if it were to make 100% sense, this movie (and so many others) wouldn't exist. People complain that Evan was overpowered by two girls, but if you think about it, as a man, there is a certain hesitation when it comes to hitting a woman, so it kind of made sense to me.Is it a movie that I shall recommend to someone else or that I shall re-watch? Certainly not, but it's also not as bad as people here are trying to make it look (people who enjoy the trend of hating on movies of certain directors - Eli Roth, M. Night Shyamalan or actors - Adam Sandler, Nic Cage). Don't be biased.",Knock Knock
283,norman-42-843758,Who's there - Rip; Rip Torn - No Rip Off,3,8 May 2017,"You kind of know what to expect when one of this years DVD releases is on the three for 10 shelf. After reading the back cover, I said to myself ""This is Funny Games, I wonder how similar it is"". It is the same story but so far as the film goes the answer to my own question is ""Not even close"". Out of all the reviews so far, only three or four have mentioned Funny Games. I have just given a nod to Submik for his comment about Michael Haneke. Haneke makes thoughtful films designed to make you consider people that exist on the fringes of society. In Funny Games two young men doorstep a family that has just arrived at their holiday home and charm their way into the house, then, little by little events turn nasty. The build up is slow and the atmosphere is taught. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the same story being reworked but you do expect some new dimension to be added in the intervening period. I should expect Michael Haneke to be extremely disappointed to have his film mentioned together with this substandard effort. To give one example, many reviewers have mentioned the fork scene. John Wayne would have said ""It is just a flesh wound"", Robert de Nero would have said ""Just get it out, there are no vital organs down there"" but just when you are expecting Keanu Reaves to man up we find out that he gets tied up instead. Oh dear. How near could such a story line be to actual events, is it all cheap thrill fantasy? In 1973 two psychotic prisoners (think of the red necks from Deliverance) escaped from a maximum security unit in Maryland, USA. picked up the teenage brother of the gang leader and then went on a killing spree. They killed six members of one family including a pregnant woman who was forced to watch her family being methodically exterminated in front of her, before being gang raped and finally shot in the back. A retelling of these events appeared in the 1997 Graeme Campbell film Murder One. This is the only time I have seen reviews on IMDb from people who have never seen the film. They say they were close enough to the real events for it to leave them mentally scarred and they have no desire to see the retelling on film. So yes, these sort of events actually happen and are a legitimate scenario for a ""Based on real events"" film. What we don't expect is for the story line to deteriorate along the way. For all those reviewers who gave as their title ""The worst film ever"" or something similar, believe me it is not.

The movie doesn't really even seem to have a point except to those that wrote it because you are left asking yourself what the motive even was for the characters doing what all they did. It is almost like watching sports to people that don't understand them. You see the characters doing things, but you can't quite ever figure out why and what the point of it all is.

The most important part that could save the movie because the concept could actually work with some solid acting. The acting is ATROCIOUS, I found myself shaking my head from the dialogue alone. All the people saying it was done on purpose do not know what good directing is. The whole thing seems like a miscommunication from what the director had in mind or someone was not listening.The script\casting. Bad acting can only *sometimes* work with a solid script. This is what successful comedies are like. Even unintentional ones. Now if this film is a ""subliminal comedy"" Then why is the script more of a ""dafuq..."" instead of ""LOL""? Many, many cringe worthy lines were said up until the end.I felt bad for Keanu honestly, it's like the movie is trying to showcase his ""acting capabilities"" and it did in a shi*** way. I was thinking though, who would be not the better actor for the role but an actor that fits the role. I came up with Sharlto Copley, that guy can be pretty funny with that accent. He just fits the role. The two girls were just plain retards They could at least make their characters extremely evil like portrayed but also a bit likable in a sense. that would have worked LOT better.I hate long reviews but I felt ranting a bit because of all the pseudo intellectual ""film expert hippies"" that claim it more than it is because they are smarter than us. It really just felt like a cluster fudge of miscommunication issues. If you want decent film similar to this go watch Hard Candy first.",Knock Knock

These *itches went from cutesy to cuntry girls in 20 movie time minutes, what the what? There is no notable reason why these chicks messed with Evan to begin with.

Knock knock stars Keanu Reeves (the matrix) and Lorenza Izzo (the green inferno) so I went into this film with quite high expectations. It had really poor acting which felt like it was made up on the spot half of the time, and the whole tone of the film was distasteful, and slightly uncomfortable to watch. It follows two women who turn up at this man's house supposedly lost. He is kind and helps them, but they seduce him. The film then takes on a really bizarre tone where the girls become convinced that Evan is their 'daddy' and they reveal that they are minors. This makes it extremely uncomfortable because he had sex with two underage girls who then constantly talk about who he is a pervert and likes girls. This is in poor taste as the whole film takes on a seedy tone which doesn't add anything to the plot at all. None of it makes much sense as to why the girls do this to Evan, and I definitely feel as though I just wasted 2 hours of my life. Eli Roth once again took what could've been a really good film with strong plot line and made it a cheap, uninteresting film to watch.

""Knock Knock"" may have just enough mild erotica (plus a whole bunch of crazy!) to pass as acceptable entertainment time-filler! Keanu Reeves starts out the film in typical low-key ""Keanu mode"", only to ratchet things up to a far more emotive sense of desperation as dictated by the plot! The two main ladies in the movie (Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo) start out as seemingly benign, giggly hotties somewhat in distress! Keanu's character's helpful chivalrousness toward the ladies results in---for him---unforeseen negative consequences! Ms. Izzo is pretty good at playing an unpredictable psychotic, while the gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous Ms. de Armas (more recently seen to far better effect in the hit film ""Knives Out"") registers as a deeply troubled childlike seductress! The main weakness of the film lies in the fact that viewers of thriller movies, while unlikely to correctly guess where the plot will lead, will probably predict far better dramatic developments than what the movie actually provides! Truthfully, I only bothered with this movie at all because Ana de Armas was in it, and---from a hormonal standpoint alone, she does not disappoint (not to knock Ms. de Armas, who, when given strong material like Knives Out, proves herself to be an exceptionally capable performer!) Knock Knock, by contrast, doesn't require exceptionalism! The beauty of both actresses is something to behold, and it almost makes believable the mild, internal moral struggle of Reeves' character, but, honestly, no one is being tasked here with anything more demanding than trying to bring an essentially preposterous story to entertaining life!

When the girls showed up, that was when Eli Roth's unique twisted mind did what it does best. The build up of suspense is actually wonderful. The actresses did an excellent job.

The whole thing is ridiculous and unbelievable, and perhaps should have been labelled 'comedy'. But it isn't, so I take it for what I'm told it is. On so many occasions one thought Reeves was finally going to take matters in hand, but he never did, and I thought this character really a damned fool to tolerate all this nonsense.

That is what makes this movie so intriguing, it's great and unconventional social commentary.The character of Reeves went above and beyond to resist the temptation of the two girls, but in the end succumbed. I honestly think that many men wouldn't have gotten as far , and would have given in way sooner.So what does this mean? Does this mean that all men are pigs, all women are victims, and that we should do something about toxic masculinity? I think even the most hardcore feminist would have to agree that the women here were certainly not victims. They are young girls that recognize how much power they have over men because of their incredible beauty, and they play with it. Also, they are fully aware that they can act with impunity, and they play this asset quite aggressively.I'm a fan of Roth's work, and this movie certainly did not disappoint. It takes a viewpoint that is almost unthinkable at this point in the #MeToo era. I find this very courageous, and that's why I give the movie a 10.The strength and necessity of this social commentary is painfully evident when looking at the reviews of this movie. This movie really pisses people off, as it explores a subject that people can't handle anymore. It's been awhile since I have seen so much cognitive dissonance in one movie review section.The movie was shot and produced well. I liked the soundtrack of the movie, especially the Where is My Mind track in the end was well positioned. The script was deliciously over the top, in order to really drive the point home.The cast was excellent. Anna de Armas is one of the prettiest women in the business, and I love that she takes these kind of daring roles. She nailed the role, and I think we will be seeing her more often in the future. Anna's amazing beauty does overshadow Lorenza de Izzo a bit, but I think she also played her part very well.Keanu Reeves was admittedly a bit funky here and there. The beginning scene where he played the dad felt a bit unconvincing. But I think he made up for it when the girls knocked on his door, because he conveyed the emotions that followed afterwards in a believable fashion. The highlight was his end rant, that was both hilarious and on point at the same time.To conclude, if you can watch this movie with an open mind, I think it can be a great experience.

I like watching suspense/thriller/horror type films, even some that others could consider bad, so I took a chance considering Eli Roth can be good and Keanu is a big name actor in this type of movie. I figured at least the acting would be good. Not a chance! Keanu was one dimensional, as he frequently is, but worse than usual due to the atrocious writing. He is a smart, attractive dad who is devoted to his wife. Except the fact he is ""coerced"" into a threesome with 2 idiotic teens maybe twenty-somethings... How he couldn't see that they were trouble the moment they stepped into his home and took their clothes off to dry is beyond me. That's because this character is a douche and wanted to have sex with them the second he saw them, so its pretty hard to have sympathy for his character. The girls are crazy and annoying beyond belief. He could have admitted to his wife what happened at some point and get them to leave and, of course, tries to cover it up instead. The story line borders on sexism, as the story tries to make Keanu ""the good guy"" (although unsuccessfully) who is being framed for sex crimes by crazy girls. He is the ""victim"" even though he is the one who gave in to his sexual desires, willingly.

1. Different storyline
2. Too much suspense

1. The killing of the asthmatic friend.

Although the other two weren't good either, at least they were not awful First of all the dialogues or the script lines are so empty, plain and flat, that a high school kids play has more meaning and acting than this. Two bimbos taken from the real world, with every day chat lines of the world we live in, are not an excuse to be used in a movie. Secondly the acting of all 3 main actors are hideous and what is even more disappointing is seeing Keanu reeves being one of them, and especially the fact that this makes 2 bad films he made this year (2015) What took my attention is how the film although trying to raise a common problem of our world, does not synchronise with reality. What i mean is certain things happening in the film would have not happened in real life, as if a man would jump like a 5 year old kid to get his inhaler from two teenagers and not push one on the floor to get his item seeing the severity of the situation, and how conveniently he slips, he hits his head and dies.

The second half, the torture was not particularly terrifying and the actions of the characters were neither here nor there. Also Keanu Reeves was not very convincing in the film.Hard Candy did a much better (and terrifying) job of exploring the shallowness of man(kind), so I would suggest that over Knock Knock.

He keeps being overpowered by 2, sometimes even just 1 supposedly 15 year olds (as if), who couldn't be scary or threatening to save their lives.

Hard Candy had a much more meaningful premise, and great acting to boot. Now, that movie was an excellent mind f$%k. But this monstrosity? No way. The worst part was the ending.

He is a good family man therefor, shelters two soaked girls in a rainy night, cliché of thriller movies, I know. He tries to be very polite and well behaved with them but he notices they are kinda different and weird. The game is lost when he can't resist their seduction and submits to them. In the morning he drives them to their so-called home. The next night they come back and continue second part of the game, torturing him for cheating and for bending the rules. He tries to escape but all comes to no result and at the end of the movie he is buried in his yard with only his head above the ground, watching his previous night's video clip on his Facebook which is uploaded by those girls.

If you like the actors, Roth's movies (*shudder*), or cheesy psycho movies from the 70s, I suppose you'll get a kick out of this... but for me there's just too much camp and poorly-thought-out writing to keep me from laughing at parts that probably weren't meant to be funny. I should probably stop expecting The Bear Jew to show his supposed genius, and I've disliked everything he's done except for Cabin Fever, which I actually found more entertaining than this, and which I was reminded of several times due to Roth's recognizable camp.

The motive for the attack is never explained and the psychotic behaviour of Genesis in particular has no explanation. It's a very weak plot, that just leaps from one act of very extreme behaviour to another. It's not interesting, it's not compelling and and it certainly doesn't appear to have involved any in-depth thought process. It amazes that studios will stump up funding for this sort of tripe.

What I enjoyed most about Knock Knock is that it didn't play it safe - you never 100% knew what was going to happen next, which was very refreshing for these home invasion type movies.The antagonists Genesis and Bel do their jobs as the sexy vixens that make Keanu's life hell - Lorenzo Izzo really shines in her maniacal Heath Ledger Joker-esc performance. A very good villain. This could be her break-out role.You never really understand their motives for doing what they are doing or why they're targeting Evan (Keanu Reeves) and the ending leaves a lot to be desired, but it still makes for a fun watch, and a lesson to all dudes out there... if 2 hot chicks turn up at your door while your wife and kids are away - just send them on their merry way. :-)",Knock Knock

In recent years most cinemas didn't bother with the potentially bankable Maniac, No One Lives, and Human Centipede. As a matter of fact this starts off like Human Centipede does, which is the biggest insult possible to the brilliant HC. Actresses who think slippers, wedges and woolly socks are sexy, camera staff who don't know where to point the camera, questionable sex which is so fast and distorted it is somewhere between boring and unwatchable, very little gore, and a shower scene which is a bad boring joke, that's what you get here. Any adult ratings must have been self-certified, and it is difficult to believe this is the Eli Roth who Directed Cabin Fever and Hostel. He badly needs a course in Camera and calling himself Eli is an insult to Let The Right One In.

That's still not enough to prevent it playing out a the start like a Letters to Penthouse story, which I assume is still a thing because I'm pretty sure I saw a copy at a petrol station a while ago.Aramis is a bit of a crack up. Her outrageous accent seems ripped straight from the Monty Python & the Holy Grail acting class for French soldiers and she acknowledges it when she remarks that the taxi driver's English was worse than her's. She was the other reason I opted to watch this and she didn't disappoint, which is why I went for 7 stars in my review.Because of a remark made in the shower scene, I had a feeling where this would go.

I don't want to do this to Keanu Reeves because I have seen him in The Matrix and thought he nailed that, but from the outset of 'Knock Knock' he was just truly abject. His enthusiasm for his children in the first scene of the film could be an advertisement for 'what you will look like if you try to act out of your comfort zone, when your comfort zone happens to be the only zone you can act in'. His performance later in the film regarding his almost comedic way of warning Louis about the two girls is another devastating indication that Keanu Reeves must be limited to more subtle roles, such as the one he so brilliantly portrayed in The Matrix.The premise of the film however is highly intriguing. After waking from his adulterous-ridden night I think it is quite easy for the majority of the audience to be able to empathise with this character, i.e doing something terribly wrong with no way out other than to face the music. When the girls claim to be underage to Evan his whole world is hanging from a thread just above extremely thin ice. It is from that moment where the creators of this film should have been more creative as they have wonderfully crafted a situation where they have a very capable, strong and wealthy man in a situation of absolute desperation. Instead they decided to never put Evan in a position where he would have to make any decisions based on his terrifying and unorthodox situation.I think it is worth noting that when Ewan accidentally selects the 'LIKE' button and not the 'DELETE' button his reaction is almost exaggerated (purpousely) for comedic effect, which calls in to question my approach to this film. I started this film thinking it was going to be serious and creepy however when I actually look back to certain parts of the film I can't help but think it was actually made to be a bit funny. Would Ewan seriously describe the girls to Ewan as 'CRAZY'? If I was in his situation I would ensure that Louis fully understood the seriousness of the situation. Would Louis really confront two 'DANGEROUS' kidnappers because of a piece of artwork only to suffer from an asthma attack? I think there is obviously an element of humour in this film which almost makes me feel guilty for the criticism I gave Reeves. I think he'll get over it.I'd like to finish this with one of my favourite lines from the movie 'The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance' which exposes the futility of writing a homicidal review and hopefully expresses my intention to not offend anyone related to this film but instead expresses my utmost respect as they have attempted to create an original piece of art, an endeavour I one day wish to take upon myself.""Tomorrrow night, at 8 o'clock he's going out on that stage and risking everything, what'll you be doing?""

She returns, dressed to kill, and the director, not knowing this is the innocent from earlier, tells her she has the role but he wants to discuss it at his place over dinner. His best move. She says alright and they meet at his place, But she isn't alone. Her ""friend"" has come along. the egotistical director see's an opportunity, or so he thinks and hits them both up.

363,shallon4000,Eli Roth just lost it!,1,5 November 2020,"When I heard that this was an Eli Roth movie, I was excited to watch it. Now I'm so disappointed in his abilities as a writer. Stephen King had a simple rule, ""If it's evil, kill it!"" Eli Roth apparently has a different take. He spends the whole movie making you hate these villains and offers no sense of moral justice to the constant beating they do unto others. The main protagonist, Keanu Reeves, is the generic dummy and victim made to represent all men as weak and unfaithful. He will make every mistake possible to complete this cycle of helpless cluelessness so that the girls can get away with the perfect crime.The movie does not explain anything, like how they spied on him? Who was their connection that could make people disappear? Nor does the movie convey realistic physics. It was very clear that the girls could take out a full grown man at any moment without much of a fight. In one scene, a girl is slicing into Keanu Reeves shoulder while for some reason, he had no strength to throw her off.It is understandable that this is a movie that is about bashing guys and letting the girls get their revenge. The only problem with this, is that you need to identify a 'revenge marker' within the plot. In the movie, 'I Spit On Your Grave', the motives were established after a rape scene. In 'Hard Candy', it was because the man had participated in a deadly pedophile video. Both movies had clear motives, and you could at least partly understand the rage and revenge of the protagonists. But this movie gives no such satisfaction. You are left frustrated as you see Keanu as more of a victim than an evildoer deserving vigilante justice.On the lighter side of this movie, I can say that the acting was great. The dialogue was good. But it just doesn't make up for the fact that it leaves you so pissed off by the end of the credits!I say, watch Eli's older flicks. He apparently has lost it with his newer movies. Hopefully, he will look back at better directors and learn from their talents, like the guy who did, 'Cabin Fever' and 'Hostile'.Anyway, don't waste your time on this.

Let aside Raspberry Awards, a special price 'Dumb and Dumber' should have been especially invented for this exploit (my hand will fall off if I write 'movie'). I gave it a 3, as I was laughing with tears while the fading shadow of Matrix was fighting with all his stamina to avoid being raped... This is a lesson for all men wanting to either preserve their chastity, or remaining faithful to their loved ones - to walk on the opposite side when encountering sexy girls heading in groups larger than 1 (one)! Or, for Keanu's credit, the actual rape scenes were the 20th take, assuming the Director was not pleased with previous takes; the poor lad was exhausted by shooting the same scenes over and over, so he finally gave up and succumbed to Eros... I could better live with a retinal image of a tired actor giving in to pleasure, than being overcome by two horny teens. All in all, I suggest to poor Keanu to undertake face modification surgery, if he wants to avoid his (remaining) fans (of any gender!) chasing him relentlessly upon eye contact...or obtain a restraining order against humanity for a min. 50 cm, a safe distance for any sex tool or organ! The 2 girls - they did their job properly, so now - after this... 'film', they can find their glory in less promiscuity indulging strip-joints or massage parlors. Finally, the screenwriter must be paying a hefty bill to his shrink, as such sex obsessions take long to heal - let us all encourage him to write a sequel, in which - after Keanu would take fence painting lessons as in Karate Kid 101, he indomitably holds the line against evil, men fluids thirsty nymphos - until police arrives and saves his (mental) virginity! Shame on you, Mr. Von Trier! This is how you do an art movie, not your recent years tribulations. Shame on us the petty viewers, for not being able to comprehend such a capo d'opera!",Knock Knock
366,guitarplayinglegend,I am not entertained.,5,4 November 2015,"I feel like there is a certain line that you just don't cross but this movie crosses it anyways. Eli Roth is known to make some controversial stuff. You could say that might even be part of his genius. However, this was just too much. I enjoyed Cabin Fever, I enjoyed Hemlock Grove, and I knew they weren't meant to be taken seriously. I didn't get that feeling with Knock Knock. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Keanu Reeves is a terrific actor. We can't really hate on him for this movie turning out the way it did. My problem isn't with the acting or the story. If anything I thought both were really good. That doesn't take away from the fact that this movie made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I felt terrible after watching it. Thats not why we watch movies is it? A movie is supposed to make you feel excited and have fun. I mean, come on. There were some things in this movie that could have been left out or done differently. My problem is that this movie is nothing but pure evil. I think it's disgusting. If you scroll down to the soundtrack there is a song called ""talking to the devil"" performed by Sorcery. If Hollywood really wants to be that demonic I guess this is where I start to tune out as a viewer. I might not ever look at an Eli Roth project the same again. Is he in the movie making business or the devil worshiping business? Because im really upset about what I saw here. My 5/10 rating only goes to the art form of telling a story and the acting that went into it. This doesn't excuse the evil behind Knock Knock at all. If you haven't watched it yet please stay far away from it. Im gonna have to spend next Sunday in church after seeing this film. Totally disgusting.",Knock Knock

But at this point of his almost three-decade career, you would expect him to be a better actor. You would be disappointed. Apparently, he peaked at ""Speed"" and ""The Matrix"" (I would include ""My Own Private Idaho"" but River Phoenix carried him). So, what we are encountering now is the principle of diminishing returns.He did not ""sell"" doting father but he did nail the dad bod. His interaction with the children seemed superficial and forced; so, he either is consciously playing a reticent father (which he accomplishes) or he fell short of depicting an adoring and devoted family man. The wife even comes across aloof and withdrawn from her husband.The premise of the film is well-worn and prosaic, as a matter of fact it is the second remake of the 70s exploitation film, ""Death Games"". It tries to disguise itself as social commentary and the women as empowered crusaders. But in essence these women are sadistic and incredibly malevant; there are no heroes in this film. There is no one to root for here--maybe Luis and Monkey, and the women killed one and kidnapped the other.",Knock Knock

One scene with Evan asleep with a girl on either side of him takes full advantage of the physical beauty of the three of them.Evan's ""free pizza"" speech is golden. The director, Eli Roth has admitted that Keanu riffed on the script in rehearsal and they used every word he said for the final cut that was done in one take. Lorenza and Ana are so lovely I almost wished they were not total psychopaths in this movie. Overall it is psychological thriller that builds and put me in mind of Play Misty for Me.

The transition of the villains from intelligent and seductive to childish pranksters was unexpected and distasteful, in my opinion. And their further transition from childish pranksters to psychopaths disrupted the possibility of the story going anywhere interesting. First the film alludes to their being some rational twist that it's building up to... but then what? nothing. It leaves the viewer with nothing. Their was no logic behind the behavior of the villains in this film. The story is never finished. And the contents of the second half of the film seemed rushed and purposefully unbelievable. The victim reacts in various different ways, momentarily, but like the villains he never follows through with what would appear to be the logical conclusion of his actions.

That may put me in the bottom percent or not, if you're also a fan, but it does give perceptive about this review. I enjoy the thriller genre and Eli Roth has made some artistic and well executed films in this field. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I watched this movie on DVD and watched ""the making of"" featurette, in order to understand what the people involved were attempting to create. In one word, art, seemed to be the intent. Both director and writers speak of creating suspense and psychological intensity, neither of which this film offers. As with many movies as of late, the best intentions of those involved, end up being driven by their own ego and ultimately making a film that is just huge disappointment for an audience member. There is nothing artistic or poignant about this drivel. It just ends up being absurd and flat. A character driven story, with characters so cartoonish in nature, I kept waiting for Batman to make an appearance. At least then, there would have been a character with some small amount of intrigue to hold my interest. The acting is quite good, despite an awful script, which is the only reason this picture was given more than 1 star.

So, I thought, cool, it's stupid and fun, I like where this is going, I may give it 7 or something. And then, rest of the film came, which just proved to me that Eli Roth is most childish director currently working. The torture is pointless, sadistic, idiotic, and thousands of harsh words I can throw to it, but I won't. I think it wasn't even intended to be stupid in his eyes; intentionally funny, yes. He just enjoys violence, with no real purpose portrays it in his films, and I guess his perverted imagination enjoys watching immoral people winning, and of course, someone being tortured for no reason of telling something with it. And I don't like saying films should have messages, but if this had one, it's laughable and wrong attempt of supporting feminism; picking two girls, who are clearly obnoxious sociopaths, his portrayal of feminism easily can be read as misogynistic actually, considering countless of shots he made with this film. Either way, it's just not right. I felt guilty for enjoying it at beginning and I felt manipulated at the end, and I really wouldn't hesitate on punching Roth in the face for this piece of sh*t. He can't even produce scares, atmosphere, suspense, story, etc., if we were to talk about his directorial skill.

401,blitzhighboy,A slow and dull movie from Eli Roth,4,19 October 2015,"Knock Knock is a movie directed by Eli Roth and Starring Keanu Reeves. The movie is about a husband who is alone at home on weekend when two women came in for help. Whats starts of as a normal night until Evan Webber played by Keanu Reeves has an affair, the two girls then reveals their horrifying plans they have for Keanu reeves. I have to say Eli Roth did a bad choice in choosing Keanu Reeves as the main character of the movie, it didn't feel right for Keanu reeves to play the role of a father in this movie, it had an unnatural feeling to it which makes the first 20 minutes of the movie kind of boring since you feel like the acting is kind of fake. He also didn't seem to fit the role of this movie, he should defiantly go back to doing another epic action movie like John Wick. The two girls played by Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas In the movie actually did a good job, they actually made me feel uncomfortable, I could also see that Keanu Reeves' character was uncomfortable, you can see that whenever the girls sit next to him he moves away and he is constantly checking his phone for the cab to arrive, hoping to get rid of them but at the same time we can see him struggling since we can feel that his character wants to have the affair. In this one scene when he enters the toilet instead of closing his eyes he uses his hands to cover it, which gives me a feeling that he kinds of want to have the affair. You know he is going to cheat on his wife but the way Eli Roth showed the character uncomfortableness and the acting by the two girls makes you root for him, since you know something bad is going to happen and you don't really want it to happen on Keanu Reeves. It makes you want him to stop and just get rid of them. The only problem with the beginning scene is the dialogue which got boring pretty fast since the girls spend the first 20 minutes apologizing for everything they did which gets kind of annoying, then all of sudden they start talking about sex and affairs which doesn't seem to fit the characters. I was kind of bored during those 40 minute with the boring dialogue nothing really develops. I was hoping the movie would pick up after that and it did kind of. Although the movie itself had some intense moments, the movie is still pretty slow and nothing really happens, all we see is Keanu Reeves being tortured mentally for the last half of the movie. I expected more tension in the movie but the movie lacked it. There were one or two scenes where I was actually holding my breath, but other then that, most of the time the movie was dull and slow. I get Eli Roth's dark message but because the movie was boring it just didn't really stick on to me, unlike the movie Hostel. Overall this movie wasn't that interesting, the movie felt kind of flat, there wasn't much tension in the movie and the dialogue weren't that good.

402,doctorarzt,Knock Knock Proves Eli Roth Should Give it Up,1,10 October 2015,"I have not seen the 'original' film Knock Knock is a remake of, 'Death Game', so I can't do a 1:1 comparison but after Eli Roth's film I'm not even sure I want to give it a look for fear that it is as dreadfully and mindbogglingly bad.Knock Knock is the story of family man Evan, played with typical woodenness by Keanu Reeves, who invites a duo of rain soaked hotties into his home to wait for a cab and winds up having sex with them and ultimately becoming their prisoner.Once the setup has been established, we endear a procession of obnoxious behavior from his captors and some seriously milquetoast psychological and physical torture. While Roth enjoys a somewhat misplaced reputation as a goremeister, Knock Knock's assault on Reeve's 'victim' probably wouldn't even stir the squeamish.Probably the most effective portions of the film come in the first act, and there it is the 'uncomfortable' social awkwardness of Reeves as his interaction with the girls becomes progressively more sexual that registers the loudest. Not exactly the stuff of horror.The 'plot', if you want to call it that, has pretty much already been blown here with the two breaks already described. There is an ending, of course, and it could have been more effective had Roth succeeded in producing some actual suspense, but as it stands it delivers as just as much of a ripoff as the rest of the film.Knock Knock is firmly situated in the 'Home Invasion' sub-genre of horror and honestly it's a lot more embarrassing of movie when held in the same company as Ils, The Strangers, or You're Next to name a few.Remember when Eli Roth was the savior of horror? Those days are long gone now. With Knock Knock and his other recent release Green Inferno Roth has shown that he can't produce scares, he can't produce atmosphere, can't produce suspense, and can't produce story. Even though his earlier films succeeded in some of these columns, that success was not sufficient to elevate him from being a 'promising' talent; Knock Knock proves that this evaluation seriously overestimated Roth's potential.",Knock Knock

All team of this movie are sick ..you guys need some serious treatment.No message, no story, no suspense, no climax..only irritating madness of two stupid girls are shown in this movie.There should be a penalty charged to director and script writer of this movie. Keanu Reeves..what has happened to you...U gave us Point Break..and now you doing this ???Such a pathetic movie. Watched the movie 'knock knock' because of Keanu Reeves and am so disappointed with the story and there is nothing thrilling about the movie. What really irritated was Keanu Reeves was like a helpless moron who just couldn't do anything against two teenage girls who go to his home and take him for a ride throughout the movie. Keanu had chances to kick back but instead gets hit by a fork by a teenage girl and gets tied up and that's so ridiculous and finally when you expect some twist you will find that both the girls will bury the so called matrix hero called Keanu Reeves in his own backyard unto his neck and there ends the movie all of sudden...such a waste of money and two hours of precious time.Keanu Reeves ..next time please sign a better script.Do Not spoil your name.",Knock Knock

410,jaiswalavinash,"Good movie, I don't really agree with all the criticism for this one,but what really is the inherent message apart from the role of social media?",8,14 May 2017,"As far as the acting is concerned, all the 3 lead characters here do a really great job with their respective roles. Genesis is effectively portrayed as the dominant leader among the two ladies and Bel on the other hand finds an emotional attachment with Evan in the course of their love-making. I really liked it when after the long and angrily profane tirade by Evan while tied to a chair, Genesis was shown to be unstirred, while Bel is shown to be on the verge of tears, nearly wiping them off as she does end up feeling for the misery of Evan. As far as Reeves is concerned, he is in top notch form indeed with him moving over to a different chair and beginning to praise his wife's sculptures whenever the two young ladies get comfy and suggestive with him, that alongwith the subtle change of expressions from smiling to solemn on the ladies' gesture makes so much sense and adds an aura of realism to the plot. I don't know why Reeves has been panned for his performance here with it being described as wooden, and similarly both the lovely ladies are equally good with their delightfully provocative and diabolical roles in their own ways. I for one, preferred Ana De Armas (Bel) over Lorenza Izzo (Genesis) for her scintillating chemistry with Reeves, and that particular scene where both of them dance to the tune of that romantic Chilean song stands out to me as one of the best in the movie.However, all of that does not save the the big reveal towards the end from being lame and underwhelming. The sudden turn in the behaviour of the ladies post the romantic night comes off as screechy and annoying rather than frightening. The acting however does warrant a one time watch. One should not go with the harsh reviews of this movie and should watch it themselves for a better idea of how this movie is.",Knock Knock

Nothing happened.What do we have there? A father of two children, married to a sexy wife, stays alone over the weekend. Suddenly, two soaking wet sexy hot party-girls ring the bell of his door. Some smalltalk and they seduce him. Finally the sex scene! Yeah! The morning after, they don't want to leave and leave a mess in his house. To punish him, in the end, they leave him unable to move in a hole in his own garden, with a sex video of themselves playing on his cellphone in front of his face. Girls leave. Family arrives. END.The beginning is all about waiting for the sex scene, because nothing else happens. After that, it's all simply disturbing. Not terrifying. It's disturbing and boring. It reminded me somehow of a guy in secondary school. One day, he wanted to come over to my house - without any reason. He was amazed of my videogames and we played. Then he didn't want to leave, closed himself into a room, threw things around and left a mess before he finally left. Same happens in the movie. Just with sexy girls and sex. So... instead of terror by some sexy chicks it's all about a children's game? YEP! It is.So. Would a man like him let those girls enter his house? Would he allow them to seduce him? I mean... maybe he couldn't have sex that day with his wife, because the children came in, but i'm sure I would do it more than daily with a wife like his one. So he is not one of those guys with a boring or not-sexy wife who didn't have sex in months. Seems none of both had an affair. Everything fine and good. Why should he do it? But well... he did. What man never thought about two wet sexy girls ringing his bell and.. have a threesome? Why not? The end is the most disturbing. They left a mess. Okay. And?!? How are they gonna ""punish"" him? He can say that the girls made him do all of that stuff with a gun on his head and that's it. Police looks for girls, locks them up and end of story.Watch it, if you want.

The script and acting is so terrible and cringeworthy that it passes the threshold of being awful and is just plain hilarious.

At one point, a friend, Louis, comes over, and get killed by the girls, so they decide to papier mâché his body and turn him into a statue, and call it ""art"" because the wife is an artist.I can't decide if my favourite part is when Evan looks over to the window and sees Genesis holding a banana to her crotch and Bel pretending to give it a blowjob.

The morning after, the chicks set up camp at the home, making a mess of things in the house like pigs and refuse to leave.

Was also surprised of how much humor is in it. It's not a comedy, obviously - but the movie has many tongue-in-cheek moments and I think that's very smart because it's about tension, relief, tension, relief. A lot of suspense films such as thrillers or horrors don't understand that if the music is drumming for over 1.5hrs and no relief for the audience it will become tiring. Here the filmmaker is well aware of all the notes to hit and the crescendo is just bravo!Also, the movie does not go into grotesque territory to be shocking - it keeps the suspense without resorting to what modern horror movie genre has become synonymous with - torture porn. There is nothing scary in someone's tooth being pulled out - it's disgusting, and I was happy to see that this film was able to keep me and my wife on the edge of our seats throughout. Eli Roth has crafted an intelligent and very well made erotic thriller. There are so few of these being made at such a level, and I appreciate the hard work put into it.I rarely write reviews (I think this is my second one in a span of 14 years). The reason I decided to write something down is because I avoided watching this film for a while because it got some very harsh reviews. Upon watching it I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was engaging through-out with very minor script-related hiccups, but it certainly is not worthy of all the 1 star reviews. Those who leave them, I think have seen very few films in their life - probably only the big ones that hit cinemas.

Don't follow the white rabbit!I am yet another person who usually does not take the time to write a review, but if I can save only one person from wasting an hour and a half of their life, then it was worth it. Knock Knock is absolute filth & swill from the beginning. Keanu, as everyone knows, is a horrible actor. Why was The Matrix so good? Because he wasn't acting. It was an action flick. He ran around and did cool things. Come on guys - even Arnold can make a great action flick. Just don't let them talk. In this movie his acting was wooden, one-dimensional, and shallow. But thank God he was surrounded by seriously poor talent with no hope of providing any entertainment value whatsoever!!! Anyway, it was painful to watch from the beginning when he was with his family. As someone pointed out, he sounded exactly the same whether he was playing with his family, or being tortured by the two girls. The first act seemed rushed and forced, but I thought maybe once we got to the main plot, things will get interesting. Not!It turned into one of those movies, you know the kind, where the victim keeps making stupid, utterly ludicrous mistakes. He is never able to defend himself, nor turn the tables on his captors. Defeated by a fork in the chest? Are you kidding me? Running away with a knife and tripping over something and, oops - there goes my knife! Yep - time to be tied up once again by two bimbos with a combined IQ lower than a guppy. Eventually I lost interest completely. A part of me was rooting for the girls because he was just too stupid & inept. I mean are we really supposed to root for a complete moron??? At some point I figured it would turn into a revenge movie. Now I really like revenge movies, I mean who doesn't. So I kept waiting and waiting, and what was my reward? One of the worst endings of a movie ever!Arghhhhhhhh! Seriously? Did you guys just forget to finish this stupid movie???So what we have here is a bad, forced, poorly done beginning. A pathetic Act II. Then cap it off with one of the worst endings ever. And you guys are giving it a 4.9??? Apparently 21% liked it on another website. I find it hard to believe that it was more than single digits.

They proceed to seduce, blackmail, overpower and torture him. The film ends with an explicit video of their encounter being uploaded to his Facebook account and his family returning to their vandalised home whilst he is left immobilised in the back garden. At the end we learn that the modus operandi of the two girls is to find and seduce married men and then ruin their lives by revealing the depravity to their loved ones to teach them a lesson. There is no discernible plot. The acting is mediocre and there are simply no positive comments I can make about this film. The whole concept is ridiculous and there is never any real suspense other than hoping the film will end swiftly.Now, I could have ignored this movie had it not been for Keanu Reeves. Once it would have been inconceivable for a distinguished man of his standard to accept a script like this. I am worried for him. Is he in decline?

The acting was perfect mostly from Ana Armas who played her role perfectly. The movie is highly sexual in nature hence children should stay away.

It promises a psychological thriller with some erotic scenes and vielleicht some gore. A nerve wrecking but unusual situation that could only be made believable by the outstanding performance of actors. But none of this came to be. Keanu Reeves has instantly dethroned Johnny Depp for being the most two dimensional actor in Hollywood, delivers poorly written lines in badly directed scenes to an extent that it is laugh out loud funny. Almost every aspect of this film is not just below mediocre but simply of-putting bad quality. Some dialogue seems to be written by a twelve year old. There is a scene where Keanu is tortured with a headphone on full volume. He is afraid to loose his hearing and shouts something in the line of ""Help, I'm becoming deaf! ...My ears! ..I can't hear!"". The total lack of motivation of the two terrorizing girls is to my believe the least of problem with this film. But I must say, I enjoyed watching this very much! Just like I enjoyed watching Troll 2. Later I learned this was a remake from the 1977 film Death Game, which in my perspective is slightly better acted and is more grounded in reality, but not as easy on the eyes as knock knock.

It's hard to enjoy a movie when the characters are flat and have no development; the characters seem to not have any impetus for their actions; and act completely ridiculous and non-sensical. Yes characters can be psychotic, but give them some depth and motivation to make them believable. I ended up fast forwarding it to the end it see what happens and the conclusion was just as ridiculous, inconsequential for everyone involved, and anti-climactic.

469,lyssashorrormoviefreak,No Spoilers just review,6,6 January 2020,"My review of this movie is complicated like the movie itself. Many people hate on Eli Roth, but I am a true fan of almost all his work. When it comes to revamping classics and giving them a new modern take I felt as if Roth did a great job. This movie is in all sense of the word a horror thriller. The movie starts of with a man named Evan waking up on Father's Day greeted by his wife and two children. We find out that his wife is very successful artist and he an architect, living a very rich and happy life. His family is going out of town for the weekend and he will stay behind to work on a project. It's later in the movie that two beautiful young ladies show up at his door, soaking wet, and asking for help. Well these girls needed more mental help then they do a former DJ's. The movie in my opinion was another great Eli Roth film. Roth always uses some of his actors and actress's from past films he's worked on which may be the reason people don't enjoy his films as much,as it would be nice to see some new faces. This movie in itself has you wondering the entire film on if they will if they won't. I give it a six as like most viewers the ending was not my favorite, but that's the thing about Roth's films... he never lets the audience in on how things are going to happen until they do. If you like any type of thriller movies I do recommend this film. Definitely was worth the watch and not a waste of time. I was genuinely on edge the entire movie, and really didn't expect that good of the film from reviews. I find that most people don't enjoy this movie as it doesn't give you the ending you want, the crazy revenge or the caught in the act. It simply leaves you with that knot in you stomach wishing there was more, but at the end of the day this a movie I will think about and will recommend others to enjoy :)",Knock Knock

474,macoliveira,No one would turn down free pizza,6,8 December 2020,"Evan is a great guy, with a lovely family (a puppy included), a beautiful house and a job that he loves. His wife and kids go on a weekend vacation without him and in the first night alone two girls knock on his door, pretending to be lost. He offers to help them by calling an Uber and drying their clothes (it was raining outside). After a little bit of awkwardness, they start to chat and of course the conversation becomes more and more sexual and tension starts to build in and Evan becomes more and more uncomfortable with them. When the Uber arrives the girls decide to take a shower and when Evan desperately tries to take them out of the bathroom they seduce him. They have a threesome and in the next morning the girls are not so funny anymore: their personalities are erratic and even a bit dangerous. After arguing, he takes them home and go back to his house to clean up the mess. But at night they come back wanting revenge because he betrayed his family by sleeping with them (!).
About the movie: the acting was horrible, specially from the actors pretending to be Keanu's family. The wife and kids awful...and even Keanu seemed a little off as a loving parent. The two girls (Lorenza and Ana) were not so bad, the problem is that they had no back story and no point for being doing all of they did. I took that they were abuse victims, specially Ana's character, after that scene where she ""rapes"" Keanu because she starts calling him daddy and asking why did he did all that to her. They were mentally unstable that's for sure. The greatest scene is the one Keanu gives his great speech, justifying why he couldn't have said no to them, by saying that what they had offered him was like free pizza and nobody refuses free pizza (sometimes we must). The movie is over the top, it's nonsense, sometimes it's funny, the audience don't get their revenge (happens often in life), an innocent man dies and the motivation of the girls, to punish married man that don't respect their families gets lost in all of this. It's not that bad if you don't expect anything good from it. It's free pizza...",Knock Knock
475,imes_jacob,Unique take on classic home invasion story that ultimately falls short,5,3 November 2020,"Knock Knock is by no means the best movie but the beating it's taking in this review section is a bit unwarranted. The one dimensional characters lack some depth but the acting is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be, in fact that's not something that even crossed my mind during my viewing.This film takes the tried and true home invasion formula and flips it, putting the two beautiful young starlets in the roll of the predators opposed to the prey. Let me stress this is a psychological thriller not your classic horror movie, so if you're looking for scary bumps in the night or the gore fest you may have come to expect from Eli Roth you're going to be very disappointed. That being said this story actually starts out pretty strong, suspense and tension build as Reeves does his best to be a good samaritan and also avoid temptation while the audience attempts to discover the seductive duos true intentions.After our protagonist ultimately succumbs to his temptations is where the film begins falling short. The sexy duo that were shrouded in mystery devolve into annoying childlike crazies that sort of lack the intimidating feel they had when they were introduced soaking wet and unannounced. Not to say there aren't a couple quality scenes between this turn and the end of the movie, the one where Ana de Armas adorns a school girl uniform is particularly uncomfortable, but they ultimately can't save the film from becoming predictable. As Reeves idealistic life continues unraveling to the point which it may be unsalvageable our intruders are revealed to have no real connection to him at all, but rather have seem to found him by sheer luck.My interpretation of Roth's lesson is that one shameful choice, despite the lengths gone through to cover it up, can reduce someone who seemingly has everything to nothing at all.

Well, but thats is not the point in reviews. If you don't like Eli Roths movies, you should not review his movies. Its like if a person who only likes Shakespeare and dramas, should suddenly starts to review Terminator movies. Also many notes on Keanu Reeves as well, and how bad he is. he is not bad at all, its a skilled actor, but I can admit, they should have got another actor for this role. Like some of the usual characters from the hostel movies. Keanu Reeves never looks like he is in horror really. That said, I think the movie is exciting. The two girls play very good. It also have some fun twist, and you can almost laugh in some absurd situations. I mentioned Hostel above, and I thought it would take that direction, but it didn't really do that.

Otherwise this is one of the scariest films I have seen in the last 5 years. Forget about ghosts and serial killers, this situation could happen. What a hellish life the main character will have, and the family as well. Do not open your door at night!",Knock Knock
491,onlyonebo,"Gone Girl on crack: A masterpiece, but not for everyone...",10,14 April 2016,"**Spoiler alert for both 'Knock Knock' and 'Gone Girl'**In today's feminist society, people aren't ready for a film that depicts the extent of female sexual power over men. This movie caricatures and exaggerates just what two cute women can get away with, to delicious and frankly, genius effect.Eli Roth knew what he was doing (for instance) with the scenes where the girls grill the protagonist on what happens to alleged sexual predators. They can do what they want and they will get away with it because they're young, attractive white women and they can always claim victimhood. It's the world we live in at the moment. It is completely ridiculous when you see it. Most men are too naive to acknowledge it and most women are too reliant on this status quo to admit it.The script is perfect because very few (if any) straight men would have been able to resist the sexual aggression of the women (Keanu's character did the best any man would do - which is why they resorted to physicality, essentially rape - and Keanu's character later had to apologise for this, whilst tied up! You see? Ridiculous). Taking the utter ludicrousness of this situation to it's extreme, and then taking it further and then a bit further is just the sledgehammer approach needed to tell this story. And yet, as evidenced by the reviews, people are still reluctant acknowledge it. They can't swallow it.This exact story is told in 'Gone Girl' but with a lot more subtlety. Similarly, in Gone Girl, Amy accuses someone of rape, and gets away with it, then accuses someone of murder, and gets away with it, then rapes and murders someone... AND GETS AWAY WITH IT! You see? Ridiculous. And in today's feminist society, most people are too brainwashed to comprehend the enormity of this situation. Bravo to Eli Roth, Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo, and Ana de Armas for putting together a modern subversive masterpiece.",Knock Knock
492,RicaGil,Big potential - bigger letdown.,3,8 July 2016,"When you see Eli Roth as the director of a movie with Keanu Reeves having a leading role, you would expect it to have a certain degree of quality. While this is true in some aspects, the overall experience from Knock Knock is one of disbelief and deceptiveness.Knock Knock has its own merit. It offers a sort of unique premise and originality in the thriller, drama and even 'horror' themes. This is not your typical or traditional thriller-horror movie where jump scares, blood or gore are present and abound. The premise is simple: A man is home alone and receives an unexpected visit from 2 girls whose intentions seem unclear. Keanu and the rest of the cast do a good job overall with the acting but it does not save a movie that traps itself in a hole where it cannot dig out of.The movie preys on sexual themes and the 'what-if' hypothetical questions a normal person could be facing with after doing something they are not suppose to. This sets it aside from other movies. But from that point onward, Knock Knock is incapable of climbing any higher and eventually falls off its own constructed steps. After the message of the movie - or lesson if you want to call it that - is delivered, nothing new is added. The worst part is there actually was a lot of potential to be offered with the premise presented. Like stated before, this is not a typical thriller movie. It could have taken a different path, focusing more on originality and 'mind horror'.The movie is literally unable to advance and offer any new content. Eventually it becomes tiresome and tedious to watch. And this is on a level unlike other horror/thriller movies that, while not being original, still advance the story or plot with new content - whether they be deaths, story elements or just plain gore or action.With Knock Knock, the movie just plainly stalls and offers no advancements after the theme has set in. There actually is no plot to begin with, although this is not that uncommon in the thriller-horror world. But in Knock Knock we hardly even have a motive or 'raison d'être'. It can even become painful for the viewers to watch when they are left with skeptical and unrealistic actions scene after scene. Does a man let strangers wander around in their house unsupervised, more than once? Can a 40kg skinny woman overpower a man twice her size? If a man made a huge life mistake and someone witnessed it, would he just go about his life normally the next day as if nothing happened?These and other actions are presented to the viewer on a constant basis and just inject more cynicism into the movie. When you ultimately reach the end, you are glad it was over not due to the plot or story but due to the boredom and unconvincing behaviors.I was disappointed to the point of writing this review minutes after watching the movie. I felt compelled to warn other viewers. It started so well and promised so much. But we all know the saying: ""The higher you climb, the harder you fall"" - this movie is a perfect example of that. For me, this was probably the movie that took the biggest fall I've seen so far.",Knock Knock

I was expecting a movie resembling that of Hard Candy. I think if it had taken that approach it would have been a great movie.** Spoilers Below ** But instead it decided to have the main character be a fairly good guy and undeserving of what was thrown at him.If they had made his character try at first to be a loyal husband but crumble at temptation then I could have fully stood behind his punishment and lesson needing to be taught. But I do not feel that is what happened at all. Was he really deserving of any punishment? if you are going to make some moral lesson movie and punish someone for their wrong doings, at the very least make them do the crime.In the end I was left annoyed.

Besides all this, I don't not understand the reason for Roth to use the same mediocre company of actors (including his wife) in all his film. Really do not bother with this crap.

Perhaps Eli Roth and his young wife (annoying chick with dark hair) drugged poor Keanu to this garbage. He must have also been drugged to give the worst performance of his career. Who the heck are the people in this film? They are all the worst actors I have ever scene and all appear to be related somehow. (Even the Uber driver is in all the same films as one of the crazy girls)I would be incredibly embarrassed if I were Keanu to have had any part of this trash.

Yes, people are being overly vicious on here. The film is bad, but not the worst (and especially not Roth's worst). I won't say one needs to give the film a chance, but I will ask viewers to refrain from using Reeves' performance as one of the film's problems. Ever since The Devil's Advocate, Keanu has been one of the few actors who responds naturally and realistically to extremely trying situations (e.g., The Matrix, The Lake House, John Wick). Relax and watch objectively. Always.",Knock Knock
499,JVogie91,There's honestly no point in seeing this movie.,1,27 October 2015,"To start this off I want to let everyone know this is my first review, so please bear with me and I'll do my best to bring you a good review.I was excited for this movie for two reasons. One because of Keanu Reeves, I mean who wouldn't be excited to see him after thoroughly enjoying John Wick and I wanted to see if he could keep climbing back up to the popularity he used to have. The second reason was that the trailer looked quite interesting when I saw it, really made me want to see it.The problem is it's another one of those movies that we've seen before where the only interesting parts of the movie have already been shown to you in the trailer. The story just seems to have no substance and the characters are just not fleshed out at all, not to mention there really is no Horror or Thrills as the genre listing would show. I admit there's mystery, but not in a good way.**********SPOILER WARNING**********This whole story is bonkers, the girls that show up at Evan's (Keanu's character) door end up seducing him after his repeated attempts to stave them off and a whole series of weird stuff happens. They overstay their welcome and claim they're underage so that Evan won't call the police, which is completely dropped 4 minutes later when he actually does call the police and one of the girls hangs up his phone and just asks for a ride home. After Evan is back home, he hears a noise and decides to check what it was, always a good idea, right? They knock him out of course and start having some sick fun with him like recording him having sex with one of the girls while she's dressed in his daughter's clothes. Then after an escape attempt Evan's incapacitated by a fork stab to the shoulder, oh yeah he had surgery on his shoulder, the opening of the movie makes sure you know that. They then tie him up in a chair and play a gameshow they called ""Who wants to be a pedophile?"" furthering the supposed belief that they are underage, so I just gotta kinda roll with it here even though they don't look anything like they're underage.The acting by Keanu through the whole rest of the movie is pretty bad, like when he gets an answer wrong during the gameshow he gets a loud high pitched squeal played in his ears via headphones, which I don't know why he didn't just shake his head and make them fall off but oh well. He says ""stop stop stop, my ears my ears, I'll go deaf I'll go deaf"" in the most unbelievable way possible, doesn't sound like he's in any pain whatsoever. The rest is actually pretty boring, Luis (guy coming to pick up a sculpture that Evan's wife made for exhibit) dies after tripping and hitting his head; the girls Papier-mâché and dispose of his body; the girls tell Evan they're going to kill him at dawn and proceed to tear up and vandalize the house; Evan tries to knock a ceramic egg off a shelf that contains a gun but the girls accidentally knock it off and find the gun first and Evan is given one more chance to escape. He grabs a knife and runs outside only to trip and fall and be captured again by the girls. Alright, the ending. After this whole debacle of a movie, the girls start to bury Evan with his head sticking out of the dirt, and just as one of the girls is about to smash his head with a stone, she smashes it beside him and starts laughing about how he thought they were actually going to kill him. At this point we hear about how they do this kind of thing a lot and how no one ever refuses them, these sick people spy on loving families and tear their lives apart on a regular basis. We also learn that they weren't actually underage therefore and tension that was built up when it was threatened that he would go to jail were completely fabricated. They then upload his sex video to his facebook and leave him there in the ground. This is where the funny part is, people start commenting about how sick it is that he posted that and he pulls his arm out of the dirt to try to press delete (crazy because the 'delete' and 'like' buttons are right next to each other) and he accidentally clicks like, to which he then lets out an angry yell. Then his family gets home and sees the mess, the son says ""dad had a party."" and the movie ends. That's it, cut to black, the end.I've probably bored you with this review, but now you know how I felt during the viewing of this movie. 1 Star for this, especially after listening to Eli Roth's interview because he made it seem like he thought the movie was good but you'd have to be delusional to think that. Well guys, thanks for reading my first review, hopefully I get better from here, and don't see this movie if you want to have a good time. It's not even a ""so bad it's funny"" watch, trust me.",Knock Knock

The obvious plot of having two females knocking on your door late at night, wet, and it just happens that your wife is out of town, wouldn't raise a red flag but got a raise out of Keanu's pants, was laughable. Watching him go through the awkward motions of seemingly playing the good samaritan allowing strangers into his house was pretentious as well as disappointing. Not all men would be so stupid, but then again, Eli Roth doesn't think so. I was hoping it might turn into female version of A Clockwork Orange, but I was again disappointed. I was hoping there would be some blackmail twist or a Karma payback, but disappointed again. I saw the Death Game with Locke and Camp back in 1977, and remembered I hated that film too, but at least Locke and Camp were more believable.

THATS NOT THE WHOLE STORY !!! because there is one more actor in this conflict - THE EGO!!! or in other words - REALITY !!! boys and girls wake up! stop leaving in a dream! in reality when the id gets such a huge opportunity the super ego stands no chance. girls if your partner is not satisfied he will YES HE WILL find alternatives, and if an alternative just drops on him like in this movie HE WILL do it. its not his fault, its just REALITY, so wake up people he is just a human being. in other words if your partner is not satisfied it will sometime somehow explode or alternatively you will just keep leaving a lie. this is just the tip of the ice of a discussion to be held over this basic conflict that this movie deals with. so there are of course lots of other aspects, ideas, sides, dilemmas and issues to discuss on this matter. but I chose to just provoke you a little bit in to showing you that this movie deals with a basic profound conflict.so why do I give it only 8? are you serious?? 8 is a great grade. and its a great movie so it deserves a great grade. its not a perfect movie like some elite movies that I would grade 9 or 10 is all.just come to watch a movie and not to criticize a movie and you will have fun plus moral debates. in other words - great!",Knock Knock

517,ghostrobot915,If you love yourself don't see this film.,3,10 October 2015,"SPOILERS ABOUND. FULL MOVIE COMMENTARY BELOW. 5 minutes into this movie I knew something was up. This movie uses tired clichés as a vehicle to progress the story. I am not going to list them but most of the details I list are clichés in some way. I am going to give you a brief rundown as I saw it so that you can avoid the mistake I made. For starters, it has product placing from Volvo and Apple right from the get go. Keanu's acting was bad, but his family's was way worse. The movie opens with the wife and Keanu having some quality private time, which is busted up by the kids who rush in to wish dad a happy Father's Day. Their interactions are just awful and Keanu acts circles around all of them, which is really saying something. Him running around yelling monster was more convincing than every other action his family had combined. His wife is not likable, apparently they haven't had sex in three weeks, don't think she really cares about that either. Just wants to go to the beach with her kids. But the movie isn't really about his family, they are only really in it for 10-15 minutes. The movie is about Keanu's interactions with two young girls who knock on his door in the middle of a rainstorm on the following night. When we are introduced to Keanu he is nursing a recent shoulder surgery he underwent when he injured himself chivalrously helping what his wife describes as a young attractive woman. The movie subtly drops this 'hint' like a 20 lb bowling ball in your lap. ""Oh, well I guess Keanu has a penchant for helping young women out and getting in trouble for it, I wonder what this movie is about. I hope it is like the Matrix! (its not)"" His shoulder injury is probably the main reason why he was unable to physically defend himself against these women, one of whom disables him with a fork to the shoulder. The movie doesn't really show a lot of Keanu grabbing his shoulder or wincing about the pain. It is an afterthought when you are wondering why he is getting completely dominated by two young women whose combined weight is probably less than his: ""oh...yeah. the shoulder."" Come on, Keanu, Bruce Willis walked on glass in Die Hard, you can handle two high heel wearing sorority girls. These girls knock on his door and ask to use his computer to contact a friend so that they can figure out the address they need to be at. The girls look like trashy party rats, makeup all jacked from the rain, totally soaked wearing skimpy clothes. A fast talking brunette American and her petite Spanish blonde. Keanu lets them in, they use his apple brand mobile tablet device, Keanu calls an Uber for them, the Uber takes 2 hours. In the time in which they wait for the Uber the girls are running through the house trying to get closer to Keanu by engaging him in conversation and flirtatious banter. They eventually corner him and just as the Uber is arriving, they take his pants off in the bathroom, give him oral sex and he succumbs to their siren's song. He bones them both, finds them still there in the morning, gets angry, then drives them home. They come back, he doesn't detect them, and the American bashes him in the head with one of his wife's art pieces. They tie him up, torture him, kill his wife's assistant, destroy all of his wife's artwork, bury him up to his neck in the back yard, and let him live, buried up to his neck in the back yard, the house a total mess. The end. It is so bizarre; at one point the wife's assistant comes to pick up the giant statue she made to bring it to an art exhibit. He detects that they're doing something weird when the statue is messed up, he finds Keanu tied up, then actually leaves him there to go see what the girls are doing to the statue. The American had pickpocketed the assistant's inhaler when she cleverly saw he had used it when he got all worked up when he first saw what they had done with the art. He sees them bashing it with some hammers, has an asthma attack or something, the girls play monkey in the middle with his inhaler, he trips and bashes his head on the corner of the statue. Dead. So just to recap, Keanu helps these girls, succumbs to their temptation, they hold him hostage, kill his wife's assistant, destroy all his most valued possessions and then they leave. That's it. Don't see it, there is very little to take away from this movie.",Knock Knock

I felt sad for him towards the end part, You can kind of feel the frustration like How you just want stab those young girls who seduced him at first. I was hooked to the screen, It kept me interested with what is going to happen next. I liked the ending where the girls finally leave ""They never say no."" ""Your all the same."", A new way to twist things up actually. Wish it didn't end so half anti- climax but it still did it for me. I would off just called the cops on the one side but he is clearly a bit too easy if you know what I mean. So do not expect a hero or the matrix. Like the other person said in the review, Have a sense of humor. I also loved the horror on his face. It's an entertaining movie. There has been worse off movies than this, it deserves better than it got. I can understand why some would say it's just another typical movie but I liked the actresses only because they are good at acting, although the one with the dark hair did a better job than the blonde because The blonde disgusted me a little bit,but it still kept the story interesting. They are psychopaths so I found the job done well, I didn't expect it to turn out this way. Give it a chance. Not for everyone though.

568,jackie_davis,Save the movie theatres from movies like Knock Knock!,1,8 April 2015,"Eli Roth is back! Eli Roth is back! Eli Roth is back with a movie that might just be worse than all the other dreadful crap he made. If he thought that the status and talent of Keanu Reeves was going to save a script that can have only been written by a ten-year-old, well, maybe he should stop thinking altogether. Knock Knock, a cheap copy of Funny Games, Fatal Attraction, and god knows what else,, is a sexual but not sexy thriller that tells the story of Bel and Genesis, two ""Femme fatales"" that wreck not just the home of a married Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) but also his life. First and foremost, Genesis and Bel are far from being femme fatales. A femme fatale has a certain look. A femme fatale uses and hypnotizes a man and with it has the ability to get him to do anything she wants him to do. A femme fatale is a woman a man would do just about anything for. A femme fatale is a woman whose sex appeal is so deadly that just looking at her will make anyone, even the viewer, drool. I don't see any of that in Knock Knock. Yes, they are ""attractive"" in their own way, and being all wet from rain certainly adds to that, as most guys would say, but that is where it all ends. I do however have to admit that the first act that focuses on the seduction was pretty believable. The girls sure know how to seduce a man. But even that ends as the story progresses (or not so much). The performances by Lorenza Izzo ( Misses Roth) and Ana de Armas made me want to knit my eyelids close. It was forced, amateur, risible. Maybe they should take some more acting classes. Keanu Reeves is the only reason this movie is not going to get the same rating all his other trash movies got. But even this does not have a happy ending. While Keanu Reeves is an actor with class and talent, Knock Knock should have not been on his ""to do list."" I felt so bad for him for having had to memorize such awful, on the nose dialogue. If he hadn't been Keanu Reeves the great actor and had been a newcomer instead, Knock Knock would have closed the career doors for him. I guess the lack of good acting in Knock Knock takes us back to the directing. Eli Roth compares himself to the great ones like Hitchcock, Polanski, Tarantino. Eli Roth claims that he is still growing as a director, and developing his style / taste. There is no such thing as ""growing as a director."" You either have the skill, or you don't have it. If you make ten crappy movies (like Hostel and everything else he made) , please don't try to come back twenty years later with a copy movie and claim that you can still convince people of your ""hallucinated directing skills."" Here comes the worst part: As the IMDb states, Knock Knock was written by three writers: Eli Roth, Nicolas Lopez, and Guillermo Amoedo. It looks like Roth works with these writers on all of his movies. But what surprises me is that none of the movies they wrote together ever received superb reviews / ratings. They can't write. The stories are predictable. The dialogues are boring and on the nose. They fill their stories with clichés and cheap jokes. So, this is it. Knock Knock. A movie that should have not been made. It would have spared many people's eyes from seeing such trash.",Knock Knock

572,maximmillion,Absolute brain-rot,1,17 October 2015,"Do NOT waste your time. It's a rare thing for me to rate a movie so low, but this warped brain-rot excuse for a social commentary did in fact waste my time and seems to exist only to twist the minds of the audience and gratify deranged perverts (with such imagery as graffitied penises scribbled onto pictures of children). Obviously the director, or this pitiful excuse for a director, Eli Roth, wished to anger the audience to the point of frustration and then fail to provide any sort of satisfactory resolution as some sort of sick joke. Such failure to provide adequate closure is the ultimate flaw a director and their film can exhibit. I could've lived with the emotional strain if there was some sort of payoff in the end; however without that the film becomes little more than 90 minutes of chaos and ultimately fails. I'd also venture to question the mental health of Eli Roth with such a disturbing fascination with pedophilia. He seems to promote it more than he does criticise it, by glorifying the goblin-like antagonists and the sick and cruel deeds they carry out. Perhaps this is some twisted social experiment aimed at desensitizing the public. And why create a film which seems to mock and ooze contempt for art and then expect to be considered such? Because if he never intended this mess of a film to be considered art then all it is is just that, a mess. Awful. Absolutely awful.",Knock Knock

I'm very much surprised that the rating is even 5. I was trying to give a zero but 01 is the least level. Please don't ever act in such movies no matter how much they would be willing to pay you because it' not worth it. You're a legend and people love you for your acting so it's not worth anything to act in a crappy movie like this. At least. I mean at least there should be a proper ending (what happened at the end? Did you die??). You may want to give a message to the public but then you could do some other movie not like this, and anyway people see you as a hero, not as a helpless fellow to be buried alive. I'm not blaming the director or the producer because anyway people will never stop making crappy movies and there will be a crappy audience to say good about it, but I'm telling you, please don't take movies of this nature because this is not who you are, you are just putting yourself down. Your fans all around the world like you for the personality that you have created in their mind, so think about your fans before you take up movies like this. This movie was so bad in so many different levels. By the way, not for a second think that I don't understand the movie and what it is trying say (Although how the story was written was a pile of crap), I do but it's just not for you and I'm talking on behalf of all the millions of fans around the world.

The plot is mostly the same as the original with some modern updates. I was not a huge fan of the original, although the concept was original for its time and it had a whopper of a surprise ending.

582,LexGrey,I can't believe I didn't EVAN-tually turn off this movie halfway through,1,10 October 2015,"****Contains some spoilers**** I just had the grave misfortune of having seen ""Knock Knock"". There are many horror aspects to this movie; the terrible acting, the Diablo Cody-esque dialogue, the tricks meant to be ""twists"", pretty much everything but the movie itself. I should've known better than to think Keanu Reeves could partially save an Eli Roth production. At this point it feels like I watch Eli Roth films as a form of self torture, to bad nothing Roth creates could ever compare to the actual torture of watching one of his movies, more so than any, this one.Frankly men should be insulted by this movie, not only because it somehow managed to exist, but because they are portrayed as mindless animals, unable to defend against the sexual advances of young women. The movie's intro is pretty much the kind of made up fantasies you'd find in ""Penthouse"", fiction, so unrealistic it'd have to set in a different universe, like those created for Superheroes to exist in. Unfortunately even the Justice League could never save this movie. Men aren't sharks in blood infested waters, they're human beings capable of thought and logic, to say that ALL men that have been victims of these girls couldn't resist them, that no man could ever said no is blatant misandry. Something that as a feminist I struggled to believe could happen to men until I managed to finish this movie. The girls then proceed to act like children, destroying everything in sight, not really doing anything calculating or taking anything of value. For me to believe that they had done this before, for the ""four years"" they hadn't been home is ridiculous. Surely someone would of eventually called the police, someone would of found them. Even if the victim lived alone by the time the body has been discovered there would be countless fingerprints and bodily fluids to sift through. I saw this movie not 5 minutes ago and somehow it's already managed to blur into obscurity in my mind. It was so cliché ridden and without cohesive thought, monkeys in a room with a typewriter could assemble a more thoughtful movie than this.

How bad is this film? Well any movie that makes the god-awful Mortecai look like a Hitchcockian masterpiece has to be considered pretty awful by anyones standards.Normally a really bad film can be considered so bad its good as they will normally have at least one redeeming quality, in the case of Knock Knock however there simply is none.Eli Roth is the man in the directors chair here and personally I've always found him to be over-rated and his movies have always left a bad taste in my mouth. As bad as his previous movies have been however nothing can prepare you for how atrocious Knock Knock is. A laughable script is delivered in the worst possible way by KEanu Reeves who here plumbs new depths of his own unique one dimensional acting 'ability'. In fact it would appear that he is deliberately attempting to outdo his usual brand of awfulness here by channelling his inner Nicolas Cage.I could go on but the plot is rubbish, the direction appalling and the acting about as bad as it can get.I only wish I was able to give this film the zero score that it deserves.",Knock Knock

Basically, while Keanu's wife and children are away for the weekend two young ladies show up at his house under the guise of being lost on their way to a party. Of course it is during a heavy rainstorm, so Keanu being the gentleman he is allows them in to wait for an Uber. And of course they can't show up to a party in wet clothes so he kindly takes the time to throw them in the dryer so that the lovely ladies won't be sopping wet all night... But they do end up sopping wet anyways as Keanu couldn't withstand their persistent advances and sexy bodies and he takes them both to pleasure town in the shower. But that's not the scene I previously referred to. No, that comes near the end of the film after the two ladies attempt to blackmail and ruin Keanu's life and all sorts of hijinx and drama and sexiness ensues. When confronted by the ladies about how he cheated on his wife Keanu gives one of the greatest single performances in a scene I have ever witnessed.

Also, the film does explain why there are no neighbours at home.

There's usually enough people on each side to adequately debate the pros and cons. But a film this ridiculously bad has, if nothing else, crossed whichever threshold is required to motivate me to reset my long forgotten IMDb login details and hopefully save some poor souls the 90 odd minutes of their lives, and (god forbid) their hard earned on a ticket.It's so hard to know where to begin, so, as a wiser person than me once suggested, I will begin at the beginning. The acting, from the get go, is so wooden, unbelievable and shallow that not only did I not feel any connection to the characters, they were actually making me angry! Keanu is has always been pretty one dimensional, but he takes it to a new level with his performance here. In this role as a supposedly doting father, it felt like he has never spent more than five minutes around any kid. The wife was equally unconvincing and the kids were so bad they wouldn't get a role on a home-brand cola commercial. I did however quite like the Boston Terrier playing the role of the family pet, 'Monkey', and I feel like he did his best to carry this stinker, but with limited screen time there was only so much he could do. Enter the 2 mysterious young women...who continue what has become the well established, by now 20 minute old tradition of corny, unconvincing Knock Knock performances.The direction is lousy. I'm no film buff, but I watch enough of them. When I saw Eli Roth was the director in the opening credits, I said to my wife 'I think he has done some cool stuff'. Half way through this stinker I looked him up, and realised that, no...no he hasn't done anything even remotely decent in his entire career. A bit of shock horror in Hostel, a tenuous claim to fame at best, and then nothing. And his lack of talent is glaringly obvious here. I think I had confused him with a hybrid of Tim Roth and possibly Elijah Wood? I dunno...but Eli Roth shall forever more be the huge red flag he rightly is. The story...let's call it a ""story"" for the sake of this review anyway. There's so much that could be said, so I'll simply say that it sucked in ways that few things have ever sucked before. It pioneers new ways to suck that modern scientific research in sucking are yet to even discover. And the final cherry on this s#!t cake, was, after breaking my spirit and will to live, to break my heart to. Using the Pixies classic Where is My Mind as the closing track. Which the Pixies must have authorise...which defies comprehension. They made great money off their last tours, and allowed it to be used to close that all time classic Fight Club.

I love horror and thriller movies. I can understand that sometimes there is not much of a story line, but just moments of thrills or horror. But this movies beat the sh*t out of that, because of how bad it is. And here I mean, they had a story line, which was bad. They had a good actor, which I didn't think could do bad acting, which he did (probably because of the script, but just refuse the roll then). And overall... If I was a sponsor, I would ask my money back. It was just that bad. As a viewer... dude... I would ask money back AND refund for my time wasted...",Knock Knock
610,neilcarlin,Curiosity kept me watching,4,19 November 2015,"Despite the warnings from negative reviews and low IMDb rating i watched it anyway... I've always liked Eli Roth mainly for his near show stealing appearance as 'The Bear Jew' in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds and his movies, though never groundbreaking for me, offered playful b-movie fun. His efforts here seemed to diminish after the initial creation of suspense. Once we move to the second act the script loses any credibility and little is left for creation of further suspense. It's almost as if the idea was to get Keanu to behave somewhat like Nicholas Cage in OMG mode. That idea i couldn't shake and ironically it became what kept me entertained, imagining cage instead of reeves, which wasn't too hard as Keanu seemed to channel the spirit of the rage cage as if he were possessed by him. Don't let my mention of cage fool you, the acting in this movie is sub par, if Keanu isn't The Wicker Man he's the wooden man and the girls act like female villains in a made for TV batman movie. In summary; I found a few things Keanu said in a serious monologue quite laugh out loud funny and the use of a popular pixies track at the end credits reminded me of a student movie using cool music to be cool. All it did was remind me of it's already iconic use in one of my favorite movies. The movie was just bad enough to enjoy it's shitness or i'd have not sat through it. Avoid this if you get offended by crap movies but I'm almost recommending you to watch this for the points I mentioned for your own curiosity. The movie stuck in my mind enough for m to waste time writing this review, i wonder if that was Roth's intention for the audience or he actually took this movie seriously.",Knock Knock

Oh, yes, if something to note, the script is really retarded. It ends into be a stupid thriller based on some kind of strange semi-moral lessons to be learned. It fails anyhow to be credible because of a really unbelievable bad plot development. It starts quite good and has some succeeded moments in the beginning. This ends really soon and start being really forced and artificial into narration. One wife overwhelmed by artist life rigors and kid's related responsibilities is urged ""to the beach"" for the weekend, leaving behind a devoted husband, a busy architect and a sexually frustrated 43 years old guy. Some maniacal girls pop up to his door, get invited inside and force him into having sex with. Then they decide to punish the unfaithful husband and presumed pedophile father. This part is really mental, but this is not the worst aspect. It is really not credible. Has nothing in common with real human behavior in the context. The end is hilarious, even more than the strange guy popping in at a point in time just to get killed for some wrongly added ""tension"".

He brilliantly displays the characters of 2 very dangerous girls and their sick games. The plot is good and the suspense is built up from the beginning. It's very different in the way that it depicts two pretty females as perpetrators, which makes it unique. Keanu plays good, but really all credit should go to the girls, especially to Ana DE Armas. Some parts of the movie were ridiculous, but all in all it delivered. It all really comes down to what you are looking for.

The rest of the movie he continues to scream about how he is indeed a 'good-guy' but by this time you've already seen him be a really horrible husband, father and male role-model. For the life of me I can't understand how these two young chicks were able to tie him up in bed... then untie him and tie him back to a chair and then untie him again and again until he ends up in a hole tied with a hose in his backyard. Especially since he's had more than one chance to escape: once while playing 'hide N Seek' if you can believe that. Yes he gets captured only to be facing down the barrel of his own loaded gun that was HIDDEN. The dude just has to be the worst escape artist in history... I know DOGS that can escape locked cages faster than this guy could get out of a wet paper bag. Quickly you no longer have any feelings for the guy you just want the movie over because you have this issue of 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure' and how it's the same ACTOR!!! You can't UN-SEE this movie. It's best to just rent Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure or you'll lose most of your respect for Keanu Reeves. Oh by the way if you're into role-playing during your sexual romps this movie will KILL most of the fun in that too.

618,bearaphelion,This movie hates people who watch movies.,1,12 September 2016,"Keanu Reeves is somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me. He may not be the most dynamic actor Hollywood has to offer, but he's enjoyable to watch and always entertaining. When I saw the trailer for this movie I was excited at the concept and that he was in it.That soon changed...It didn't take long for me to grow uncomfortable and unhappy. At first I thought that the director wanted me to hate women, due to the unbelievably annoying acting by Belle and Genesis. I thought, ""Damn, Eli Roth wants us to not only feel okay about two women being murdered, but to actually stand up and cheer when it happens. When they start playing the pedophile game, I just stared at the screen in utter confusion. At no point did Keanu think that those girls were underage, and it only became an issue once they lied about being underage for 5 minutes before it was revealed that they weren't. The entire plot point that the movie is built on means absolutely nothing. Everything that happens in the movie means absolutely nothing. Things just happen. Every second that they were on screen, and all the awful things that they did was so frustrating to watch that I wanted to turn off the movie and forget what I had seen and heard. The only thing that kept me invested was a single hope...**SPOILERS** After being beaten down by the acting and the story, I had the hope that Keanu would finally break free from the nightmare that was Belle and Genesis, and since it was directed and partially written by Eli Roth he would exact revenge upon them. After an hour of watching the girls giggle and laugh while destroying his house, to the point where my ears started to bleed, the climax finally came, although the word ""climax"" doesn't exactly fit this situation.Never in my life have I been so disappointed in a resolution, and overall my heart and soul was crushed by the ending of this film. It just ends. The girls just...walk away. Their game and mission meant nothing at all. Stuff just happened. The director and producers must have assumed that the last line, ""dad had a party."" would leave audiences laughing and laughing and laughing. I can honestly say that the story, acting, and direction was the worst of any movie this year, and certainly some of the worst of all time. It's not a psychological thriller, it's just two girls running around a house destroying Keanu's possession, tying him up, releasing him, tying him up, playing the most pointless game ever, releasing him, tying him up, over and over, while laughing and giggling with no purpose other than to annoy the audience.

The vicious young women seduce, blackmail, assault and murder as they continue with their plan. We are left wondering, will Evan also be killed?While this movie has elements taken from several other films, it achieves its purpose is providing 99 minutes of suspense. Unlike other reviews, I found Keanu a little different than in past films. His performance was understated, certainly a far cry from the action hero we are used to seeing him in. Also, towards the end, there's a scene where Evan is screaming at the girls.

The two antagonists relentlessly and remorselessly terrorized the protagonist throughout the story, committing physical, mental, and emotional torture and torment, and finding it all amusing and satisfying. The repeated use of the word monster in the beginning of the movie is the clue that the two ""bad guys"" represent the monster, the alien, the zombie, or the ghost in any horror movie. The monster is without conscience and commits actions that are horrific to humans, but the monster is clueless to the morality of it all. I stopped the film half way through and finished it the next day, because it was making me anxious to see Reeves' character suffer such abuse, and not score a single point in the battle of wits and wills. And just like some monster flicks, the monster gets away and the viewer is left to ponder that it's still out there and may attack again. The reason I gave the film 4 stars is because I felt the director and actors conveyed exactly what they wanted to convey and did it effectively. Excruciatingly so. It was the most emotion I have ever seen Reeves generate on film. I cannot recommend it due to the extreme sadism. It's just not good for anyone's psyche.

The way it was shot made it look like it was a big budget Hollywood movie and though it takes place in one main setting, you never really notice because of all the crazy things going on. Unfortunately, that's where the good points about this movie end. There were a few points in the movie (the beginning, the middle, and the end) where little hints were dropped to explain the plot of the movie, but all were so brief it was easy to miss them, and if you did catch them they didn't tie in together well enough to explain what was going on and why it was happening. Moving right along to the acting -- more disappointment. Keanu Reeve's takes the blame here! His acting was so awkwardly bad it completely overshadowed everyone else's like a huge dark cloud and took away from the intensity of the movie. Imagine watching an emotionally intense scene that would normally make you cringe, but instead you can't help but laugh because of his terrible acting. This movie is definitely not for movie buffs who enjoy movies with well written plots and great acting, they'll want to skip this one; but if you want a good laugh on a Saturday night you'll want to watch this with a group of friends.

750,jenx10,Monkey Business,1,2 January 2021,"I regret watching this movie, and the only reason I finished it is that I was waiting for a twist that would have made it somewhat watchable. Wrong! The movie is what it is...stupidly ruinous. Keanu's acting was distracting because his eyes almost never matched the emotions he tried to convey. The girls far, far outacted him in eyes alone. They acted crazy, they looked crazy. He looked like he was trying too hard. Otherwise, this is a story about a man who sets weak, permeable boundaries that lead to his destruction. He tries to be nice to the GIRLS, rather than protect the vows and responsibilities to his FAMILY, which is stupidly dangerous. His continued inability to set boundaries and stick to them renders him morally helpless early on. He doesn't really worry about protecting his family until the girls threaten to hold him accountable for what they say he did, which was another opportunity to do the right thing, which he again failed to do. The number of times he could have walked away, taken control, escaped, or followed through on calling for help was stupifying. He even seemed to worry more about his wife's artwork than his wife. Forty-three-years old, yet no perspective about what was most important when important things were on the line, and almost no ability to react intelligently to danger, once he finally noticed it. If all men acted this way, women would absolutely rule the world.If the moral of this movie is that men are forever weak and stupid when temptation pays an unexpected visit, then the movie's a hit, I suppose. However, there are men out there who would set firm boundaries early on, like the girls hoped, and the ruin would have been avoided. My takeaways? Don't fight evil with politeness when you see the first signs. Believe people's actions, not their words. If they don't respect your boundaries (marriage, children), then they don't care about you and wish to do you and your family harm to varying degrees. No need to keep them around to find out how far they'll go. Trying to be the good guy in times of temptation gets you nowhere you won't regret later. Trying to cover up sins, misdeeds, or broken vows by getting in deeper makes you even more the fool and under someone else's control. Keanu handed over the reins of his life to two girls who were smarter and much more determined than him at every turn. Also, repeatedly begging for mercy from evil gives it what it wants. Have some self-respect or, if acting, shed some tears and be more believable about it. He never should have taken this role because he should have known it wouldn't be a good fit. If he was trying to stretch his abilities or try something new, I'm glad he got the experience(?), but it did nothing for me as a viewer. I'm not a fan or an anti-fan. I had no expectations either way, yet he managed to disappoint them.No one will probably end up reading this, and that's OK with me. I just had to vent a little after watching. I pathetically hoped the wife had hired the girls to test him over the weekend based on a comment she made in the beginning, and they somehow ended up being psychos, but no. I hoped the girls had escaped from an asylum or psychiatric treatment, etc., but no. In the end, the saddest part for me was when they stole Monkey. The most ridiculous part for me was when Keanu accidentally liked the Facebook video. The stupidest part for me was when he did almost everything else.

754,rsbmovie,Potential but no delivery,3,26 January 2015,"I was able to view this at Sundance and couldn't have been more disappointed. I'm not sure if Eli Roth was trying to make this a campy horror, a legitimate horror, or a social commentary. He failed miserably in all three regards.1. As an adoring fan of Cabin Fever, I keep hoping Roth with find a way back to creating edgy horror that doesn't take itself too seriously. The last two minutes did elicit a few chuckles from the audience but seemed inconsistent with the rest of the movie which had a very serious tone. 2. The movie had the potential to be a thrilling horror along the lines of Fatal Attraction. Unfortunately the seduction felt forced and the mental instability of the girls completely unbelievable. Furthermore, the horror scenarios were so contrived that I found myself getting bored rather than terrified: a small Lorenza Izzo overpowering a large Keanu Reeves, using extension cords for restraining when they can't generate sufficient tension, being held at gun point just inches from a semiautomatic gun that likely has not had a round chambered, Aaron Burns leaving a tied up Keanu Reeves because the girls are destroying art, the cliché tripping while trying to run away, the premise that all neighbors within earshot of a screaming Keanu were on vacationthe movie was one ""Oh come on"" after another. 3. The movie ends with the premise that, presented with temptation, all men will succumb. As mentioned, the seduction felt forced and completely unnatural. Keanu Reeves was a great father and husband. His obvious discomfort at the two womens' advances vanishes instantaneously as he becomes a flirtatious DJ and the rather irate Keanu, upon finding the two naked women, is suddenly pacified as soon as they unzip his fly. I find it hard to believe that Keanu Reeves character would have done anything he was shown to do in the movie and therefore reject the social premise that men are sexual deviants.Most of the conversation I heard after the movie was negative. I'm still holding out hope that Eli Roth has another great movie in him. But this definitely wasn't it.",Knock Knock

Of course because of Reeves playing in it, you expect a great production and cast. It is a SMALL budget production. Very small budget, used the director's house for the filming, which is a large portion of the movie takes place, has only 8 actors/actress + 1 dog in it; 3 main roles, 3 secondary and 2 ""one scene and out"" kind of thing. So you can't be expecting anything grandiose. Now, that being said, and if you are willing to give it a go, you will not be disappointed. The suspense is intense in a jaw dropping way, and Roth DID do a good job in keeping the viewers guessing all the way. Reeves was amazing as always. He took this very challenging role because he never had a go at anything like it and you are not gonna believe he took this role but he did, and there he is, and it is awesome. He definitely was out of his comfort zone and am glad he took a chance because of course; he rocked it. You will see some acting skills of his that you never thought you'd ever see, or thought he had.

I literally felt embarrassment line after horrid line. Maybe with better direction from Roth some of the lines and scenes could have been salvaged but unfortunately he was unable to rescue this rotten screenplay. Izzo's acting is so cringe-worthy it makes Jared Leto's Joker look good. To me, it's really a shame because the premise could have lent itself to a great movie, or at the very least an enjoyable one. I am a fan of Keanu's but his acting in this ridiculous plot-hole filled disaster makes me have doubts. Not one member of this cast delivers a performance worthy of a community college student film role. That being said, I am grateful to have watched this. It has allowed me to see the true talent and beauty of every other movie I've seen. Ever. I would like to see this movie re-made.

(Trending) well...let's say she is no can longer pick a movie unless she checks IMDB. She didn't check and we suffered through a painful 90+ minutes. Im now wondering the logic of Netflix to recommend this to me and my family but it should be a crime. Towards the last 85 minutes my wife had to fast forward just to see what happened and it just got worse. Pray that Keanu to finds a better agent that will recommend him not to do movies like this.

795,brianalbanese,My honest review,1,2 January 2016,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The only reason why I watched this was because it is an Eli Roth movie and I thought Hostel was decent. But seriously, the premise of this movie is just terrible. And the only reason why Lorenza Izzo has any type of career going is because she is married to Eli Roth. Apart from looking physically attractive, she serves absolutely no purpose in film. So our protagonist (Keanu Reeves, who while I like him in some movies is a god awful actor) decides to keep these two girls in the house for this long for what reason? Because he wants to have sex that badly with them even though he is happily married? The only lesson learned that one can come away from this movie is for guys to think with their brains instead of their you know what, otherwise it will lead you down a bad road. But a 100 minute movie did not need to be made in order to tell that to the audience. Extremely slow, not really all that entertaining, and terrible acting on everyone's part. Eli Roth's movies have declined fast since Hostel. I am just extremely disappointed in him. I know, duh, he's obviously made so much money and I should just shut up, but this movie is pure garbage. The last thing I will say is that I cannot believe for the life of me why Eli Roth is remaking Cabin Fever (2016), which by the way WAS HIS OWN MOVIE! So this guy is so brilliant in the industry that he is recycling his OWN IDEA! Just pathetic! #endofrant",Knock Knock

I loved the fact that the action started quite fast(15 minutes into the movie or somewhere around that). Really entertaining movie and also it was one of the best horror movie i have seen in a long time. I did find the 2 girls annoying at first but the action is not at all hard to follow...The action is quite simple and it's a home invasion type of movie. It takes place in a lovely house that belongs to an architect(Keanu). He is visited by 2 girls in the middle of the night while his family is out of town. The action revolves around the fact that the cheaters must pay for what they've done.Also i really enjoyed the ending and i found it to be really suitable, the fact that he didn't manage to delete the video from Facebook and like it instead, made it a much more realistic movie.",Knock Knock

The movie was shown as a ""Sneak Preview"" and that's pretty much all the reason why I watched it. From time to time it's interesting but the movie completely fails. Some scenes are dragged out to the point you find yourself asking if they tried to make a Terrentino-movie, yet those scenes become awkwardly boring. The only twist in this movie is how many times Keanu switches from ""I will do anything"" to ""I will f**ing kill you"". There is zero development, no clue of the intention the ""kidnappers"" have, and there is zero suspense. You keep asking yourself what turn of events this movie will eventually have but it just ends. Keanu Reeves is a terrible cast for the movie because you expect him to knock those two 80lbs girls out at all times, which makes this movie seem so unrealistic it beggars believe. At no time are you scared of those two party chicks. As a horror movie it get's a solid 0. The 3 points are merely for production value.",Knock Knock

I want to mention that I have never left a review on IMDb, however, after watching this movie I felt compelled to warn everyone of the harms which watching this movie may cause.Once a week we have a 'surprise movie night' at my local cinema called 'Sneak' which I went to with my date (bad mistake). The first couple scenes still seemed like a typical Hollywood thriller or just another boring old love story. However, the moment these two ladies knocked on the door, it was clear to me that Keanu, whose acting was horrific, would cheat on his beloved wife and family and destroy his idyllic life. Alright story up to here...Now lets skip the aforementioned disaster acting, storyline and cringe-worthy conversations. There is a couple moments where I was actually wondering how this movie received a 'go' to be played in German cinemas. In my opinion it highly promotes paedophilia. (I don't mean to offend anyone by saying this).Spoilers. I want to explain this statement: two hot girls, looking like they are in their mid-twenties, seduce this 43 year old father and then pretend they are minors and want a huge punishment for this Keanu-dad's behavior... that already is sick. But the scene where Bel puts on his daughters school clothes and calls him daddy???? Let's not forget that she is wearing an 8 year old's (his daughters) undies. What the serious f... - what in the world - this is sick! Then she 'rapes' him (he easily could have slammed her off the bed) and continues to call him daddy. I mean what in the world is wrong with these people??? Who came up with this idea? To me this person belongs in prison. I am being serious. Turns out these girls aren't even minors and the whole movie made no point.To me this was the absolute worst movie I have EVER seen. My date felt the same. We both felt pretty awkward after watching this movie! No actually throughout this WHOLE movie.Also - what was the role of this dog, which to me was the only likable thing in this movie. Last note, I kinda hope whoever wrote the screenplay or came up with the idea will be punished. In whatever way.

They prey on married men seductively and hope they say yes to their advances to then ruin the mens lives. Keanue Reeves performed disappointingly as the type of acting on all parts reminded me of several B rated thriller/dramas with a low budget.Overall it has a very weak storyline and it just wasn't an enjoyable watch, it didn't have me enticed at any point nor did it make me want to watch more.4/10",Knock Knock

Like most movie watchers I am not an actor, not a film or theater director and not an educated acting expert. I am just a film lover, therefore - like most people writing reviews on IMDb - I am not exactly qualified to judge Keanu Reeve's acting. And that's great, because I have no problems with his acting. If I know anything about acting, I can say that Keanu Reeve's is not a great drama actor and has never been, he's just not that kind of actor. And that's probably why he never does that kind of movies. Neither does Arnold Schwarzeneger, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. However, he is a successful actor because he is great for a different type of movies, for portraying people of certain type - real life people of certain type. Therefore he is a legitimately good actor. It's hard for me to describe that, but if you have watched other movies that Keanu was in, you know what I mean. What I am trying to say here is, his acting is not any worse in this movie than in others, like The Matrix, Street Kings and John Wick. What makes this movie terrible, though, is directing. And that's Eli Roth's fault. This movie is just pointless. It's for the kind of people who like movies that are disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing. And it probably is good in that genre. But with Keanu Reeves being in it, I guess people expected it to be a different kind of movie.",Knock Knock

Which I guess could be argued that this is the mark of a god movie because it stays with you for a little bit. Let me get one thing straight however, this is not a good movie. The script is very juvenile at best and downright horrible at worst. There is very little, if any, character development that makes us want to feel something for the characters. We have two attractive women who seduce a devoted father and then torture him because he let them. Yes. That is the entire plot. But there are some true saving graces with this film in it's acting. Say what you will about Keanu Reeves as an actor, this may have been one of his best performances hes given in a long time, only because he is real and gives an honest performance of a man who has been taken hostage in his own home by women who are slightly insane. Director Eli Roth makes use of long takes which is refreshing to see in a medium that has become known for shorter and shorter takes. And the two actresses, Lorenza Izzo and Ana De Armas, do a decent job with the characters they are given.

You have 30 seconds to hide, a 43 years old man cannot hide! can't ever run! or go outside. 6. A man made a mistake, what's your problem with his wife's art?This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could give it a zero star.",Knock Knock

In almost every seen I become outraged wanting to do something and my mind could not accept what that my eyes are seeing I wanted to change the story make it better and in the end I was excited and happy that for me this nightmare was over.. excellent acting and I hope not to see a movie like that in the near future nor in real life:)...,Knock Knock

I guess these feminists have to show ""strong"" women in the movies to overcompensate their enormous weakness and inferiority to men in real life.An ideological, misandric, and totally out of touch with reality movie.

To me its those obvious horror/thriller loopholes that end up bringing the genre down a bit in terms of rating but at the end of the day are a bit of inevitability when it comes to these flicks and as a viewer you can either choose to look past them or not, and depending on your approach it will likely dictate what you think of the movie. In the end it got me pretty infuriated but i actually appreciated that aspect of it, the plot needed far more work in terms of fluidity but wasn't completely let down by the acting, with some scenes having some real shine to them, It also deals with some edgy scenes in a very anger invoking and arousing way (kudos to Ana de Armas) that was very reminiscent of domination and taboo. ultimately worth watching.

The acting was good and I thought Keanu was very good as well.(possible Spoilers) The movie starts with a lovely tone, seeing the happy family and a pretty great Keanu as a a loving father. He is alone for a few days working on a project. Then he gets a visit from two girls, they need help and he is a nice guy so he helps them, they then completely abuse his giving nature and ultimately trap him and end up doing all kinds of horrible things to him and the house.What truly makes this movie horrific is the fact it seems rather real and it seems like it actually could happen. As a guy this movie terrified me. I even paused it because I was so frustrated at one point. This movie works with the real horror of powerlessness and injustice. There is no supernatural monster out to kill you, there is no zombie Apocalypse. I was not happy watching the movie, but i do think it is good.

Coming from Eli Roth (loved Hostel I & II, Cabin Fever, Grindhouse) I expected more from this movie, especially since IMDb listed it under ""Crime, Horror, Thriller"". What???!!! The only crime about this movie is watching it!! There was absolutely no horror nor thriller to speak of. Keanu Reeves was completely emotionless even when yelling and trying to be tough. (Not sure if this is considered a spoiler - As far as the girls go, what was with the damn giggling throughout the entire movie - compelety annoying) The acted like they were 10 years old if that.

Keanu Reeves, AKA (Evan Webber) from Knock Knock could have very easily accessed the hidden hand gun very early on in the movie once he realized he was dealing with 2 sychopathic nymphomaniacs that wanted nothing but to run some scam on him. Horney or not, he was supposedly a very happily married man in this movie. So there was no sense in making him appear to be a helpless walking hard on that didn't know any better. This movie was just a disappointment for such a great actor. I hope that this is not a sign of what the future hold for Keanu Reeves.

Imagine his wife is an idiot, did not believe him, took the kids and divorced him. That would be the suggested ending, won't it. What seems to be a moral story leaves an unfinished business.

Evan's (Keanu Reeves) ridiculously cliché happy family have left him alone for the weekend, presumably to buy more 'Worlds Best Dad' mugs. That's when two young ladies lost in rainstorm find themselves at his door.The film from here on can be split into two major parts. The first, Evan's seduction. Which was generally well done and convincingly acted by both Keanu and the two girls. It was easy to empathize with Evan as he battled with his worries, his guilt and his desire to give in to the temptresses.The second half of the film is where things get a little shaky. The girls return to Evan, to punish him for his infidelity. And while they are both believably crazy. the scenes very rarely have moments of tension. In fact the set pieces bring more humor than anything else. It has all the standard thriller tropes, a very weak 'torture' scene, a shocking revelation and even a scene where Evan snaps. They were all met by laughter from the audience.The only danger is from Evan's fear of what will happen when his wife finds out. And even that is dispelled by the end in a scene which very clearly leaves him looking like a victim. Overall it was somewhat enjoyable, but not for the reasons Eli Roth would of hoped I imagine.

It was truly one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my life. I had high hopes for the movie before seeing it, especially since I'm a fan of Keanu Reeves in many of his other movies. However I found the movie to be utterly bizarre and ridiculous and struggled to sit through the whole movie and resist the urge to leave. The acting was really over the top at times and so painful to watch. The plot did have potential and could have been so much better but unfortunately it did not work at all in this movie. Many of the scenes are extremely creepy and perverted, and not what I would expect to see in any movie. I found parts of this movie very difficult to understand and follow, so that I eventually lost interest completely.

Keanu had chances to kick back but instead gets hit by a fork by a teenage girl and gets tied up and that's so ridiculous and finally when you expect some twist you will find that both the girls will bury the so called matrix hero called Keanu Reeves in his own backyard unto his neck and there ends the movie all of sudden...such a waste of money and two hours of precious time.,Knock Knock

Or the scene later in the film when she holds a gun to his head from about a meter away, i don't know about you but in a life threatening situation like that i would try i take the gun off her because he knows they want to kill him so what does he have to lose. Oh and he obviously has to trip over when he runs out of the house otherwise it wouldn't be a horror film.Another issue i had was the fact that in the end of the film it is revealed that they never were going to kill him and they just wanted to conduct a social experiment but didn't they already kill that guy Louis i mean they caused him to brake his neck even though they later said that it was all just a hoax or did everyone just forget about that guy.Finally although i didn't really like the film it did make me laugh at the end when he accidentally liked the video i feel like if the film had more dark comedy i would have liked it more.",Knock Knock

The last line is the worst thing, the kids could use more coaching but the thing is, the entire story is poorly written and executed, so if you ask me, the problem doesn't start with the cast, it's the started since the preproduction, the script like I've mentioned, is poorly written so whoever authorized the money for this movie is the one to blame, they clearly haven't seen actual good movies before.

So, the film starts out showing us the fact that Keanu Reeves is this perfect,amazing family man with perfect kids and a perfect wife and everyones so happy and perfect,which is basically shoved down our throats for about 20 minutes. So unnecessary. His wife and kids then f**k off somewhere(where to,no one cares) he's left alone in the house with the wife's sculpture, which is a God awful looking thing and that for some reason is more important than life itself, and then the two girls turn up and what is already a horrendously awful film becomes actual torture that you only carry on watching because it's so bad, you'll laugh. There's so much wrong with it. The two actresses can't act for sh*t and are so annoying that any kind of sex appeal disappears (along with your soul,if you managed to watch the full film) and Keanu's acting is just so so bad, I feel like he just turned up on set because he had f**k all else to do. On top of all of this, there are so many things that are just unrealistic: he wouldn't be overpowered by two tiny girls,they wouldn't be able to dig that hole wearing what they were wearing, they would've been knackered after digging that hole, they didn't need a hole that big, he would've tried to get to the ipad when they started digging the hole, not when they'd nearly finished, he wouldn't have gotten his arm free so easily after being buried and no one would've wanted to see his wife's sh***y sculpture. These are just a tiny amount of the stupid things in this sh***y film. And to top it all off, the blonde girl in the film keeps on making references to how her dad sexually abused her. One remark would be enough but every 5 minutes? WHY?! The only entertaining part of the entire thing is when Keanu goes on a rant about how hes a good person and that the girls came to HIS house and f****d HIM, which I honestly think was meant to be a serious bit of acting but it was done so badly and went on for so long I actually laughed out loud for the whole scene.

It was so awkward to watch the moment the kids entered the scene, I knew this was going to be horrible. I enjoy Keanu Reeves! Hello? Neo Anderson? John Constantine? John Wick? Kai? Klaatu? Alex Wyler? Those are all some good flicks. But this was just a couple of chicks (wicked as they come) making a mess out of someone's house, just because. Also, I honestly don't know why art was such a big part of the film... It went no where. Just a story filler I guess. The whole film is based on a 48 hour span of nothingness. Reeves' Character Evan is some kind of awkward. Kind of like he doesn't know how to use his manhood. (Who would after being deprived of sex for 3 weeks-poor guy, Ha). And WHAT IS WITH HIS DOGS ALWAYS BEING SCREWED OVER. Is my review a little all over the place, null of story, and boring? And where the only part that catches your attention is the sex in the beginning? Thaaaaats exactly how the flick is.

OMG!...nothing... this movie is nothings and I pity Keanu for producing it. How can he be so dumb to produce a movie where he did the worst acting of his career or for that matter worst of the worst actor's. Both the female characters were so dumbly irritating that you want to kill them while watching the movie.

Keanu plays a absolute wimp and there are so many times he can sort out his situation, but doesn't and cant fight two stupid teenage girls.

Instead of spending one and a half hours watching a moderately scary horror film, I spent one and a half hours watching a film with no intentions but to show cruelty.

I am doing so purely because this creation is so bad it's criminal; I would implore anybody reading this review not to waste 90 minutes of your life watching this abomination. That is time you will never get back, time that could be put to better use watching infomercials - they would have a stronger plot and more engaging characters.Speaking of plots, it was so weak it had me lurching between two polar states of either uncontrollable ridicule or seething rage. The flaws were endless, so plentiful in fact that I felt compelled to keep watching to make absolutely sure that the utter nonsense unfolding before my burning retina was not going get any better. Needless to say, it didn't.All that said, the plot was by far and away not the most offensive aspect of the whole sorry episode, oh no. The acting I was witnessing had me blinking in disbelief; it is no exaggeration to say that I've seen more convincing, skillful performances by naive children in nativity plays. Keanu was at his dismal worst, fighting to inject some believability into the situation; however his efforts were completely and utterly nullified by a duo of the worst 'actresses' ever to offend my eyes. With utter disdain I gritted my teeth through their hackneyed delivery of horrendous 'performances'. It occurred to me at one point that they were actually getting paid for this assault on the acting profession and a little bit of vomit involuntarily entered my mouth. Both of them managed to compete constantly for the dubious honour of the 'World's Most Clichéd Acting Style'. Both managed to deliver entirely unconvincing performances that should be instantly forgotten but unfortunately are now etched into my brain in slow motion like a harrowing train wreck. I'm convinced they watched the 10 cheesiest thriller/suspense movies of all time and set out to beat them all for a lack of originality, believability and depth of character.Having said all of that, I am literally baffled as to why Keanu agreed to do this movie.In short I have three recommendations for this attempt at a movie.

They beg him to go away with them. I was kind of disappointed at the fact that it portrays men to be so easy to be seduced and women to be such manipulative, sex craved vixens. I can't say I can give a full sypnosis of this film as I fast forwarded Almost all of the film.

This fact alone disappoints me because I am a Reeve fan and a little part of that admiration just went away. The film started well, with him sidestepping their advances and being seeing the girls as young and stupid, but in the bathroom scene apparently all of that goes out the window just because they're naked. Wow. As the film progresses it seems to become a slight against men, by portraying them to be these idiotic, misogynistic, and sex on the brain oafs that will do anything as long as there is a piece of ""meat"" hanging in front of them. This becomes overly clear when the character, ""Genesis"" has the line, ""You all are the same"" and ""They never say no."" I understand that this is a film but to create something so bigoted and dogmatic and think that it is acceptable; it really begins to bring to light the morals and philosophies of the writers and producers. I know that this will probably make some folks mad or angry but flip the situation around. If it had been a woman on the bed getting raped by a man, I'd put money on the fact that this movie wouldn't have made it beyond the notepad of the first writer. We as a society tend to have double standards that usually benefit one party or another, and I completely understand why this happens and why it is bad. But to campaign against this problem and to become a more accepting society, movies like this are not helping whatsoever. I am not trying to suggest censoring literature and media, but to have a film that is so one-sided is very detrimental to furthering our society to become rational and fair. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this film. It will only make the viewer angry and frustrated. I feel this film will only please one particular group of people, the more radical feminist groups. More liberal feminists will probably be angered by the movie because it really puts a bad name on the movement, by making it seem that this is what feminism hopes to prove. The intention of my review is not one of contention and hostility but to give my opinion and hopefully shine some light on the reasoning behind it. I just ask that before you go and fire away a comment or a reply to this review, to try and see it from a different my perspective, a 22 year old man that is still trying to understand how the world works. Thank you. P.S. I use the word ""feminism"" and ""feminist,"" not as a derogatory remark or slight, but just as a descriptor of a noble movement or person.",Knock Knock
905,merylhartstein,The Worst,1,13 December 2015,The movie was so bad we had to fast forward most of the scenes just to find out how sick this movie is.. My boyfriend is on with cable company to get bis money back..it was a bad version of Fatal Attraction. He should have stayed on the bus! We should have gone online to read reviews which had been more fun that watching this hideous excuse for a movie. The whole cast should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves .

906,boykol,intelligent competent architect overpowered and outwitted by two loony girls,1,17 December 2015,"Movie is unrealistic in these ways. Keanu's victim character actually called 911 and reported a break in. One of the girls quickly hung up the phone before he could say more. In such an instance it is police policy to visit... they would have been there within minutes, taking a report and names of everyone. Game over right there.Size and strength advantage was overwhelmingly in Evan's favor. Even when he realized the seriousness of the situation, he was overpowered by just one of the two girls in a fight, not a tag team attack (even then, in real life they'd lose every time).With his life clearly in grave danger, and within grappling distance, Evan makes no move for the girl pointing a gun at him. For one, I watched closely and her fingers were BEHIND the trigger. Not to mention it's a Beretta 92fs with a very slow heavy double action first trigger, also to his advantage. It's his gun, he'd know both of these things. Further considering the efforts to hide it from his kids in the sculpture/vase, it's very likely the SAFETY WAS ON. I rewound and it appeared to be on but somewhat dark and blurry. Either way with your life on the line you lunge, especially with an obvious total gun novice that is stupidly too close with her fingers BEHIND the trigger. All of this was unbelievable.Digging that hole would have taken those little girls hours (they likely would have been exhausted and totally spent, unable to chase Evan down later when he made a break for it). Further, the girls would have been too deep in the hole working and distracted, and that ridiculous cord tie up job could have been quickly worked loose with any adrenaline fueled effort while they were toiling away. He could have gotten his gun and game over.The comedic 'liking' the horrible Facebook post by accident and the kid making the line about daddy having a party took away from the serious thriller aspects that the director tried but failed to achieve throughout the movie. Still, bad call, counterproductive decision.Not realistic enough to be terrifying, more like a bad unintended dark comedy.",Knock Knock

I give this film a 6/10 because the acting is good it has its up's and downs its how you say ""teenage humor"" which is okay. Keanu Reeves does an alright job i felt toward the middle of the film he started to drift away a little bit. ""Lorenza Izzo"" and ""Ana De Armas"" do an excellent job in there roles playing deranged and mental women. I was satisfied with what i watched. This film is definitely at least a rent definitely not worth spending $20, $15 or even $10 dollars. This is a watch though with some friends or even a sleep over watch.

It was meant to be Eli Roth's take on a home invasion, it was artful, and brilliant in my opinion. The girls acted their parts so well that they made me angry which was the point. Keenu Reeves was wonderful as always, this was a very different role from his usual and he hit it on point. The plot of the movie was excellent, the acting was phenomenal, the moral of the story was brilliant. I just don't understand why so many people hated this movie. Maybe it was too racy?

914,katiekoo,"Terrible, even by my standards.",1,13 January 2016,"Let me start off by saying that I really enjoy a lot of Eli Roth's work. Cabin Fever was the first of his films that I watched and I love it. Hostel was not too bad for what it was, and I've watched it a few times- while many don't like the ""torture porn"" aspect of it, I've always thought that it was a very creepy, unsettling movie and had great atmosphere. I recently watched The Green Inferno and enjoyed that a lot as well, despite it getting fairly bad reviews from a lot of people. At any rate, the point is that I've definitely been an Eli Roth fan for a while now.I'm also a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. I've seen nearly every film he's been in- that's how big of a Reeves fan I am. That doesn't make me blind to his acting capabilities though. There are definitely movies he's been in where his performance leaves much to be desired. But I thought he was amazing in certain roles, like Constantine, The Devil's Advocate, etc. and even some of his romantic roles like Sweet November were pretty decent.But my god. This movie was just horrible. It pains me to say that, since it combines two people I'm definitely a fan of, but there are no redeeming qualities about this movie except the very cute French Bulldog.The girls' acting was pretty good; they were seductive and psychotic and did well in their roles. But Keanu was terrible; the scenes where he's being hurt in some way and screaming are completely unconvincing. I did like the first bit of the movie with his family, I'll give him that.The ""plot"" is pretty bad, the pacing is just terrible and overall I found this movie just really...boring. That's probably the best way to describe it. I was thinking for a Roth film that there would be more awful things happening but in all honesty, without trying to spoil anything, the physical stuff that the girls put Reeves through is mild at best.I also would have liked a bit more depth to the girls and why they were doing everything but I suppose that's probably a minor complaint compared to the rest of the problems with this movie.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed such masterpieces as ""Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead"" way more than I enjoyed this movie, and Paris Hilton's performance in ""House of Wax"" was superior to Reeves in this film.",Knock Knock

He is a very likable guy and the antagonists are genuinely disturbing early on. Everything is set up so well for a classic B horror movie. Unfortunately, I wouldn't hold it to even that standard. Everything goes to crap after the first act. As another reviewer stated, Keanu's performance after the introduction is pretty reminiscent of Nicolas Cage in 'Wicker Man'. He's not entirely terrible, but the script doomed him from the start. The weird factor of the villains essentially went from good to just plain stupid. Lots of awful, awful clichés also pop their heads out in this film. There's nothing subtle about them either. Lots of events and stupid decisions are very lazily thrown in so that the writer could force certain things to happen. Even the way these things happen is ridiculous. One scene in particular made me cringe and almost turn it off halfway through. Terrible, terrible writing, even for a horror movie. I shouldn't have to say it like that, though. Just because it's horror, doesn't mean you don't have to put some original thought into your work. If you enjoyed the theme of the film, but want something a little better, check out 'Hard Candy' with Ellen Page. Still a bit weird, but certainly superior to 'Knock Knock'.",Knock Knock

925,mistrainflower,"Not really worth seeing, if looking for believable entertainment.",2,23 May 2016,"The writers were grasping for straws on this one.Let's face it, as viewers we want to be sucked into the middle of the story; we need to feel the excitement; our emotions have to be pulled from us and our intellect stimulated.This movie had me almost constantly saying to myself that the situations were unbelievable. Time after time it was obvious the writers would do almost 'anything' to try and create drama, thrills, and/or cause me to become emotionally involved, no matter how absurd the notions behind their ideas were, such that it came off as a comedy; a comedy spoof on how not to write a screenplay.If you're a highly sexed male that loves to see hot young women naked, you'll see them for a couple 'seconds,' which is probably the movies only redeeming quality, because Ana de Armas (Bell) is definitely a hottie; other than the imagery of Keanu's (Evan) and Ignacia's (Karen) successful family life and home, which was very pleasant, (the setting was nice).As soon as the antagonists Lorenza Izzo (Genesis) and Ana de Armas (Bell) arrive on screen, which isn't very far into the movie, it goes downhill pretty quickly, except as mentioned immediately above, not that their acting was bad, it's just the writing. The word 'Thriller' should absolutely not be used in the same sentence with any dialog pertaining to this movie, unless to say the supposed thrills were shrouded by unbelievably.I've loved Keanu since the debut of Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure, but let's face it, he's not the best actor when it comes to delivering believable lines. Unless of course he has very few lines to say. So to say that his lines in this movie were beneath him is a statement indeed. Sorry Keanu!The only reason we didn't turn it off before it was over was because we paid for the rental, and would feel even more ripped off if we had. At least we could laugh and make fun of the writers. So a comedy it was!In the end I was left wondering what the moral of the story was. I actually felt for the very first time, that the writers really had no idea, that it was only ever about two crazy hot chicks and nothing more.

The extreme childish behavior of the two girls (one of them was pouring pancake syrup directly into her mouth at breakfast) was so stupid and over the top. They behave like 5 year olds, only to find out at the end that they are actually both over 18. And Keanu's acting. OMG. I knew he wasn't Oscar material, but it was just BAD.",Knock Knock

It doesn't even make sense that they killed him, he did nothing. It doesn't make sense that they tried to cover it all up with the texts and hiding louis' body when they destroyed the house, wrote their names on the walls, posted a video with one of them in it and left their DNA and fingerprints all over he house. I mean, I know those girls were nuts, but are you for real? Who and why would they investigate men to have sex with and then kill them for being rapists? The man declined them in every way possible and he only gave in when they were already blowing him, they practically harassed him till he gave in, and also, they were all over him and they intended to get him to cheat and to have a threesome with them, so it doesn't make sense at all, he said it, and I hated him for saying it, it was like free pizza but they shoved the pizza down his throat until he accepted to eat it. Which gets me to the next point: we all hated him for the pizza monologue but if he declined them and he was avoiding them and rejecting them, the whole monologue doesn't fit, it's not like he opened the door and just had a threesome with them, he backed off several times; but that doesn't justify it, he said his monologue, it didn't make sense, but he said it. Also, the ending is very inconclusive, which could mean the director was ""leaving it"" to the audience, like to think about it but still it really doesn't get you nowhere. This movie is some mra stuff. I get it, some women lie about being raped, but most don't, most women don't even tell anyone and the amount of women who report it is minimal, and the amount of men who get away with it (even when they are reported) is huge, so yeah, women can be as horrible as men but that doesn't mean you can just rape people, and yes, women can be rapists too, but two girls investigating men to get them to cheat, destroy their families and then kill them doesn't make sense even if it's not reality. This movie just makes you feel angry every minute and lose sympathy for everyone but Louis and Evan's family. Also, how would they know his family was leaving for the weekend?

I don't even know why or how Keanu Reeves accepted this offer, it was bad decision to make. I was so disappointed. I did not understand why did not he go against two teenagers. In real life, almost every men would go against if they were in the same situation. Just running outside but fell off the ground? He had a knife and pan to attack these two. I really wish the actor was not Keanu Reeves, I watched it because of him. If the character was acted by a different actor, I would not even choose it.

Really, with a rating like 4.9 I was going to see a complete disaster. But what I have found is an absolute masterpiece. Keanu is a fantastic actor, stop perceiving him as Neo. Because in fact he is John Wick. I'm kidding! He is great at playing a person he meant to play. The film itself reminded me a High-Rise (which I think is a pretty good satire). And there was something familiar to an idea of man raped by a woman from Thursday (1998) (which I think is a very decent movie). So if you have liked those two, perhaps, you will like ""Knock knock"". There was a things to laugh at. And there was another things like ""Oh, man, this is so wrong... but this is what happening in our society. Some kind of madness.""

I had high hopes about it, Eli Roth to me was only known as Hostel I director which I think is not a bad movie, nor the best but, a good thriller is needed sometimes. Besides Keanu as a main character and an intriguing plot, a decent photography direction presented in the trailer was the perfect formula for an acceptable Sunday afternoon movie. FATHER'S DAY! At this point you just want to puke, everything is just so sweet and needlessly long that you're aiming to see everyone die or at least how the family gets destroyed somehow, none of this happens. I'll let you watch the movie at your own risk but i'll tell you, the family dog's is the best performance you'll see here and everything gets more and more annoying and ridiculous every second. There's no suspense, there's no blood, there's nothing you are expecting this film to be. The end is the worst of all, the forced knock knock joke to make it coincide with the title is so stupid will leave you wondering if the whole film was a really bad joke, it ends with the pixies song ""where is my mind"" which is good but, what were you thinking Eli Roth? this is not Fight Club.

This movie was so awful I got physically agitated and angry. I expected more from what I read in the summary, and the fact that Keanu Reeves headlines the film. I should have known in the first five minutes that the film was not going to get any better. The acting was so terrible I was cringing. I can understand what he did, I get that and I wasn't mad at him. However, as the film wore on I became more and more angry at him. Not for what he did, but because he could literally not have done less to try and escape the two crazy b***hes. He had so many opportunities, so many hours, and for someone who is supposedly intelligent the choices the character made were pathetic and infuriating. I have never seen a movie where the main character just lay there and take the brutal treatment. There was no reason for him to have just sat there staring into space. There was no reason for what the antagonists did--even crazy girlfriends/exes don't do this sh*t for such a petty reason. Secondly, the police would have been at the house pretty f**king shortly once he called 911 to report a break-in. They knew his address, and if he hung up abruptly the cops would have been on their d*mn way regardless of whether he was there to give all the freaking details. Lastly, they murdered a person and implied that it was not the first time. Like, sorry, but if they had done this to other men, then why didn't the other men left alive but humiliated give a description of the girls and why weren't there detectives looking for these psychotic murderers? Particularly if there were videos or photographs like the ones on his phone, there is no reason these girls hadn't been caught unless they were traveling state to state, and it really didn't seem like they had any kind of means to do so. Maybe they really were flight attendants? I want to scrub the memory of watching this from my brain. I want to get back the hour and a half that I just wasted watching this brain melting film.

Some reviews attacked the helplessness of the normally heroic Keanu Reeves. For me I saw it as refreshing to see him in such a vulnerable role, the underlining theme of the film was power and how fragile it can be. Do not watch this film if you do not want to see a very depraved and perverted play on the home invasion plot.There are sinister overtones from the very beginning with sweeping helicopter shots of Hollywood gradually leading to the family home accompanied by a chilling piano piece. You will then have to get through about 10 minutes of very forced and obvious narrative, this being Evan is a devoted family man. Examples include, countless family photos and kids drawings sprawled across every possible surface in the home, stale dialogue between his kids and wife including a very forced dad is a monster scene. from this there's only 3 plot points of any use taken from these very pointless scenes 1.Evan is a family man! 2. His wife's art piece is going to a gallery 3. Louis needs his asthma pump for almost no reason but most important is that Evan is a god damn family man!A big question asked by this film is who would say no to this scenario, two beautiful women with what seems like no consequence and a night of passionate sex. However it gets incredibly dark and perverted very quickly and we see any sort of control ripped away from Evan as the true intent of two sociopaths is uncovered. it's wonderfully wicked and exceptionally acted by all three leads with a frustratingly ambivalent ending that follows the theme of the film.
