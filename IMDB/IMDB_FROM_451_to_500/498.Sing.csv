0,TheLittleSongbird,"Doesn't completely sing, but really soars when it does",7,21 July 2017,"Took me a while to come round to watching 'Sing'. It looked very interesting, and animation and musicals are things there is a real personal fondness for. Why did it take so long to watch it? Being behind with my film watching and hearing very divisive opinions on how good it was or not.Seeing 'Sing' for myself finally with an open mind, from personal opinion it was an enjoyable film with many good elements but has a few things that stop it from being even better. It really does soar fantastically when it does work, which it does a vast majority of the time, but doesn't completely sing with a few things that weren't given quite enough attention. While opinions seem mostly mixed to positive, it is easy to see why people will find fault with it. As far as 2016 animated films go, it's a good one and one of the better ones but there are far superior ones overall.Let's start with the positives, which are a great many. The animation is wonderful, it's bright, colourful, rich in detail and with slick character designs and some parts in the musical numbers have some imagination. Absolutely loved the soundtrack, which was incredibly varied which was great (from the Beatles and Katy Perry to Puccini and Stevie Wonder, amongst many others) and they are not just great songs on their own but the renditions of them have so much passion and heart (even remarkably fresh takes on songs that are done to death in talent shows).Most of the writing is good with something for both kids (younger and a little bit older) and adults. Parts are very funny and others very heartfelt. Likewise with the story, simple and standard stuff but it entertains and it moves with very emotional and beautifully written back-stories for particularly Johnny and Meena. The portrayal of talent shows and the backstage drama, while not much new at all, is affectionate and with much heart instead of being cynical or exploitative. Its message is universal and is as easy to relate to as the best of 'Sing's' characters. Enjoyed most of the characters, Johnny and Meena are instantly easy to relate to and the portrayal of the underdog with a heart of gold will also appeal greatly. The chemistry between them all is great. The voice acting is terrific, especially slick Matthew McConaughey, emotive Taron Egerton (really surprised me he did) and Tori Kelly and sassy Reese Witherspoon. John C Reilly is funny too.However, as has been acknowledged, 'Sing' is pretty predictable in places and would have benefited from having less characters and richer depth to more of the back-stories, all interesting but some rushed and not explored enough. Some of the characters were too thinly sketched, and some could have been left out entirely (a shame when most were written very well).For instance, count me in as somebody who found Mike an unpleasant and annoying character that will go over some children's heads and will make adults question about the message the character is meant to give out. Seth MacFarlane overdoes it in the voice acting too and considering the type of film needed to tone things down, this is a family film not the more adult-oriented 'Family Guy'.On the whole, while not perfect 'Sing' is enjoyable family fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Sing
1,SnoopyStyle,generic,6,24 September 2017,It's a world of animals. Koala bear Buster Moon grew up loving musicals. He's a producer but his theater is failing after several bad shows. He decides to throw everything into a prize for a singing competition. His secretary Miss Crawly screws up the flyer changing the reward from $1k to $100k. This attracts many performers from all walks of life. Rosita is a pig overwhelmed by her little piglets as a housewife. Mike is a mouse busker. Ash is a porcupine in the shadow of her boyfriend in their punk duo. Meena is a shy elephant. Johnny is a gorilla from a criminal family. There is also friend sheep Eddie who is the grandson to former singing diva Nana.This is a rather generic family movie. It takes no risks and there is nothing risky here. It's a safe movie for the family but not much more. There are lots of pop songs but the performances don't usually advance the plot. Not like there's a lot of plot to advance. This is an inoffensive animated movie for kiddies and young families.,Sing
2,Horst_In_Translation,Much more than an animated casting show,6,10 December 2016,"""Sing"" is a pretty new animated movie from this year that runs for almost 110 minutes and was written and directed by Garth Jennings, a filmmaker who has been prolific in the past, but not really in the animated film genre. Actually he has not made a new movie for almost ten years and before that he mostly worked on music videos. So him being the man in charge of this film we have here is definitely a bit surprising. The cast, however, is not surprising, The voice acting participation by Oscar winners Witherspoon and McConaughey as well as the likes of Johansson and Reilly shows how great and appreciated animated films are these days. Have been for a long time actually. And the reason is that the contents and quality are on a level where you can be almost sure with every animated movie that it is at least a decent watch, sometimes even a pretty good and occasionally even a great one. The animation is always top-notch, just like this one here, and the story is convincing most of the time too.The title already gives away that music is a core component in this one. And this component is also why I believe that people from all age groups can appreciate it. There are old songs in here for adults, new songs by Perry/Swift for teenagers and basically something for every age. And the very small ones will of course not just appreciate the music, but also all the colorful fun animals that are the humans of this world, just like in ""Zootopia"". And most of them, except the koala lead character, give music performances at some point. There were kids dancing in my showing in fact, this says it all. It's almost like a music event watching this film. For me personally, the absolute highlight was the Leonard Cohen song Hallelujah because it made me think of one of my favorite musicians' recent death. It fit nicely in terms of story too because it was a quite significant scene when we hear it. But it would have been even more perfect if it came from the same character at the very end because it's the same character who also has the film's closing number.So yeah, in terms of story-telling you should not be too precise about some of the plot developments like the father suddenly loving his son or the way one character defeats her stage fright, but it's all fine. I can accept it for the feel-good moments in there and lets be honest, even if the koala was supposed to be rather smart and headstrong, he is still pretty cute. There were many scenes in this film where I enjoyed the watch a lot. It needs a while to get going in terms of the drama, but when it does, it really owns the screen. The final music number is simply gigantic and at that point I was closer to giving it an 8/10 instead of a 4/10 for sure. But let's not forget the rest of the film. 6/10 seems fairly accurate I guess. Now, a final word on the casting show references. The film eventually takes a turn away from that concept and I believe this is a good thing as this is a subject that is really nothing too glorious and it should not be appreciated in a film like this one here. Luckily, it isn't really. Only to some extent in the first hour I guess. There are references about only one band member being good enough and what the other does. Or about a group (of frogs) splitting up.On a completely different note, it is funny how the film really tries his best to be kids-friendly. The snail does not get killed, but celebrates at the end with all the other ""losers"". They are all happy finally. And there are more moments like these. You will know what I mean when you see them. As a whole, I would not call this film a triumph, but it comes pretty close at times, especially at the ending and there are some emotionally great moments in here for sure too. That's why my final verdict is that it is indeed one of the best animated films of the year. It may be a bit of a long shot for it to receive an Academy Award nomination, but I still hope it can. Or at least we can maybe even get a sequel at some point. Until then, see this one. You will most certainly not regret it.",Sing
3,nogodnomasters,All Creatures Great and Small,10,13 August 2017,"Following on the heels of ""Moana"" this is another must see film for the kids (and of course for you since you have to take them). Buster Moon is a play producer/director who has made flops. He means well, although his antics may approach that of Zero Mostel. He decides to have a talent contest for the best singer. We get to meet every character. The characters are cliché and the film formula, but it works due to the animation.We want them all to win as they are all underdogs. I was secretly pulling for the elephant. We have a shy singer, an unappreciated housewife and mother, a jilted woman, a con man, and a young person forced into a gang. None of the performers sing from just one artist. The film boasts 64 song credits, and while it has plenty of songs, it is not a musical. Fun uplifting film with some down moments. It was a film where the audience felt like applauding afterwards. A story about following your dream.",Sing
4,classicsoncall,"""Real talent from real life - that's what audiences want!""",8,22 January 2017,"My eight year old granddaughter could hardly contain herself when I asked her if she wanted to see the movie. All through the picture she would poke me when something struck her as unusually cute or funny. We caught the 3-D version which was well done. I don't get to see that many so it's cool to see how the animators make their characters come off the page so to speak.I for one am pretty poor at recognizing the actors behind the voices in animated flicks like this and I wouldn't have guessed a single one here. With that in mind, I thought all the non-professional singers who lent their talent did a pretty good job. Seth MacFarlane was a hoot as Mike the Sinatra Mouse with a nice rendition of 'My Way', and I couldn't get over Scarlett Johansson rocking it out as her character Ash, or Reese Witherspoon as Rosita. They all sounded good with strong singing voices.What gets me as I read the negative reviews on this board for what's nominally a kid's picture is how nasty some of the comments are. One particularly deranged reviewer goes into specific detail on how each of the singing animals performing in Buster Moon's talent show represents a nominee of President Donald Trump's cabinet. That would be especially amazing foresight for writer and director Garth Jennings who started on the project early in 2014, with an almost completed film screened as a work in progress at the Toronto Film Festival back in September of 2016.Well, not to get sidetracked, but this film is generally fun entertainment for the entire family with an important message of perseverance for youngsters on working toward completing their goals. That one's best exemplified by Tori Kelly's Meena - ""Don't let fear stop you from doing the things you love.""",Sing
5,gavin6942,Forgettable,6,22 October 2017,"In a city of humanoid animals, a hustling theater impresario's attempt to save his theater with a singing competition becomes grander than he anticipates even as its finalists' find that their lives will never be the same.You might think with a soundtrack loaded with popular songs, and a cast of voices that are some of the biggest names out there... this would be huge. And surely many people like it. The toddler who watched it with me seemed to enjoy it.But it just did not seem to often anything more than the same old thing. Unlike ""Zootopia"", it gives us this world of humanoid animals without really giving us any reason or logic behind the world. I would love to know why the British gangsters were represented by gorillas. What does this symbolize?",Sing
6,jboothmillard,Sing,7,17 June 2020,"I saw plenty of pictures and clips for this film at the time it was released, most frequently the pig singing and dancing to ""Poker Face"" by Lady Gaga, it was rated well and a good cast of voices, so I looked forward to it, directed by Garth Jennings (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Son of Rambow). Basically, set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, in the city of Calatonia, Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey), a koala bear, is a theatre impresario, with a struggling theatre, and a bank representative, Judith (Rhea Perlman), a llama, threatens to shut it down. To save the theatre, Buster hosts a singing competition with a cash prize. His assistant, Miss Crawly (Garth Jennings), an elderly iguana, is making the poster, when her glass eye falls out onto the keyboard, adding two extra zeros to the prize money, and the misprinted flyers are blown out the window into the street. Animals from across the city gather to audition. The successful auditionees selected include Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), a pig housewife and mother of 25 piglets; Ash (Scarlett Johansson), a punk-rock porcupine; Johnny (Taron Egerton), gorilla son of mobster Big Daddy (Peter Serafinowicz); Mike (Seth MacFarlane), a mouse street musician; a singing and dancing frog trio; and Pete, a camel opera singer. Meena (American Idol star Tori Kelly), a teenage elephant fails her audition when she gets stage fright, while Ash's ill-tempered boyfriend Lance (Beck Bennett) is dismissed from the contest. Rosita is partnered with exuberant dancing pig named Gunter (Nick Kroll) for a routine. It is only when questioned by the contestant that Buster realises the flyers advertised a prize of $100,000, money he does not have, but he remains optimistic. He arranges with his friend Eddie (John C. Reilly), a sheep, to meet Eddie's grandmother, former opera singer and stage actress Nana Noodleman (Jennifer Saunders), who is uninterested in helping to sponsor the prize money but agrees to attend a private preview of the show. Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance to perform but becomes a stagehand instead. When the frog trio breaks up and quits and Pete is injured, Meena is added as an act, despite Buster has yet to hear her sing. Rosita struggles learning her dance routine with Gunter, having parenting duties. Ash discovers that Lance has left her for a new girlfriend, and they are evicted from their apartment, she breaks down during her performance of her song, Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe"". Johnny is torn between rehearsals and having to help his father as the getaway driver for an upcoming heist. Trying to do both, he gets stuck in traffic and fails to pick up the robbers in time, his father and his gang are arrested. Meena does not get any help in overcoming her stage fright. Mike, confident the prize is as good as his, buys a fancy car to impress a female mouse and swindles a group of bears. The day of the preview, the bears interrupt the show, demanding the money from Mike, who points to Buster. The bears open the prize chest, but the money inside is nowhere near $100,000. Then the theatre is flooded when the large water tank, containing luminescent squids performing lighting effects, cracks, and breaks, causing the theatre to collapse. The land is repossessed and Buster, who had been living in his desk as the theatre, is forced to live with Eddie and his parents. The contestants try to cheer him up, but Buster is too despondent to listen. He tries to start over by opening a car wash. Then Buster hears Meena singing ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen from a distance in the rubble of the theatre. He is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money, performing on a makeshift stage on the lot for Rosita and Meena's families. Rosita and Gunter perform Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"", which finally prompts Rosita's husband, Norman (Nick Offerman), to pay attention to her singing talent. More animals are drawn to the show which is being broadcast on the news. Johnny's rendition of Elton John's ""I'm Still Standing"" impresses his father, who escapes from prison to reconcile with him and apologise. Despite an interruption by Judith, Ash sings her original rock song ""Set It All Free,"" which her ex-boyfriend watches on TV. Mike returns to the show and, despite a helicopter hovering over the theatre, sings Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"". Lastly, Meena finally overcomes her stage fright and sings Stevie Wonder's ""Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing"", which literally brings down the house. The show is a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. She buys the lot and the theatre is rebuilt and reopened. Also starring Jennifer Hudson as Young Nana, Jay Pharoah as Meena's Grandfather, Leslie Jones as Meena's Mother, Laraine Newman as Meena's Grandmother, Adam Buxton as Stan, a member of Big Daddy's gang, and Bill Farmer as News Reporter Dog, with additional voices from Wes Anderson, Bob Bergen, Jim Cummings, Tara Strong and Edgar Wright. All the cast are chosen well to play likeable characters, McConaughey slickly voicing the lead koala character, and there are fantastic singing voices, the stand-outs being Witherspoon, McFarlane, Johansson and Edgerton (who played Elton John three years later). This film will appeal to fans of shows like The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent and American Idol, the backstories of the individual wannabe characters are good. The script is well-written, and the animation is of course superb, but the best thing is the soundtrack, with a great choice of popular new and old songs, something for all the family, a marvellous computer-animated family musical comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Faith"", and Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!",Sing
7,tavm,Sing is the most enjoyable of the musical computer-animated movies we've seen this year!,9,21 December 2016,"This is the third computer-animated movie in a row that features actual singing by the characters after Trolls and Moana. The title basically means just about every character is singing something because it's about a singing contest being produced because the producer wants something that brings the people to his theatre, not like those previous shows that didn't do much for his career. Seems like all genres of music from various decades is represented here. My movie theatre-working friend was especially enamored with the gorilla singing a song associated with his favorite singer, Elton John. This movie does show the struggles of putting on a show and possible disasters that happen when risks are taken. I really don't want to reveal any more so I'll just say that me and my friend highly recommend Sing.",Sing
8,oscaralbert,If you're wondering WHY America's House of Horror & Disaster Flicks . . .,9,12 January 2017,". . . Universal Studios is releasing a CARTOON feature (!)--SING--wonder no more: SING is the most definitive film treatment of the Trump Administration that Hollywood has released to date. ""It's a miracle that anyone survived such an unbelievable disaster,"" says a bystander, viewing the wreckage of koala Buster Moon's imploded theater, which it's quite obvious for us to take as an effort to symbolize post-D.J. Trump America. ""I'm a Danger to Society--a deluded, washed-up charlatan who never had a hit in his career,"" Buster confesses to his henchmen after this catastrophe, ripping the words out of many-times bankrupt Casino Builder, Court-Documented Founder of a Fraudulent University, and most pertinent to SING, a Ne'Er-Do-Well near the record for being ""America's Biggest Loser"" in respect to his entertainment history of having Umpteen Emmy Nominations (the field is very thin) without so much as one Golden Doodad to show for it with his APPRENTICE series--this from Trump's mouth, IF he were an honest man. In fact, the entire cast of Buster's acts closely mirrors the key nominees to Trump's Cabinet of Deplorables. The scheming ""I Did It My Way"" white rat Mike is easily seen as one-time white-robed KKK Imperial Wizard (slotted as attorney general) Jeff Sessions, the Gangster Gorilla Johnny fits treasonous Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson (see his record in the sewers of Chad, Iran, and Syria) to a tee, the stentorian-voiced elephant (the Party Symbol of the Repubs) can be none other than Kellyanne Conway, the tunnel-visioned porcupine intent upon transforming SING's culture for kids into a fatuous ""Reality Show"" competition must be incoming ""Education"" Secretary ""Amway Calling"" Betsy DeVos, Hell-bent upon eliminating America's K-12 Public School System in favor of chains of low-performing for-profit ""Charter Schools"" run by her Billionaire Buddies pledged NOT to teach problem-solving, science, critical thinking, or the 3 R's, but rather a curriculum consisting only of bogus ""Talent Show"" preparation, and nothing else--the list of these spot-on Trumpster impersonations cutting to the Truth of America's Doom offered by the makers of SING just goes on and on.",Sing
9,neil-476,Musical fun,8,15 May 2018,"Buster Moon, seeking to save his failing theatre, stages a talent contest. The competitors include dancing housewife Rosita, teenage delinquent Johnny, undervalued songwriter and ace guitarist Ash, cocky crooner Mike, shy songstress Meena etc. And each of these has personal and domestic issues to be resolved.A synopsis makes it clear that there is very little originality here as regards story. This sort of tale dates back to the 1930s, to early sound musicals with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. And even though the characters' assorted problems can be viewed as more modern - Johnny's Dad is a bank robber, Rosita's husband undervalues her, Mike is tied up with organised crime - they still won't come as a surprise to any adult who has watched films since childhood.But let's factor in that these characters are all anthropomorphised animals, and that this is a CGI movie with kids as its primary audience, and the familiarity of its plot becomes considerably less important.Since marvelling at Toy Story, and then Shrek, there have been so many CGI features that one can more or less take it as read that character and product design, animation and voicework will all be first rate, and that is the case here - one expects accomplishment, and a film which falls short in these areas is far more noteworthy than one which doesn't. So we can take it as read that Sing - largely put together by the French Despicable Me production company - is as visually striking as we would expect it to be.Where it succeeds is in the musical numbers, both in how they are staged, and in how emotionally they are integrated into the narrative. I'm a sucker for music which grips me by the throat, either in its own right or by reference to how it is presented, and a lot of the music here does just that. I'm not going to give examples because, if this movie is your sort of thing, then I don't want to spoiler any of the delights in store for you.The music, from across the musical spectrum, is well-chosen and well-used, whether in its or original form or as rearranged. I had never realised that Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight was so sad.So don't see it if you hate musicals, CGI, or movies with no surprises. But if you're OK with all that, you'll love it.",Sing

Watching trailers for movies coming out in the new year,I was surprised to see a second non-Minion title from Illumination was about to come out! Which led to me clearing my voice and singing.The plot:Facing a serious risk of losing a theatre which has been owned by his family for generations, Buster Moon decides to stage a talent show,where the winner will get $1000. Focused with keeping the lights on,Moon gets his secretary Ms. Crawly to print the flyers. In possession of some wonky eyes,Crawly mistypes and gets everyone in the city to believe that Moon is hosting a show with a top $100,000 prize.View on the film:Returning to the entertainment industry after spending a decade falling to get any projects going,writer/co-director (along with Christophe Lourdelet) Garth Jennings swings back onto the big screen with energetic,rapid-fire crane shots ducking and weaving round every corner of the singing city. Lining everyone up in town to audition,Jennings and Lourdelet give each of the characters a brightly bold appearance that would make them easy to tell a part even in silhouette, from the spiky Punk Rock hair of the hedgehogs,to the monster lizard Miss Crawly (who is well voiced by Jennings.)Featuring over 85 songs from the 40's to the present,the screenplay by Garth Jennings makes the 110 minute running time fly pass by barely leaving a minute of the film not being touched by an excellent ""mix tape"" going from the timeless numbers of ""old blue eyes"" to modern toe- tapping Pop. Focused mostly on the songs,Jennings still finds space for a neat story involving Moon's funny sly underhanded business dealings with mishaps during the rehearsal,which when performed by a crooning Seth MacFarlane and a high-kicking Scarlett Johansson,help Sing hit a high note.",Sing
11,Mr-Fusion,Top 40 exuberance,5,19 March 2017,"Looking at ""Sing"" from a family movie standpoint, it's pretty solid. This is your usually candy-colored kids movie, but it's clean, fun and really just wants to get the audience moving. My wife and daughter really liked this, and I guess that's really all you need if you're looking for such a movie.It's somewhat a disappointment for me because, even with its familiar ""save the theater"" theme, it feels more like American Idol than the Muppets. Granted, it's impressive that fifty year-old songs found their way onto the setlist, but the focus is unquestionably modern. Getting to the point of why this movie is not really my bag, it's really just the music.5/10",Sing
12,StevePulaski,Illumination finally gives their formula the life and respect necessary for it to succeed,7,26 November 2016,"After wading in the water in terms of quality for the better half of this year, Illumination Entertainment finally gets the above-average film they deserve with Sing. The sad part about a film like this - which is basically an animated variety show of animals covering yesterday and today's pop tunes - is it's more likely to fail than succeed on the simple merit that its narrative prompts for things like humor based on recognition, general unevenness, and lazy screen writing. While all of those certainly come into play sooner or later, you might just be surprised, as I was, how Sing's effervescent charm sneaks up on you well into its second act and manifests its way into becoming an enjoyable, character-centered experience.The film revolves around the perky Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey), a Koala bear who owns the historic Moon Theatre and has for the past twenty-five years. In the present day, however, the theater is dilapidated, with crippled, worn infrastructure that can barely stay intact. Buster hasn't put on a show in three years, but with the help of his elderly, but well-meaning lizard assistant Ms. Crawly (director Garth Jennings), they decide to host a singing competition which will eventually pave the way for a variety show of sorts for the entire neighborhood.Originally intending the winner of the competition to get $1,000, a typo by Ms. Crawly renders the cash prize $100,000, money that Buster doesn't have but must fake like he does until the show is over. This becomes harder to do when he sees exactly how troubled most of his talent are, and how they're all singing to escape or better themselves. There's a teenage gorilla named Johnny (Taron Egerton), who is trying to forge a path for himself unlike his father's that doesn't involve petty crime and gang activity, a mouse named Mike (Seth MacFarlane), who is in total debt with no immediate relief, a young elephant named Meena (Tori Kelly), who needs to overcome stage-fright in order to pursue his dreams as a singer, a porcupine named Ash (Scarlett Johansson), who gets accepted while the other half of her duo/boyfriend Lance (Beck Bennett) does not, and a pig named Rosita (Reese Witherspoon), who is caught in the middle of a struggling marriage with her husband and twenty-five piglets as she tries to relive her years as a performer.A movie where animals sing once-popular radio hits feels like the ""cat video""-infested bowels of Youtube taken to the next level, so on that note, much like their film The Secret Life of Pets, Illumination has cracked the secret to getting people interested in their films on a purely conceptual (no matter how basic) level. But after insulting us with Minions and shortchanging us with Pets, the studio finally gets it right with Sing by giving us what we subconsciously expected to see, which was a bit of a story behind the characters. We'll come for the cuteness, but we'd also like to be given a reason to stay and a reason to connect to the film.Sing features an amiable cast of characters with familiar voices - McConaughey and MacFarlane are very good, for that matter - and infuses their stories with enough interest to make them transcend the tropes they could've fallen into it quite easily. For example, the stories of Meena, Rosita, and Ash are actually kind of sad, and give way to the wonderful idea of female empowerment based on breaking out of ""your place"" or your comfort zone and fully becoming your own, confident person. Common, absolutely, but screenwriter Jennings infuses a bit of disillusionment into their stories to give them an emotional layer that might even echo or resonate with parents, who thought they were taking their kids to see another cute and cuddly kid movie. Maybe they might even see something in the way the Johnny character feels, as he's constantly pressured by his father to be tough and to be a part of his gang rather than encouraging him to be his own person.Sing has moments where its lazy screen writing does prevail, such as the handful of montages we get that show a goofy pig dancing to Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance"" or kangaroos singing the Men Without Hats' ""Safety Dance."" They're moments of brief amusement until you realize how entirely vapid and distracting they really are. Thankfully, where Jennings could've stopped writing, he decided to keep going, and the result is a modestly successful animated film that at least makes an admirable attempt to give us more than the internet and other movies of the like already have.Voiced by: Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Taron Egerton, Scarlett Johansson, Tori Kelly, Beck Bennett, and Garth Jennings.

13,Hellmant,"I'm not a big fan of most animated kids' films, these days, but this is one of the better ones.",8,4 January 2017,"'SING': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new hit computer-animated comedy musical; about a bunch of anthropomorphic animals that enter a singing competition, hosted by a koala bear that's trying to save his theater. It was written and directed by Garth Jennings (who also helmed 2007's 'SON OF RAMBOW', and 2005's 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY'), and it was co- directed by Christophe Lourdelet (a veteran animator, and first time filmmaker). It stars the voice talents of Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlet Johansson, Taron Egerton, Tori Kelly, John C. Reilly, Nick Kroll, Jennifer Saunders and Jennings himself. The movie received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's a blockbuster at the Box Office. I enjoyed it quite a bit.The story is set in a world inhabited entirely by humanoid animals. Buster Moon (McConaughey) is a hard working koala; who owns a classic theater, which hasn't been doing well financially (in quite some time). Buster is extremely optimistic that he can save it though, if he puts on a singing contest. When the $1,000 prize money is accidentally advertised as $100,000, many animals are eager to audition. Buster is determined to press on, despite not having the reward money that's promised. Multiple talented misfits ambitiously pursue their dreams, by participating in the competition. I'm not a big fan of most animated kids' films, these days, but this is one of the better ones. It's entertaining, beautiful to look at, and it's pretty emotional, at times, and inspiring as well. The music is all catchy, and fun to listen to, and the voice cast all does a good job. The film is funny, without being too overly silly too. I really enjoyed it, and I think most kids will as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc",Sing
14,cherold,"Decent story, weak humor",6,24 April 2017,"I should begin by admitting I didn't see this in optimal conditions. I woke up after an airplane nap and it was half over. So I watched the second half, then watched the beginning. And the plane landed before I got quite to where I'd stopped watching.That being said, my overall impression was of a movie considerably less funny than other films from Illumination Entertainment like The Secret Life of Pets and Despicable Me. There is a rote quality to the humor.However, I will admit that I was rather taken by the last part of the film, which was basically a series of feel-good moments that pulled together the movie's various plot strands in a pleasant although predictable way.Had I seen the movie in order perhaps I would have given this a 7 - who knows?

15,Robert_duder,Topical and fun with boisterous personalities,8,14 April 2017,"2016 wasn't a great year for movies but animated films on the other hand... Sing looked great from the trailers and I'm amazed it took them so long to capture the ""singing contest"" idea considering television is full of them. But this is so much not about the competition. It's about music, and varied personalities and pulling together and working together despite differences. In the first half of the film I wasn't blown away. In fact, I mostly felt it was okay. The film actually hits it's high points in the latter part. You really get to some strong feelings and see the stories develop of all the various characters. The music is fun and fluffy pulled from some of the most popular pop songs right now. They drive the story and make sense to the scenes. Like any great animated feature nowadays, it has this amazing moral to the story about friendship and overcoming hardships to fulfill dreams. It is fun, silly, decently animated, and wonderfully voiced.The cast includes some very big stars. Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlett Johansson, John C. Reilly, and Taron Egerton (as one of my favourite characters Johnny.) Nick Kroll is also fantastic as Gunter. I don't know how many of them did their own singing or not but regardless they bring personality and style to their characters and the voices just work together so well regardless of where they recorded them from. Everyone is recognizable and yet you lose them in the character which is exactly what you would hope from an animated film like this.My daughter has had me watch this a few times now and I distinctly didn't care for it and then by the second and third viewings I liked it a lot more. It uses the typical songs but they work so well for the story and each main character has it's own little sub-story and then you have the focus on Moon and his theatre and the end just demonstrates the emphasis on friends and family and working together. It has laughs, it has emotion, it has silly moments, and there is nothing adult about it ultimately which I think is good because sometimes animated films can try to do adult undertone and it falls flat. Neither co-director Christophe Lourdelet, Garth Jennings have a ton of experience especially in this vein other than animation department but they clearly know how to strike a chord so to speak. It's fun, it's breezy and it hits the right notes (enough with the puns!) Best of all it grows on you meaning it will have a lasting effect. 8/10",Sing

17,ericstevenson,Certainly good enough,7,16 June 2018,"I think this movie at one point had the most viewed trailer in movie history. It's since been replaced by ""Avengers: Infinity War"". I was really impressed by that as this movie is based on a completely original idea, right? Well, the story's pretty basic with a koala holding a singing competition. A lot of stuff from the trailer is only in the first 20 minutes. My favorite character might be Mike the mouse.I couldn't recognize Seth Macfarlane's voice at all! I'm not going to spoil it, but the way his storyline is resolved is very satisfying. The animation is great and it's a really interesting world these characters live in. I admit that some of it is clichéd and the characters probably aren't the most original. I still rooted for most of them and it's pretty realistic for a movie about talking animals. I counted 64 songs in the credits! ***",Sing
18,lesleyharris30,"Simple Family Fun with a Stellar Soundtrack,",8,5 February 2017,"Sing is a great movie with a well developed plot and an outstanding voice cast. It is a simple, sweet film that the whole family can enjoy as we are taken in to a world of talking animals as they compete in a singing competition. There are countless fantastic covers performed by the animals throughout, a version of My Way by Frank Sinatra particularly stood out for me. There were far too many characters to follow, I think this could have been trimmed. There were obviously going to be ones that were more intriguing than the others and I feel like they should have limited it to the characters that really stood out. I found Meena to be a very boring character, I did not have much compassion for her, nor did she interest me in any way. The voice cast is outstanding in this movie. Matthew McConaughey shines as a polite koala, Reese Witherspoon is stellar in both speaking and singing parts as Rosita, Taron Egerton has great depth in Johnny, while Scarlett Johansson brings in a lot of energy as Ash. The highlight for me has to be Seth MacFarlane as Mike, this mouse suited his personality and the type of characters he is well use to playing in the likes of Family Guy perfectly. I found myself smiling whenever he came on screen, I loved his cocky, arrogant personality and his own song covers were terrific. It is a whole lot of fun that will leave you humming a variety of songs afterwards. While it is forgetful, Sing is a great ride and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. In order to save his theatre, Buster Moon puts on a singing competition in which anyone in the city can compete.",Sing
19,Irishchatter,good CGI animation musical!,8,31 December 2016,"So as 2016 ends, I decided to give this a watch on Putlocker because well, it's been advertised a lot and of course, it has a lot of well known stars! I was even stoked to have realized Seth McFarlane was on this and omg, his voice just melts you, it is just so sexy! The frank Sinatra look on his mouse character, really suits his part! You don't get to see enough of McFarlane singing in animation especially when he's on Family Guy! I don't have a particular favourite singing animal on this but all were very good. I definitely would recommend all ages should take a look at this!",Sing
20,ironhorse_iv,Sing is not worth singing praise about. It was just alright. Mediocre.,7,17 January 2017,"Besides Disney & Pixar, Illumination Entertainment has been on something of an animation roll as of late, ever since 2010's 'Despicable Me'. Despite, most of their films, not being hits with critics, their movies continue to make mad cash. Sadly, their newest movie 'Sing' is one of their weakest. Directed & written by Garth Jennings and co-directed by Christophe Lourdelet, the film tells the story of a group of anthropomorphic animals such under-appreciated pig mama Rosita (Voiced by Reese Witherspoon); the gentle son of a gorilla crime boss, Johnny (Voiced by Taron Egerton), punk-rocker porcupine Ash (Voiced by Scarlett Johansson), arrogant mouse street performer, Mike (Voiced by Seth MacFarlane) and shy elephant, teenager Meena (Voiced by Tori Kelly), who has the pipes but not the confidence, all entering a singing competition, hosted by an ambitious theater-owning koala Buster Moon (Voiced by Matthew McConaughey), who needs a hit show to save his beloved theater from foreclosure. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the way, they introduce all these characters in the beginning of the film, was very awkward. The quick fast jump transitions was just too much. It seem, early second that it was moving, without giving enough time to establish, who they truly are. I really didn't like it. The film pacing was all over the place. Another problem with this movie is how many songs, were feature in this film. 80 songs ranging from the 1940s to 2010's is way too much for a jukebox musical. Because of this, the film's music felt more like an endless amount of swiping through Pandora than a great use of storytelling device. Plus, of the many, many pop songs used in this family film's soundtrack, there are a few that are rather explicitly not kid-friendly, including ""Butterfly"" by Crazy Town, which is subtly, about cunnilingus, and ""Anaconda"" by Nicki Minaj, which is explicitly about having intercourse. So that was weird. Honestly, the movie could had work better, if they allow a few songs to sink in, throughout the film. Instead, it felt more like white noise, for most of the 110 minute film, until the final act. Despite that, I do like the last bit of the movie, where the songs do come to characterization the revealing thoughts and feelings of a given character. For example, 'Shake it off' by singer, Taylor Swift, show Rosita's story arc, as she wants to prove to her family what a talented singer she is. Another is ""I'm Still Standing"" from music artist, Elton John is about someone who was under a negative influence, and who managed to break out of it and stand strong without it. A perfect fit to Johnny's relationship with his father. The same, can be, with 'Set it All Free' by songwriter, David Bassett, 'Don't You worry about a thing' by Stevie Wonder and 'My Way' by singer, Paul Anka. It reflects about their live, and having no regrets on how they lived it. All amazing performances from all the voice actors, even if the Seth MacFarlane one seem the most generic in how much, he sings it, outside from this film. Still, if I had to cut one, it would be, his, since it didn't seem like his Mike character had a personality arch to be nicer. He is a rat in the beginning, and still, a rodent in the end. All he manage to do, is waste screen time. However, I can praise the other actors in the roles, they were given. Each one of them, made it, their own, despite some of their cartoon animal counterpart having some characteristic stereotypes that can be view as racism like having black gorillas as violent thugs or sexism, like one character being ignored by her husband until dressing up in a promiscuous cat suit, trigger him to like her. In my opinion, it wasn't too jarring as it was in Disney version of talking animal kingdom, 2016's 'Zootopia' with its gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity thoughts of prejudices and discrimination. While, 'Zootopia' is by far, the better film, since it was thought-provoking and had better jokes. I thought 'Sing' did have some moments that really pull you in. The movie did had some humor that was a bit interesting. Great use of foreshadowing, and like I said before, the characters backstory is what makes this movie and their drive to win the money, unique. Yet, I do have to say, I hate how the film abandoned the competition part, toward the third act. It lesser the pressures of them, trying to achieve their goals. I would love to see, some of them, fail at it and one had success, like any other competition show. Yes, it would had be, risky, but it would be more like it is in life and would show that not everybody can have success. In my opinion, the ending was a little too child-friendly. After all, in true-life, not everything can be patch up with music. If anything, solo success destroy family units, not bring them, closer to together. Overall: Due to a few missteps, 'Sing' is not worth the price of admission. Still, it worth checking out as a rental. It's a fun movie, but it falls short of being great.",Sing
21,Reno-Rangan,Music is the key!,8,24 April 2017,"It was one of the most watched trailer by me. Yeah, I liked the trailer and teaser, those beautiful songs and characters made me watch this film. Maybe because of that, I thought the trailers looked much better. I enjoyed the film, it had depth in characters than what I saw in the promotional videos. Though it is a simple story, and that worked so well.Its neither Disney or Pixer, but awesome. The good thing is the others as well getting there with par. It got nominated for the Golden Globe, but missed out the Oscars. A film for all ages. The musical is very common in animation, especially from Disney. This was a little different, a music genre. And the characters are the very special to this film to clinch the success.It could have been easily added to 'Zootopia' universe, since the two films are from different productions, that idea was ruled out. The selection of voice-over cast was excellent, particularly in the singing perspective. Recently Dwayne Johnson sang one for 'Moana'. I know the real life actors brought in for the marketing purpose, but anyway they all were so good.I liked a couple of tracks, but most of them are not original. Even the theme song from 'Zootopia' by Shakira had a small part in it. So this film is surely suggestible for anyone to try at any time in any mood. It only cheers, definitely worth spending time for it. Now bring it on a sequel. As per the latest news, they have announced which is going to hit the screen in 2020. That looks too long, I need it even before that. Meanwhile, you guys enjoy it if you'ven't watched it yet.8/10",Sing

Sing is quite a different animation film since the basic is about singing. Initially did not expect this film to be great, funny or interesting but upon viewing, there was something different in both style and originality with this film.What makes this film work is not only the singing (there are a blend of older songs and newer ones of different genres) but the different type of characters, and how each main animal character is given a backstory and subplot.For a family/children film it works- the comedy is juvenile, the visuals are nice to look at and it sends a positive message.

25,Ed-Shullivan,A simple story with a cast of animal characters that come to life and warm our hearts,8,3 February 2017,"This date night was going to be an unexpected twofer. First on our list we saw La La Land and just loved it so we stuck to the musical genre and next on our list was the lighter side of comedy with the animation feature Sing. Neither Mrs. Shullivan or I are fans of 3-D films but this was the only format being offered at 10:00 PM so we went for it. It took me about 15 minutes to adjust to the 3D format even though I have tried it a few times before, and my opinion has not changed. In my opinion the 3D format does not add any value to a film and by the sparse theater crowd I assume most are in agreement with me. Producers have attempted the 3D format for more than 60 years now with little success and I will be glad when the format is abandoned and the editors rely on content quality and not CGI.The film Sing is great and it will appeal to a vast crowd from the age of 3 to 103. After I had adjusted to the 3D format and we got to know the animal characters and the story line I for one just forgot that it was an animated feature and I sat back and watched the film progress in a very positive light. There are some big name stars lending their voices and I am sure they are proud of their finished product. Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) owns a theater for live performances that lately he has been unable to sustain paying his debts so the bank is after him to pay up or the bank will repossess Buster's dream theater. Buster's late father had worked extremely hard in his car wash across the street from the theater to fulfill Buster's dream to open the theater and Buster needed to pull off the biggest hit of his life if he were to keep his dream theater out of the bankers grasp. Each of the animal characters has a story to tell. Each of the animal characters also has a great voice and a personal life that the winning prize money if they were to win the sing off would take care of. The plot is simple so the children should be able to follow along relatively easy, all the animated animal characters were adorable. There are also some bad guys besides the bankers who want their hands on the prize money, and this just adds more humor and excitement to this cute little animated feature.The songs were great, the story line very heartwarming, and the animated characters were all cute and cuddly. Mrs. Shullivan and I ended our date night on a high note for this twofer evening. I give the film an 8 out of 10 rating, taking two points off for making me watch the film in 3D which did nothing to enhance this viewers experience. If you like this review I also wrote one on the first film we saw tonight which was La La Land.",Sing
26,matthewssilverhammer,"It's Bad, But At Least There Are No Minions In Sight",3,30 December 2016,"2016 has been a porcupine quill in the eye, so it feels appropriate that Sing, a decided disappointment, is the last movie I review this year. Illumination (Minions, Despicable Me) might be the most mediocre studio around; each of their movies have such potential, yet refuse to reach past clichéd stories, characters, and humor. Sing is no different, leaning on montages to fix problems, stilted familiarity to force emotion, and a long-expired message about kids being themselves. Gimme a break. It starts great, introducing us to each of the singing-animal characters with a flying shot, letting us know how they're music affects and is affected by the life around them. Unfortunately from there, each high note the movie hits is undercut by a sour one. The lack of one clear protagonist gives it some stakes, but they do little with them except to bombard us with ""The Voice"" style sob stories. The song performances definitely have their moments, but they also have their annoyances (Crazy Town's ""Butterfly""; rabbits singing ""Anaconda""; yet ANOTHER cover of ""Hallelujah""). The one decent character, a soulful gorilla named Johnny, is even ruined by a dangerously cynical parenting storyline. Worst of all, the humor fails. In my theater, the only joke that garnered real guffaws was a shoddy gag about nervous farting. The characters being animals serves no purpose but to cheaply engage children, unlike the far superior Zootopia from earlier this year, which used its non-human characters to great comedic and thematic effect. I guess if you found the trailers for Sing hilarious, emotionally fulfilling and coherently plotted, then you may enjoy this. Otherwise, don't buy a ticket for this show.",Sing
27,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A crowd-pleaser, ""Sing"" has enough appeal despite its simplicity",7,2 July 2017,"Singing competitions have made for great television entertainment for 15 years, so it seems only natural that some animation company would design a family film around that central conceit and fill it with singing animals. That pretty much sums up Illumination Entertainment's ""Sing,"" which finds enough moments and characters that amuse and charm to keep it from even coming close to getting booed off stage.Simply, koala Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) is a passionate but unsuccessful theater showman whose last great idea to keep his theater from being repossessed is to put on a singing competition, which draws in a multitude of animals with big dreams and difficult lives/personal obstacles to overcome including a young gorilla (Taron Egerton) with a criminal father, a stay-at-home pig mom of 25 (Reese Witherspoon) and a shy elephant with a diva voice (Tori Kelly) to name a few. To keep things interesting, Moon's elderly lizard assistant, Miss Crawley (Garth Jennings, the writer and director), accidentally adds some zeroes to the prize money, which puts Moon over his head.Each and every character has a roller coaster story arc that pushes them to find out how badly they want to follow their dreams. The examples are mostly archetypal and predictable, but they work. There's something deeply human about their pursuit of singing, the same ""it"" factor that probably keeps TV reality competitions going and connecting with audiences all over the world.The laughs aren't as big or consistent as other Illumination films, but ""Sing"" has its moments. The best moment of levity comes unexpectedly when Moon has hit his ""rock bottom"" and tries to raise funds by organizing a car wash. In general, there are little elements in the characterization, small details really, that give the film its charm. They help warm you up to a film that's otherwise not about much of anything in terms of story. Compared to a film like Disney's ""Zootopia,"" in which there was a thoughtful reason for all the characters to be animals living in an animal city, ""Sing"" was assembled this way purely for commercial appeal. Still, it does enough right to combat its superficial exterior, even if it can't reach the bar set by so many other more thoughtful, cleverer and emotional animated family films. It's safer, but ultimately better than the films that aim to reach that bar and fall short, namely Illumination's other 2016 movie, ""The Secret Life of Pets."" It's also a little long, but it doesn't require your full attention to be appreciated.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Sing

Reilly-The Lobster, Guardians of the Galaxy; Reese Witherspoon-Hot Pursuit, Mud; Scarlett Johansson-The Avengers movies, We Bought a Zoo and Tori Kelly-in her first movie, she was a singer on American Idol & The Voice.This is an animated movie that has a world full of talking animals, instead of humans-think Zootopia. The story is kind of like an animalized version of American Idol-perhaps Animal Idol? Matthew voices a koala bear that owns a rundown theater and he is behind on his bills. He comes up with an idea of a singing competition to save the theater. More bodies in the theater means more money in his pockets. John is a llama that is Matthew's best friend. Reese as a pig, Scarlett as a porcupine and Tori as an elephant are just some of the contestants competing and the music covers over 85 songs from the 1940's to the present day-From Frank Sinatra to the Beatles to Beyonce'. There is even some music of George Michael & David Bowie included. I really enjoyed the music and the comedic parts were great, too. There is a line that Matthew says that actually might be considered the main theme of the movie: 'When you hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up!' And boy, does he hit rock bottom. This is one the whole family can enjoy. It's rated ""PG"" for some rude humor and mild peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Sing

32,Amari-Sali,"While Sing may not be a classic in the making, it still makes for a good way to spend almost 2 hours.",7,26 November 2016,"Review (with Spoilers) StorylineSince he was a kid Buster Moon has loved the theater. Not in terms of desiring to be a performer but more so he wanted to own one, create production, and he eventually got to do that. Problem is, he sucks at it. However, undeterred, he decides to have a singing competition. Not as a Muppet style last resort to gain funds, but as a business as usual type of thing. Unfortunately, though, his assistant Ms. Crawly makes posters not offering $1,000 but $100,000. Which brings the talent, but also brings a swath of issues for two of them really need that money.HighlightsSong ChoiceThere is a little something for everyone here. Naturally, pop hits dominate, but for those who like something old school Mike mostly does Jazz with his saxophone or Rat Pack era songs like ""My Way."" Also, there is scattered rock or pop/rock music here and there. The most notable song choice would be Johnny singing ""I'm Still Standing"" by Elton John.Meena and JohnnyMeena and Johnny are really the only two characters who are given real emotional grounding so their highs and lows matter to you. Meena seems to not have a father and is being raised by her mother's family, she is shy to the point of anxiety attacks and seems to be the only introvert in an extroverted family. One which fully supports her singing, but with her grandfather being so aggressive about her pursuing her talent, you can see he only makes things worse.Then with Johnny, he is another case of a missing parent. In his case, it is his mom but with his dad around, and his dad's criminal gang being sort of parental units, you see he is making it. Problem is, his dad has a vision and plans for Johnny which he doesn't necessarily want. So when he goes against the grain, as seen in the trailer, and gets disowned, it leaves him with no one really. His father's friends came with his dad and without him, we watch a heartbroken Johnny try to just figure out what life can be like without his dad.CriticismToo Many Characters & Not Enough DevelopmentIn order to get funding, the production companies seemed to have gotten as many name recognizable talent they could, and from there they wrote enough of a story to keep the big names happy. Not the type of story which could give depth to each character, but with it being a kid's movie, you can assume the general consensus was there is no need to get that deep. Hence why we don't explore the stress Rosita has from taking care of 25 piglets nor dealing with a unfulfilling marriage. Hence why Buster, despite being the lead, never becomes someone who can get a real emotional response out of you. For never-mind, he is a bit of a selfish butt-head for ripping off his stage hands and then taking advantage of Meena for free labor, but the one thing which could redeem him is that he is trying to make his dad's hard work pay off. The problem is with this, it more told to us than shown. Even then, it isn't like we see his dad struggle or even Buster struggle alongside him. Heck, even the one person who could have given his story some oomph, Ms. Crawley, she is purely a comedic relief. There is no development of their relationship so we can understand why she has stuck with him nor were we given an understanding why he hired her and what she means to him. I mean, she doesn't even act as a source to make Buster's dad more than just a picture trotted around to remind us how bad Buster feels about possibly losing the theater.Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)Did I cry a little due to Meena and Johnny? Absolutely I did. However, I can't say if I didn't get to see this for free, at a screening, that I would actually pay for this. Did it have potential? Yes, it did. However, it seems like another case of having an animated movie, bloated with Hollywood stars, which is more about a money grab than creating something which has longevity.",Sing

34,rgkarim,"Sing it Loud, Cute and Proud",7,21 December 2016,"Tis the season for movies, and this week there are plenty of films for all to see. My first review this week is the latest animation film geared toward the younger audience group. Assuming you've seen the title of my review, you know I'm talking about Sing, Illumination Studios' latest production. As an answer to Disney's Zootopia, Sing is trying to take the anthropomorphic animal story and a little twist to bait you in. But was that twist enough, or is it another generic animation. Please read on to hear my opinions on the latest blockbuster.LIKES:  Very Fun  Decent song and dance numbers  Character development  Touching momentsThe thing you always hope for in a kid's movie is a fun adventure for the audience (both adults and kids). Sing does its job of providing laughs and energy, having a variety of jokes that will tickle your funny bone from time to time. Little kids will find the slapstick antics of characters farting, tripping on stage, or crashing into some sort of scenery. Adults on the other hand will embrace the funny voices, well timed delivery, and popular culture references. Whatever your style of humor, Sing will surely entertain most audience members. For a movie titled Sing, you hope for a little singing and dancing, right? Good news, there is some of that in this movie. Sing's song and dance numbers keep with the cute theme of the movie, filled with explosive colors and energy. The singing isokay in the film, but the music director picked a wide variety of tracks (from a multitude of genres) in hopes of roping all ages into the film. Their twists on some of the classics is certainly enjoyable, though doesn't quite come together like the originals. Dance numbers are again cute, but are primarily comedic relief than a true wow factor you might have expected. My main like of Sing though, is the emotional moments the directors packed into the film. The cast of aspiring singers each have their own problems (shocking right) and our heroes must face them semi-head on throughout the 90-minute run time. While the outcomes are certainly predictable, the dialogue, music, and animation are more than enough to maximize the emotions of the moment. I found my heart strings being tugged at a few of the story arcs, but enjoyed the attempt at teaching the audience some important lessons. Nevertheless, there is some simplistic character development to help around out the adventure. DISLIKES:  Different theme than presented  Many numbers were shortsighted  Dropped potential characters  Story, while touching, was kind of blandWhen I saw the trailers for Sing, I was expecting American Idol meets Zootopia. To an extent, we do get that, but it's only in the auditions part of the movie. You've seen most of the audition numbers in the trailer, and the studio didn't expand much past this. As a result, the music numbers I would hope blow me away were reduced to simplistic quips that while comical and cute, weren't that impressive. Surprisingly they are missing some genres like country, rap, and others that some audience members might have been hoping for. I guess the soundtrack will have to make up for the short bytes. In addition, the contest aspect really wasn't pursued, as the story takes a different approach to make it a completely different movie than you were expecting.This approach, as well as the short numbers, also reduced the screen time of some of the other animals you might have been hoping for. So, all those animals you see auditioning, don't get too attached, because chances are they aren't going to stick around long enough for the adventure. In addition, some of the supporting characters have limited roles, their story lines hastily wrapped up and lost in the musical numbers. And the result of all this is again an entertaining story, but one that is kind of bland and lacking suspense. The incomplete use of characters and the lack of the contest aspect took away the suspense of rooting for your favorite animal, diluting this film's potential to really drive the emotions home. The VERDICT:If you haven't guessed from my review, this film is fun, fun, fun. It has energetic song and dance numbers, some cute wholesome comedy, and yes some predictable emotional moments that we all like to see this time of year. However, the decisions to not pursue the contest, limit the engagement of the other characters, and the lack of hard-hitting numbers took away from the movie for me. Therefore, this reviewer recommends, and predicts, this film will be best enjoyed by families with little ones (who will most likely flood the theaters to see it). However, this reviewer recommends holding out to see this one at home instead of in the movie theater. Scores: Animation/Comedy/Drama: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Sing
35,invisibleunicornninja,A soulless product for the masses.,3,27 March 2018,"Plot - Everything is cliche and predictable. There is no creativity or originality here. There are lots of plotholes, and there is no message. This movie is extremely boring and designed to appeal to pretty much every demographic. There are several interesting ideas hidden in this movie, but they're just mixed together to create this garbage. The fact that the characters are animals doesn't contribute anything to the plot. Characters - None of the characters are original or interesting in any way. Animation - The animation is lazy, boring, and full of continuity errors. Humor - This movie has a lot to work with. There are lots of interesting ideas that could've been implemented here. There are many cheap jokes that could've been made. Surprisingly enough, this movie never (except for maybe 2 sight gags) makes a joke relating to the different species and the fact that they're animals. There isn't even anything to say about this movie because there is nothing here. This is a product designed purely to make money. There was no creativity put into this thing. The people who made this movie didn't have a story to tell - they just wanted to make money. Unfortunately the general public is stupid and they just ate up this unoriginal drivel. If you want to watch an interesting and creative animated childrens' movie where the main characters are animals, then go watch Zootopia (which this movie was banking on the popularity of). Its not the greatest movie ever, but its fun and original.",Sing
36,bkrauser-81-311064,Light and Entertaining Family Fun,7,23 December 2016,"Sing is one of those incredibly obvious ideas, that it's a wonder no one had thought to do it before. By taking the mold of a ""let's-put-on-a-show"" style revue, Sing aptly intermingles two of the most widespread popular culture phenomena cooked up over the last quarter-century: singing competitions and talking furry animals. The whole thing pretty much writes itself. Yet just because the film lives comfortably amid expected clichés, and risks very little in being upbeat, doesn't mean it's any less vibrant, sincere and fun.That sincerity is primarily worn on the sleeve of one Buster Moon (McConaughey), a theater owner whose last few shows have failed to generate any excitement. In a last ditch effort to save his theater from foreclosure, Moon banks everything on a singing competition with a grand prize of $1,000. Due to a printing mishap, a couple of zeros are added on to the prize, peaking the attention of every struggling and wannabe vocal star within city limits. Such talents include an under-appreciated housewife of 25 piglets (Witherspoon), a teenage porcupine (Johansson), an ape whose father would rather see his son follow his footsteps (Egerton), an egotistical crooner with a propensity for Rat Pack music (McFarlane) and an elephant with bad stage fright (Kelly).Much of the movie juggles between the stories of its supporting cast, all of which we only get cliff notes of their foibles. At times it can be a bit jarring; like listening to the radio while someone else if flipping through your favorite channels. Yet when the film finally settles into its groove, the diversity of the cast, and how well they gel together, goes a pretty long way. We get to see them struggle through rehearsal and balance their personal lives with the limelight. Not all of them get along, and as with any stage show, things don't always go according to plan, forcing them to test their metal. At the center of it all is Moon, the stubborn, foolhardy Koala whose dreams are barely held together by a defiant can-do attitude.It all pretty much unfolds as you would expect. The only real surprises to be had don't come up within the story but rather the audience guessing which character will be flipping the switches most often on the plot mechanics. Since that burden is so evenly divided among the cast, we feel like we're spending more valuable time with them and get a sense of satisfaction when our favorite character's circuit is finally closed.People will no doubt compare Sing to Zootopia (2016) due to their superficial similarities. I would think a more apt comparison would be Trolls (2016) which, like Sing tried to drown out unpleasantness with unfettered chirpiness. Yet here there's a little something for everyone. Who you are, and in some cases what you listen to, basically determines which character/s you will most easily identify with. Permeating through all the stories is just enough adversity for characters to understand the stakes. Thus the comforting cheerfulness feels not just natural but earned.Call it a feeling of magnanimity before the Holiday season but in my humble opinion Sing is just what the doctor ordered. It's a fun, breezy, goofy little jukebox musical that is pretty much the movie equivalent of comfort food. It may not leave you with a lasting smile but it will give you a smile nonetheless.",Sing
37,valadas,Beautiful,8,16 December 2016,"A movie whose characters are all animals but in anthropomorphic shape and with human feelings and reactions. Their number is extremely varied: koalas (the chief character is one), elephants, gorillas, dogs, giraffes, etc. and even squids. Their facial expressions are extremely human. And the urban atmosphere is totally human: the buildings, the streets, the cars and the traffic. The story is rather interesting. The main character, a human koala, organizes a singing competition to try to restore the old prestige of his beautiful theater. This meets with several problems including a flood that destroys the theater building meanwhile.

39,Abdulxoxo,Enjoyable and fun animation,7,21 February 2021,"The world of 'Sing' is populated entirely by animals, although it's got to be said that it's nowhere near as developed as the world from 'Zootopia' which immediately puts it one step behind in comparison. Nonetheless, it's bright and colourful with a real upbeat spirit to it. Each of the main characters has their own storylines which eventually interweave and crossover into each other. Some are more interesting than others, but they all have their own humour which was enjoyable.The plot itself is fairly basic and does rely heavily on the soundtrack to entertain. The movie featured around 65 songs, which must have been an absolute nightmare to get the rights for. Clearly getting these songs was of huge importance because they spent 15% of the total budget on acquiring the rights to use all those songs. It was totally worth it however as for most of the movie you'll find yourself grooving along or silently mouthing along with the words.If one quarter of the budget went on the music, I imagine a large chuck of the rest went on hiring the incredible voice cast which included: Reece Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlett Johansson, Taron Egerton, John C. Reilly, Tori Kelly, Jennifer Hudson and more. Some of them could sing, but others surprisingly good. There were some incredible performances.
Overall, the movie is amazing, with fantastic animation, great voice acting performances that capture the essence of the characters, good musical elements, and a story with emotional elements alongside many fun elements that are sure to keep most viewers smiling/laughing from time to time.",Sing
40,Troy_Campbell,"Lacks depth, but offers plenty of fun.",7,28 December 2016,"The success of the Despicable Me series has put Illumination Entertainment well and truly on the map in the world of animated films, but unlike their rivals Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks, they've yet to produce any masterpieces. And whilst Sing is tremendously fun, a masterpiece it is not. With a concept based on one of the more tedious fads of the new millennium — a singing competition à la Idol and The Voice, etc — the story feels ten years too late, although the high-level of energy permeating throughout barely gives you the chance to care. The melodies performed on screen are surprisingly eclectic, featuring hits from a range of artists such as Elton John, Katy Perry and Frank Sinatra, with some pulled off fabulously (Elton John's ""I'm Still Standing"") and some not so much (Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off""). Much like the soundtrack the comedy on offer has a bit to suit everyone's tastes, from fart gags and pratfalls to montage parodies and subtle one-liners. Which jokes are for the kids and which ones are for the parents I'll let you decide. There are no major weak links in the diverse, albeit stereotypical cast, however Taron Egerton's son-of-a-crook gorilla Johnny and Nick Kroll's hilariously uninhibited pig Gunter are easily the most memorable. Sing is an in-the-moment treat with some laugh out loud gags and seriously good, umm, singing.",Sing
41,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Despite the great songs it has, the movie itself is nothing to write home about.",3,5 November 2018,"Sing is Universal Pictures'/Illumination Entertainment's attempt at emulating Disney's many preceding animated musicals: and it doesn't really work. The stories are haphazardly told and the animation is subpar for 2016 standards. It has a good cast, don't get me wrong, but they're stuck in such an ordinary film it's not funny. They're playing anthropomorphic animals for NO reason at all; it's just so the kids can laugh and root for them in a superficial way. The characters are all the same underdog trying to overcome their shortcomings, the character models look derivative of Dr. Seuss characters from The Lorax and it's full of characters trying to be Despicable Me 'Minions' fodder. This whole film is very rinse and repeat-y. It gets incredibly boring fast because of this. And a lot of the film's problems lie in its unfocused story and and boring character designs.It seems that Illumination Entertainment wants to CONSTANTLY recycle the same damn animation aesthetic over and over again as long as it's cost-effective: and Sing doesn't realize that it's to the movie's detriment. Sure some of the characters look good for newspaper caricatures but that's it; when they're living-breathing animated beings in a movie they're pretty damn lifeless because of the empty mentality the animators had when creating these characters. Sure the story has resolutions just like any movie should, but the ones found here are so redundant and cliche that I'm surprised this film was welcomed by audiences everywhere. People should (and often DO) demand a lot more from American animations in cinema.Sing gets 1.5/5 stars.",Sing

44,RforFilm,"When Sing wants to be a musical, it's a crowd pleaser. Too bad parts of the story are rushed",6,27 December 2016,"If there's one thing that animation has always done well in is bringing worlds of anthropomorphic animals to life. What this means is that while the inhabitants of the world are animals, they will act and live like people. Disney is probably the best example as they have created Robin Hood, Chicken Little, and most recently, the acclaimed Zootopia. All of these movies have no humans and that all of their characters are animals with different personalities. What animation can also do with this concept is to let the characters take on their animal-like traits. That is what I enjoyed about Zootopia; it took those animal instincts and created a story about prejudice. I guess that at the same time, Illumination Entertainment had their own anthropomorphic animal movie in the works. Illumination has had some big hits like Despicable Me, The Minions, and Dr. Seuss' The Lorax. While the movies are fine, their marketing is very aggressive and tends to do well at the box office. In the case of Sing, that too was marketed like crazy with the hopes that families would come out and see it for the holidays. Despite going up against Rogue One, perhaps Sing does have some voice. Theater owner koala Buster Moon (played by Matthew McConaughey) has been obsessed with the performing arts ever since his father took him to a show there. He may be the owner of his cherished theater, but it is also falling on hard times where he's only produced flop after flop. The place is also in need of major repair. As a last effort, Buster plans for a singing competition with a cash prize for the winner. He sets the prize for a $1000, but his senile assistant accidentally makes it $100,000. Before the advertisements can be checked, the word is spread and nearly the entire town shows up to audition. After a lengthy scene of various songs sung, Buster makes his picks. First is pig Rosita (played by Reese Witherspoon) is a mother of twenty-five and is neglected by her husband. Next is mouse Mike (played by Seth MacFarlane) who is arrogant and has gambling issues. Then we have punk rocker porcupine Ash (played by Scarlett Johansson) who left her boyfriend when she caught him cheating. Then we have gorilla Johnny (played by Taron Egerton) who is the son of a mobster. Finally, we have elephant Meena (played by Tori Kelly) who has a great voice, but has severe stage fright.I'll say that right away, this is a large jukebox musical with songs of several genres from the forties till now. You'd think that songs from Billie Holiday to Lady Ga Ga would seem odd to set to a musical, but the story of Sing manages to put them in the right spot. Without spoiling it, I'll say the that final show is a lot of fun and is a great finale. It took advantage of it's talented cast and brought out their strongest moments as singers. It sounds like a great movie right? Wellwhen it's not a musical, it seems to loose steam when the singing stops. The character that gets the most focus is Buster, who has a genuinely touching arc. Seth MacFarlane and Taron Egerton's characters are fun to sit through, but the others like Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, nor Tori Kelly are that interesting. Their singing is still good, but their story elements wither feel rushed or don't get enough time. Perhaps if one was cut, things might have flowed better. This is one movie I would have liked to see an extended edition of.I'll give this six koalas out of ten. I'd say that while kids will probably get a lot out of the movie, grownups may end up liking the soundtrack a bit more. Perhaps you too will sing along. So consider your musical taste and see if this is palatable.",Sing

(Well, maybe not official official, but it might as well be. And, by animal, I'm referring to all non-humans appearing in 2016 movies.) Going into the last week of 2016, four of the year's top 5 movies in terms of worldwide box office receipts either starred or were completely inhabited by creatures other than homo sapiens. But the trend goes well beyond ""Finding Dory"", ""Zootopia"", ""The Secret Life of Pets"", and ""The Jungle Book"". Let's not forget ""Kung Fu Panda 3"", ""Ice Age: Collision Course"", ""Monster Hunt"", ""The Legend of Tarzan"", ""The Angry Birds Movie"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows"", ""The Monkey King 2"", ""Storks"", ""Pete's Dragon"", ""Shin Godzilla"", ""The Wild Life"", ""Keanu"", ""Nine Lives"", ""Norm of the North"" and even 100% live action movies like the surreal Danish import ""Men & Chicken"" and the wonderful documentary ""The Eagle Huntress"". Filmmakers even evoked animal imagery in the titles of many of their movies that had nothing (or almost nothing) to do with animals (such as ""War Dogs"", ""Eddie the Eagle"", ""The Lobster"", ""Nocturnal Animals"" and ""Lion""). Yes, 2016 was a banner year for our furry, scaly and feathered friends on the big screen. Then, right at the end of the year comes one more addition to the list (and another animated movie featuring a world of anthropomorphic animals): ""Sing"" (PG, 1:48).Buster Moon (the voice of Matthew McConaughey) wants what any city-dwelling koala bear wants – to run a musical theater! He's wanted it since he saw his first live performance at the age of six. Buster's koala dad slaved away at a car wash for years until he made enough money for Buster to realize his dream. Buster bought the theater that he first visited with his father and has run it into the ground. The shows that he stages keep losing money, he can't afford to pay the help and the bank is threatening to repossess the theater. But Buster has always been a dreamer and he's no quitter. His latest idea is to stage a singing competition with open auditions. His best friend, a sheep named Eddie (John C. Reilly), thinks it's a terrible idea and encourages him to consider selling the theater, but Buster is undeterred.Buster has his loyal, elderly and scatter-brained one-eyed iguana of an assistant, Miss Crawley (voiced by Garth Jennings who also wrote and directed the film) to print out fliers advertising a prize that he really can't afford to offer and animals from all over the city line up to audition. The story follows several different aspiring animal singers as they pursue their dreams, but focuses a little more on a frazzled homemaker with a great voice. Rosita (Reese Witherspoon) is a pig who is burdened with a brood of 25 piglets and a self-absorbed workaholic husband (Nick Offerman). What's more, for the show Buster pairs her with a fat German pig named Gunter (Nick Kroll) whose larger-than-life personality is the complete opposite of the reserved Rosita's demeanor – and Gunter insists that she dance in their performance.The contestants whom Buster selects are all talented singers, but, like Rosita, each of them has personal issues that may prevent them from even making it through the rehearsal process. Johnny (Taron Egerton) is a cockney-accented gorilla who has kept his love of singing secret from his dad (Peter Serafinowicz), a criminal who has been getting Johnny involved in his gang – AND Buster wants Johnny to learn to play the piano in time for the show! Ash is a teenage porcupine who is cast in the show without her boyfriend (Beck Bennett), with whom she auditioned – and then she is asked to sing songs that she feels are too cheesy for her punk-rock sensibilities and wants to try writing her own music. Mike (Seth McFarlane) is a mouse who croons like Frank Sinatra and has an ego bigger than any member of the human Rat Pack which gets him into trouble with some big, bad, card-playing bears. And then there's Meena (Tori Kelly), an elephant with a gorgeous voice, but paralyzing stage fright. As each of these dreamers tries to work through his or her individual challenges, Buster works desperately to bring his last-chance show together and hold his theater together financially, emotionally and even physically.""Sing"" is a lot of fun, but has some flaws which may drive adult Movie Fans to distraction. The characters are full of personality, the soundtrack is full of great songs (bits of over 80 of them from the 1940s to the 2010s, including a couple original compositions) and the film is full of vibrant and detailed animation. On the other hand, some of the plot points are more unrealistic than I can deal with (even in an animated musical comedy) and the majority of the main characters don't seem to deserve the chance to reach their goals. Since kids make up such a large portion of the audience for an animated feature film like this one, knowing that several of the characters seem like they're being rewarded for bad behavior may give some parents pause. Besides all of that, the story is formulaic and the plot feels contrived but the film does contain positive messages about working hard for your dreams, overcoming obstacles sometimes being its own reward and people (or, in this case, animals) working together and appreciating each other, in spite of their differences and flaws. Feeling that this film is a mixed bag, I can't quite bring myself to sing the praises of ""Sing"", but it has enough going for it to earn a mild recommendation. ""B""",Sing
49,MihaiSorinToma,A good animated musical,8,8 September 2017,"In a city inhabited by animals, an almost broke koala which owns a theatre comes up with a brilliant idea to save his business. He organizes a song contest in which anyone could participate, promising by mistake a huge prize for the winner. Each of the selected animals has problems of its own, but they're determined to win, no matter the consequences. Meanwhile, the koala struggles to find a way of sponsoring his show which seems doomed due to lack of funds.It's an interesting animated musical which came up with an original idea, of a song contest, and tries to make the most out of it. It manages to keep the viewer entertained most of the time, making him laugh or even sad, while caressing his ears with some very good music. Unfortunately, it's one of those movies which doesn't take itself very serious, thus it's prone to errors. It tends to exaggerate with the funny part, while almost every serious moment is treated with superficiality, almost making a laugh out of it. I know it is a comedy and it is supposed to make you laugh, but trying too hard to do it often results in the opposite direction.Overall, it's enjoyable and a good movie due to the musical part, but not something wow, having nothing that could have made it greater.

61,Magow-Intermean,Sing Review,10,23 March 2019,"Failed impresario Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) has a brainwave: to revive the fortunes of his ailing theatre with a singing competition; one that attracts a motley crew of animal entrants.
Garth Jennings' last movie was the heart-warming and imaginative Son Of Rambow, a small but perfectly formed personal film that served both as an antidote to his first, the fun but flawed adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, and a calling card for what he could do with gentler material. We waited with bated breath to see what he'd do next. And waited. And waited.Finally, a decade on, he's made his next move, and in a guise nobody could have expected. The path between animated films and live action has been well-trodden in recent years, but Jennings has become one of the few directors to cross in the opposite direction, rocking up at Chris Meledandri's Illumination Studios.
Sing is a full-blown musical. But you may not be prepared for just how full-blown it is.
Illumination's output over the years may have been wildly successful, but from a creative point of view their work has been middle of the road, bland and lacking in true inspiration. While Jennings' presence hasn't quite led to a Pixar-level bump in quality, this is a clear step up from the likes of The Secret Life Of Pets and the endless Minions-related movies.As the title might suggest, Sing is a full-blown musical. But you may not be prepared for just how full-blown it is. Across its 108 minutes blast some 84 songs. And while many of those come in snatches and bursts, that's still almost a song per minute. On the surface, this doesn't feel as close to Jennings' heart as Son Of Rambow, but as a man who made his name as one half of Hammer & Tongs, creators of some of the '90s most iconic pop videos (Blur's Coffee & TV and Supergrass' Pumping On Your Stereo among them), his love of music infuses every frame.
And this isn't just a standard selection of modern chart hits, either - for every nod to Taylor Swift, there's a deep cut album track from a musical legend. Any movie that places such importance on The Beatles' excellent Golden Slumbers has its ears in the right place.Jennings' love of music infuses every frame.
The musical onslaught is symptomatic of the film itself, which flits about furiously like a coked-up koala. Though McConaughey's hyperactive Buster Moon is at the heart of the story, there are eight or nine principal characters (not counting substantial support from Peter Serafinowicz as a gruff Cockney silverback and Jennings himself as a batty lizard secretary) all vying for screentime. Jennings rarely cuts between them, instead sending his virtual camera hurtling through the city at breakneck speed from storyline to storyline. It can be a little dizzying.
Thankfully, those characters are entertaining enough to make the bombardment bearable. And even if the message ultimately peddled here is the same 'believe in yourself' self-help mantra as a thousand other animated movies, there are just enough unexpected quirks in the storytelling (let's just say the singing contest doesn't become the X Factor facsimile you might expect) and enough infectious fun to make it stand out. Don't leave it another ten years, Mr. Jennings.",Sing
62,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,15 December 2016,"Theater producer Buster Moon (Matthew McConaghuey) owns the most glorious theater in town, but his many failures have brought the theater gradually into almost falling apart. When the bank gives an ultimatum to Moon has one last chance to reestablish the theater to its former glory and he decides to assemble the greatest singing competition ever put to stage.By reading that synopsis I don't think anyone would ever believe it needed to have animals as characters and that cuts right to the problems ""Sing"" has, even though it manages to sneak in some good laughs and funny characters, the final product ends up being a mess, overlong and stuffed with too much stuff for a single film.What is sad about this film is that it furthers a pre-conception about Illumination Entertainment and the more we go on the more that becomes evident: they are not making movies based on good stories, their interest is widely oriented towards flashy products that attract kids and they keep struggling with bringing those ideas on screen in a way that makes a film pleasant and watchable for all audiences. Their animation is also inferior to anything we've seen in the genre recently. So of course they are making tons of money and good for them, but the more we go on the more I frown when the logo of the company comes in before the film, it has never meant good news up until now and that's really sad.Garth Jennings worked on this project for five years and wrote and directed this alone, something very rare in the animation world, so he definitely deserves a huge amount of respect for diving into such an effort and, admittedly, he comes out with some good stuff: many of the characters in this film have a great starting point and an effortlessly comedic dynamic, Miss Crawly, voiced by Jennings himself, is the old lizard assistant to Moon and almost all of her jokes work, her dynamic on screen is just comedic gold. Seth MacFarlane also brings to life a hilarious, irreverent rat with a passion for jazz and that is another element of the film that really works.There is also a raw energy to the film that is established through the music that is passed on to the audience in a positive way for the major part, it gets you going along with the characters and brings out some very funny musical gags and jokes that are definitely the highlight of the film. There's also to consider the fact that the protagonist of the film is incredibly likable and even though his journey doesn't offer much emotionally, he remains a strong character with some very strong traits.Yet, nothing, not even he incredibly high spirited joyful atmosphere of the film can save some of the big flaws in the storytelling and the overall concept of the film. There are no two ways around it: you are watching a film with anthropomorphized animals and I couldn't, for the life of me, explain to myself why they were animals and why was this the medium through which I was watching the film, it is a fatal story flaw that annoyed the hell out of me, especially considering how big of a production this is.Another highly unbalanced element is how the music is handled in the story. Whilst it does manage to give the film a pleasant beat at times, for the majority of the film the way in which the characters interact with it is pathetic and this is coming from someone who has been a musician for all of his life. The message behind the music, the way showmanship is represented, the idea of the competition and worst of all the actual music choice, all of this is handled terribly, it sets a terrible example for kids and it really disrespects the musician figure. It does not manage to make the music relevant thematically or emotionally and that is yet another flaw in how the movie is structured and brought to life.Finally, there are many touches of style in the film that fail miserably. The way the characters are introduced by making the camera move fast around the city, is one of the laziest and most useless techniques I have ever has the displeasure to experience in a theater and I think that everyone involved in taking that decision should really think about it. It is terribly out of place and adds nothing to the story or the tone of the film. It is really something that I was shocked to see employed in an A+ Hollywood production and this is not the only useless and lazy stylish addition that the film employs.Overall sing has some good comedic touches, some likable characters and an overall energetic vibe to favor it, yet the film on a whole does not stand up as a pleasantly joyful experience because of several flaws from the inception of the idea to the character development.",Sing
63,coreyjdenford,Mostly on key,6,27 January 2017,"This review of Sing is spoiler free*** (3/5)WE'VE ALL BEEN there, right? We've all been in that situation either at school or college when there is a poster for a talent show around and that is a chance to show the talent deep inside, so you sign your name at the top of the roster, you wait for ages for your name to be picked and then when it comes to that faithful terminus you decide not to go on the stage with a fear of being embarrassed but there is no turning back, so you go with it. Sing the eighth Illumination animation in the last 7 years essentially riffs on that same ordeal seemingly haunts our lives. It's basically X-Factor with Despicable Me-like animations. We open with Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) a dapper koala with a dream ever since he was young to open a theater to make his father's dream come true, but when his dream starts to crumble he is at the brink of foreclosure so he has an epiphany to have one last big show, the world's greatest singing competition for a large prize, he sees just how many people have turned up but when the decision comes to have a final few he feels as if he doesn't want to let anyone down. Sure enough as these contenders take centre-stage to show off their talent and potentially show their good side, these characters have a bad side to them, too, each of them have many restrictions as there is always something or someone trying to stop them from performing.But the announcement of a very special guest coming to the theatre, the pressure starts to mount heavily as each contender feels as if they can't perform anymore and it's here when the film hits problems. Unfortunately like Minions or Despicable Me 2 when it comes to second act it starts to form holes, Sing follows that same bit of repetition with some of the jokes falling flat or even repeating themselves at this point granted there are few laughs but there is nothing defining a laugh-out-loud moment apart from there is a funny car wash scene. When Buster starts to lose hope and thinks that there is only one way to go. But the film has other problems rather than just the repetitive actions; it has no particular focus on one character so there is no chance to get to know them because when we first meet them there are some wobbly transitions taking place to move over to the next few characters, there is an instant connection granted as we get a chance to hear their talent first hand and the film riffs on that same standard throughout the opening. Sure enough the second act is a bit dim as there are a few problems that form but does the film pick itself up at the third act? Yes, there is a chance to cheer and laugh or may be sing and dance to the 85 song soundtrack. Though the second act is slightly clunky when the jokes get dry and it is twenty minutes too long there is still plenty here to enjoy or even spark a laugh at and may be show off your talent, Sing is an enjoyable and fun animation for all ages.VERDICT: Despite the clunky second half, Sing is to say the least, an entertaining talent show movie for all ages and is mostly on key and is just one step on an already promising year.",Sing

66,ayoreinf,"Well written roles, carry this movie beautifully",8,2 March 2019,"To be precise, most of these are well written cartoon roles, and still, though this cartoons are supposedly shallow we get the stellar cast finding in them hidden depth. They all seem to be mere cliche. The busy neglected stay at home mom; the silly infatuated teenager; the sensative son of a gangster; the slick con man that thinks the world of himself; the cantankerous ancient diva; and obviously the clumsy and shy fat girl with a golden voice. Each and every one here is a cliche, but a well written one, and they all get room for growth, and in this little heartwarming singalong, they do grow and they do warm our hearts while doing it.It's not easy writing cartoon characters and making them human enough for us to care for them instead of laughing from them, but Garth Jennings pulls it off. He gets his stellar cast performing one surprising real life singer after the other. The fact that the actors do sing their songs helps a lot, making each song their own.At the bottom line it's funny at the right moments and moving at the right moments, even though the story is never really original and never really surprising, it does make us care for every single character on screen, and in my personal book, it's quite an acievement",Sing

There's a wide array of characters that aid to the changing dynamics that also help propel the story in a cohesive way.All the acts in the film are evenly proportioned, going seamlessly from one to the other, as if they were glued in a harmonious way. In that particular sense this film really grabbed me, it is consistently firm in quality from start to finish; that's how I perceived it, hence why I believe I enjoyed it so much.

70,Aly200,"Surprisingly Sweet, Fun and Catchy",8,29 August 2017,"From the masterminds behind the ""Despicable Me"" franchise and distributed by Universal Pictures comes this fun musical comedy about a down-on-his-luck theater owner who tries to save his theater by holding a singing contest. The catch?: they're all CG animals, but this is the family appeal of the film and it's a unique concept to have animals participate in an 'American Idol'-like contest.""Sing"" managed to assemble a diverse group of characters of different species and backgrounds: From the misunderstood and conflicted Johnny, a gorilla who wants to sing and not be part of his dad's bank robbing gang, then there's the put-upon yet talented Rosita, a mother pig whose family looks down upon her singing, the obnoxious mouse Mike who just wants the glory and puts all others down, porcupine Ash wants to be the front woman of her musical act despite her boyfriend's attempt to be the center of attention and finally there is the reserved, but soulful young elephant, Meena whose stage fright restricts her attempt to audition for the contest. These are the oddball contestants who we grow to enjoy and root for (with the exception of the vain Mike) as the film follows the numerous ups and downs. And running the whole affair is the troubled theater owner, Buster Moon a koala who resorts to some shyster tactics to save his behind from ruin, but he does have a heart when it comes to his contestants when he learns how much they want the show to succeed.The vocal casting is impeccable as the actors really bring their best to their respective characters: 1. Actress Reese Witherspoon imbues Rosita with an undying drive to live up to her potential. Rosita starts off as harried and, in a way, repressed which hinders her ability to break through and perform to her imagination's delight, but when she is able to invent a way to balance her home life and preparing for the show then Rosita sees her true potential as her performance partner Gunther helps her limits let loose. Witherspoon sings quite well as the actress has previous sung in the biopic ""Walk the Line"" where she won an Oscar as June Carter Cash. 2. Funnyman Seth McFarlane provides a Frank Sinatra-esque dialect to the snobbish Mike. Given the comedian's work on TV with ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" the actor is no stranger to vocal work and also sings many of his animated programs' songs, McFarlane really taps into the vein of Sinatra when singing. I normally don't care for the stylings of McFarlane, but here he is not irritating but is instead a vastly mature character despite the arrogant nature needed. 3. Scarlett Johansson portrays Ash in her trademark husky voice, even when singing. While the character matures through the film from being a second banana guitarist and wannabe singer to a girl who commands the stage when she performs in the final act (after enduring a breakup from Lance, her boyfriend). Sadly Scarlett has never been known for being a good singer, but the film uses her voice sparingly which works out. 4. Tori Kelly as the vulnerable Meena is the character who matures the most of the all the contestants. Meena's stage fright initially prevents her from actually singing through the film which crushes the gifted elephant's dreams to share her talent. However as a stagehand Meena gets to watch all the competitive behavior and gets a perspective on the contest. However Kelly doesn't disappoint in the final act of the film when Meena finally sheds her shyness and belts out a glorious gospel tune. 5. ""Kingsman"" star Taron Egerton brings a naivety to the role of Johnny, someone who wants to be something than he is meant to be. Johnny has a soulful voice and wants to share his gift, but is afraid of his robber father's disapproval. Egerton's natural Cockney English makes his voice stand out from the American voice cast members, but lends beautifully to his singing when doing an R&B ballad that will melt even the hardest hearts. 6. And at the tail end (no pun intended) of the talented cast is Matthew McConaughey as Buster Moon, the desperate koala theater owner. Imbuing the koala with his trademark swag all with an overconfidence that gets Buster into constant hot water makes for a character who needs to face his reality. McConaughey even changes his vocal patterns to shed his native Texan accent as much as possible, but there's no mistake that the Oscar winning actor was tailor-made for Buster.The use of traditional pop songs make for getting the audience to sing-along with the performers. The script provides numerous character breakthroughs and moments of heart that keep the viewer engaged in the story. A fun adventure for those of all ages.",Sing
71,austin0731,a mixed bag with a good message at the core,4,11 December 2016,"Sing is a mediocre entry in my opinion, although I must say it made quite a recovery from its second act onwards. The entire first act seemed more like cutscenes after cutscenes rather than a fluent storytelling. I felt that the characters were very clichéd and two dimensional which really makes the film lose compared to the high quality of animation films we have gotten recently, yes 2016 is quite the year for animations yet this film seems to have taken a couple steps back. What tore me between my opinion however is the payoff we got in the third act, it was quite spectacular and redeemed itself in my opinion. I would commend the film for the message and insight on showbiz, the film does not ease the ride but really reflects reality in a very brutally honest way. But great insight and message without good execution really can't make me feel impressed with this film. It is really quite a shame that this film did not deliver because it had such a wonderful message behind it. Now despite the criticism I do see that this is a family film not targeted towards those who view films more critically. However in a day and age like this in which we are going to get films such as 'cars 3', the animation industry is really stepping its game up, in terms of building worlds and characters with more depth than ever, these studios are really starting to create content that is really for all ages. So I believe that if illumination was to continue to thrive they really must evolve and adapt as well, I do not doubt the stardom of the minions but it's only a matter of time before we get over them.",Sing
72,FelipeCarrillo,A Touching and Moving Animal American Idol,9,5 January 2017,"In 2007, Christopher ""Chris"" Meledandri, the founder and current CEO of Illumination Entertainment, founds his own animation film production company after having been President of 20th Century Fox Animation and supervised and produced movies such as ""Ice Age"", its sequel ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", among others. Three years later, ""Despicable Me"" seeps in worldwide movie show-times as a joyful, energetic and mostly invigorating feature film. Since then, the company has been rising, collecting recognition and purification which are credited to its works. With discrepant spin-offs, sequels, and original ideas, they've been working on providing an annual film, and while 2011 didn't release any new project, they challenge themselves this year like the major studios with two films filled with magic, spirit, and exultation. After ""The Secret Life of Pets"" of Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney, arrives the seventh one and the first animated musical of the Universal Pictures section. The factory shows clearly conviction deposited in its product, since it has been a pretty competitive year in the matter, and even story lines of this film have been outlined in other projects, putting it at great risk around to the unpleasant and subjective paradigms. However, there are inexplicably films of which you cannot hate, even though you know that something goes wrong, well this is the case.In a universe where humans are substituted by animals, it's ordinary to glimpse a giraffe jogging, a lizard talking or a zebra cooking. In this domesticated world is set Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey), a koala owner of a fluctuating theater which is falling apart due to the almost non-existent income. He hopes to become a virtuoso host and rebuilds the theater, which his father bequeathed him; so announces a singing competition without restrictions or impediments, anyone who considers that can hum has the possibility of auditing in the proscenium. After a grueling knockout round, there are five shortlisted contenders to fight for the tempting award, a prize that has been altered by mistake. The finalists are intended to be a heterogeneous group: Rita (Reese Witherspoon), a housewife and mother of 25 piglets should be related a lover pop culture pig, Gunter (Nick Kroll); an egotistical and individualistic small mouse, Mike (Seth Macfarlane); a teenage elephant with stage panic, Meena (Tori Kelly); a young bouncer who wants categorically a different tomorrow from his family gives him, Johnny (Taron Egerton) and a rocker porcupine with an amorous deception, which impels her to emerge as a soloist; Ash (Scarlett Johansson). Around these plots, the story succumbs in well-known territories, however, it comes out unscathed thanks to the thoughtful and authentic connection with their characters; a story that finds its main propellant in the wonderful inspiration.In times where scrupulousness for accuracy and concentration for detail ruled in ""Zootopia"" or ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", many people consider that the film does not take hold in visual terms regarding its predecessors, placing emphasis repeatedly in the facial gestures scarcity and poor worked textures, however, contrary to what many declares, I encounter this one even more effective since they put the organic aside for going deeper in significant features for development, it should be noted that the above does not mean that the movie perishes visually, it's gorgeous on the essentials; the squids liveliness, the flood, the city environment and the auditions are grandiose but evidently dissimilar against its competitors. It's noteworthy that Illumination has joined the trend of concealing different easter eggs among its films in order to generate a kind of not confirmed interconnection among them, clearly highlighting the masks used by gorillas in the robberies, the iconic and unforgettable face of Snowball played by Kevin Hart in ""The Secret Life of Pets"".Music is a vital issue, therefore they inject covers of 65 different artists, which ranging from Ariana Grande's low notes to the exquisite polyphony of Frank Sinatra. Katy Perry, Kanye West, Sam Smith, The Beatles, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj lead the melodic lists artfully personified, linked and adorned by particularly humorous circumstances. In addition to this, the film also conceived two own songs: ""Faith"", performed by Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande and ""Set it All Free"" sung by incredible Johansson.The last card of the ascending study is an uplifting, noticeably touching and fertile in laughs reality show that will return you the hope of finding simple films with teachings so important. With animation standards of the seventh art in these days, ""Sing"" may not be an aesthetic pearl, but who longs for sensational animals and computerized voices when you have Taron Egerton singing to the dreams, to Scarlett Johansson as a mother and model or to Mathew McConaughey keeping alive the illusion of dreaming and fighting; any human being would swap one thing for other.",Sing

But since I haven't seen much of the original Star Wars, I wasn't too sure about seeing it and decided against it to see Sing since I love songs.As a music fan, I was very disappointed. It was bland, it was clichéd, and the dramatic parts were forced, or is it just me ignoring the movie by looking at my phone because I don't give a crap and it was quite boring?Rosita's piglets and those radio animals don't contribute much to the story and were just there for almost pure annoyance. Taking the piglets out will not chance the story and maybe even the radio animals.It's like the writers weren't even trying to make these characters sympathetic. Few of the characters were jerks The plot is contrived and lazy. The jokes were funny and annoying at the same time especially that fart scene, I have had enough of fart scenes! They are NOT THAT funny!The character design was ugly and sick to watch.Now for the plus, well, the animation was dazzling and sparkling. Most of the voice actors did really well singing and voicing their characters and they should be proud. There was a little obnoxious singing in there but not that much. I think kids might like to sing along to some of the great songs in here, other songs that were covered I didn't like so much. Though, I don't understand why for God's sake, they put Anaconda in a kids movie! Even if it's just a little bit, ugh!-_- And what is with people and twerking these days?Though, this movie could've been better and I was disgusted at how many famous actors they put in this movie. Just because it's a movie about characters singing famous songs, you put famous actors in there?

Suddenly though, despite all the clichés, typical Hollywood plot beats and predictability, I found that I actually cared what was happening. No, it was more than that, I was completely engrossed - and I don't even know how or when it happened.Sing is a unique and bizarre film: it's the perfect example of stars aligning to turn even the most sceptical viewer into a sniffing, pumped-up fan of song, dance and being just alive. It's the kind of film that says, ""Wow, there really is still magic in Hollywood.""I've never been a fan of Elton John and my knowledge of Taylor Swift began at ended at her being a pop singer, but each song fitted perfectly and to see my little girl stamp her feet and clap was worth the admission price alone!

78,SpoilerAlertReviews,A great underkoala story! Great laugh out loud moments.,7,4 February 2017,"Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy director, Garth Jennings teams up with Despicable Me 2 story animator Christophe Lourdelet for Illumination's longest film, about a singing contest held in hope to help save the anthropomorphic city's Moon Theatre. The theatre belonging to Buster Moon, a koala voiced superbly well by Matthew McConaughey. This being his second voice performance for an animated film, his first only being last year's Kubo and the Two Strings. His inherited and beloved theatre is in a dire situation, with failed productions after production putting Moon under financial strain and in a stroke of genius, he decides to host a contest that would hopefully turn the tables and rescue his theatre. Interest spread far and wide, from the weird and wonderful characters voiced by some surprising actors. Most surprising being Seth MacFarlane as Mike the arrogant and self righteous mouse performance in style of Rat Packs era legends like Sinatra. I didn't even recognise Scarlett Johansson voice as punk rocker porcupine, Ash; and is there no limit to Taron Egerton's talents, first Kingsman, then Eddie The Eagle and now singing his heart out in this, playing Johnny the aspiring Gorilla trying to take a different path to his father's choice of being a criminal. I can't fault any of the performances, but what is key here is the music, the film featuring more than 85 pop songs ranging from the 40s right up to today's music. All classic and recognisable tracks apart from the couple originally written for the film, namely Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande's ""Faith"". There's actually moments of aww when hearing classic tracks from the recently departed Michael George, David Bowie and Leonard Cohen. There's plenty of laugh-out-moments, especially the auditions in quick fire succession and when Buster Moon finally gets his shirt off, yes, that's right, McConaughey's character gets his shirt off but to hilarious comedy effect. On the whole, it's great fun, super catchy and doesn't feel like the 110min runtime. It's an underkoala story with great feels at the end, that reminded me a little of Stepping Out. It's a worthy watch for the whole family. I've put this higher than Illumination's Secret Life of Pets.

Unlike Zootopia that creates a world only possible in animation, this movie puts animals in an already familiar world. There is little to no reason for them to be animals for any reason. Luckily this allows the creators to focus more on story. Before you can talk about the story you have to talk about the folks in it. The cast is very well acted, funny, and surprisingly talented when it comes to singing. You really get to hear the voices of some folks that you wouldn't often think to have amazing vocal skills. Now the plot is generally good. There is a nice story revolving around a guy with a dream who can't make it a reality and has a last second hurrah. The individual plotlines of each of the characters are all interesting and if I'm being honest Johnny has one of the best plots I've seen just in general.

Despite the fact that this movie is a kids movie, and us being 26 years old we have moved way past those kiddie movies. The good news is the movie had a very adult message behind it and it was so realistic on so many levels. While the annoying fart and burping jokes are meant to be for kids, we were both able to look beyond that and see the realistic struggle in Theater Showbiz. The pain, the sweat, the lies, the time and the money to do this sort of thing would be just so unbearable to go through. So the movie did an excellent job at achieving this message.The voice cast are also incredible. The best singers were Reese Withspoon, Seth Macfarlane (surprisingly) and Taron Egerton. The only complaint we would have about the songs is that they were cut all the time. Every single time you are hearing the actors sing it cuts it short just as you are getting into it! Apart from all this, despite never going to the movies to see little kids movies this one was an exception. We both thoroughly enjoyed it. Take your (annoying) kids and go and see this movie. It's not perfect, but it's definitely not disappointing!",Sing
82,snperera,loove this movie,9,8 February 2017,"going into this movie, I knew that I would like it...but I didn't think that I would love it as much as I do. Such a sweet movie and it has such agreat message that you should never give up on your dreams no matter what. The songs in this movie are so great and the talent is so great as well!! The characters are so likable and I like that we get to see sneak peeks into their lives. Tori Kelly in this is amazing!! oh my gosh! she has such energy and heart to her character and I just loove her soooo much! I have seen this movie 3 times in the theatre and I fell in love with it even more. I will always love this movie and I cannot recommend it enough to both kids and adults.

85,stefstars,Could've been better,4,23 May 2019,"I hate to bash on illumination because there's animators hard at work there, giving their best and all. This company makes it hard to like them by basically just throwing unfinished/ half assed storylines out there and hoping kids eat it up - which they usually do. This movie has interesting characters, with the exception of the rude ass rat, but it fails to tell their stories in interesting ways - hell it fails to keep up with their respective storylines. Johnny the gorilla and Buster Moon the koala get the most time in having their respective stories told. Honestly it's hard not to like Johnny the gorilla, this character and the elephant Tori Kelly plays are part of why I can't bash this film too much.It gets boring in a lot of parts, particularly anything having to do with Rosita the pig, I'm sorry but that character was so boring. It gets irritating in a lot of parts, ESPECIALLY in parts that focus on the rat played by Seth Macfarlane. I like Macfarlane but ugh, this character was unfunny and you just wanted to get him in a mouse trap. Scar Jo's character, the porcupine, can be a bit boring as well and her storyline is awkward for a kid's movie...Like my review, the movie is all over the place. You know how in the first few minutes it just zooms into different parts of the city to introduce the key characters, well that's basically how the whole movie goes and it does that in a really careless way. At the end of it you could care less for what happens to these characters and just want it to end.I think this movie could've been a lot better if illumination didn't do the half assed process they do with every film they churn out and depend on their soundtrack to carry the entire film. ""Sing"" is basically a prime example of a good idea but poor execution.",Sing
86,sjarja,above average but nothing more,6,8 March 2017,"Sing is cute - but no revelation. While i watched the movie i couldn t help but wonder ""why it was all animals...."" - a question that did not come up in my mind when i watched Zootopia for example.In zootopia is makes sense - the movie is based on not just the racial diversity of animals (compared to humans) - the sizes, abilities and all - but the great difference between predators and prey.Sing however seemed to use animals ""just for the cuteness"" - sort of. There was no reason whatsoever to have this movie play in an animal world; and i found it to get a little in the way of storytelling.Visuals are good and it is a fun ride - but it does not look near as good as Zootopia.What i was most disappointed with were the voices. I did not quite expect some cheap auto-tuned song and more focus on the characters... which is strange as the movie is all about characters and their progression. Coming out of the movie i still felt that most characters had not received the proper storyarc and detail they deserved.So Sing is a nice movie that is completely forgettable. Causal entertainment that will not stick in memory very long.",Sing
87,valen060,"Predictable and Average with Melodious, Musical Fun",7,30 December 2016,"For Illumination Entertainment to release the next animated flick in the same year as their recent hit The Secret Life of Pets, I was left even more curious as to what their follow-up Sing can belt out. The moment I walked into that theater and watched it in its entirety, it left me both entertained and in stitches as to see what these characters are capable of.The equation to me is like: Zootopia + American Idol + a hint of Glee = SingSo Buster Moon, a koala and owner to his local theater is falling on hard times as no one is interested in the shows he puts on. When he and his associates Eddie (a male sheep) and the elderly Ms. Crawly (an iguana) decide to put together a singing competition for all the locals, he hopes it's the only way to save his theater from being taken away from him.Although the singing prowess is all there in the anthropomorphic animal characters and were definitely superb to hear from each of their respective voice actors (Taron Egerton, Scarlett Johansson, and even Seth MacFarlane certainly stood out with both speaking and singing) it's a plot that feels too routine and a tendency to be predictable when it comes to the more pivotal moments in the movie. The scenario started to slowly remind me of the old 1997 Warner Bros. movie ""Cats Don't Dance"" in terms of has-been or aspiring individuals that would do anything to make it big in the limelight. In spite of the littler ones (and I even noticed some much older adults) being kept amused by the off-color humor and various renditions of hit songs each character sang, it's pretty much average fun for families of all ages. It's no ""Moana"" and feels like a low-budget ""Zootopia,"" but it's a bipedal, animated musical comedy that's not afraid to stand in the spotlight. The ending song ""Faith"" by legend Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande is also a catchy tune. No wonder it got some recognition for awards season. A lesser effort, but melodious enough to hear.",Sing
88,margulanabutrlov,Sing Review,10,23 March 2019,"Failed impresario Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) has a brainwave: to revive the fortunes of his ailing theatre with a singing competition; one that attracts a motley crew of animal entrants.
Garth Jennings' last movie was the heart-warming and imaginative Son Of Rambow, a small but perfectly formed personal film that served both as an antidote to his first, the fun but flawed adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, and a calling card for what he could do with gentler material. We waited with bated breath to see what he'd do next. And waited. And waited.
Finally, a decade on, he's made his next move, and in a guise nobody could have expected. The path between animated films and live action has been well-trodden in recent years, but Jennings has become one of the few directors to cross in the opposite direction, rocking up at Chris Meledandri's Illumination Studios.
Illumination's output over the years may have been wildly successful, but from a creative point of view their work has been middle of the road, bland and lacking in true inspiration. While Jennings' presence hasn't quite led to a Pixar-level bump in quality, this is a clear step up from the likes of The Secret Life Of Pets and the endless Minions-related movies.
As the title might suggest, Sing is a full-blown musical. But you may not be prepared for just how full-blown it is. Across its 108 minutes blast some 84 songs. And while many of those come in snatches and bursts, that's still almost a song per minute. On the surface, this doesn't feel as close to Jennings' heart as Son Of Rambow, but as a man who made his name as one half of Hammer & Tongs, creators of some of the '90s most iconic pop videos (Blur's Coffee & TV and Supergrass' Pumping On Your Stereo among them), his love of music infuses every frame.
And this isn't just a standard selection of modern chart hits, either - for every nod to Taylor Swift, there's a deep cut album track from a musical legend. Any movie that places such importance on The Beatles' excellent Golden Slumbers has its ears in the right place.
The musical onslaught is symptomatic of the film itself, which flits about furiously like a coked-up koala. Though McConaughey's hyperactive Buster Moon is at the heart of the story, there are eight or nine principal characters (not counting substantial support from Peter Serafinowicz as a gruff Cockney silverback and Jennings himself as a batty lizard secretary) all vying for screentime. Jennings rarely cuts between them, instead sending his virtual camera hurtling through the city at breakneck speed from storyline to storyline. It can be a little dizzying.
Thankfully, those characters are entertaining enough to make the bombardment bearable. And even if the message ultimately peddled here is the same 'believe in yourself' self-help mantra as a thousand other animated movies, there are just enough unexpected quirks in the storytelling (let's just say the singing contest doesn't become the X Factor facsimile you might expect) and enough infectious fun to make it stand out. Don't leave it another ten years, Mr. Jennings.",Sing
89,christophershobris,Best Film So Far By Illumination,5,3 January 2017,"This is what Illumination is capable and what happens when they go beyond minions. While its not a perfect film it is an eye opener for me in terms of what Illumination can do as a company. To me they are still not as good as Disney or DreamWorks but Illumination impressed me with Sing. Here is why. The plot is very original, not many animated films have singing as a topic. Even though a month before we got Trolls, which is still unique in its interpretations. The voice acting and singing by the actors and actresses is superb. Some of the actors surprised me like Seth MacFarlane, he showed his singing talent and can do more then just Family Guy. But the flaws are present. The characters are not the most memorable. The reason is that there is so many of them there is never really any time to get to know them on a personal level. Many side characters are thrown in and none really stand out. It just a bunch of random characters who want to achieve a certain goal. The character design is also a little distracting, but that's just a nit-pick, and the animation itself is decent but not on the level of Zootopia. So those are my thoughts and now here are my grades. Music: B+ Story: A- Characters: C Animation: B Overall: B-",Sing
90,Amthermandes,"Like ""Zootopia,"" with singing.",7,15 January 2021,"It's a cute film, despite the overbearing typical modern themes of ""you're special,"" ""you can do anything you set your mind to"", and ""follow your heart"". Plot development and execution is extremely predictable and ""cookie-cutter"", but the good stuff is all in the details: the humor, the characters, the animation, and sure, even the music.One may think the movie is purely a platform upon which to showcase all the current, popular musical artists, with almost no thought or heart going into everything else, but thankfully this is not the case. It's not perfect, and yes, there is heavy ""music placement"", but it should be obvious even to the most skeptic of critics that a lot of work went into creating a fun, family-friendly movie for all.The actors & singers do a great job too, and on a personal note, it's a great way for anyone unfamiliar with Seth MacFarlane's singing abilities to see just how friggin' talented the guy is, despite their opinion of him.",Sing
91,Animated_Antic,I really had a good time.,9,4 January 2017,"I seriously had started to doubt Illumination's movies after the disaster known as ""Minions"". I really had lost my appeal in their movies and ""Secret Life of Pets"" didn't help me win them back. Sing on the other hand, did. This movie is very well crafted, fun, funny and overall a good movie.The story is about a koala who owns a theater named Buster Moon (Mathew McConaughey). He's struggling to keep his theater open and pay the bills so he figures, if he holds a singing competition, he can bring back the crowds. He plans to give out a $1,000 prize to the winner, but an error makes it seem that the prize is $100,000. The competition quickly spreads around town and Moon selects the best singers. An overworked mother pig named Rosita (Reese Witherspoon) who is partnered with a crazier pig named Gunter (Nick Kroll), a teenage porcupine rock star named Ash (Scarlett Johansen) who is trying to get over a breakup, a gorilla named Johnny (Taron Egerton) who does not want to be part of his fathers gang, a shy and stage fright elephant named Meena (Tori Kelly), and an arrogant mouse (Seth MacFarlane).One of things that I really enjoyed about this movie were all the characters. They're all very likable and the actors who play them have really good singing voices and film doesn't even use auto-tune at all (unlike Trolls). Another thing that I did enjoy was the animation which is really good and is mostly laid back unlike Illumination's previous movies. The story is also really well written, for the most part. There are some jokes in the movie that aren't really funny, but they're very rare and I also thought the story kind of went back and forth as it seems some certain scenes weren't tied together well. And, yeah, let's talk about the similarities that this movie has to ""Zootopia"". The film really didn't need to be composed of anthropomorphic animals. In fact, if you made them humans I think only one line would change and that's it. The city they live in also seem unnatural for the animals. In ""Zootopia"", the city looks like a city animals built and would live in, Sing's city looks more like a Southern California city, but if you ask me those are nitpicks.All in all, Sing is a very good movie and I definitely had a fun time. I definitely enjoyed this movie and certainly recommend it. It's not a great movie, but I don't think it's supposed to be. I think it was only supposed to be a nice simple animated film and I definitely plan on watching it again.",Sing
92,CelluloidDog,"If you love to laugh, cry and listen to great songs. Not what the critics say...",9,4 January 2018,"Simply outstanding(!) and far better than what professional critics and amateur reviewers say. It's really one the best animated films of the decade. If you don't want a musical but prefer superhero fighting, ok, it's not for you. But in terms of originality, laughter and songs, this is the best animated film. I've seen probably more films than most critics and seen the best, so trust me on this. I will go through some critics points which I don't think are valid.1. Originality and moral theme: Sing has multiple storylines and they move quickly so it's hard to focus on one moral line like the Lion King or Monsters, Inc. But each story has a terrific line which are not necessarily trite cliches. For one, Rosita is an overwork mother pig with a ridiculously large family. Frankly, I have never seen a story line like that since one of those movies from the 1960s or earlier (e.g, Yours, Mine and Ours). But it's a funny take on a multi-tasking mom who wants a life outside homemaking. Meena is the shy elephant who can sing but is afraid...I don't know any movies that carry that story line unless one means the reality shows where we find a Susan Boyle or two. I have not seen a Buster Moon dreamer in a movie in a long time. You could compare the storylines to one of those 70s movies on dancing but this is different. Ash fires quills when she sings, Buster acts as a carwash mop, Ms Crawly is always losing her glass eye. Tell me you have seen all that in other movies. I'm sorry critics. This is a very original film. And the storylines are terrific: overcoming fear, shyness, learning to stand on your own (from your boyfriend), learning not to just be an overworked mom, trying to face up to your dad, live up to your dad, dream. I could stop there, but I wonder what people missed?2. Humor: people seriously thought it wasn't that funny? Miss Crawly's glass eye? Buster Moon and the moon? Gunter dancing? Rosita in the supermarket? The baboon Mike attacks? Buster wakes up in...? It has far too many funny moments, almost nonstop especially with some characters.3. Songs: it's a unique film since Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlance, Tori Kelly join up with Jennifer Hudson, Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande...and the songs are terrific.Aside from that, the animation and direction were terrific, as good as any animated film. The characters, squids and the flood were exemplary in outstanding animation.Ok, the plot was relatively simple even with the running storylines.
If you don't like to laugh, don't want to hear a great soundtrack and songs, and a fast-paced movie, then this isn't for you.",Sing
93,ragpap93,A Humble Musical,5,30 May 2017,"A theater is on its final legs and a music competition could be its only hope. The characters were spectacular. It did not go overboard in any place. The audience got just what they wanted nothing more nothing less. Not too funny either but the singing was pretty good. The plot follows each potential singer through their ups, downs and their transformation. One cliché was there off course like when it was discovered that Moon did not have money to give but I think we went through quite fast. The comeback was more about singing for themselves and each character sings a specific genre of music. Great fun for the whole family in my opinion.",Sing
94,TheMovonka,What a pity...,5,15 December 2016,"I fear Sing"" has to be described as nice. Only nice. With this short sentence I don't want to disappoint any fans or viewers, but it is the best thing I can say about this ambitious music movie.With emotions, fun and great singers to perform hits and mashups to entertain the audience like Sister Act, Pitch Perfect or other music oriented movies, Sing should have been a great flick in the pre-Christmas time. At least the trailer looked like this.In the end, we got an superficial, easy going kids movie with slight laughter and standard radio hits we all hear every day. Besides maybe one original track, it appears that creators licensed only from one or two sources to allow themselves flexibility in music selection. In combination with a straight forward story-line with no twists, deepness or surprises, it is mostly interesting for children who loves a koala bear in a suit.Instead of going out of the theater with music in my head, a song to sing along and a great feeling inside, I felt as I have seen a mainstream short term typical kids TV movie on a Sunday afternoon with some music aside. Seen and forgotten – What a pity",Sing

96,trevor-82944,"It Hits the Right Keys, but is Still a Rather Monotonous Tune",4,28 April 2017,"Well, I can certainly understand why the Golden Globes loved Illumination's thespian-infested movie. ​ Based around something as universally understood as music, Sing seems to be an appropriate first-time directing effort by the duo Christopher Lourdelet and Garth Jennings (who directed live action before). The result of their hard work brings a passable accomplishment by the studio's sixth ever full-length feature, even if no studio gamechanger nonetheless.The feature takes place in an unnamed San Fran-Los Angeles-esque city painted by Miami, home to many anthropomorphic mammals, reptiles, birds, primates, household pets, cephalopods, arachnids, and whales. We focus on six mammals: one a producer, five the lucky choices for his theater-saving singing competition. Plenty celebrity voices deliver occasionally terrific singing, although the minor roles' unfitting voices draw back the overall quality. Surprisingly however, the anthropomorphic individuals' subplots are all masterfully balanced in their yearnings on the road to fame and fortune:Buster Moon the koala (Matthew McConaughey) wants to keep the theater financially stable after his father passed down the torch. Despite being the lead, he is the least interesting cast member, more existing to vocalize the cliché morals. Though he still plays great off the more colorful characters, including his dimwitted senior secretary, Miss Crawly the iguana.Rosita the pig (Reese Witherspoon) wants to follow her passion away from her uncaring husband and twenty-five children. She soon meets unexpected challenges when the competition pairs her with an overly optimistic pig named Gunter. This widely marketed chunk of ham shockingly gets little stage time; and I should also mention how he flaunts an indistinguishable European accent exaggerated to the point of annoyance. The immature will worship him like Moccus, leaving adults to gag a bit while watching an overweight swine in a unitard stereotyping western culture.Johnny the gorilla (Taron Egerton) wants to escape his father's criminal lifestyle, and follow his heart for the microphone. Boys across all ages will relate to this highly soulful musician, despite a phoned in resolution to his subplot.Ash the porcupine (Scarlett Johansson) seeks public appreciation alongside her boyfriend/musical partner. While her story feels relatively unengaging compared to the others, she still brings a nice voice, especially when her guitar strums electrify her quills to the point of showering out.Mike the mouse (Seth MacFarlane) needs the prize money to pay back a bear gang who see him as a tasty meal. His ratty account maybe could have benefited from higher stakes against the law; but it does not matter anyway, for this crude comedian providing the voice amazingly makes a tiny crooner so ruggedly lovable with some spice thrown in.Meena the elephant (Tori Kelly) cannot pursue her love for singing, as her glossophobia gets in the way, with no thanks to her arrogant grandfather. She has the most poorly balanced yet easily relatable experience for all the boys and girls facing a similar fear.Together, doubt gets conquered in a unified walk to fame and fortune. So who ends up winning the competition?It doesn't matter! They are all too introspective to notice one another, as these well-rounded individual stories have zero interweaving amongst one another. In the end, Sing cares less about teamwork, and more about getting children to worship the most popular hits by Lady GaGa, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen, and everyone else out there (just stay through the credits, the list of songs used lasts over a minute). It doesn't matter if the human artist singles are sung by cute little animals; accompanied by predictable fart jokes, evidence proves why this movie aims squarely toward kids with an affinity of music over rules, offering the parents nothing more than a few scattered chuckles to at least manage without booing the artist offstage.",Sing

You can't rate this one for anyone above 12 but it gets full stars for anyone below. I guess if you're 13 or over and are still a child at heart, you'll rate it highly too.""The Koala takes the cheese  Hi hoe the merry-O "" Anyway, the Koala is the ringleader of this movie. He is starting a variety show with all the unknown talent in the city. His mother once performed in a local theater that she owned but now he is trying to do it on his own to impress her.Koalas are cute in the wild but I wouldn't have picked this one to be the centerpiece of this movie. The other animated creatures are much more pleasing to the eye than he is. Still, he does a good job putting everything together in his quest to make everything work.Unfortunately, I feel this is another ""bait and switch"" ad campaign. We have been seeing the ads for this film mysteriously simply titled Sing. We saw the pig swooning and dancing with maracas in the grocery story for months. The fact of the matter is, most of the whopping 65 musical routines are very short and they don't ring many bells. I say that as compared to the stellar Trolls that came out this year where the song number is less but the music is more well-known. I think hiring Justin Timberlake to direct the music on that one paid off.As I was arguing some of my criticism to my 11-year-old daughter, she reminded me, ""It's a kid's movie Dad."" I will leave that magnanimous wisdom with you. Does it matter the story is thin and the characters underdeveloped? I say no and the sound of kids laughing and clapping at the closing credits drove that home with me. I recommend this only after you have seen Trolls, a much better animated music based film.

Not only this movie is not original in it's concept, but in everything else as well.
The characters are just stereotypes, so everyone is represented. Illumination is known for their horrendous character desings, and here they continue with that tradition; if the desings in Pets were awful, here they're worse. Also, you noticed they repeat the exact same models throught the entire movie? Look it up, they made like 8 models only.
The messages this movie is attempting to communicate to children are: don't lie and don't give up? Seriously? That's like something you understand when you're 2 years old, very original Illumination, very original.
The biggest crime for me is that they ruined Golden Slumbers, that is something I can't forgive. And the other music... 95% is pure pop trash that everyone knows.

101,ivans536,Below average,3,25 February 2019,"Nothing here stands out.From the boring, one-dimensional characters, the slow, yet somehow rushed script & completely predictable and uninteresting plot, this is an example of how studios are still able to produce mediocre fare even with huge budgets and big name actors.There's nothing for adults, neither jokes or references that are beyond children nor there's any character development. A monkeys' father just changes his mind about his son singing although a second ago he said his cellmates should turn off the television, implying he doesn't like it.
And yes, cellmates. This movie has no problems with showing bank robbers escaping prison or a morally completely depraved mouse as something good. The mouse literally robs a person in the beginning and later buys a car with money he stole from people by cheating at poker, just to ride of into the sunset with his one dimensional eyecandy love interest.The only redeeming quality is the good animation, but which A-list animsted movie doesn't have that these days?

103,ksheimsoth,"It looked great, then I had doubts, and then I enjoyed it thoroughly!",9,6 January 2017,"Honestly, the first trailer I saw caught my interest immediately. It also seemed to have Johnny, the gorilla, as the main character, so you can imagine my surprise and disease when the new trailers hardly showed him at all. It made me feel like ""Oh no... if they're this unsure of their plot, what will the movie be like?"" But I held onto my first impression and went into the theater with excitement, and I was not disappointed in the least. The focus was mostly taken by Mr. Moon, but the movie did this very interesting thing where all the characters are given just enough screen time to flesh them out, encouraging the audience to find patterns and realize the overarching moral. It strangely made the moral much easier to feel and realize. No main character felt unnecessary, and it made all of them easier to love (I love every single one of the characters, actually). I think I liked it better this way than how it would've ended up with one main character. It gets the message across much better than it would've before. By seeing everyone's own stories and problems and determination to pursue their dreams, it provides a larger umbrella for all audiences, that no matter what you've been through, you can still keep going. Basically, the movie focused more on the message than the story. I really appreciated that, and I'm sure the kids do too. I also like this thing that's been happening in movies lately: a theme of wanting the past to be popular in the present. And the fact that Mr. Moon isn't the usual stubborn traditionalist is refreshing and makes him a LOT more likable and unique. La La Land had it's stubborn traditionalist through the Jazz fanatic Sebastion, but he obviously learns to be a bit more open-minded by the end. That was good, but Mr. Moon being open- minded from the start is much more likable and makes him a sturdy pillar amongst the messy lives of the singers who search for solutions throughout the film. So basically, whenever I saw the guy, I felt like everything was gonna be okay. Mr. Moon didn't care as long as he kept running his beloved theater, and I think that's a type of conviction that's rarely found today. I would say Mr. Moon is my favorite character, but I can't because all the other singers are just as likable in how they overcome their problems.But I will admit I didn't like how it encouraged what good singing is. It creates a connection with the kids of today, but it also teaches them that what we're listening to now IS good singing and kinda encourages kids to stay in that spectrum. I gotta appreciate Mike the mouse's singing, though. Knowing Seth MacFarlene was gonna voice him instantly made me feel at ease about the music they would be singing. Gotta love Seth. :DSo basically, just go see it. As an adult, it was very enjoyable. As a musician, I appreciated their efforts quite a bit.Also, Mr. Moon's name reminded me of Georges Méliès in Hugo. If that was intentional (which I feel like must be), I love it. :D",Sing

Something that 'The Muppets' had done in 2011 only instead they had a telethon to save their theater. But I gave this movie a chance after seeing how it got good reviews and to be honest, it was actually good.The characters are likable and fun to watch and you definitely feel sorry for them such as Ash dealing with a breakup and Johnny not wanting to be part of his dad's gang and oh yeah that scene of his dad saying 'How did I end up with a son like you?' was just ice cold, great acting there by Peter Serafinowicz. And Meena dealing with her stage fright.The story though might look like they loose focus on other characters but its structure reminds me of films like 'Love Actually' where it focus on characters and their story arcs. But despite all the great talent and animation. I tend to think the plot was clichéd as we have seen these types of films before such as dealing with stage fright, saving a theater/other building from doom it's just clichéd. But it still left me a smile on my face as the film was fun to watch. Great singing by the actors and great animation by Illuminations and I'm glad that they weren't putting more focus on the pop songs unlike Alvin and The Chipmunks.",Sing

109,anandrajeev979,Unexpectedly Amazing and feel good movie of the year.,9,15 March 2017,"With Illumination , I did not expect this coming. Even though with the same plot , same characters and clichés , it serves as an excellent piece of entertainment to be fully enjoyed. I especially loved the overall voice over acting of Koala , Mr. Moon. The fact that it included so much classic songs only makes it better.Faith is mind blowing too. I think this was Tori Kelly's debut movie and boy she delivered very well. Final word is , Even though it feels at first you have seen this a 100 times before , but SING has a wonderful charm associated with it that makes it not only worth watching but mostly enjoyable and feel good. I don't know how this Movie didn't get nominated for an Oscar for best animated feature.Academy sucks really , No noms for Dory and Sing. Still , I loved it and am highly anticipated for its sequel in 2020. No owner it's so good given it's $580 million worldwide box office haul.Well Illumination has had a good year with Secret Life of Pets another juggernaut with $800 million in receipts. This sets very high expectations for the 3rd installment in Despicable Me franchise.",Sing

He also wants to see the results of all the animals' efforts, but the difference is that everyone on the stage has a reason to prove their salvation by singing, while the second generation of sheep is just based on the friendship with the koala boss.

111,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Sing (2016),6,31 December 2019,"""Sing"" (2016) is a family movie about finding and expressing your voice, regardless of your circumstances. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:There isn't a whole lot of depth beyond this movie's initial façade. It is first and foremost a children's movie in the form of a mash-up between American Idol and Zootopia, which is great at times and mildly frustrating at others. The strength lies in the ending, which offers a great catharsis and the diversity of personalities between the characters.The main character however, Mr. Moon, has a potential to divide audiences as he can be perceived as both industrious but also unsympathetic, as his choices throughout the runtime are questionable at best. As a result, the level of sympathy will indeed greatly vary towards him and the story, but it is somewhat made up for by the developed sympathy to the side characters. If this movie is showed to younger children, it would be recommended to talk with them after the movie to clarify that some actions shown aren't that morally acceptable.My personal grade: a delightful 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",Sing

113,gbidari,Don't Listen to the Haters - This Film Is Great,9,21 June 2017,"I'm not a fan of musicals, or of a lot of the pop songs featured. But the renditions here are pretty great and there are an insane number of songs included. It's not always laugh out loud funny, but there's plenty to be entertained by for adults and kids. Some of the best comedy here is slapstick with great timing on trips and falls. This movie has a lot of heart and there's a real sweetness in the writing and acting. The voice talent is played perfectly from the comedy to the more emotional moments. There's a great timeless quality to the plot and characters, despite the inclusion of current pop culture elements. At times it's a bit predictable, but it's a kids movie. McConaughy's classic underdog with a heart of gold who just won't quit feels familiar in a good way. Some of themes and lessons are more complex than one would expect from a kids film too. Another bonus is this although crime is featured, there aren't any real depictions of outright violence. Even more rare there are NO GUNS in this film, which has become all too common in kids programming, which in my eyes bumps this up a star or two. Seems to me all the bad reviews are from folks that are either deeply bitter and directing it at this film or just didn't know what to expect when they decided to watch the film.",Sing
114,klchu,Great songs and great characters,9,26 November 2016,"I knew I was in for a good music movie when the first song gave me chills.I went into this movie expecting lots of songs and gags, and they are there, but I didn't expect to start caring about the characters and their stories. SING brings together a talented cast and writers for a movie that transcends some of the animated movies out there. The whole family loved it so feel free to bring anyone from 5 on up. Even the younger ones may enjoy it when it's available at home.Every voice actor delivers and the animators nailed it. The pacing and directing are also very well done.

115,AlienByChoice,"Not fun or funny, not original, not inspirational. Rock bottom.",2,24 December 2016,"Family of four - 2 adults, one 7 year old, one 4 year old. Not one of us enjoyed it. Never mind the 4 year old. Never before have I seen my 7 year old being so bored by a movie that she wanted to walk out.If you've seen the trailers you've seen the best bits of the movie. That's it. There's nothing else to see there. I know you aren't going to believe me, but try and trust me. THIS is all there is. The exposition is boring. The story is too complicated and adult-themed for kids to understand, and too plain stupid for adults to relate to. The jokes are either too try hard (including fart jokes that even the kids didn't laugh at), or just plain misses. Racial stereotypes that wouldn't have looked out of place for a Dirty Harry movie. And for a supposedly musically themed movie, the music is pretty much absent for most of it.Here's my guess how this terrible mess happened. Imagine a Mitch Hedberg-like ""Club sandwich"" dialogue:I have an idea for a movie! A modern take on ""Fame"", but we replace the school with American Idol!Yeah, sounds good. But we've got to make it funny!OK. Funny... I know! How do you feel about talking animals?I'm for them!This movie is a go then! Let's release it in Christmas.Christmas... Then it needs to be animated.OK. Let's give to Illumination. They can polish anything.That's a deal!Bottom line. Skip it. Just skip it.

116,pokedom,When will you learn Illumination?,3,17 January 2017,"I've seen enough kids movies to know how they'll play out from beginning to end. They start with introductions, then establish the main motives. Then they have ""wacky adventures"", before hitting rock bottom and eventually getting back up because of a line from the beginning of the film. Finally, the plot wraps itself up nicely and ends happily ever after, the end. Any side characters are then milked for money from then on out. I say this because Illumination, the studio behind Sing, as well as Secret Life of Pets, Despicable Me, and The Lorax 2012, have fallen into this pattern so much it hurts.Lots of people like to proclaim that Illumination Entertainment are the next Disney. I like to think of them as the reason the next generation of humans is screwed. The minions are literal demon hell-spawns, they ruined the wonderful story of the Lorax, and when they had the chance to redeem themselves with Sing, they bombed. Badly.When I first saw the second trailer for this, I was hooked. I fell for the bait, hook, line, and sinker. Then the third trailer came out. All the hype went away faster than I could blink. The wonderful moments that looked like quality cinema that were in the second trailer disappeared, and in its place were bad jokes and dated pop songs. And boy does this final product show it.The best summary I have for this movie is that it's Zootopia with half the budget, ten times as many songs, and none of the great characters, writing, or morals. So if you like music numbers, here you go. Oh yeah, and plot holes and missed opportunities as far as the eye can see.When the monkey gang emerge from the sewers to get to a getaway car, they hear the police and immediately run from them... into the open world and not down the sewer they came from. During the final concert the llama banker tries to shut it down and kick everyone out. She says she's calling the police. We never see the police show up. The monkey's father breaks out of jail and gets chased by the police (so that's what they were doing...) in helicopters. He hides behind a sign, but then they fly right by him, and despite him being in the open for them, they just fly right past and do nothing. The father monkey eventually meets up with his piano playing son, and pretty much just says ""I'm proud of you, are you going to visit? K bye.""Before writing this I saw several reviews saying this was ""fun entertainment for the kids!"" and ""they didn't stoop so low to include body humor!"". Nope. There was a fart joke literally halfway through the movie. And if you want to entertain younglings, please let them watch Zootopia. It is an infinitely better movie, and better yet it'll make them think way more critically than just ""YAY I LOVE TO SING!""",Sing
117,blazedounal,Best movie for kid,10,21 March 2017,"I was so utterly impressed, never got bored and thought it was a kiddie movie, never not wanting to hear the next song. Starring the film was an all star cast, too many to name and they all did a spectacular job singing and acting, the main star that gave me goosebumps singing was Tori Kelly, she can sing the house down. Sing is best movie for kid.In a world of anthropomorphic animals, koala Buster Moon owns a theater, having been interested in show business since his father took him to his first music show as a child. Following financial problems brought up by the bank representative Judith, he tells his friend Eddie that he will host a singing competition with a prize of $1,000. But Buster's assistant, Ms. Crawley, accidentally write $100,000.Animals from all around the city gather for auditions. Those selected include: housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; street musician mouse Mike; mobster's son gorilla Johnny; and punk-rock porcupine Ash. Shy teenage elephant Meena bombs her audition out of stage fright, while Ash's boyfriend Lance is dismissed from the contest. Rosita is paired with another pig contestant named Gunter for a dancing routine. Although Buster discovers the flyers show a prize of $100,000, money he does not have, he remains optimistic. Buster convinces Eddie to arrange a visit with Eddie's grandmother, former opera singer and theater actress Nana, to persuade her to sponsor the prize money. She is hesitant to contribute, but agrees to see a private screening of the show.Encouraged by her grandfather, Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance, but becomes his stage hand instead. When some of the other acts quit, Meena is added as an act. Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, having been distracted by her parenting duties that have fallen into disarray. After discovering Lance with a new girlfriend Becky and evicting them from her apartment, Ash is heartbroken and in no state to sing her assigned song ""Call Me Maybe"". Johnny is torn between having to help his father as the driver of the getaway car. When Johnny tries to do both, he does not show up for the planned pickup, and his father and his gang are arrested. Meena does not get any help overcoming her stage fright, and Mike, certain the prize money is as good as his, buys a fancy car to impress a girl mouse, and fights a group of bears in a card game at a nightclub.The day of the screening, the bears interrupt the show, demanding the money from Mike, who in turn, points to Buster. The bears open the chest containing the prize money, but it is nowhere near $100,000. The glass tank full of luminescent squids that Buster got to light up the theater breaks, and floods the theater, which then comes crashing down. With the lot repossessed by Judith, Buster, who had been living in his theater's office desk, takes up residence at Eddie's place. Buster tries to start over by opening a car wash, using the same bucket that his dad had used to earn money for Buster's theater.When Meena goes to the theater's rubble lot and sings Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"", Buster hears her and is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money. They perform in front of Rosita and Meena's family members. As Rosita and Gunther perform ""Shake It Off"", more animals are attracted to the scene as the show is broadcast on the news. Johnny's rendition of ""I'm Still Standing"" impresses his father, who then escapes from prison to reconcile with him. Despite interruption by Judith, Ash sings her original rock song ""Set It All Free"", impressing Lance. Mike returns when his peers make fun that he was not able to sing like the ones on television and sings ""My Way"". Meena finally overcomes her fears and sings Stevie Wonder's ""Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing.""The show becomes a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. Nana buys the lot, and the theater is rebuilt and reopened.",Sing
118,infoalwaysacritic,Tremendously Uplifting Story,8,2 April 2017,"There are times when a thought provoking, challenging story, will be a catalyst to a new way of thinking about a topic; but it's not the only way that happens. Sometimes a story that changes ones paradigm is one that warms the heart. It's a deeply personal experience, and that is what Sing gets right all the way to the finish.From the start, Sing introduces what seems to be too large of a cast, and their uncomplicated motivations. It is not subtlety that will delight the viewer, but then it is intended for a young audience, while offering something for the parent as well. Sing, however, knows its shtick and plays it well, providing enough background to clearly understand the major players and what is at stake for them participating in a singing contest.What Sing has to say is that people all have different motivations and different stakes tied up in personal expression, but when doing what you love and overcoming your fears, great things can happen. The relationships on screen are real enough to connect on many levels, despite their animal appearance, and visually the film maintains a fun bounce to it even through the tough parts.The story, while solid throughout, does have some hiccups, making some leaps of logic in order to setup some key conversations. If not for the predictability and these loopholes, this would be a must see. As it is, it's a very good story, told by an excellent cast. 8.5/10",Sing
119,Ben_Cap,An Animated Movie for Pop Music Lovers of Any Age!,7,11 January 2017,"In my opinion, the trailer for Sing was one of the best of the last year. I was captivated by the music and wondered to myself ""why has no one thought of this before?"" This is the first movie by Illumination Entertainment so I did not really know what to expect as far as tone and animation style were concerned and the best way I can describe both of these elements of Sing is safe. In a year with some really great animated movies, Sing was going to have to be something a little more than safe to stand out, but they may just have found a way with the music displayed.Garth Jennings, known for his adaptation of Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy and Son of Rambow wrote and directed Sing and as a big fan of both movies I had pretty high expectations for Sing, and some things lived up to me hype and some fell short. Sing has such a big and varied cast because of the nature of the story, it is an ensemble cast, which as first was a little unnatural, but eventually I cam around to the idea. The characters are well displayed and each have a very specific journey that they take while trying to win the 100,000 prize. While I like the multiple characters, I felt that the movie moved really slowly. It took a really long time to get the ball rolling and an even longer time to set up the third act.The voice acting in Sing is pretty unique in the way that not only do the voice actors have to voice their characters dialogue but also have quite a few musical numbers to pull off. Each character has multiple musical moments, while some more impressive than others, it is still an accomplishment for all of these voice actors. As I said before some of the performances were stronger than others and in my opinion Taron Egerton as the gorilla Johnny is the real stand out. I could not wait to check my phone in the car and see if he really had sung his parts in the movie and to my joy he had. The young man has quite a voice and we may have gotten a sneak preview of a star being born.The animation style of Sing was fairly basic for the climate of animated movies these days. Kubo and the Two Strings which used stop-motion animation, which is an incredibly difficult style for such a large scale movie, made you marvel at it as much as making you ask ""how did they do that?"". Moana pushed the line of computer animated graphics and did things with water that blew my mind. There is nothing really like that in Sing, and to be fair those are two tremendous movies to be compared to, but in that category Sing comes up short.What really got this movie a whole number score higher were the musical performances, particularly toward the end. The music in the movie is outstanding, and while the original song is not necessarily the best one in the movie, there are just so many great songs featured in Sing and almost all of the big performances were home runs. The music was also extremely varied in both genre and time period. I hope it will get kids into the music of Elton John and Frank Sinatra and hopefully get some of the adults to enjoy newer music. Overall Sing is a fun movie that shows a real love for it's main genre, musical, and even though it moves slowly, the themes and characters hold up and make the experience enjoyable.",Sing

Thanks to a mix-up by his assistant Ms. Crawley (director and writer Garth Jennings) about the prize money, there are hundreds of potentials. Animals that come to audition for a part in his production/singing competition include Rosita (Reese Witherspoon: Walk the Line, Legally Blonde), a very busy mum to 25 piglets and wife to Norman (Nick Offerman: Fargo, Parks and Recreation), Johnny the gorilla (Taron Egerton: Kingsmen The Secret Service, Eddie the Eagle) who is reluctant to go into the family business of stealing (much to his father Big Daddy's - voiced by Peter Serafinawicz: Guardians of the Galaxy, Sean of the Dead - chagrin), punk rock duo porcupines Ash (Scarlett Johansson: Lost in Translation, Chef) and boyfriend Lance (Beck Bennet: The Late Bloomer, Saturday Night Live), Meena (Tori Kelly: VIP for a Day, The Voice) the shy elephant whose grandfather (Jay Pharaoh: Ride Along, Saturday Night Live) encourages her to enter the competition, Mike the mouse (Seth MacFarlane: A Million Ways to Die in the West, Ted) a greedy and selfish sax player and several others including a giraffe and a group of five Japanese red pandas. After choosing which singers he thinks will perform the best for his show, he convinces his best friend Eddie the sheep (John C. Reilly: Step Brothers, The Dictator), grandson of famous theatre singer Nana Noodleman (voiced by Jennifer Saunders: Absolutely Fabulous, Coraline, young Nana Jennifer Hudson: American Idol, Dreamgirls), who he hopes may help fund the future of his theatre by helping him with the prize money.Paired up with another pig Gunter (Nick Kroll: Sausage Party, I Love You Man) a Lady GaGa wannabe, Rosita realises that her dance moves are not up to scratch, and worse than that, that no babysitting service wants to look after her 25 piglets whilst she chases her dream. Johnny has to negotiate a 'job' with his father's gang, Ash has to overcome her broken heart and Meena has to conquer her nerves. Is it all going to end in tears? This is such a joyous little film, from the first song we knew that the singers were going to nail it and once you get your head around the premise of Glee for animals, all ages can settle down to enjoy a talented cast deliver the goods.Due to a mix up, we had expected to see Passengers but as the only options for a replacement movie were 50 Shades (with my Mum, I think not) or XXX (not seen any of the previous films), we came to the film not sure what to expect. Because we were early, as we entered the theatre the credits were rolling and the previous audience leaving and a Mum with a young family came over to tell me that we were going to love the movie. She was not wrong.It was a happy movie and just what I think people may need in these uncertain times. All of the songs are a great mix of modern and classic and the moral of the film, if there is such a thing, seems to be to always follow your dream. Again, a sentiment we can all use. All in all a modern feel-good fairy tale.",Sing

Who knew that Taron Egerton had a voice like that? The film did do a good job of tying several different genres of music nicely to make this enjoyable musically. That is perhaps the only exciting creative part of this film.The story, however, was bland, flat, and boring. I don't quite understand how they could have missed the mark. To avoid any spoilers, I can safely say that the story is quite predictable-sure, some things happen that you wouldn't be able to guess-but, from the very beginning, you know generally what will happen in the middle of the movie, and what will happen at the end.Generally, predictability is typical of a children's film, which this is; although, it does play to the hearts of adults, by bringing in elements of the burdens of family responsibility and the stress of going into debt. However, in stellar children films, that predictability is out-weighed by brilliant humor, emotional connections with characters, and a feeling of sinking into the world of the film. Think of ""Cars (1),"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Toy Story,"" and ""Tangled."" Great films, general predictability, but an incredible script and a unique story line.This film, though, misses on so many levels. The characters seem to have neat backstories, but there is no depth to any of them. You can only barely connect to the characters. It was so disappointing.It's a good movie to have on in the background, but beyond that, it really isn't worth it. It really could have just been so much better.",Sing

This is a fun and entertaining animation for the whole family. Matthew McConaughey voices The lead character, a Koala named Buster Moon. And he does an amazing job putting emotion into the character. This movie has an outstanding soundtrack, with music throughout. I found all the animal characters to be fun and unique. Keep an ear out for Tori Kelly's Character, an elephant named Meena, her voice is amazing. A great film for little kids, or big kids. Sing Movie #sing",Sing

136,topeka_brooks,"I laughed, I cried",10,17 January 2017,"Best film of 2016, and we've had some good ones this year.The film is a kid's flick, and family entertainment. But if you can get past the excellent CGI, and the juvenile aspirations: Sing sings to the heart of everyone who has tried to overcome a doubting Thomas.Got a boyfriend, or girlfriend, wife, parent, or boss who doesn't believe in you?? ... You will understand the film and its inspiration.A few criticisms are in order, but as it's not my job: Who cares? I loved the flick, and I only wish Hollyweird would do more films like this one.Those who do not see the film under the misapprehension they will see nothing more than another Disney film for kids are missing a rich treat celebrating both theater and talent. And a lot of pop music.",Sing
137,jakep3,So Good,9,6 March 2019,"This movie is great. My daughter loves it (which means I've seen it four time already), and you know what? I'm not sick of it yet. The story and characters are good, I love a story that works out but not the way the players expected them to.But where this one really shines for me was the animation. Nerdy, I know. But watch the reflections in the car doors, the bottles of olive oil in the grocery store, the water, the hairs on the animals. It's those near perfect little details that are quite an achievement in realism.Definitely worth at least one watch.",Sing
138,zbsdeizux,Wholesome,8,4 January 2021,"First off: acquiring the music rights for this movie must have been an ordeal. There were many hit songs on the soundtrack, including but not limited to ""I'm still standing"".I love that the movie is so wholesome - it's family-friendly, fun and transmits the message that music connects people and you can make your dreams come true if you believe in them. It doesn't matter if you're big or small.The characters were excellently developed, you can tell this wasn't an amateur job. I love this movie and have watched it multiple times. It makes you feel good and sing along - and don't we all deserve a little happiness?",Sing

140,deideiblueeyez,Plays its tropes well,7,18 April 2017,"This film isn't unique nor is it out-of-the-box, but it plays its tropes and clichés perfectly, making them so much more enjoyable than I thought they'd be. Pretty much all the characters are likable, their family lives are relatable, the soundtrack is on point, and the voice acting is superb. Even though it's a vehicle for catchy pop songs, they're GOOD pop songs, darnit. Though I don't see myself seeing this over and over again like I would for Zootopia, it's something that you'd and yes I'll admit it was heartwarming for me at the moments where it was supposed to be and I smirked at a few funny moments. Like always, Seth MacFarlane has a great voice, as does everyone else. Oh just watch it, it's not going to kill you. I thought it would, I thought I'd find it droll, but I actually got into it and I loved it. My little siblings love it too. It's a great family film for the car that'll have the little ones singing along with it.",Sing

I feel like this is second part of Zootopia though their is no link in story.

The best part of this movie is you can watch it with family and friends as this movie contains no profanity. Overall I had a great time watching this movie.",Sing

145,pbartbar,Had my doubts but.....,10,6 January 2017,WOW! I had my doubts before going but it was a family event with our daughter and her husband and our granddaughter so I went. All skepticism disappeared in the first 5 minutes of the film. All I can say is the singing sent chills up my spine and the character voices were phenomenal. This is definitely an uplifting movie. The animation was as good as I have ever seen in a movie and the story line was something you could expect to see in the real world so it was very easy to get into. Some of the actors doing the voice overs I have never heard of but they were fantastic. You cannot go wrong seeing this. We will definitely be buying the Bluray when it comes out.,Sing
146,shaht-16429,Well produced musical numbers and fast direction can help overcome a predicable story and troublesome flaws in character and story lines,7,26 April 2017,"Sing tells the story of a struggling theatre owner, Buster Moon the koala (McConaughey) as he tries to save his theatre by producing a singing competition which comprises of acts by Mike the mouse (MacFarlane), Johnny the Gorilla (Egerton), Rosita and Gunther the pigs (Witherspoon and Kroll), Ash the porcupine (Johansson) and Meena the elephant (Kelly). Each of them want to win that prize money of $100000 that Moon has allegedly promised the winner, however a large numbers of setbacks and misdemeanours from Moon and other characters almost prevents them from producing a selling show. There are a few qualities that set Sing apart from the rest of the crowd musical comedies about an amateur coming out on top. For example, instead of focusing on just one characters aspirations and problems, it will show a myriad of characters all hoping for the same dream of stardom so it keeps the audience guessing who the main character is, this is achieved through some smart and fast direction. The focus will sometimes zip throughout the city of which these characters live in this gives a helpful introduction. This kind of rapid editing and camera-work would not be possible if it were not an animated movie. And it works because it speeds of what would be a slow intro without letting the viewer feel tired or bored because there is almost always something captivating on screen, be it a scheme made to send flyers, a contraption to keep a household in order or a number of large scale music productions/covers.The music in this movie is done spectacularly done, everyone in the cast did an excellent job. In particular, Taron Egerton (Johnny) for his rendition of Elton John's ""I'm Still Standing"" and Tori Kelly (Meena) for her rendition of Stevie Wonder's ""Don't You Worry 'bout A Thing"". If I did have a problem with their music it would be their choice of song, I wish it was more pertinent to their struggles as up and coming singers, Scarlett Johansson's song was but not necessarily any of the others. There was really no focus on the characters personal struggles, and I feel it would have helped flesh out their characters better if they had more of a motivation than just wanting the prize money.Ultimately what this movie suffers from is a feeling of familiarity. Each respective character has seen their story been played out in other better movies. For example, Johnny has a father that is disapproving of his dream, Tori is a talented singer with stage fright, Mike is a cocky but down on his luck street musician who ran into some troubles with bad people, Rosita is an overworked mother finally wanting to break out of her overworked lifestyle with a husband that present but not aware and Ash determination to live her dream interferes with her relationship with her boyfriend. Also the classic rags to riches story line is in play with Buster. The story is very predictable, there are only some surprises but some of them do not make much logical sense. And finally the character of Mike is just awful, if it was not for Seth MacFarlane voice performance and singing, this character would almost be unwatchable, he wasn't funny he did not learn anything in the end and often brought the supporting cast to its lowest ends.Sing will entertain children and families with its bright animation and diverse group of characters. Its fast and sharp enough to keep your attention and there are no terrible lessons to be learned. Viewers will probably remember its musical numbers and that is just about it, its characters and stories are just bland.",Sing
147,gornasa,Totally bonkers and awesome,10,20 March 2017,"I believe everyone else has already mentioned everything that's great about this movie, but I still want to say a few things. I'm 39 years-old but I absolutely loved it. I loved the hilarious script and the stunning design (you can't get enough of it), especially the looks and personalities of all the characters. If you pay attention to the details, you will be laughing out loud all the time. And what about the gorilla with an angel voice? What about Gunther the dancing pig with a German accent? What an amazing movie for both kids and adults! A real feel-good flick that reminded me of Zootopia because that one was also amazing and it also makes you totally happy inside. Nothing about Sing feels contrived or fake, it's simply an adorable story with great songs in it and lots of cute and funny stuff. I know it doesn't sound like a good movie the way I put it, but it really is. And I was shocked to discover the actors behind the voices - and I mean singing voices. Scarlett Johannson doing a rock song? That was a blast. And Taron Egerton doing the angel voice gorilla? Don't make me laugh, but oh my God, I want to have his record on my shelf yesterday. Everything about this movie was just right. It's unmissable. See it even if you're not a kid.",Sing
148,ashtree80,Hard to pin down,7,19 February 2019,"I decided to rate this movie higher than maybe it deserves, it's hard to say.The good points:
I thought the actual animation was beautiful and detailed. It is a very nice looking movie with bright, colourful, fluid animation.
I thought they featured an interesting assortment of characters, mostly likeable. It features characters I do not often see portrayed, and I cared about them. I even cared about who would win.
It was fun.The bad:
the story. It goes everywhere and nowhere. A lot of things do not get resolved at the end. It is a very unsatisfactory ending. The pacing is a little weird. There are too many threads and too many different subplots to care about. Some plot events don't make much sense. SPOILER:
consider the water damage that destroys the theatre. Why? There was already a lot of conflict in the story. They crammed in this extra ""now the theatre is destroyed!"" conflict just so it could be quickly resolved. Why? What does that add to the story? It just felt like padding. And then he returns to car washing for one scene. What happened to that? The movie almost shames him for leaving his dishonest theatre work and returning to legal, profitable work. I know car washing is nothing prestigious but at least it is honest work. And how did he know Nanna's grandson? How did they meet? I missed that part. And what happened to the mouse at the end? He just gets away from the bears? And was there any point in Big Daddy escaping? Why? It's so stupid.!!*End of rant*
Yet, I found myself liking the movie. The music was fun. I liked some of the characters. It was bright and colourful and pretty. Maybe I should rate it lower....",Sing

150,nonsensehere,Too many story lines.,5,18 February 2019,"This movie doesn't seem very well put together. Personally, they ran with too many story lines and no clear end goal or resolves.They sorta tie things up with all the mini stories and main story but not in the way I had pictured. It is kind of an everywhere show with some cheap funny moments thrown in to distract us from the fact is was poorly written. Feels like they just wanted to make some money from the show. I am glad Netflix has it so I could watch. I will NOT be adding this animated movie to my collection as I don't feel it is up to par with other movies: eg.

152,RachelCop,"Kids would love it, but teens and adults not so much.",3,2 June 2017,"This movie isn't amazing, great or even extraordinary.Sing was more neutral/hate for me.So what's the plot? The plot is Buster Moon wants to open a theater the only problem is he needs singers but he only has $1,000 and he thinks that's enough to get enough singers. When the chameleon is typing in the reward money her eyeball falls out lands on the 0 multiple times making it seem like the animals will win $100,000 all the animals sign up but later to find out the prize money is $1,000 dollars. And when the animals do find out and his theater gets destroyed what do the singers do? Do they get angry because he lied? Nope. They decide to help him rebuild his theater. Like why?? How does that make any sense?Talking animals is nothing new, and singing is nothing new you could literally make these characters anything and the plot would remain the same. I don't find anything interesting in this movie, what's with the unnecessary fart jokes? I wasn't laughing at first but they were longer than they were supposed to, which eventually made me laugh. I'm usually not the biggest fan of fart jokes but when it goes on too long it gets old real quick. The only positive thing I have to say is the character designs I do like some of them but that's about it.",Sing
153,Faizel-R,enjoyable family movie,7,9 January 2017,"I did not intend to watch this movie at the cinema, but when I tried to book tickets for Rogue One the show had just sold out. So my expectations were not very high. The movie starts very slowly and you get an introduction to each character. You get a little snippet of their associated talents and a little bit of a back story before the finale.This is an animated feature from the Illumination production house, the creators of the minions. The animation is top notch and adds to the development of the characters. The story take a little bit of time to develop and there was a point where I was almost bored, but this movie is much better than ""Minions"" and ""Despicable Me 2"". The soundtrack and the closing is what really makes it.So overall, it is a refreshing offering for the festive season and an enjoyable family movie.",Sing
154,gorillaz-96353,Steve's Film Page on Facebook,7,14 June 2017,"This film has many clear strengths, but Sing is also obnoxious. Illumination films are habitually and continually weak in their plotting and pacing. This is a fact they are well aware of, because they lean on their talents in other areas to balance this out. Also, some of the characters in Sing are terrible. Mike is disturbingly bothersome and rebarbative. He's Seth MacFarlane's Ted, but instead horribly unlikable. His only purpose is plot advancement and that could have been easily incorporated into another character, perhaps the equally awful Buster Moon. McConaughey did a passable job, but I much preferred him in Kubo and the Two Strings. His character was poorly written and it came dangerously close to hindering the messages of the film. With that said, Illumination protects their flaws. They provide enough characters and character development to disguise their mistakes. Some of these characters, while common archetypes, are done quite well. Meena and Johnny are great additions to the story, among others. This studio also puts forth consistently strong animation. And, despite the poor plotting, there are some truly powerful scenes. One in particular was the disaster that occurred with the theater. That entire sequence was great and memorable, and there are several more examples. I said this film was obnoxious, and it is, but I still find myself going through the desired emotions. I felt a little guilty, enjoying it so much. It was overlong, but the character development was worth it. I was emotional for good reason with this film. How can I fault something when there is a smile on my face and water in my eye? It didn't overcome every obstacle, but it didn't really need to. 7/10 — ￼watching Sing.",Sing

156,areinhol,Pure fun well done,9,5 January 2017,"Computer graphics has reached the point where talented animators can produce any image or action on the screen that they can imagine. The imagination of Sing's creators seems boundless, sustaining a hectic pace of gleeful inventiveness that never lets up. There is stuff you glimpse out of the corner of your eye that must have taken someone weeks of work to create, that might even be good enough for a film of its own, but its gone in less than a second.The story line is an old one, a bunch of amateurs putting on a performance, but the energy of the animation and the cleverly thought out bevy of performers, who all share a deep love of music, make it fresh and engaging. How many really new plots are there, after all? If going to a movie that is just pure fun is something your might be ashamed of, this film is not for you.

The animation is really good and all the characters are very endearing, especially the protagonist, Buster Moon. Plus, we're listening to beautiful voices all along the movie.There's a great story and we immediately share Buster Moon's troubles and hopes. I enjoyed following all the main characters' lives in parallel, it creates a different perspective on the situation and the way things are happening. The message behind it is clear: you should do whatever you are into, follow your dreams and never give up. You have to fight until the very end, and then you will achieve big things.

161,soroielijah,"Not too great, but not the WORST movie ever.",6,9 January 2017,"I really enjoyed this movie! The music is fun and enjoyable, the characters are actually really likable, and the animations and shots of the movie are really good.That being said, in my opinion, it feels like a cash in on Zootopia's success, since both movies have similar concepts and ideas. Certain aspects of the movie could be easily fixed, but remain pretty out of place.For example, the beginning of the movie chucks exposition at your face like nobody's business. It starts with the protagonist, Mr. Moon, and narrates his story in a way. Soon, about 2-4 minutes into the actual movie, it starts quickly doing extravagant cuts to other houses and places to introduce one or two new characters and their arcs. They elaborate for a minute or two, and jump to another character and shows who they are. This issue resides in other parts of the movie as well, because throughout the middle of the movie the characters go through some drama that builds, but once you begin to get invested another character is focused on instead. There are so many characters and side plots that this gets distracting easily. Especially if you take a liking to one character and their specific side plot. There also seems to be a bit of a wall between the groups. There is a character who is a mother and a character who doesn't spend good quality time with his father, that could have made for an interesting interaction. But no, unfortunately every character has a different problem, so the characters don't interact with one another too much unless they're in the same group of singers or something. Luckily, the characters are likable enough to get invested in their story, and you really do begin to like them throughout the movie. It helps amend some of the issues with the sequence of events.spoilers - A few small issues: The fox girls who sing Japanese music can get tiresome. They contribute nothing much, except comedy, and even that isn't too good with them. They don't need to exist. Also, with the gorilla's father, when he goes on his way to track down his son at the theater near the end, it feels really out of place. In the middle of a nice song they cut to a gorilla running away from the helicopter just for him to show up, give his son some props, and leave. Probably to get arrested. They really could have handled this better.But, otherwise, I really find this movie to be enjoyable if you can look past all that. The songs, characters, and overall plot of the movie keeps me somewhat entertained. It's enjoyable to look at, and its issues don't completely ruin the good aspects of it. I'd give it a 6/10.",Sing
162,ChrisB1986,A Generous Gift of Music,10,26 December 2016,"I give it a 10/10 and not a 9/10 because I liked the little white mouse in it who studied music/singing professionally. I liked near the end when he sang, ""I did it my way!"" I myself chose to major in music but didn't sing songs like that. At the beginning, he got upset that someone didn't give him more money singing on the side of the road. These animals all rushed to win $100,000 in a singing contest a big later on. Also, I actually went to a concert by Chris Mann, a great Phantom in the US tour of The Phantom of the Opera recently. He sang songs like that, as he was a major and sang in Italy.I thought the pig seemed nice but not as interesting as the mouse.The elephants were a little on edge.The koala was tacky sometimes but presented a nice idea of entertainment production.The assistant to the koala was mostly annoying until a point at the end when she was able to join in with everyone else rather than appearing weird. I think a lotta people possibly liked her, tho. She was a reptile of some kind.I didn't like how they put the dad gorilla in jail. He escaped to congratulate his son singing then went back to get locked up and told him to visit.I didn't really like the 3 bears attacking the mouse for cheating at a game.I must say I think it is a statement by people who could care less about singing on YouTube saying they're better cuz people who love music use YouTube to post themselves singing. You would probably know for sure if it was wrong cuz YouTube can sense it. I've never seen that you cannot post karaoke online. I just don't watch things if I can buy the exact same thing unless it's posted by the original artists. The reason it relates to the movie is because of the property issues, which were pretty big in a way.This movie also expressed shame in those who love singing.",Sing
163,jack-davy,Let's Not Get Carried Away Here..,4,28 January 2017,"Okay, so I am very confused here as to how this film is so highly rated.The animation itself and the sound design and music etc, is very well done. But considering its predecessors ('Illumination Entertainment') are Despicable Me & Minions, we have come to expect this high level of professionalism.The film as a whole was underwhelming and felt very flat. Twenty minutes into the film and the story was already very much underway and much of the 'laughs' - sorry, ALL of the 'laughs' - I had already witnessed from the countless trailers and adverts I have been subjected too since they were released about five months ago. Hence, by the time the film was finally released (Jan. 27th - UK & Ireland) the jokes were neither funny nor interesting and I was very bored.Moreover, the cinema packed with children and their tired parents let out VERY few laughs for the jokes and throughout the film, it was relatively silent from the audience. I could almost hear the children shuffling in their seats, eight rows behind me.The characters offered nothing new and it was a happy ending for all. Which confused me even more seeing as the obnoxious mouse got away Scott-free with his slutty mouse friend in his snazzy red sports car, paid for by the money he stole from the bears by cheating at poker.WHAT MESSAGE IS THAT FOR CHILDREN?!I have no idea. I have NO idea.Bottom line, the film suffered from being over-hyped, bringing us nothing new and a theme that was very confusing. The songs used were performed well and I appreciated the concept of the animated-take on today's singing competitions. But let's not get carried away here, the film is just about average.",Sing

165,hoejianwei,Just listen to the soundtrack,4,28 December 2016,"This is a film meant for kids, so I went into the cinema expecting simple plots and low expectations. However, this film has a boring plot that is too simple even for kids. I felt like there isn't even a plot for this film and they just added in covers of famous pop songs (some original songs) here and there randomly in the film and the songs didn't even flow well. Though there are some good singers in the film (Scarlett Johansson and Taron Egerton), but there are some really bad ones as well. Reese Witherspoon and Nick Kroll absolutely can't sing, although that is understandable as they are there for comedic purposes. I felt like I was cheated of my money and time as the ending feels empty and off. However, there are great covers of pop songs in the soundtrack of the film and I felt that was the only good thing about the film.Overall, don't watch this in the cinema.

As an audiophile, I love to listen to music despite having pretty much zero talent in the realm, and this was positively a treat to listen to as I watched. While not super heavy on plot, it doesn't need to be. Let's face it, it's a kid's film and they aren't in it for the plot.

It's not only my best movie of 2017 but also it's my favorite movie of all time! This had really great songs and really great characters! The plot line was great and it tells you that you should not let anything stop you from doing something you love to do! You also have a feel for the characters since all the characters have had some trouble in their lives! Johnny for example is part of a gang who his Dad runs and he does not want to be in his gang because singing is his dream! Another example is Meena. Meena is always shy and can't sing in front of a audience and she tries to overcome her fear. My favorite character who I loved so much was Mike! (Played by Seth MacFarlane) Mike had such a great singing voice and I also loved it when he played his Saxophone! :D We got wonderful performances by Seth MacFarlane, Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlet Johansson, Tori Kelly, Taron Egerton and John C. Reilly!When I walked out of this movie, I was so happy to have seen this! I was just blown away of how awesome this movie was!

I appreciate the fact that the makers did not resort to toilet humor to generate laughs. The entertainment was clean. There were no unnecessary sexual references.I like kids movies that inspire and Sing managed to do that. It encouraged kids to get over their fears and try against all odds. All the characters were lovable and unique in their personalities. Movie also had some very good music. Length of the movie was just fine for kids.

My mum said that it was one of the best films they have ever seen and my dad is a CRITIC. I can still not believe some of the actors singing voices like Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy/Ted) as Mike the mouse. I never knew that he could sing that well other than a few family guy episodes. He is absolutely brilliant.Back to the film, I never got bored throughout the whole film as there was always something going on. I saw it in VueExtreme a couple of days ago and it was just amazing. The bigger screen and better sound made the singing just that much better. I would say it's for all ages.The characters stories were just so well thought out. Like Johnny, with him having to be in his dad's gang even though he just wants to sing. Or Meena, who just wants to sing but gets so scared. At first I didn't want to watch it, thinking it was just another one of those crap kiddie films, but boy I hugged my friends for inviting me after the film ended. So, even if it doesn't look good, go and SEE it because you will be surprised.To conclude, if you DON'T enjoy this film than SHAME ON YOU as it's probably the best animation I have ever seen other than maybe Despicable me 2.

It felt like the writers didn't think ahead as much as they needed to, and they just slapped some cliché characters with a theme and went from there. The cliché characters happen to be the greedy guy, the shy girl, the guy with dad issues, the teen, etc. The only character that I actually liked was Mike, even though he was a jerk.The movie felt really boring at most parts, I rarely felt interest or a liking in any character.

Although there were a couple scenes I thought that were funny, the movie is not creative or original. It is only around to make money. The characters are stereotypes that everyone can basically relate to. The character designs are too simplistic. The message of the movie is also simplistic.

I didn't hold up much hope that Sing would be anything other than a hyped up title which offers a sedate movie experience. I was wrong and I am pleasantly surprised at how good Sing actually is. The soundtrack is phenomenal and the characters are very well put together. The main character of Moon is just right, balancing raw ambition with generally being a nice guy. The bears were brilliant but the best part of the movie is at the end when the characters perform their chosen songs. It was witty, funny and filled with real ""buzz"" moments. The rendition of Rocket Man was superb. Take your kids to see this one on the big screen. You'll be just as drawn into this great movie as they are.",Sing
179,waynel-59765,Reminds me of the magic of movies,9,5 July 2021,"I remember when I first stumbled upon this movie. This came up as a YouTube ad and it completely captivated me. I thought ""finally a movie that I'm actually psyched to see"". I saw it on opening night and wow do I love this movie.The story is that Buster Moon, lover of the theater since childhood is now a struggling theater owner who's looking to get out of his financial struggles. He decides to host a singing competition. After an audition, people (or animals) from various backgrounds and with various motivations to why they're in the competition all compete for a chance to win $100,000.Now this sounds pretty run of the mill and your right, but the film is self aware of that. Now of course being self aware doesn't fix the issue of being predictable but at least the film is in on itself which I like. But the movie doesn't play out at all how you might expect with many twists and turns but an ultimately satisfying conclusion. If you expected this to be a simple story about a singing competition with a winner at the end, you'll be surprised to know that the film is so much more than that, and I'm so glad it is.So the storyline is fantastic but what about the characters? All of them are great and everyone in the audience will have a favorite character. I honestly can go on and on about our main cast but I don't want to spoil them for you, so I'll talk about a few of them. Johnny(Voiced by Taron Egerton), my favorite, is a kindhearted gorilla who's father wants him to be a criminal like him, but Johnny aspires to be a singer. He's my favorite as I can relate to him the most, as I see me and my dad in him and his dad, and his dream of being singer is simple sure but lots of people have dreams that some deem silly and that makes him easier to identify with. Mike, an egotistical mouse is not the nicest guy but honestly he's just fun to watch especially since he keeps to getting himself into trouble. I normally don't like jerk characters but he's a great example of the jerk you love to hate. And being voiced by Seth MacFarlane in one of his only other roles besides Ted, A Million Ways to Die in the West and of course Family Guy helps too. The man's a genuine talent and should do more stuff showcasing that.Every single character is great and all the performances from the film's cast in both acting and singing is right on point. Thanks to this film I'm a fan of everyone here and I look forward to seeing them whatever they do in the future.The animation is gorgeous especially since The Secret Life of Pets I feel didn't have the best character designs. But this one is leaps and bounds better. The music might definitely put some people off, I know YouTuber I Hate Everything hates this movie but everyone has a right to an opinion and I love the music and this movie to bits.It might not be unique and the plot might not be anything special but I'm of the belief that a film can be as predictable as it wants as long as the film is good, and I think it is. Not every movie needs reinvent the wheel, sometimes just a nice enjoyable film that makes you feel good is enough. The film is a crowd pleaser in the best possible way and reminds anyone that there's no dream too foolish or stupid to follow if you believe in yourself.Seeing this in the theater was so magical and reminded me how great movies can be. And I hope I can create that magic as well.I can't recommend you see this movie enough. You might not feel the same as me, but this movie will remind you just how magical movies can be. And we need that magic again.",Sing
180,donovanwyatt-50274,Sing!,8,8 April 2018,"I can carry a tune; carefully with both hands... but that's about it. I'm like most people who've got an ear for music but no talent for the singing; more than slightly obsessed with animated singing cartoons. But you can't just go throwing some tunes on screen and expect me to be all in. I've got standards, blame Disney and Pixar, you must hit me somewhere good and give me a reason to add you to my wall of animated singing glory (yes, I have a shelf of movies that all require singing to happen - sooooo).Sing has a back story familiar in the animated movie world. Anthropomorphized animals living in a parallel world to the human world going through life struggles with theme songs and musical soliloquies. But it doesn't feel like it's already been """"done"""" and the daily life and struggles in this town populated by animals provides a relatable background to pull you into the story without wasting opportunities for authentic and touching moments made more so by combining them with satirical hilarity and off-color humor - there a very good reason it's PG and not G.Buster Moon is a too slick for his own good theater owner who's living his life one step ahead of creditors and a final cut off notice from the electric company. Clinging to his dream has brought out the huckster in him. Buster voiced by Mathew McConaughey comes across more as unbelievably optimistic than shifty - trust me this character cuts it a little close to the ponzi-scheme runner edge. You've got the quirky (glass eye-having) ancient-as-all-get-out assistant who of course has our beleaguered theater owners back no matter how much things are falling apart or going awry. She makes a massive mistake (this is why copy editing is important before going to press, people) which becomes the secret waiting in the wings to drop the other shoe of disaster on Buster's head... or so you think.Each of the contestants have a mini-backstory that explains what brings them (or holds them back from) to the stage and there's something in each storyline to interest each movie go-er:You've got the rock chick Ash (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) playing second string to her boyfriend with delusions of rock greatness Lance (voiced by Beck Bennett).The talented stay-at-home mom Rosita (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) who put her career aspirations aside to marry and raise her (25) children and support her career-focused, completely tuned out husband, Norman (Nick Offerman).Smooth-talking street hustler and saxophonist Mike (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) looking to parlay his participation - an anticipation of winning the big prize - in the singing competition into cash that opens the doors to the life of status, luxury, and wealth he's intent on becoming accustom to.Street tough Johnny (voiced by Taron Egerton) son of """"smash and grab"""" gang leader Big Daddy (voiced Peter Serafinowicz) he's living - reluctantly - with both feet in the underworld and his heads in the clouds where the music's calling his name.Then there's Meena (voiced by Tori Kelly) sweet and shy with a killer voice and a huge case of stage fright with a little social anxiety to even things out.They're all here for different reasons. They'll be at least one you can behind. The secondary characters and scenes add color and flavor like any good animated movie should. The music is an ode to some of the best (and worst) popular music as to offer. There's a good enough mixed bag of songs from past decades (it's a little like name that tune with the song snippets) to hit the spot for all age groups. Honestly some of the best irony and hilarity in the movie are the song match-ups to animal characters during the audition process. It's well drawn and nicely paced to keep you interested and entertained. The story has its sad moments - let's just say I have mad respect for what Buster's dad did to raise the money for him to buy the theater in the first place - coupled with ridiculousness to keep it from being bogged down in the maudlin.This movie isn't trying to make you dig for deep emotions or push you to make sweeping philosophical changes to your life view. But it's got some down to earth and simplistic lessons about being honest, asking for help, owning your mistakes, and not giving up.Sing is part love letter to the shrinking world of theater and live music venues and a call to arms for going after your dreams and seeing your success as possible long after everyone else has written you off. It's equal parts simple entertainment and commentary into how we relate to ourselves and each other.It's not the best I've ever seen but it certainly makes my list movies I'll watch to adjust my mood without putting me through the ringer.An animated movie sprinkled with musical moments about a down on his luck koala trying to save his dream by hosting a singing competition that in turn fuels the ambition of other dreamers...that's totally what we need for the Holiday viewing schedule. Right?Why yes, yes, it is.",Sing

There is no single main character, instead there are multiple different main characters that each have there own small conflicts and stories that tend to be overbearing and downright unnecessary. The story tends to go all over the place often making very little sense and the popular music/culture does not make up for that, nor does it enhance the film or even really add anything new to the experience. I would've liked this movie a whole lot more if it were structured like a musical; having original musical numbers appear throughout the film that help convey the message and move the story along strategically. In reality, ""Sing"" seemed to take a reverse approach, simply throwing in well-known pop songs everywhere completely randomly. This movie left a lot to be desired and honestly left a bad taste in my mouth. Could've been much better.",Sing

Also, it mostly wasn't my kind of music (extra kudos for Ash for sharing my exact sentiment in-movie), and the story was clichéd beyond belief and - for me - all the jokes fell flat (esp. the one with the huge number of piglets that seemed to be a direct ripoff of Zootropolis/Zootopia/Zoomania.

191,christopherlopez-80891,Perfect for the whole family,9,29 March 2017,"This movie is awesome in every extension. I would recommend it for kids and even for adults and teens. The story is original and each character has a different story and the reason why they want to win the $100,000 dollars. Even Buster Moon has a different story . . . obviously. I've seen it in theaters and this movie started and ended up better than expected. The graphics are noticeably familiar, debited that's been made by the creators of Despicable Me (2010) and The Secret Life Of Pets (2016). Nevertheless, the director isn't always the same one who directed those 2 mentioned movies. However, at least the director of SING is the same person who directed the movie called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), which that's why this movie was in good hands anyway. The furry characters are almost like Zootopia (2016), but that doesn't mean Illumination's SING is a plagiarism of Zootopia (2016). As I repeatedly said, the story is totally original. Back to what I wanted to say all this time, Illumination's SING is one of my favorite movies I've ever seen from the creators of Despicable Me (2010). I wish this movie had a sequel where new singers or I should also say ""new characters"", to simply take this movie to the next level. What would you think of that, IMDb? Can you interview SING (2016) 's director to say if he thinks of making SING 2? :3",Sing
192,belindatagoe,Pretty enjoyable but feels outdated.,6,15 March 2017,"FINAL WARNING: BIG SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! If you're reading this review, you probably have an idea about what Sing is. Set in a city full of talking animals, Sing starts with Buster Moon, a koala who's been running his dad's theater for years. It's seen better days. To avoid selling the place to the bank, Buster Moon holds a singing competition, and several animals who are down on their luck sign up, looking to finally get their big break.One thing I liked about Sing is that it's a pretty uplifting movie. It's true that, when you've hit rock bottom, the only way is up! I think that's a pretty optimistic message to send to kids, given how tough life can be. Also, I enjoyed watching Johnny and his gorilla family, Mike, Buster, and Rosita and her pig family. They were the best characters in the film. Also, the animation is excellent, although that's to be expected these days. It's 2016. The days of badly animated CG movies are gone (I hope).I also liked how they resolved the singing competition. I was expecting one of them to be the winner. I didn't think that the theater would end up being destroyed in Buster's attempt to convince his colleague's aunt to fund the prize money for the contest. Something that poignant would convince anyone with weaker guts to give up. Instead, they had to pick themselves up, which is fine because everyone has to do that at least once in life. The theater's destruction didn't sway them from their passion for music and singing, and their second try ended up being their big break because they chose to persevere. I loved how everyone ignored the authority figures like the police and the banks in favor of the underdogs (i.e., the singers). So, I'll give Sing credit for making the characters take a less predictable and ultimately more satisfying path.Of course, there are some issues with Sing. There were some legitimately great songs like the one Meena sings near the end of the movie, when she finally overcomes her stage fright. But, I would've liked some more original songs. The movie has a lot of one-hit singles and pop songs that I've heard over and over again for months or years, like the ""Hey, I just met you"" song or ""I've been kissed by a rose on the grave"" or whatever the lyrics are. Animated movies that star talking animals and feature one-hit singles were cooler 10+ years ago. Sadly, the movie often becomes more about how many songs they can fit in than how well developed the characters are.That brings me to my next point about character development. The red pandas that showed up were adorable; with some better writing, they would've been great characters. Instead, they were the usual ""KAWAII! KONICHAWA! ANIME! J-POP!"" types. I don't think they even had names. It was a lazy, embarrassing gag. Whenever they randomly popped up, I cringed. Other than being boring stereotypes, they have zero influence on the plot. So, why are they even in the movie? No more ""Japanese are weird 'cuz they don't speak Engrish"" jokes, please. Enough is enough.Overall, this isn't the kind of movie that'll challenge you. It's not like Zootopia, where I was equating the discrimination against predators in that movie to the various types of discrimination that occur in real life. There's a real interesting social commentary in that one. Sing may have had a better ending than Zootopia did (very disappointed by that one's ending), but otherwise, don't be surprised if this movie is overshadowed by Zootopia for years to come. Sing is a simple, fun movie that's alright to watch after work. It's not groundbreaking in any way.",Sing

195,mrkgkaye,Definitely A Must See,10,3 January 2017,"I read some other reviews before posting my own, especially the ones that are rated less than 5 stars. I just have to say that Sing is a good movie that does not tie into any racial stereotypes nor does it enforce any kind of agenda. So those that believe that there are some sort of hidden message to Sing, is dead wrong.The plot is a bit interesting only because without the singing competition there is no way to connect the characters. But that is the thing, each character that is represented is going through something different that wants them to be there. It is exactly like Buster Moon says ""Do not Let Fear Stop You from Doing the Thing You Love Most""I found myself connecting to each of the characters emotionally, because i know that we have all been there at some point in our lives. The Adult Themes are much needed in Sing, because without them it would have just been another cheesy, second rate, kids film with no depth.You got:a tired, overworked, and under-appreciated pig mom, with 12 piglet children, who gave up on her dreams, while her husband is completely oblivious to her. A moody porcupine teenager who was selected over her boyfriend which she finds out later that is a complete jerk when he was ""cheating."" OK so the definition of cheating is weak, but he is caught singing with another girl in her apartment. The ""swift and conniving"" mouse guy who is only in it for the money, trying to hustle mobsters, but fails. All while living on his own standards.An Elephant teenager who is just too scared and shy to get over her insecurities to sing in front of others, especially when she has the family supporting her. Oh and the grandfather that helps her get the courage to do so, because of his ""birthday wish"" to see her sing and excel in life.And, my favorite, a gorilla teen who does not want to be like his father and not a part of his notorious gang who pull off a gold heist.",Sing

But enough of that, let's talk about the specific stuff (CLICK OFF IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET).What made me like the film was how the characters interacted with each other. Mike kept his selfish and inconsiderate tone throughout the film and totally dissed the characters, and got exactly what he deserved. My favorite character is definitely Johnny because his dad constantly said that he wasn't good enough. Johnny had no one to look up to and had every reason to be angry, but he wasn't. In fact, he was pretty happy and supported his peers throughout the show. He did an amazing job with the piano at the end and gets what he deserves when his dad breaks out of prison just for him. However, I was sort of disappointed when his dad pretty much just said ""I'm proud of you"" and left.Well, that's gonna wrap up my review. If it gets popular enough then I'll probably do a Cars 3 review in June.",Sing
207,wihry,Absolutely stunning,10,27 December 2017,"Enjoyed every second of it, the moment you look at any scene you are in, there is so much truth and beauty. Being an aspiring musician myself I can easily recognize the situations, the mindsets, the twists of action... and the model characters are so expressive and realistic to the very least detail-even if exaggerated. For the soundtrack - top of the top, the voices, as well as the playlist. With my rather skeptic approach I was not expecting such a touching show. I created an account here for the very occasion to say thank you - for the really good job.",Sing

209,mortalpeace,I Didn't Like It...I Hated It,3,14 August 2019,"This movie was boring and uninspiring. This film stunk of greed and lacked creativity as most Illumination films do.First of all, there was no reason why the characters were animals besides to appeal to the young audience. The animals functioned like everyday humans which was such a waste and could have provided fun, visual elements, and jokes to the film, like Zootopia. Not only that, in Zootopia, being animals was essential to the plot, as the film demonstrated a social divide between predator and prey in the city. However, that was not the case in Sing.Second, the comedy was flat, unless it was just me because everyone else in the theater found the jokes entertaining. The more I thought about it, there were no memorable scenes in the film as the only scene I remembered was the audition and that's it. The characters were boring, the setting was boring; everything was boring.Finally, this movie proves that to emotionally manipulate your audience is to make the characters animals, have them sing popular songs and, boom, you have created a successful movie. I hope and pray that studios do not learn from Illumination and create mediocre films such as Sing.",Sing

Starring the film was an all star cast, too many to name and they all did a spectacular job singing and acting, the main star that gave me goosebumps singing was Tori Kelly, she can sing the house down. The movie was a feel good movie and it had things for both Kids and the Adults to enjoy. Me and the audience laughed throughout and enjoyed the film, we even clapped when the end credits rolled. This by far to me beats ""Secret Life of Pets"", I thought ""Secret Life of Pets"" was an okay film but I was so disappointed. I Highly recommend everyone to see ""Sing"" when it releases in theaters December 21st.",Sing

215,yjkinson,Recycling Old Material,4,17 April 2018,"Universal must have been desperate in 2016. Though the concept of a bunch of animals going through a similar process as many vulnerable people do - with the likes of the X-Factor, The Voice, or Britains Got Talent and all those other 'Reality' (notice the quotation marks there) shows that basically repeat the same thing every season - take a breather... it doesnt work in this film. 
The story is shallow. A bunch of animal characters, non who you are led to care for, audition for the false promise of $100,000 even though we were shown prior to this, that they all just sang because they enjoyed singing.
Some get picked for the show others don't. No heart strings plucked for those animals who didn't get picked. No time to learn their names, well apart from a Giraffe whose name I've forgot already.
Love the fact the soundtrack is just a bunch of songs everyone's heard already over the years and how non of the songs have any connection to the characters. It's just like Suicide Squad, the score is horrendously unrelated to the film. Anyways it's the same reason why big name actors were brought in to voice act on this film. It enticed many people to watch it. 
This is a film for children, but I find that insulting really, Toy Story is for children but that has story, characters you care for, great original score and some high name actors even back then in the 90's.
It is obvious the film industry on a whole are only making movies to make money but it's just getting more and more desperate these days. There's barely any love or care in these sort of films anymore. And worst of all now that companies have tapped into the media they can promote the film through everything these days and have people believe it's a great film. Truth be told many out there believe it is. Maybe their children liked it. But many kids like just about anything like that. Doesn't mean it inspired them or taught them anything about life.
Anyways I'm ranting now and not really reviewing this properly. A mediocre review for a mediocre films. 
Just a bunch of old material recycled in the never ending cycle of milking the cow until its bone dry.",Sing
216,jakwieci,Much Deeper than I Expected,7,2 January 2017,"Movie Review: Sing Sing is a fun movie. The animation, the, singing, the characters, writing, dialogue is all fun.In some ways, that's a shame, because the movie, as is, has all the parts required to create a deep and sophisticated story populated with tragic characters. It would be too easy for a family movie filled with cartoon animals to be populated by goofy caricatures. It's not. Every character has a full, multidimensional life, with their own reasons for wanting to sing, and their own tragic flaws threatening to tear down their lives (and the for some the lives of others!) Having everything work out is a given, as it's a family movie, but a couple of tweaks, film it with human actors, and there's a powerful drama at play here.The characters really do form an ensemble, but the one holding it all together is Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) who is a combination dreamer/film-flam man. He wants to bring the world something beautiful, but he just can't.Rosita (Reese Witherspoon) plays the housewife who is over worked under appreciated and realizes it is crushing her soul.Mike (Seth MacFarlane) is a Vegas style star that has gone undiscovered. The moment his hopes get up, he lives the big life, which invites big problems.Ash (Scarlett Johansson) represents the true musician who's life falls apart as she sells out to be popular.Eddie (John C. Reilly) is Moon's layabout best friend who is spoiled and happy to leave a dull empty life, but discovers he does need more.Johnny (Targon Egerton) is the son of a thug, and is stuck between gaining his father's approval, and finding his own way in the world.Meena (Tori Kelly) is the shy singer who doesn't want to be a bother, but we all know has something special. (As a bonus, her elephant family are dressed in the same attire as Babar)Nana (Jennifer Saunders) is the yardstick for everyone else, the lonely former star who sees the world as lacking, and seems happy to leave the world to itself.That's a lot going on when they manage to squeeze in 60 pop songs, requisite fart jokes and a supporting cast that actually serve the story instead of presenting visual gags.The downside is that the movie is too serious for itself. There is no barrage of pop culture jokes, or 'cute' moments, or jokes for the sake of a punchline. The voice acting is great, the writing feels natural, the animation serves the story. Technically it's a great achievement. I would recommend seeing the movie. I don't see it becoming a memorable classic, rather a movie that people are pleasantly surprised to watch when they give it a chance.",Sing
217,BaxterCallow,Sing is Garbage,1,24 June 2017,"An admittedly glossy, but shallow, heartless, empty, and pandering mess of cinema, Sing is the 7th hit in a row for Illumination. Because with budgets as low as 631 million dollars, they'd really have to mess up to somehow make their money up and then some. While Minions is god awful, Sing seems to actually be somewhat liked by audiences. Who these people are, I have no idea. But IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores do indicate that plenty of people do very much enjoy the film, so let me try and explain to you why I think Sing is actually a terrible, awful, manipulative piece of crap. Have you ever seen The X Factor, and have you ever seen an animal? If you've answered ""yes"", you've basically seen Sing. Structurally, it has a bizarre setup, because there isn't really a single main character as there is...an ensemble of different characters who are all given just about the same amount of screen time, each with their own little side-plots that offer nothing more than vague stereotypes that all fit into the most trite movie clichés you could ever imagine. You have the Koala, voiced by Matthew McConaughey, whose business is struggling and desperately wants to succeed at his dreams of producing a popular show, because his dead father worked hard to get him to where he is now; There's the pig, voiced by Reese Witherspoon, who's a dedicated mother of 24, who never got to live her dreams of becoming a pop star because she had to look after her kids. Also, her husband works so hard, he basically ignores her. There's the arrogant mouse, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, who's undeniably talented, whose motivation is purely monetary. There's the edgy teenager/porcupine, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, punk rock rebel, who has dreams of becoming a singer and producing her own music. Then there's the shy elephant, voiced by Tori Kelly, who dreams of being a singer, but can't get over her stage fright, which keeps holding her back. Then there's my favorite, the gorilla, voiced by Taron Egerton, who dreams of being a singer, but is held back by his dad who's in a gang, who robs banks, and is a wanted criminal. Now, apart from them all having the same exact dream of wanting to be a famous singer, what do you notice about all of these characters? Apart from being plain horrible, you'll notice that every one of these characters represents a demographic with a stereotype. Young children have the stupid fat pig character, voiced by Nick Kroll, who's just funny and random. The mothers have the other pig character, who's a relatable mother and, wow, isn't it really hard being a mother? Edgy teenage girls can relate to the porcupine who's having boyfriend trouble, and hates wearing anything with color. Edgy teenage boys can relate to the gorilla, who has father issues, and also appeals to those who want to rebel against what your parents say. Shy and reserved people have the elephant character who also happens to have a really stereotypical black family? Then the remaining characters appeal to everyone else, purely because they're cute or because they have vague motivations as us. Point is, everyone is covered, I don't think there's a single type of person who's missing a blatant, simplistic, unsubtle representation. And this movie takes it to the next level, as well, by applying the concept to the very plot itself. Everyone dreams of being a pop star, it's why The X Factor was so popular. So adapting that idea into a movie makes a lot of sense if you want to capture the most simplistic, predictable, general audience possible. So, the majority of the movie is dedicated to animating a bunch of trendy pop songs, that everyone is guaranteed to know at least one of. The segment most people know from this movie is the ""funny"" and ""hilarious"" audition scene in all of the trailers. Come to think of it, this film is basically an hour-and-47-minute-trailer. It has about as much plot and character progression as your average trailer does. And you can tell that certain scenes were specifically designed to be workable into a trailer. You know what, I don't even need to explain. Here's some videos for u; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBe1hXRNi4g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiDMJ-MstqQ Your welcome...",Sing

It sounds familiar, because isn't that all of us. To seek to be someone who we want, rather than the misalignments that life leads us to be.I thought the show had plenty of opportunities to create actual dialogue, and to present actual problems in life, that one has to overcome, and to understand that not everything goes according to plan, but yet is what you make of it.One of such scenarios was of the elephant being made a stagehand, rather than allowed to compete on the show. It was a good chance to diverge and look into conditions that one might face in such situations, and how one could go about it- but in the next moment, the camel got hospitalised, she got a part in the show, and everyone is a-okay once more.You might argue that it's just a children's show, but than again, so are the movies from pixar, and in those movies, you actually walk away learning something precious.",Sing

It turns as a completely different movie. For Example Mike, the mouse, looks like a 50's ""bird"" voiced By Seth M. turns out to be and Argentinian ""rat"" voiced by some failed actor. I mean the direction changes, the casting changes. Everything changes ad it turns to be a bad copy. I will wait, to see it again with its Original sound track.

228,ciaoamicomio,A Pleasant Surprise and A Very Kid-Friendly Must-See!,9,3 January 2017,"Sing! was undoubtedly my favorite kid's movie of the year. It was lively and fun, without clichés and it was just a pure-hearted comedy. Unlike movies like Zootopia and Secret Life of Pets, it flows nicely as a comedy WITHOUT peril or scary images and is the true definition of a children's movie.To those who are obsessing about the rabbit's shaking their tails, THAT WAS NOT TWERKING. They were simply shaking their tails! And that scene was like, what? Three seconds? Seriously, STOP GOING CRAZY OVER A 3-SECOND CLIP. Yes, yes, they definitely shouldn't have put that in a kid's movie, but it goes over their heads. Or they just laugh at it. It's harmless. At least it's not violent or a jump scare.And to the people claiming that the movie is racist because of the gorillas, don't you think it's racist to believe that the gorillas are portrayed as African Americans with NO PROOF AT ALL? If anything, I would think the elephants, who were actually voiced by African American VOICE ACTORS, were portrayed as ""black"", not the gorillas, who are all portrayed by CAUCASIAN British MEN. As an African American, I found no proof at all that this movie is racist or that the gorillas portrayed black people.To gjzabala: I understand that today's songs are very bad compared to songs from the late 90's and early 2000's. But that is no reason to hate a movie just for showing some popular songs. Two older songs, ""I'm Still Standing"" by Elton John and ""Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing"" by Stevie Wonder were both older songs. I'm an introvert and I absolutely LOATHE dancing. I also think it's pretty embarrassing, but still, I like concerts and stuff like that. At least none of the songs were inappropriate. They were all positive songs that would convey good messages to children.",Sing

My daughter will sit and watch the whole movie, and she is only 11 months old. She actually will dance to some of the songs in the movie, like when the pig Rosetta dances in the grocery store.

230,harryw-22205,"Brilliant Animated Film, The Kids Will Love It",8,1 February 2017,"To kick start this review I must warn you; this film will, without a doubt, have you singing. We've all heard the songs on this films soundtrack from popular modern day singles such as 'Firework' by Katie Perry, to classic hits such as Sir Elton Johns' 'I'm Still Standing'. This film is a lot of fun.With La La Land also currently in the cinema, fans of the musical genre will be over the moon and will definitely enjoy this funny, innocent, feel good film. Directors Christophe Lourdelet and Garth Jennings have clearly thought a lot about the soundtrack hear with a good mixture of songs that will appeal to any generation watching. The voice actors do a great job with their singing, particularly Taron Egerton and Tori Kelly.The characters in this film are nothing less than delightful! They all have a wide range of interesting personalities that allows the film to succeed in delivering a range of thoughtful messages to the audience, such as expression and appreciation. All the characters are experiencing their own problems which some members of audience could relate with, for example family acceptance. Although all these characters have different personalities and problems, the one thing they all have in common is that they love to sing, something I found very eye opening.The thing for me that drags this film down is that some of its jokes are risky, too risky. Depending on whether you are quite a protective parent, some jokes in this film will infuriate you with obvious references to drug use and twerking. Sure chances are these sort of jokes would go straight over a child's head, some will say that they don't think they are appropriate to have in a children's film which I suppose in understandable.Despite this criticism, I still highly recommend you take your child to see this film as they will love it and will be taught a few important life lessons whilst having fun.

231,kshannonfrolich,"Racist and Sexist, Extremely Offensive",1,21 December 2016,"BOYCOTT THE MOVIE ""SING""The movie ""Sing"", released today, was appalling. My friend and I walked into the theater, expecting to see a fun and easy-going children's film which quickly turned into a nightmare.The movie had countless racial and gender stereotypes, portraying the thieving gang as big black gorillas, Japanese girl groups as unintelligent and irritating, overweight individuals as insecure, rockers as teens in abusive relationships, Russians as villains, and Latina- Americans as overweight housewives with big families. Sexism was apparent when one character was ignored by her husband until dressing up in a promiscuous cat suit.In addition, most of the principal characters were voiced by Caucasian actors, despite the attempt to display a diverse community (through several species of animals). Many crimes included in the movie, such as thievery, gambling, and fugitivity, went unpunished. Masked by an effort to demonstrate unity through upbeat music, ""Sing"" is sending harmful messages, as the film is infiltrated with insults. While the intent of the movie may be different from its reception, it is an especially sensitive time for our nation regarding racial and gender issues. We must be vigilant by recognizing films such as ""Sing"" as offensive and disrespectful. They cause regression in the social lessons we try to instill in future generations.",Sing

I did not appreciate the casual, off-hand references to adult content. Twerking (when the bunnies are auditioning to a Nikki Manaj song, swinging their behinds at the audience and singing 'Oh my God, look at her butt'), smoking drugs (at a party/club one of the animals looks at an inhaler and asks ""What do you smoke in this?""), and the underlying fact that one of the animals is living with her boyfriend.

Pixar used to make great films but after the death of Joe Ranft, they have lost the edge they had. Dreamworks tries too much and over do everything and Disney only makes musicals (pun). but SING is no musical. yeah, it features songs but it is not a musical. and there is an amazing amount of subtlety in the movie such as the scene when Meena brought the house down literally through her performance and the backdrop falls and we see the real MOON behind Meena as if the universe is also excited to see them perform. very charming. very uplifting movie. if need to do something and just don't think you have it in you then watch this movie, it will give you the right amount of juice to get up and get it done!

I was surprised that the movie got a high rating at IMDb (>7), ""what the hec"" I said; I will just see it. From the 1st five minutes I was attracted to the amazing characters and the plot. It was a totally different experience to me than any other movie; I literally burst in laughter in some scenes and cried in others; my feet were dancing whenever they sing a song and it all reach a breath-taking climax at the end. The plot brings amazing background story of each character and dramatically shows us how they all overcome their troubles to reach their goals. You should see this movie and enjoy the music and the character development. I rated it 8",Sing
250,vincentsadiasa,I loved it!,10,16 January 2017,"This is my first time to post a review here in IMDb! I think Sing deserved my first review. I've catch this movie last Sunday with a friend. Actually I'm torn between La La Land and Sing which to watch first. I decided to go and see this movie. I'm a big music reality- singing-competition fan and this movie just hit me right on both eyes and ears. Also, I loved Tori Kelly and never thought that Taron can sing well. I admire each character stories but my favorite was Ash (Scarlett). I can't wait for its Bluray so I can watch it again. I don't get why others don't like it. Its not that bad as what others think of it. In fact I loved it.",Sing

I laughed, cried and cried again. Frank Sinatra ""My Way"" screen was a tearjerker. Johnny's dad finally realizing his son's talent was wonderful to watch; Meena finally coming out of her shell and blowing Mike away was inspiring. I will definitely be taking the kids again to see this movie, it was so good no one wanted to go to the bathroom (:-).

The music in the show is excellent and quite diverse. There's everything from classical crooning songs to teenage pop songs. There's the shy reluctant character who ends up stealing the show. The animal characters are charming, and there are the token ""bad guys,"" and some really, really good characters. Big dreams and hard work are themes that are woven throughout the movie, and something that every parent hopes that their children understand. My three year old grandson and my 6 year old grandsons sat spellbound throughout the movie. They both said that they liked it better than Moana.

If you are smart enough the people you cheat and steal from can't touch you. I like the understanding the boy and his father came to. I've usually found that a good movie focuses on conveying a good clear theme or message and this one was kind of all over the place with weird conflicting messages.

261,nick-dedalus,Scarier than a horror movie - the biggest insult to music I've ever witnessed,1,8 April 2017,"Sing depicts an animal society in which the art of making money and writing music are the same thing. Where art directors take pride in admitting they know nothing about art. Where angry teenagers who wants to rock their confusion out of their system are told to dress like princesses and dance like teen idols in order to become ""rock stars"". Where a former successful theatre's only chance to survive is to put on a TV-like talent show where no one learns anything except that all the promises they've been made are nothing else than an old chest full of junk. The clear message behind Sing is so largely accepted by society nowadays as the ""real thing"" that it doesn't even need to be hidden with metaphors and is this: ""Don't even to try to be yourself. Instead, put all your talent, effort and ambitions in trying to become exactly what the paying audience wants, because that is your only chance to escape your miserable life"".Nobody should watch this movie, for no reason, ever.",Sing

Sure those are the thoughts in my mind, but why hands are shaking, why there are jellyfishes swimming in my eyes? Although there is the most clichéd routine, and the most nonsensical plots, but with the earnest production and the performance with the true heart of every filmmaker, animator and voice actor behind the scene, there is a film provided to us, beyond compare. As a foreigner, I think those maybe the one reason why the US is great, the children in the auditorium are cheered for the roles, with the audience in the film together, when the film about ends, and then the adults are cheered with children, too. I think after years, when those children grew up, there must be someone who will always remember the night he/she had been planted a seed in the heart, named DREAM. This film is similar to La La Land, but still different. On is the love story for adults, but another one is the modern fairy tale for young and old. The only thing there are same is Dream, the eternal topic of human being. 1 point for Dream, and 1 point for cheering audience in the auditorium. 7.5/10 highly recommended.",Sing

I had recently seen Zootopia and Pets, both animated movies set in worlds full of solely animals, and had similar expectations. Sing, however, had much more of a plot than I had expected. The animals go through some real issues and struggles faced by people who own small businesses or businesses related to fine arts. This is a good movie to take the kids to as it is animated, full of songs, and family friendly in its humor. The outstanding cast full of big names in the must industry makes the movie more inviting to parents as well. Overall, this movie was worth the watch.",Sing

By the trailer alone, I could tell that this was going to be captivating due to the fact that it was not animals singing but familiar voices as well! They also sang current songs and some older songs during the audition portion but I believe that was truly them catering to their audience and they hit the nail on the head with that one. Each actor/actress delivered for their character immensely and I was shocked to see that a few of them knew how to sing! The beginning was...interesting. It caught my attention (the voice and not so much the sheep) but I was glued once the main character began to speak about his present life. The most exciting part of the movie was the lessons in it which was people will do what they want to do when they want to do it and never be afraid of doing what you are good at! I hope a sequel comes out soon!",Sing

I was about to rate it 10/10 but the last performance song made it 5/10. It drop all of the beautiful moods that had been build through out the movie. I am disappointed. I wish the ending song could be more powerful or given to a better singer. That could be a plash since this idea of animation, no-one has done it before. Good job on the graphic and characteristic for each voice. The movie still speaks up humanity and so much courage which is important for education.

The mother pig demonstrates how women need to stay in the kitchen. And Johnny.... my main man. Think about how much gold he would have if he didn't think about his Justin Bieber voice. Seth MacFarlane does a great job of being a mouse. He totally sounded like brain griffin. There is also of course the elephant. Ironicallyou there is an elephant and mouse in this movie. And the elephant was scared of the mouse the hell is that. But otherwise it's a 10/10 movie.",Sing

My kids (6 and 12) both LOVED this movie, as did I. If you don't like musicals, this is NOT for you. Sing contains a wonderful ensemble cast that draws you in and captures your heart. You find yourself routing for all of them, and your heart picking a favorite. Mine was Johnny. You cannot help but to route for him to break away from the messed up family he has and pursue his dreams.It draws you in from the beginning, creates character stories and plots to hold your interest throughout, and gives a wonderful conclusion in the end. Yes, that is the recipe for a typical (and successful) kids movie. My kids cannot wait for this to come out on DVD so we can have it here at home to watch over and over again.",Sing

One point I would like to make is that I would have liked to seen more singing from every character, like full songs not just them practicing. Going in I thought that is what it was gonna be like but it was not, from the trailers it looked like there would be more songs. I liked the development for each character even though there was too many that they really focused, they could have filled it with more time for other characters. It was cool that Seth Macfarlane was in the movie I knew before that he did sing I just didn't think he would be in a movie like this.",Sing

It's like pitch perfect and all stars combined into one incredible film you just want to sing along to. It is by the makers of despicable me and you can definitely tell in the quality and the humour it brings. The 3D version is incredible it is so well made you feel as if you are there with the characters I felt as if I was a child again. It helps show the true value of team work and friendship as well as that your dreams will come true. The film is great for all ages and I definitely recommend it I couldn't stop smiling through out it is much better than I anticipated and the cinema should be much more packed next time I see this film and I definitely do !,Sing

People pursuing their singing dream is no new topic, but when it is in the form of an animation, and all characters are animals, it suddenly gets a lot more watch-worthy. I love how this movie aim at all age group, not just children in particular. I even think that adults would appreciate this more as it talks about some serious problems when one insist on following his dream. Just like others have stated, this bears lots of similarities with La La Land, but more unreal, thus more satisfying for us audiences. One last point I would like to mention is the bomb cast! I was blown away when I found out Witherspoon, Egerton and Scarlet Johanson could sing that well. They sure added lots of charms to this cohesive piece.",Sing

It's a cartoon and it's not meant to have deep dramatic plots or spend hours building characters. It's meant to be a fun movie to let you escape for a couple of hours. This movie does that and much more. I thought this movie was great. I thought the music choices were superb and each one didn't ruin the songs by trying to re-invent them. This is one of just a few movies in my opinion that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. Anyone who hasn't seen it, trust me, you won't be disappointed.",Sing

This laugh out loud kid's movie is fun for the whole family. With its popular hits of today and very well- known actors such as Scarlet Johansson, Taron Egerton, and Matthew McConaughey this cast of voices creates a band of crazy singers. But on a more personal level, I came into this movie with a typical expectation of a kid's movie. But this film blew me away at some parts of the movie you actually start to care about these fuzzy little animals. At parts of the film, I saw myself cheering for some and feeling sorry for others. My favorite character was Johnny the Gorilla played by Taron Egerton. I liked this character because in my opinion, he had one of the most interesting stories. He comes from a life of crime but all he wants in life is to play the piano and sing. There's a part of the movie where Johnny's dad basically disowns him of being his son. As I was watching this I thought wow this is a very deep subject matter for a kid's movie. But in the end, this movie will leave you smiling and wanting more perhaps a sequel. As for my final review I give the movie a 5/5 I really enjoyed this movie and I can't find anything particularly bad about it. And I would definitely recommend this movie for all ages.",Sing

284,Fred1234567890,Singing to the Heart's Delight: Movie Review of Sing,8,17 October 2017,"The animated film Sing provoked audiences to SING along to catchy songs, tear up in times of trouble, and to rejoice when a character gains confidence. Sing was targeted toward young children, but the plot line, the songs, and the cast helped make this animated film a classic for all ages.The plot line taught children about moral compass. The story encompasses Buster Moon, head of the theater, trying to increase viewership at the theater by making a singing contest. However, mistakes were made when Miss Crawly accidentally pushes two too many zeros to make the competition worth $100,000 instead of 1,000 dollars. Unlike other movies like The Avengers that show a definite hero and a definite villain, Sing shows the backstory of all of the characters, and brings them together into one cohesive story. Ash, a porcupine in a one-sided relationship, and Rosita, who looks for a way out of her life with her many, many children, both come together to compete against each other for the singing competition. Johnny's family is part of a crime syndicate, and Meena is too shy to perform in front of other people, and they both come together to compete in the singing competition with Ash and Rosita. The character's stories come together as one and create the plot line of Sing. The plot line is not a hero-villain story; the plot shows the individual growth within each character and how others interact within the changes of the character. There are no villains except themselves. In a few ways, the villains of Sing is the characters themselves. Morally, Sing teaches children to never try to compete with others because it is unhealthy for mental health. They should only compete with themselves. When the characters were all fighting against each other, they would be mean and terrible toward each other. However, when the characters work together, the competition show becomes a beautiful show where everything flows smoothly. The plot line shows other characters influencing and helping other characters into making big changes, and the audience gets to see each character transform: Ash gets rid of her boyfriend, Rosita and her husband finally re-spark their romance, Johnny's father realizes Johnny's potential, and Meena finally overcomes stage fright. Thus, the plot line teaches children that they should not compete against other people, but only with each other, meaning the movie will be targeted toward children instead of adults. The songs were catchy: kids and parents alike will continue to sing the soundtrack weeks after watching the movie. From covers of Call me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen to Under Pressure by Queen, both children and parents can sing along since the songs covered are over a long time period, so everyone can at least recognize one. The soundtrack is quite diverse from modern songs like Shake it Off by Taylor Swift and Don't you Worry 'Bout a Thing by Tori Kelly, to originals like Set it All Free by Scarlett Johansson, these songs are sure to amaze. The placement of the songs really brought out emotions for the audience also. For example, when the band of animals finish the ""competition,"" they begin to rebuild the theater, one brick by a time, which Nana Noodleman begins to sing a powerful ballad: a mashup between Golden Slumbers and Carry that Weight by the Beatles. The placement of the songs evoke emotion from the audience, making the audience enjoy the vivid emotions of the movie. The actors and actresses voicing the characters are quite known to the public eye. Scarlett Johansson is known for her work with Marvel Studios playing as Black Widow, and also in the movie Lucy as Lucy. Reese Witherspoon is known for her roles in Legally Blonde, Hot Pursuit, and American Psycho. Tori Kelly is an actual well-known singer singing songs like Should've been Us. Matthew MacConaughey is also known for his work in Interstellar, and Seth MacFarlane is known for his work in Family Guy and Ted 2. Thus, this increases ethos in the movie because well known actors are cast into the movie.Therefore, the movie Sing will be remembered by both parents and children alike. The moral of the story is for kids to remember to never compete against other people, but to only compete against themselves. The songs were so catchy from different time eras that anyone could sing along to it, every grandparents. The placement of song really evoked emotion from the audience, making the audience fall more in love with the songs and the overall movie. The actors and actresses were so well known from other movies that their voices were recognizable. Sing overall was a great children's movie with great animations for all to enjoy.",Sing
285,wiseconnor,I don't understand,2,25 May 2018,"I do not understand how this movie has a rating like this. The animation is lazy, and the movie is full of stereotypes. They tried to include as many modern pop songs as they can (and a few older ones for the parents) to try to appeal with the three year olds the film is targeted to. It being for children IS NOT AN EXUSE FOR BEING LAZY. Illumination panders to young children, and put no time or money into their films to get their slimy hands on as much money as possible.",Sing

Illumination's at it again with a ""get rich quick "" scheme.",2,17 July 2018,"""Sing!"" is another half-baked Illumination film with little to no heart and soul in it. The film was made in 2016 and had mediocre animation compared to the other animated films that were made in the same year. To put this in perspective, 2016 was the same year that Zootopia, Kubo and the Two Strings, Moana, and Finding Dory were made. Sing's all around story and characters wither in comparison to the other movies as well. Just looking at one of the characters in the other, better films you can tell exactly what that character is all about. For example, I can tell that Nemo from Finding Dory is a young, naive boy. You can't do that with one of the characters from Sing, however. Overall, Sing is just a mediocre animated movie only enjoyable to young children, and brain dead adults. There is no way I would recommend this idiotic cash grab of a film.",Sing
