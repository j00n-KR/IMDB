0,TheLittleSongbird,Should be thrown into the bay and never watched again,1,11 October 2017,"Okay, that sounds rather harsh but to me 'Baywatch' really was that bad. The original series was not exactly great, was very silly and can be easily criticised, but it at least was from memory sort of fun and had some campy charm.Something that 'Baywatch' (2017) completely and utterly fails to do, it actually came across that nobody involved had actually seen the show and only heard about it. Really though, 'Baywatch' is better seen on its own terms and it even fails spectacularly on that front. Have said a few times recently that 2017 was a very hit and miss year for films (from personal opinion), 'Baywatch' is, to me, along with 'The Emoji Movie', 'The Mummy', 'Stratton', 'Fifty Shades Darker', 'Flatliners', 'Eat Locals' and 'Transformers: The Last Knight' one of the year's worst, and it's the worst of the lot.'Baywatch' has only one thing that's semi-decent and that is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, he fits his role well and at least tries to give the film some energy and charisma. All that effort feels wasted however because his character is so weakly written and his material even weaker than that.The rest of the acting is dreadful. Zac Efron's comic timing is completely lost at sea here and he fails to make his character interesting or likable. Then there's the supremely irritating Jon Bass and Priyanka Chopra portraying the single most insipid villain of the year. There are some lovely-looking ladies here, but their acting is sophomoric in vapid roles that never feel real, eye-rolling dialogue and in a few cases limited screen time. Alexandria Daddario is particularly wronged in all those areas. The cameos from the likes of David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson may have been intended to be affectionate and nostalgic but were actually neither, instead they were useless in cameos that were clearly shoe-horned in to provide some clumsy connection to the original series.Despite the near-uniformly poor performances, they are in all fairness saddled with everything else failing even worse than they do. The writing is particularly bad here in a strong contender for the worst script of the year, with dialogue that would even be beneath actors and actresses who can't act their way out of a paper bag and truly laboured and excessively crude jokes that throughout all land with a sickening thud than soar with hilarity. Just for the record, crude humour is not always a bad thing but it depends on how it's executed. Plus there are a lot of great comedies out there that make me laugh every time, so it would be unfair to accuse me or anybody else who hated the film of not having a sense of humour. The crudeness, dumbness and complete lack of taste are just far too much to stomach in 'Baywatch' to the point it's vomit-inducing, and there is no sharpness, wit or subtlety of any kind in a completely laughter-free and distasteful film.Nothing good to say about the story either, which is not just predictable but even more problematically it's shallow, not the easiest to follow and lifelessly paced. And before anybody defending 'Baywatch' screaming and preaching don't take it so seriously, please try and take on board that those who hated the film knew exactly what to expect and watched it expecting a silly turn-your-brain-off-at-the-door sort of film but got a film that took itself much too seriously to judge it on that front.It's a very cheap-looking film too, especially in the shoddy editing and obvious and abused use of green-screen. Even the scenery is flat. The soundtrack is forgettable at best and there is not a single interesting, fun or likable character, being either personality-free or annoying. As for the direction, what direction? All in all, awful way in every way apart from Johnson. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Baywatch
1,bkoganbing,Beautiful beach people again,3,17 September 2017,"I will say this for the film version of Baywatch. You can't say it wasn't keeping up with the times. Villainess Priyanka Chopra seems to be based on Ivanka Trump and those who paid to see this and rent this I think will recognize same. Dwayne Johnson steps into the role that David Hasselhoff did on the small screen, Mitch Buchanon mentor and trainer of lifeguards. He's getting a new recruit in Zac Efron former Olympic champion whose reputation for being too much a party boy has preceded him. His joining Baywatch is a kind of community service.On TV the Baywatch cast always got into things that had a most peripheral connection to the beach. Here Johnson says this is part of our mission. Which has him bumping up against real cops instead of how it was on TV.Priyanka Chopra is a fabulously rich woman with her fingers in a lot of pies and her objective is to privatize their beloved beach. I guess she wants her own little Mar-a-Lago in California. But the Baywatch crew will stop here no matter how many she corrupts.John Bass has a few moments as the goofy lifeguard with tech smarts and the beautiful boys and girls are there as they were on TV.I think the film would have been better had it played it far more straight.",Baywatch
2,Leofwine_draca,As cheesy as you'd expect,5,9 August 2019,"BAYWATCH, the film version of the cheesy '80s television series that nobody asked for, is a mildly entertaining and diverting slice of comedy and thrills that's better than it has any right to be. That this works at all is largely in part to the presence of The Rock in the main role; he trades on a lot of natural charisma here and elevates the material somewhat. This is good, because Zac Efron is merely slimy in support, and the earnest Alexandra Daddario still hasn't nailed her performances. The film suffers from a sub-par script which is far too reliant on tired AMERICAN PIE-style gross-out humour and juvenalia, although the crime elements are handled a little better and the direction's okay.",Baywatch
3,SnoopyStyle,I'm out,3,23 September 2017,"Baywatch is an elite team of lifeguards patrolling the beaches of Emerald Bay. They are led by their leader Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson), second-in-command Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera), and goddess CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrbach). Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass) is in love with CJ. He and Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) are two of the new recruits competing for a place on the team. Matt Brody (Zac Efron) is an arrogant Olympian who is forced on Mitch. Despite being only lifeguards, Mitch is constantly on the lookout for anything endangering his beloved beach. His unauthorized investigations lead to businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) who is corrupting politicians for her nefarious goals.I'm willing to give this a shot. Jon Bass looks like the last person who should be a lifeguard in the ocean. I assume he's supposed to be the comedian but Hannibal Buress would make more sense. The character turns into the tech guy which is his natural state in the first place. There are too many dick jokes. One or two do work but it's an overload. Zac Efron is pushing too hard into the unlikable category. He and the Rock are good comedic performers but the team needs an actual comedian. This stuff piles up but I'm still trying to give it a chance. Finally in the morgue, Matt jumps out of the drawers into the arms of the bad guys and I have to give up. It's too annoyingly stupid and it only gets stupider. Problem is that it's not stupid funny. The serious crime caper is badly written. It's all simply stupid. The joking gets less and less funny. Even the David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson cameo do nothing. I gave it every shot but the movie kept missing.",Baywatch
4,boblipton,This Is Definitely A Movie,5,15 January 2021,"It says here that Mitch Buchanan - Dwayne Johnson - leads his elite team of lifeguards. I have a hard time with that concept. Life guarding is a seasonal occupation for teenage boys to earn a few dollars. It lets them yell at children and develop a tan for the pretty girls. Although the requirements may have shifted, it's the equivalent of Pete, the Good Humor man when I was in grade school. During the winter, I seem to recall, he sold coal. I can't imagine any of these occupations as being skilled, let alone elite, although I imagine you need to have passed the usual Red Cross classes.Anyway, there's a murder, and rumors of someone selling drugs, and Johnson has to put Zach Enron in his place, and there's a ski jet sequence to some rap music. I don't recall the original TV show, which I never watched, but heard about occasionally, as being one that aspiring performers took to stretch their acting abilities and try to speak the words, trippingly off the tongue. It was about looking at good looking people in G rated sexy swimsuits. David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson have cameos. They were in the show, weren't they?",Baywatch
5,kosmasp,Expecting and getting,5,10 October 2017,"When I first read that the Rock would star in a Baywatch movie, I thought it was April Fools ... but it wasn't April 1st, when this was announced and hence a couple of years later, we get this movie. And while they proved that you can revive a TV show (21 Jump Street), this doesn't quite cut it.There's something missing overall. There are some funny jokes here and there and The Rock delivers as expected. There's also a no prisoner mentality to it. Plus a couple of cameos. You know you can't do Baywatch without the Hoff. But while he is generally out making money out of others making fun of him, some may not feel that does the show and its legacy justice. And some others just don't get the premature humor and really low IQ humor this is based on ... just be prepared. (btw. no nudity, not even in the unrated version, except for male genitalia that is)",Baywatch
6,BA_Harrison,Hot stars in a tepid movie.,5,27 April 2019,"Nobody watched the original Baywatch TV series for its meaningful plots or award-worthy performances; the same goes for this big screen version. Baywatch the Movie definitely works on the assumption that the viewer will be too busy ogling the cast's hot bods that they won't notice or care that the script is self-mocking trash that relies heavily on dick jokes.Having recently seen Wonder Woman, all the while thinking how much better Alexandra Daddario would have been in the role, I decided to console myself by watching the gorgeous actress in a tight swimsuit for a couple of hours. Delicious Daddario is joined by the equally lovely Kelly Rohrbach as blonde lifeguard CJ Parker. And for those into guys, there's the impossibly ripped Zac Efron as Olympic swimmer Matt Brody, and everyone's favourite action star of the day, Dwayne Johnson as Mitch Buchannon.While I admit to finding the dick gags amusing (I never claimed to have a sophisticated sense of humour), the rest of the film isn't anywhere near as funny as it was clearly intended to be, the action scenes are unimpressive, and the plot is mind-numbingly predictable (intentionally so, perhaps, but banal is banal). Thank heavens for the constant eye-candy, without which the film would have been much more of a chore.5.5/10, mostly for Daddario and Rohrbach, rounded down to 5 for that terrible scene with the burning boat, which features really bad CG flames.",Baywatch
7,tavm,The movie version of Baywatch was pretty enjoyable for what it is,6,31 May 2017,"As someone who never watched the TV show ""Baywatch"" but knew of its reputation as the fluffy, action series with a good-looking cast, I didn't have much expectations of enjoying this movie version with my movie theatre-working friend. Still, despite some funny raunchy scenes, I came to like the serious plot that permeated much of the movie and liking the way the characters were depicted most of the time. Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron give whatever gravitas to their roles as needed as do many of the supporting cast. And the cameos from a couple of the original stars of the series was also nice tributes from what I know about them. I'll just now say we both enjoyed Baywatch the movie.",Baywatch
8,sunwarrior13,"Bathing Beauties Galore And ""The Rock"" Saves It",5,20 November 2020,"Two movies released in 2017 were a remake of two popular TV series. One is ""CHiPs"" which proved to be a mindless and disastrous remake as I have indicated in my review. The other is ""Baywatch"". Will it be a disaster as well?Before we discuss that, let us discuss what the film is all about.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Zac Efron stars in ""Baywatch"" which happens to be a remake of the popular TV series from 1989 to 2001. In the movie,we get see the legendary life guard Mitch Buchannon and his team of lifeguards at the bay deal with a crime that is going to hit the beach from a ruthless businesswoman that has evil plans bad for the bay. Added to this mission,we also get to see the recruitment of new life guards.The TV series was obviously known for the bathing beauties that galore on the beach rather than its plot and storyline. The film makes sure that it provides numerous scenes of it not to disappoint the viewer particularly the fans. Also,we get to see the plot lines that are familiar of the TV series. Unfortunately,it tries to make an identity of its own through with elements of crude rumor especially with characters blatantly stating how erect their penises are whenever they see beautiful and sexy female lifeguards.But what saved it from complete ruins was the elements present in it such as the bathing beauties for which the TV show was known for. Added to that, we also see entertaining performances from ""The Rock"". Overall,these features managed to prevent it into becoming a disaster.",Baywatch
9,CinemaSerf,An object lesson in objectification...,6,1 December 2020,"Much as with the television series in the late 1980s, this is not a film with depth, characterisation, a cunning plot nor a pithy script. It's a film about good looking folks demonstrating that fact, clearly and succinctly. Sure, it's cheesy and infantile at times; but if all you are looking for is a piece of mindless escapism then what's to complain about? Dwayne Johnson has his tongue in his cheek as popular lifeguard ""Mitch"" who leads his team of scantily clad glamour-guards protecting the surfers of ""Emerald Bay"" and who all rub along nicely until the arrival of the cocky Zac Efron (""Matt"" - well, he's not going to be called Nigel, is he?) who has just bit too high an opinion of himself for the his co-bodies Alexandra Daddario (""Summer"") and Kelly Rohrbach (""CJ""). This film could never be accused of taking itself seriously offering just a hint of, though surprisingly little, sexual chemistry as the perfectly chiselled people find themselves mixed up in a dodgy property deal fronted by Priyanka Chopra which gives them an excuse to flex their rippling muscles as they engage in some daft, good humoured, testosterone-fuelled antics to save their beautiful beach from the bulldozers. ""Baywatch"" is a well produced eye-candy exercise that makes no bones about it's purpose - a piece of throw away cinema that might make you feel good (or envious). Should you think it's going to make you cringe at the dreadful script and the in-your face vanity of all of these outwardly attractive, but inwardly pretty hollow people then maybe you should skip it... If you persevere, then enjoy it for what it is - a soap on a beach..",Baywatch
10,grantss,"Quite different to what I was expecting, and pleasantly so",7,1 October 2017,"Matt Brody is a 2-time Olympic champion swimmer. However, due to drug and alcohol problems he has fallen from grace, to the point that he now has to perform community service as part of a plea deal for an offense. He will serve his time as a lifesaver at Emerald Bay lifeguard station, run by the no-nonsense Mitch Buchannon. Brody soon discovers that his celebrity status will earn him no favours. Meanwhile, people are dying in mysterious circumstances in Emerald Bay and Buchannon and his lifesaving team investigate. The occurrences may be linked to a nearby property development.Quite different to what I was expecting, and pleasantly so. I was expecting some sort of overly-politically-correct, dumbed- down/sanitized-for-SJWs/millennials version of the 90s TV series, or, at best, a remake of the 90s series. Thankfully, it is neither. Rather than being a more-style-than- substance drama like the TV series, this is a comedy, and a pretty funny one. The humour doesn't pull any punches and, tellingly, the movie is more a parody of the original Baywatch than a remake. Many of the jokes make fun of the original series, and do so very well.On the downside, it can be too crude at times, resulting in some scenes that aren't funny and just lower the tone. The broad plot is also pretty basic, but then, again, this is a comedy, so par for the course.",Baywatch
11,neil-476,Not as sanitised as the TV show.,7,9 May 2018,"Mitch Buchannon heads Baywatch - the lifeguard organisation for Emerald Bay. He and his team regard themselves as a water-bound extension of the police force, a view not shared by the police, the Council, or newcomer Matt Brody, a disgraced Olympic gold medallist. So when a prominent local business person turns out to be smuggling drugs, and Mitch gets on the trail...Baywatch was a much loved TV series. To be frank, the stories were serviceable but only just, the cast interactions were a little on the soapy side, and the main attraction was the slow-motion jiggling of the female cast members' wobbly bits (and, secondarily, for female audience members, the ripped abs of the male cast members).The film supplies all the above, but does so in a very tongue in cheek manner. Heavan knows, the TV series wasn't series. But Baywatch the movie is quite firmly pitched as a comedy with action, nostalgia, profanity, abs, and wobbly boobs.Is it funny? Well, it's not hysterical, but it's often amusing (as usual, most of the best gags are in the trailer). The crime story is adequate. The lion's share of what goes on is shared between Dwayne Johnson's bombastic Mitch and Zac Efron's bone-headed and entitled Matt who actually has a character development arc. Alexandra Daddario gets to make suggestive comments about her boobs, jiggle them a bit, have very blue eyes, and is given nothing else of consequence to do. But the outtakes look as if everyone had a huge laugh making the film. There is some gore, some sexual frankness, and a moderate amount of profanity. The film wouldn't have been significantly different without any of this, but it would have had a much wider market. I offer no opinion, I am simply making an observation.",Baywatch
12,FlashCallahan,Life's a beach......,7,1 July 2017,"Matt Brody is a former Olympic swimmer who wants to join a team of lifeguards led by Mitch Buchannon. Brody thinks its in the bag, but his casual attitude starts to rub Mitch the wrong way. When drugs, bad jokes, and a shady resort owner pose a threat to the bay, Mitch and Matt must put their differences aside to save the day.....First off, Johnson was right on twitter, saying this wasn't made for critics, and if you consider some of the films that have been based on TV series (Charlie's Angels, Sergeant Bilko, Leave It To Beaver, and My Favourite Martian) this isn't half bad.It's a shame though that the first thing you notice is that it's trying to hard to emulate the success of 21 Jump Street, by sending up the show it's referencing, but then when you have Johnson and Efron, two more than capable actors bouncing off one another, you will find a lot to enjoy.It's your atypical summer blockbuster, full of big explosions, beautiful people, and a plot so thin, it appears cachexic.So whilst the two leads are at loggerheads for the first two acts, during the second act, the actual plot starts to kick in, and it's your predictable 'drug running' scenario, with the titular team getting involved for no good reason.It's one of those films where you know you shouldn't really laugh, but some of the lines and put downs are just so off the cuff and a little leftfield, they just surprise you as to how funny they actually are.The actual physical comedy doesn't stick, and a lot of the supposed comedy set pieces out stay their welcome, but thanks to the chemistry between the toe leads, and a lot of silly but endearing secondary characters, it's worth catching if there's nothing else to do.",Baywatch
13,Aaron1375,"Strange comedy, a bit uneven",7,9 October 2018,"This film was better than I thought it would be, but then I was not sure what I was expecting. However, I most certainly was not expecting almost a spoof like comedy. That being said, sometimes it played like a spoof comedy, sometimes a raunchy comedy and sometimes like a straight summer comedy with some action within it. It was very uneven as it did not seem like it knew which style of comedy to settle on. Still, it was funnier than I was expecting and thought it was uneven, it still proved to be entertaining.The movie stars the Rock as Mitch, one heck of a good lifeguard. He is about to be saddled with a new recruit whose only attribute is that he is a gold medal swimmer, but he has an attitude! He also has a portly guy he personally chose and a female that the gold medal swimmer is attracted to. Soon, a death is discovered and Mitch just knows that there is something going down and starts an investigation, while the gold medal swimmer is confused by this as this is a job that is seemingly more fitted for the police!The movie was funny, despite the flow of the film which seemed really uneven. Dwayne the Rock Johnson does a pretty good job with comedy and so did Zak Efron. The film did feature a couple of appearances by former Baywatch stars, but both amounted to simple cameos. I found it stupid that they put their names in the main credits as this kind of took away the surprise when you finally saw them.So, a pretty good comedy that could have just stayed a bit more consistent. Be a spoof, be an action comedy or be a raunchy comedy, but don't try to be all three within the span of 10 minutes. The Rock would go on later in the year to make the far superior and much higher grossing Jumunji, but while this one did not score huge at the box office, with its world wide take was still a hit for the Rock. He has become the Arnold Schwarzenegger of this generation where his films do pretty good or great in the US and if they fail a bit here, they do well overseas.",Baywatch
14,trashgang,ideal for a relaxing evening full of stupid jokes and situations and action,7,15 July 2017,"When my teen daughter said they wanted to go to Baywatch but needed a drive I was damned to go with them because I just have seen a few flicks last week in theaters but hey, as a good dad I went with them. Was it a good idea?I knew that Zac Efron was in it and the seats being taken by teen girls I knew they all were waiting for him. But having a WWF and WWE past I also knew that the rock was in it. And I do know that he had a lot to say about Baywatch that it was going to be a good ride.I laughed a few times and I enjoyed the story and the effects used. It's not just a teen flick. It has a lot of one-liners referring to other flicks or to the past of Zac Efron. The humour used was okay and it even had a lot of stupid situations especially with Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass). The acting was above mediocre. I never had a feeling of , let's stop it even the cameo by The Hoff were okay. At the end you will have a few seconds back to memory lane with Pamela Anderson too. Please be seated as the movie ends because throughout the end credits there are bloopers and they are really good. So at the end of the day this flick was a nice surprise. A bit of action, showing off of Dwayne Johnson with his body. a lot of laughing with baywatch itself and stupid situations like you see in Dump And Dumper and Hot Shots.

15,Mr-Fusion,"These are shallow waters, but it works",6,22 September 2017,"Do you remember four months back when this was sold as a buddy movie? Maybe that's what piqued my curiosity, that it's not the T&A but the beefcake that people want (which it has in abundance). ""Baywatch"" has it share of missteps; it goes overboard with the slo-mo, and some of the hokes are awful. But as much as I wanted (subconsciously) to slam this movie, I ended up enjoying it as the breezy Summer fare that it is. I think it's because the other recent TV property that springs to mind is ""CHIPS"", and that's a low damn bar. But I like this cast. And it works almost purely because of all- around good guy Dwayne Johnson. His enthusiasm for this is unbridled and this would sink quickly without him. It's a testament to his screen presence. I'll come right out and say it: I wouldn't mind a sequel. 6/10",Baywatch

But it was just stupid and not that sexy. For me, having Priyanka, Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach in a movie and not have it be sexy is an awful fail.And it could all been saved if the story would have been a little more interesting or the jokes better, but they just weren't. Did I have difficulties watching it? No. It was like a dumb TV movie that you can enjoy and I was on an international flight.

And then what?,4,24 September 2017,"Based on the TV series of the same name, 'Bawatch' is a film that tries to revive the spirit of its source material, but fails to make a feature length film of out it. Pecs and Boobs are aplenty and a lot of slow-mo. And then what?'Baywatch' Synopsis: Devoted lifeguard Mitch Buchannon butts heads with a brash new recruit, as they uncover a criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay.'Baywatch' stands on a faulty script. The Writing settles for good-looking people with gym chiseled bodies and a lot slow-motion to get you amused. And while all that is appealing, considering its 'Baywatch', but why would one watch that for nearly 2 hours? Also, the track of a drug lord (Priyanka Chopra, in hammy mode) is uninteresting. Mark Swift and Damian Shannon's Screenplay is funny initially, but lacks meat overall. Seth Gordon's Direction is passable. Cinematography is alright. Editing is fair.Acting Wise, Dwayne Johnson & Alexandra Daddario are the only reason why 'Baywatch' doesn't sink entirely. Johnson, buff as always, is striking & an effective leading man. Daddario, on the other-hand, sexier than ever, lights up the screen with charm & energy. The rest barely add much.On the whole, 'Baywatch' doesn't really work.",Baywatch
18,JamesHitchcock,Junk TV to Junk Movie,3,5 March 2018,"""Baywatch"" was one of the most popular television series of the nineties. The programme-makers might have liked to kid themselves that its popularity was due to the quality of its scripts or its acting, but the truth was rather different. Setting a TV drama among a team of Californian lifeguards was a brilliant stroke. It not only permitted plenty of shots of young women in swimsuits but also provided an obvious retort to anyone who complained about a gratuitous display of female flesh. ""But real lifeguards have to wear swimsuits to work!""Well, so they do, but perhaps not all real female lifeguards look like the cast of ""Baywatch"". It was obvious that no actress could ever hope to win a part in the series unless she possessed the face and figure of a ""Playboy"" model- and several of the cast were precisely that in real life, most notably the series' biggest-name star, Pamela Anderson, who had several ""Playboy"" appearances under her belt. The formula of sun, sea, sand and sexy swimsuits worked for a while, and for a number of years young male audiences all over the globe were tuning in to watch the lovely Pamela and her co-stars sporting themselves in the surf, but all good things come to an end and the series eventually came to an end. There are, after all, only a limited number of plots you can get out of a team of lifeguards, however beautiful they may be. Only that wasn't the end. Now, twenty years on, someone has decided to revive the format for a movie. The film keeps the original setting, and some of the original names, although fans of the series will have noticed some changes. Casey Jean Parker (the part played by Anderson) is taller and less voluptuous. Summer Quinn, once blonde, is now a brunette. And Stephanie Holden and Mitch Buchanan are now black. (Stephanie also, for some reason, has taken to swimming in a long-sleeved swimsuit more like a leotard). The plot revolves around a new recruit to the ""Baywatch"" team. Or perhaps I should say a reluctant new recruit. Matt Brody, a former Olympic gold medal swimmer, has been forced to work as a lifeguard as part of his community service for some unspecified offence. The rest of the team take an instant dislike to Matt, which is hardly surprising, given that he has an obnoxious personality and a massive ego. The scriptwriters seem to agree with me that there are only a limited number of plots you can get out the basic ""lifeguard"" theme, because the team here spend surprisingly little time in the water. They spend most of their time on land (although still dressed in their swimsuits) investigating the doings of a gang of drug dealers. You and I might think that law enforcement is something best left to the police, but in the movie the only people who try to point this out are portrayed either as an officious, arrogant jack-in-office (the local police lieutenant) or as a spineless coward (Matt).The original television series was, ostensibly at least, a serious drama, but the film is very much an action-comedy. There is a good deal of bad language and crude lavatorial or sexual humour, something from which the TV series was surprisingly free despite being aimed at a predominantly young male audience. (In Britain it always went out at Saturday tea-time, traditionally a slot aimed at the family market). The television series was not noted for high standards of acting, but the film is considerably worse in this respect. Dwayne Johnson may have ditched his ""The Rock"" nickname, which was always more appropriate to a professional wrestler than to a professional actor, but he is still as stony-faced and emotionless as ever. None of the original team of Baywatch Babes (with the possible exception of Alexandra Paul, the original Stephanie) had much talent as an actress, but at least they did bring some personality and charisma, as well as beauty, to their roles. The current team (Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera) have the beauty without the charisma. The film's storyline is just as hackneyed and clichéd as anything in the series, which was as little noted for brilliant plots as it was for brilliant acting. My feelings are perhaps best summed up by the words of Richard Roeper, film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times, who said ""When you make films from junk TV, more often than not you're going to wind up with a junk movie"". 3/10",Baywatch
19,Hellmant,Surprisingly entertaining!,8,1 June 2017,"'BAYWATCH': Four Stars (Out of Five) A satirical feature film adaptation of the 80s cult classic TV show, of the same name, starring David Hasselfhoff (who also has a cameo in this movie, along with his TV costar Pamela Anderson). The film stars Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Zac Efron, Priyanka Chopra, Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach, Jon Bass and Ilfenesh Hadera. It was directed by Seth Gordon (who also helmed 2011's 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' and 2013's 'IDENTITY THIEF') and it was written by Damian Shannon, Mark Swift, Jay Scherick, David Ronn, Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant (Lennon and Garant are of 'RENON 911!' fame). In the film Johnson plays the self righteous leader of a special team of lifeguards, which fight crime on the beaches of Emerald Bay, Florida. A disgraced former Olympian (Efron) is added to the team to help with PR, while the lifeguards try to take on a corrupt business woman who might be smuggling drugs. The movie has received mostly bad reviews from critics, and it's also disappointed at the Box Office so far. I found it to be much better made, and more entertaining, than the critics have given it credit for! Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) thinks way too highly of himself, and his job as a lifeguard, and he often upsets the local authorities, and his captain (Ron Huebel), by investigating crimes he has no jurisdiction over. So when Mitch finds a bag of drugs on his beach, and suspects a local business woman (Chopra) is to blame for it, he gets himself, and his team of lifeguards, in a lot of trouble trying to prove his suspicions correct. At the same time Mitch also has to deal with three new recruits to his lifeguard team, including a cocky ex-Olympic athlete named Matt Brody (Efron). Brody and Buchannon's enormous egos both continue to battle each other, while they also try to keep their beach safe.The movie is surprisingly entertaining; it's consistently funny and the action scenes are pretty slick and exciting too. Going into the film expecting it to be a bad movie, I'm sure helped it's enjoyment level for me as well. I think The Rock and Efron are both great in the film, and they also have pretty good chemistry together as well. Chopra makes a great femme fatale villain in it too, and Bass is pretty funny also. It's just an all around amusing and fun time at the movies, and it's much better than the TV show it's parodying as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/4Bt6rG-Wb0c",Baywatch
20,FeastMode,my notes,2,24 July 2019,"Horrendous. the only reason i didn't give it a half star is because there were some funny parts and i liked when it focused on the rock and efron. they had some good chemistry. the hot girls were hot girls. they were fine. but most of the ""comedy"" in this movie is so much more than just not funny. it is cringeworthingly bad. smh wow omg smh moments. so many. it was also a very low quality movie. the writing was so bad. the story was useless. it didn't even feel like a real movie most of the time. i don't really know why they made this if they were gonna just put together a piece of garbage.here's the best part, i didn't even get to the worst part of the movie. Ronnie, in my opinion, no exaggeration, might be the all time worst part about any movie ever. i kid you not. if this movie was actually good, he would have still sunk it. he suck so bad. everything he says is awful. he is the worst. his presence on the screen made me question every decision maker in hollywood. like are you guys demented? i don't think i have never hated anyone in a movie more than him (1 viewing)",Baywatch
21,Robert_duder,"Considering how bad you SHOULD expect it to be, it's not that bad, but still underwhelming",6,25 August 2017,"If there was ever a reason to say a remake/reboot was necessary this would be it. There was no situation where this would have ever worked in any way. So I sat down to watch it with sincerely low expectations. So imagine my shock when it was okay. Okay at best! It certainly had some fun with the original series poking fun at the seriousness of the original series and the sorts of things they took on. It also made multiple blatant way too obvious jokes about the slow motion running and the bathing suits. It actually ended up being less gratuitous than I thought and I think even balanced the male to female ratio and included a short, stubby, geeky guy for good measure. The ""Jonah Hill"" type of the film which was unnecessary but it worked. It actually tries to have genuine heart and it does have it's moments. The characters aren't completely vapid and they actually give them some personality even if they spoof the poor personalities. The story is okay, kind of weak but at least they gave it a story. The action scenes are decent but contrived and much like many films I've seen lately, why is CGI fire so incredibly bad. There are two ""okay"" cameos from former Baywatch cast members (the two most necessary) but it's not a film you should rush out and buy that's for sure.The biggest movie star on the planet oddly enough is Dwayne Johnson (I saw oddly because for a WWE wrestler to come up and become the world's biggest star was unheard of prior to him.) Mind you it seems more are coming (Dave Bautista for instance.) Johnson is so incredibly charismatic you can watch him in anything no matter how bad. So his personality and larger than life on screen persona makes his character and performance redeemable for the film. He is having a good time and fans of his will enjoy it for that reason. Similarly Zac Efron has a certain quality about him that makes his suave and egotistical character of Matt Brody kind of fun to watch. Efron and Johnson have good chemistry together (I'd love to see them do something with a better script.) Both men are built like brick walls and seem to be popular with women. The women leads are not much different. They are stunning, gorgeous, half decent actors at least but underdeveloped characters. Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach absolutely...err fill their roles well. Daddario is fast becoming a celeb crush, the girl is just an unbelievable beauty and she is a good actress too! I actually liked Rohrbach's role and her fun romance/chemistry with the ""nerd"" of the group played by Jon Bass. That was one of the best parts about the movie. Bass plays his incredible predictable role well so it works fine. The five of them have good chemistry together which helps too for the very silly contrived plot. Ilfenesh Hadera has a sadly small part because she seems like she could have been a more serious addition to the cast. Priyanka Chopra is horrendous as the villain. She isn't even as good as a Rocky and Bullwinkle villain. She might sort of look the part but she is so subtle and laid back, the only good part is her ridiculous death.Director Seth Gordon has some decent credits to his name but mostly in Television. I can see why he would want to take this on and try and make it his big hit film but everyone had to know this would never fly? The thing is it's not terrible. It's okay in every sense of the word. It's funny-ish, it's got action-ish, it's got men and women in bathing suits-ish, it's not even really gratuitous except for the language which is quite unnecessary meaning they would have been better off trying to sell this the demographic of teenagers or early 20's. I was surprised I didn't hate it because the script is slapped together with very little effort and it relies entirely on the charisma and chemistry of the cast which is actually good enough to not hate the movie 6.5/10",Baywatch

23,bowmanblue,'The Rock' and Zac couldn't save it,6,6 May 2019,"I think I was the only teenager growing up in the early nineties who never watched a single episode of the TV show 'Baywatch.' Therefore, I'm not one of those people who is going to start moaning on about a 'big screen adaptation ruining my childhood memories' (I save that rant for Michael Bay's 'Transformers' franchise!). Plus I'm a huge fan of cheesy movies and Dwayne Johnson - so odds were on that I'd enjoy this. I didn't. Pity.First of all Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson - once again - proves why he's currently one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood. He has a natural charm that shines through in whatever he does, 'Baywatch' is no exception. He's definitely 'the star' of the show, but that's not to say that Zac Efron doesn't pull his weight. The two of them do well in every scene they're in, however just because the actors are good, doesn't mean the film is any good.Johnson and Efron's performances aren't enough to make up for the armies of dull and cliched characters they're forced to interact with. I know one thing everyone expects to see in anything with the title 'Baywatch' is young, fit people in revealing swimsuits, but then women they've chosen (despite looking the part, obviously) just don't get the lines to make their characters anything more than cardboard cut-outs. And this isn't just a fault aimed at the female cast-members. There's the 'token' fat guy who is supposed the be the 'comic relief' (in a film where basically every character tells jokes anyway). He's just awful. Almost all of his jokes don't land and some just go on for so long that you actually will find his performance quite painful to watch.The story revolves around the lifeguards trying to foil a drugs-ring plot. Yes, this should be something the police take care of and, to give the film some credit, it is self-knowing enough to point plot-holes like this out for a quick laugh. If ever you had to suspend your disbelief then it's with the plot of this film. People do stuff that wouldn't seem out of place in a 'Scooby Doo' cartoon, i.e. constantly peeping over the edge of walls to 'spy' on the villain's operation and then 'disguising' themselves in order to infiltrate the operation.I really wanted to enjoy this film. Even with Johnson and Efron desperately trying to do their bit to save the movie, I doubt I'll ever watch it again. I reckon some people will. It truly is one of those 'guilty pleasure' films that might just sneak into a DVD collection here and there.https://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.com/",Baywatch
24,ThomasDrufke,Nothing Lands,4,25 May 2017,"I don't claim to know much about the original Baywatch TV series (besides the obvious things), but I do know what a good comedy entails. I know that when I go to a comedy I expect to laugh. Baywatch rarely delivers enough action or comedy to keep the film from moving at a begrudgingly slow pace.So, if it's not funny then what's the point? Well, there really isn't any. Baywatch attempts to follow in the same line with films like Fast and Furious where silly humor and visceral action lead the way. But there's a big difference here. Where in other films it feels funny because the characters inside the story don't realize how serious they're taking the situations they're in, it's the opposite with Baywatch. It almost feels like the characters in Baywatch know they are in a ridiculous comedy and continue to act like it, coming ever too close to winking at the camera at times.Films like that only work if the tone is just right. It's very difficult to pinpoint who exactly this film is targeting. You'd think it's the R rated comedy crowd, but the film recycles so many old jokes and comedy tropes that I would find it difficult for anyone to get super invested. When the jokes aren't hitting you have to look to the characters for something to grapple onto. All of these actors and actresses are beautiful to look at, but besides Zac Efron's character, none of them are fleshed out. In my mind The Rock can do no wrong, but I certainly would have expected more out of him (especially considering he helped produce this as well).The worst part is that you can see every story beat coming. You know when someone is going to get the girl or guy they want, you know when they won't, you know when the characters are about to go through a big moment, and you know when the big gag or joke is about to hit. I didn't even mention how pointless and out of place the cameos feel. I haven't seen all of Seth Gordon's directorial efforts, but I really enjoy Horrible Bosses so I expected to at least get a kick out of Baywatch/superheroes on the beach, but it wasn't meant to be. Man oh man is it hard to make rated R comedies these days.+Efron is redeemable-Nothing lands-Rough green screen-Predictable at every turn4.2/10",Baywatch

26,lesleyharris30,"Harmless Fun,",7,16 June 2017,"Baywatch is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a very fun movie that had me laughing throughout. As you know, it is based on the show of the same name and, similarly to 21 Jump Street, it turns the concept of the television series on its head, making it a raunchy comedy. The chemistry between the cast members makes this film, I enjoyed each individual relationship, particularly Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron, who have a big brother, little brother dynamic for the entire movie. Efron and Alexandra Daddario also had a very sweet connection with one another, as well as Kelly Rohrbach and Jon Bass, who had a dynamic that never failed to make me laugh. I did not, however, appreciate the moments when this movie got too serious. There is an entire sequence when they go to save a burning boat, which I get was to showcase the seriousness of their situation, but it was fifteen minutes of no laughs, no comedy. It was all way too dramatic, and it seemed like the writers and director got a little too big for their britches. As well as that, once the plot really kicks in, I found the performers started to play their parts far too straight. The first half of the movie is pure hilarity, then it gets very serious and turns in to a tribute to Baywatch, rather than a spoof. It should have taken a leaf out of Jump Street's book, in which it never took out the fun and steered away from the television series as far as possible. It is simple, harmless comedy from start to finish. It certainly has its flaws, but Baywatch is a great laugh, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. A new crew member turns up on Mitch Buchannon's beach while a criminal plot threatens their future, causing them to investigate. Best Performance: Dwayne Johnson",Baywatch
27,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,16 August 2017,"BaywatchThe most important thing to remember when lifeguarding is to not rely on dolphins to save every one.Thankfully, the lifeguards in this comedy are keeping their beach safe themselves.When esteemed lifeguard Mitch (Dwayne Johnson) is forced to add hotshot Olympian Brody (Zac Efron) to his summer roster, he shows his distain by training the cocksure rookie himself.After enduring Mitch's grueling feats of strength, Brody is filled in on the Baywatch team's (Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach) extracurricular activities: surveilling a suspected drug smuggler (Priyanka Chopra). A raunchier version of the already exploitive television series, this poorly written feature film adaptation brings the show's best assets to the forefront but at the expensive of a decent story and capable acting. The terrible T&A humour aside, this quasi-tribute plays more like an insult to the show and it's fans.Incidentally, the only explosions lifeguards see are the beached whale kind. Red Light",Baywatch
28,851222,Nothing works in this movie because of very poor script,4,25 October 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.You can summarize ""Baywatch"" (2017) in one sentence - exposition of good looking bodies and missed opportunities. I was really looking forward for this movie. Premise was great - it could have worked as good comedy. Unfortunately script of this movie is beyond anything that could have made this movie work - it has zero suspense, zero humor (not a single really funny moment during whole 2 hours) and lack of any creativity. Plot was beyond average.Overall, basically nothing worked in ""Baywatch"" because of very poor script. It is not a funny comedy and as some sort of action comedy it totally lacks any suspense or anything that resembles character development. Sure you don't watch movie like ""Baywatch"" for character development, but boy oh boy does it lack anything that resembles for a fun movie. Unfortunately ""Baywatch"" is one of the worst movies of 2017.",Baywatch
29,The-Sarkologist,Better than Expected,4,4 June 2017,"I am going to have to swallow my pride and admit that I actually enjoyed this film. Maybe it had something to do with me muttering 'I'm seriously going to regret this' when I actually bought the ticket. In fact I'm really not all that sure as to why I decided to go and see the film, though a part of me was trying to convince myself that it had something to do with wanting to see how bad it was. Well, as the law of inversions dictates, that which you expect to be good ends up being bad and that which you expect to be really bad, even if it actually is really bad, turns out to be good. Well, I guess that is what happened here – I expected it to be bad, and to be honest it was pretty bad, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.Basically this is just another one of those films that is trying to resurrect a popular series from the 80s and 90s. Honestly, I never actually watched the series, probably because Pamela Anderson really put me off, but maybe also because I wasn't really all that interested in watching a series about a bunch of life guards at the beach, and all the resulting drama. Which probably baffles me as to why I wanted to see the film. Well, as it turns out, like a lot of the films that are looking back at some of these old series (such as 21 Jump Street and CHiPs), it is turning the series into a bit of a joke, and laughing at how crazy the concept was.For instance, throughout the film there is this running joke about how they are, well, lifeguards – they aren't cops, and they can't do things that cops are supposed to do, which means that when they are chasing a badguy they are, well, just a normal person chasing a bad guy. I guess this has a lot to do with the original series having a lot of crime, and the lifeguards getting to the bottom of it. This, as you can probably expect, has the lifeguards attempting to bust open a drug operation.There are also some out takes at the end, which further shows how they were making fun of some of the things that were used in not only the original series, but in similar films and shows. Further, the way that they had David Hasselhof come in, and make a comment that The Rock happened to have the same name as his character (as was also the case with CJ Parker). In fact, with the exception of Ronnie, most of the Baywatch team were characters resurrected from the original series. However, in the end, while it might but fun, and enjoyable, it is still pretty bad, and would probably only recommend it to somebody who wanted a bit of a laugh and a film that doesn't really take itself too seriously (and even then there are better films out there).",Baywatch
30,slightlymad22,Not As Bad As I Thought,6,31 March 2018,"So I just watched the Baywatch movie.It's very uneven. Its main storyline was something from a pg movie with no real danger (real Scooby Doo pantomime stuff) yet the humour was from a gross-out r rated flick The alleged comedy sidekick (who inexplicably gets the girl he lists after all movie) is awfully unfunny!! This type of character would have been cut from the American Pie type movies, so god knows how he made it in this.It wasn't all bad. I laughter twice once when Efron said ""Everything you are talking about dealing with, sounds like an entertaining, but far fetched tv show"" And when the Rock made Efron fall in to the pool, the Hasselhoff cameo raised a smile (though I'd wish older celebrities would not have so much plastic surgery) All the cast look good none more so than Alexandra Daddario WOW I'm developing quite the crush on her!! The other babe Kelly Rohrbach was easy on the eye too, and I have to admit Zac Efron is winning me over. I'm surprised this did as bad as it did, as I thought there would have been an audience for it!!! At least during its opening weekend, I'd have thought name recognition and the billing of The Rock and Efron would have brought the crowds in.

31,Reno-Rangan,When lifeguards turned homicides!,3,4 November 2017,"In the 90s, when the original television series was aired, I was just a kid. Then it was too sexy, that I was not allowed to watch. The world has changed so much all these years. I always wanted to see that, but never had a chance. Now a film, possibly a new franchise if it all goes well. There were lots of expectations on it, but the film did not deliver that. Yet they have already announced a sequel.The bay security team is now recruiting new members. Three joins as the trainee after the tryout. Within a few days, a couple of suspicious deaths happen in the bay. The cops are not worried to solve it, but the Baywatch team jumps in and starts their own investigation. That leads them to a dangerous territory. From there, how they deal with it was revealed with some action-thriller.Pumped up body, starring alongside a current top star, nothing is working for Zac Efron. He's just an accidental actor, won't survive long, unless he turns it all his way like Ben Afflect did. On the other hand, Dwayne was awesome. All the other actors too. Priyanka was not ideal for such role. Because an Indian in a negative role for an American film, nah, it does not work. India keeps all the thugs and sends only engineers, doctors, scientist et cetera to the foreign lands. A Chinese or a Russian villain works better.No suspense. Everything was open from the beginning itself. Some of the comedies were good, but some were most absurd. Especially, I did not like the storyline. The Bay security force not doing their job, but police work. It goes completely out of the frame. It's okay doing same within their enclosure, but the film entered beyond that. Thus, the film missed to cover the beach events as what the title had promised. I hope the sequel would fall in line.3/10",Baywatch
32,cruise01,All fun until the jokes are repetitive and a lifeless plot.,7,26 May 2017,"Baywatch is in all a fun summer blockbuster action comedy with no brains and no plot. Based on a campy TV series, which I was once a fan of. Baywatch tries to be a little too much like 21 Jump Street, all stupid humor and a thin plot about drugs being smuggled in its concept. In this case, about lifeguards trying to solve the case and stop drugs from washing up on their beach. Sure, there is plenty of eye candy for men and ladies; you get the ladies in bikinis running in slow mo and than you have Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron shirtless if the female audiences find them to be eye candy. The plot follows Lt. Mitch (Dwayne Johnson) and his lifeguard team preparing for tryouts for the new recruits. The new recruits trying out are Ronnie (Jon Bass) an awkward techie guy, who is already falling for one of the lifeguards C.J. (Kelly Rohrbach). Summer (Alexandra Daddario) is also a new recruit, who is smart and skilled. Then, there is Matt Brody (Zac Efron) a cocky, arrogant young guy, who won two medals in the Olympics and ruined it when he partied too hard and vomit while in the swimming event. Mitch discovers drugs being washed up on shore and suspects its Victoria (Priyanka Chopra) with her new club opening up next to the shore. Baywatch is a lot of fun, its not meant to be taken seriously. The direction knows that it is fun and campy for entertainment. It is fun to see how these different characters interact, C.J. being a hot lifeguard and Ronnie trying to score a date with her and every encounter with her goes awry. Matt and Mitch always going head to head, and the duo trying to investigate this drug crime. It may not be as good as 21 Jump Street which the filmmakers knew how to keep it energetic and used a lot of media references and squeezed that in there for its jokes. Baywatch only has the typical stupid humor. It all comes from Matt Brody, which is an entertaining character with his stupidity. Feels like his character from Neighbors transferred into this film. Sure, there are some sexual jokes such as a guys private parts accidentally getting stuck on a beach wooden chair as he fell on it, a gratuitous scene of a dead guy being full frontal, etc. The sexual jokes is not as bad as Neighbors. The film does have a fun cast of a likable duo of Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Alexandara Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach are beautiful talented actress that made their characters fun. Priyanka Chopra had a great time playing a fun villain. There are a few action and chase scenes of seeing Mitch jumping out of a burning yacht after saving a few girls. Going undercover in a morgue. Or a climactic showdown with the antagonist while the fireworks are going off. The visual effects in that scene was decent with the helicopter and the fireworks. What did not work with Baywatch is there is no real plot. Has a fun idea of seeing these lifeguards work together and trying to solve this drug case while the police officer that is assigned in that area is stupid. Also, the stupid humor can also be repetitive with the same jokes. Overall, Baywatch is a fairly fun summer movie with its likable cast, entertaining repetitive humor, and a campy concept based on the show. Does leave a forgettable plot. Lets not forget a surprise cameo with two of the cast from the show which is fun to see.",Baywatch

Johnson has charisma as usual but his chemistry with Zac Efron isn't there, and the constant back and forth jokes between them becomes tiresome quickly.With some decent and entertaining moments, overall Baywatch didn't live up to the hype and has somewhat been forgotten already.

Have Hollywood seriously run out of ideas that they are now consistently pumping out films from TV Series? 'The A-Team' was tolerable, this was just pointless. Lifeguards of the ""Baywatch"" team take it upon themselves to unravel a drug smuggling, property purchasing and countless murdering case that plagues the beach. ""Why not just let the police deal with this?"" is a line consistently spoken. I would agree, but then chances are we would have a 'Hawaii Five-O' film in our midst and I just cannot deal with another one of these mundane disasters. So lifeguards abandon their own beach and perform a variety of illegal activities like, but not limited to: high speed boat pursuits, imitating professions (such as a doctor) and playing around with dead people. The 'Suicide Squad' are more qualified to look after this beach!? God damn. I knew as soon as the massive titles came up out of the ocean on a noticeable green screen, with a barrage of explosions and flailing dolphins...that I was in for an experience. Credit to Dwayne Johnson though, he still gives everything his all and never fails to make me smile. I did laugh three times due to Johnson name calling Efron ""High School Musical"", ""NSYNC"" and ""One Direction"". I did get a good chuckle from that. Everyone looked the part I guess, plenty of slow motion running with jiggly boobs and wet hair (if that's your thing...). Hasselhoff and Anderson make cameo appearances, rejoice! But heck, even their brief performances couldn't save this oceanic mess. The story was generic with a boring antagonist. The noticeable green screen was extremely noticeable that even I noticed the noticeable green screen. Did I forget to mention it was noticeable? The worst CGI fire ever is included.

37,jtindahouse,Should've been so much better,5,21 August 2017,"I went into 'Baywatch' hoping for a similar case to '21 Jump Street'. '21 Jump Street' as a show never held any interest to me whatsoever, however the movie version (and its sequel) were nothing short of brilliant. On that occasion Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum found some of the best comedic chemistry you'll ever see and that, combined with a fun and interesting script, were enough to make for a brilliant film. Sadly, the film version of 'Baywatch' encompassed none of those assets and was a lot closer to the actual show version of 'Baywatch', which I consider near on unwatchable.Let's start with the casting. Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Now admittedly they both have the look, but that's where it ends. It seems the casting director figured as long as the stars had good bodies that would be enough to carry it (again quite a similar philosophy to the TV series). How wrong they were though. Johnson does his best to bring some humour and light-heartedness to the film, but Efron just completely fails. In fact he sucks all the humour out of most scenes he's in. Also the pair have zero chemistry together. They never clicked and this is a huge part of why the film fails.The next problem is the story. My God was it bland. The laziness in the creativity department was quite astounding. And then as if that wasn't bad enough, the villain characters they created for the story were as dull and cliché-ridden as you will ever see. The entire script for that matter is lazy. They couldn't even come up with an interesting opening scene to kick the film off with a bang.As for positives, it's a nice looking film. By that I mean the cast is very good looking. Other than that though it's a very hard film to praise. This could have been something special with a different couple of actors in the lead role (possibly Johnson could have stayed on if the other actor had some serious talent to find some chemistry and carry some scenes) and if an entirely different script was used. That wasn't the case though and so this ended up being a very poor film.",Baywatch

Plus I love Alexandra Daddario, such a beautiful woman, but a surprise to me that I found the women they got to play Pamela Anderson's part in the film more stunning, but she had an unfair advantage being next to Jon Bass who plays the lifeguard who looks nothing like the other beautiful people but had some funny bits that she got to tag along in, which made her look better.Anyway, despite having the Rock in it, the movie Baywacth is stale as hell.

I went in expecting something just has awful as Chips, but in the end it was more amusing. Parts where the movie goes wrong for me is that when the raunchy gags where thrown in, and I can't help but feel that was in at the last minute, and I thought it brought the movie down.Dwayne Johnson seems to be having the most fun here, as Mitch. Johnson is always a joy to watch, regardless of what role he's playing. Zac Efron is alright has Brody, moments where he wasn't whiny like a little school boy. Alexandra Daddario has Summer, don't get me wrong is beautiful, but wasn't giving much character to play to the point where I just didn't care. Kelly Rohrbach has C.J. was pretty descent, I like the way she wasn't written has a dumb blonde, but has a smart and very friendly person, and every bit has beautiful has Daddario. Jon Bass who thought was gonna be written has an annoying sidekick, but his character seems to change has it goes on. This started out terrible, but got better in spots, moments that where funny, action scenes that where okay. Not a great film by any standards, questioning anything in it would be rather pointless, but it has some amusing moments.",Baywatch
41,stevendbeard,Raunchy Action/Comedy,7,27 May 2017,"I saw ""Baywatch"", starring Dwayne Johnson-San Andreas, The Scorpion King; Zac Efron-The Neighbors movies, Charlie St. Cloud; Priyanka Chopra-The Bollywood actress that you might have seen on Quantico_tv; Alexandra Daddario-San Andreas, Texas Chainsaw 3D_2013 and Kelly Rohrbach-The PET Squad Files_tv, Rizzoli & Isles_tv.This movie is based on the popular 1980's TV series and I guess it all depends on if you liked the TV show on whether or not you will like this movie. I was not a big fan-I admit, I did watch it for the Uh....scenery, occasionally. It was just not all that believable. But, this movie is pretty much like the original show, with it's outlandish plots and gorgeous girls-and guys, if you are into that kind of thing- running in slow motion on the beach and solving crimes, when they are not saving people from drowning. The movie even makes fun of the slow motion running bit-as well as the unbelievable plot lines-on more than one occasion. Dwayne/Mitch is the head life guard that loves protecting his beaches. Zac is a new recruit that was a famous gold medal winning athlete but fell from grace and now has to work as a life guard due to a court order. Alexandra & Kelly/CJ are other members of the Baywatch team. Priyanka is the villain that is involved in drugs and murder-and yes, even the villain is good looking here. If you are looking for something serious, you might as well forget it. If you just want something to take your mind off of the boring day to day monotony, then this is a perfect summer movie. This is a raunchy action/comedy. There are a couple of cameos from David Hasselhoff & Pamela Anderson-I am not giving anything away here, their names are in the opening credits. There are some bloopers and a funny scene during the end credits but nothing at the very end. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I enjoyed it and would probably buy it on DVD.",Baywatch

43,alindsay-al,A poor attempt at comedy,3,2 March 2018,"This film gained lots of publicity when it was first released but I missed it in the cinema and I have now seen Baywatch, and it is just a poor comedy that is just not worth seeing. The premise of the film sees a top team of lifeguards having to deal with a drug ring and a new cocky member of the team. Dwayne 'the rock' Johnson plays the lead in the film and he is his usual charming self even though I don't feel this is one of his better performances. I just felt like his character wasn't written to be particularly likeable in this film which is surprising considering what type of a performer Johnson is. Zac efron plays the new recruit in this film and he is easily the best part of this film, he is funny and unlikeable but he also actually adds a little depth to the role and added more to his character then I expected. The rest of the cast are pretty paper thin and just see as comedy relief or eye candy and it just really hurts the overall quality of the film. The story in the film is ridiculous in a lot of ways but just doesn't work because of alot of factors involved especially the absurdness of the whole situation while trying to be serious at times which doesn't flow well. The script has some pretty funny one liners in it that made me chuckle, but the film isn't funny enough and the attempts at drama are pretty poor overall. The style of the film doesn't know what it wants to be a parody or action film, the action scenes are poor and the pacing of the film is awful. The first 30 mins of the film are awful but it does get better but not good enough. Overall this is not a particularly funny movie and one that can be skipped.",Baywatch
44,jimbo-53-186511,About what I expected which isn't entirely a bad thing,5,23 July 2018,"Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) is a head lifeguard who is devoted to his work and takes a serious and professional approach to his job. He soon finds his patience tested when cocky gung-ho new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron) joins the programme and he clashes with Mitch as they have very differing attitudes to what being a lifeguard is actually about; however the 2 men find that they must work together when they learn that real estate magnate Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) is taking unethical measures in order to create a monopoly on the bay.Let's all be honest with each other here; this film never had a chance of being brilliant and anyone who was actually expecting this to be an amazing film either doesn't live in the real world or perhaps hasn't seen the original TV Series upon which this film was based on - which I can understand with younger viewers as it must be close to 20 years since Baywatch was last on TV. Having said that the film did work on a very basic level for me; the banter (mainly between Johnson and Efron is amusing - even if Efron being compared to every solo male singer or boy-band member in the last 20 years was a one-note joke it was a fairly effective joke for the most part). Sure it's a shallow film, but in some ways it's amusingly shallow as it does at least have a degree of self-awareness about it; there are a number of slow-motion scenes which are obviously an in-joke about the original TV Series (which perhaps won't work for those who haven't seen the TV Series), but for someone like me who was a teenager at the time and remembers the TV series I did find some of these references to be quite funny.Although there is a plot here, it is rather weak and with all the focus being on the cast members perfectly toned bodies or wonderful breasts - like Efron himself I found Daddario's assets something of a distraction, and I also thought that Kelly Rohrbach was pretty hot as well. But this forms part of a problem in the fact that these are the things that you remember about the film and the story takes second place and almost feels inconsequential. Like I say it is the fairly amusing banter between Johnson and Efron that prevents me from completely hating this film.The acting is pretty much as bad as could be expected with, rather unsurprisingly, the 2 people in the film who seemingly haven't been selected for their looks (Johnson and Bass) giving the most engaging performances and it is these 2 actors that come across as being the most believable and 'real' people out of the cast. Efron isn't very good when he's on his own and only works well when he plays off against Johnson. Daddario and Rohrbach are both hot, but they are fairly vapid characters who add very little (apart from the obvious) and the same extends to Hadera who I felt could have been used better. There are a couple of lazy and rather meaningless cameos from ex-stars of the TV Series which add nothing to the film (which strikes as desperation from the producers and with Johnson being one of the producers I thing he should hang his head in shame). I get that the film isn't meant to be taken seriously and I liked the way it made fun of itself a bit, but there's this underlying feeling that Baywatch the film is far too in love with itself and for me this took some of the enjoyment away from my overall viewing experience.",Baywatch
45,r96sk,"Not terrible, but I still wouldn't say you should rush to see this",6,17 August 2020,"It has a couple of decent moments, but 'Baywatch' is mostly uninspiring.For a comedy, it takes itself way too seriously in parts. None of the heartfelt stuff really lands, while a lot of the humour is over reliant on sexual innuendo. The premise is followable, if entirely predictable. The cast is oversized, way too many characters. Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron are good enough in their respective roles as Mitch and Matt.Summer (Alexandra Daddario) and Victoria (Priyanka Chopra) are alright but underdeveloped, as is Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera). C. J. (Kelly Rohrbach) and Ronnie (Jon Bass), meanwhile, are annoying and extremely pointless. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Ellerbee) is solid in a small role.I've never watched the original television series so maybe I missed a few callbacks etc., while there are two (incredibly forced) cameos from it.

I wanted to like this movie, I am a fan of the cast members. I love Dwayne Johnson and I like Zac Efron too. To be fair it wasn't the cast's fault that this film fell short. Johnson, Efron, Daddario, and the rest all did well with their roles and were good picks. To be completely they were the only good parts of the entire movie. Pretty much everything else was poor in quality. The writing is lazy and the ""comedy"" isn't even comedy, it's completely unfunny. The movie uses crude slapstick as the basis for all of its humor and that is lazy. I didn't laugh at any of the moments that were meant for laughs. The action parts of the movie were decent, meaning that they were average. I liked the actors and their chemistry, but that's all, the rest fell flat. 5/10.",Baywatch

48,jadepietro,Seeking Abs + Sol + Lotion,2,30 May 2017,"(RATING: ☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: D THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: This lewd unfunny movie is far from entertaining, but definitely far-fetched.SYNOPSIS: The lifeguards recruit new trainees and fight crime on the sandy beaches of LA.JIM'S REVIEW: Baywatch 2017 is awful. A smutty profanity-laden movie that seems obsessed with boobs and penises. Now you may say, ""Well that's what I expect from this film version of the television series."" and I will say, ""No, you really don't...it's just plain bad."" The salacious streak that runs deep in this new (and not improved) film version loses that tongue-in-cheek humor and innocence of the 90's television series and detours into lewd and titillating shock value tailor-made for the frat-boy mentality.￼Just like any body building competition, the human machines are in good shape and well oiled, ready to pose and preen. The flesh is willing, even if the brain is dead. And Baywatch 2017 is in need of rescue...stat! It barely has a pulse!This movie substitute is has today's audience in mind offering lots of skin, mindless action, and a healthy dose of sleaze whenever the story takes a dive, which is often. A committee of seven led by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift who are credited (or discredited for the resulting non- hilarity) concocted this inane screenplay. Jokes repeatedly fall flat and the double entendres are endless. Just one example of the dialog shows the level of sophistication: ""Why do your balls sound like three-year-olds?"" 'Nuff said?The casting is picture perfect. The new lifeguard family, still sporting that trademark form- fitting red swimsuits are: a likable Dwayne Johnson as Mitch, the patriarch and Big Kahula, Kelly Rohrbach as sexy C. J., Alexandra Daddario as Summer, Ilfenesh Hadera as Stephanie and Zac Efron as Matt, the main reason to see this film. Also in charge of the so-called comic relief is Jon Bass as Ronnie, a nerdy every-man (sans muscle definition, but having a huge ""personality""). His role is an embarrassment of twitches.Much has been made of Mr. Efron's regimen to sculpt his fat-free physique. (Let's just say that Michelangelo's David looks like a puny specimen of mankind by comparison.) His dieting and exercise program has certainly succeeded, and his comedy timing is watchable, among other things.￼As for the script, the minimal plot is in need of a few protein shakes. It involves Mr. Efron's bad- boy character's transformation from egotistical and dim-witted former Olympian champ in need of a PR makeover to a kinder and gentler dim-witted former Olympian champ, under the tutelage of Mr. Johnson's Mitch, the older and supposedly wiser leader. (The bodies aren't the only thing ripped, think back to Ryan Lochte's headlines.) The lifeguards must swing into action to stop drug dealing on the beaches of L.A. Enter Priyanka Chopra as the super villain, and that's no spoiler, as she plays this femme fatale role dressed to kill, literally and figuratively, wearing a host of slinky outfits and stiletto heels. The drugs may wash ashore but subtlety never touches land.Beside the aforementioned dreadful screenplay, much of the blame goes to Seth Gordon's sub- standard direction. Scenes go on endlessly and the comic pacing is off, although the chemistry between the two leads works as well as any routine buddy movie. The film may pay homage to the once popular television series, but even those episodes looked more realistic than this more expensive movie version.Although some moviegoers may become slightly woozy at the bodies on display, Baywatch 2017 may cause cinematic stupor and possibly brain damage. Stay outta the water!",Baywatch

Most of the jokes were in poor taste (making fun of Stevie Wonder and Steve Irwin...really? Calling Zac Efron every boy-band and boyish pop singer there ever was?), the excessive swearing (the original Baywatch aired on regular television and was a success without the potty mouths) was unnecessary, the toilet humour was ridiculously overdone and every character's role so over-exaggerated that at one point I began to wonder if I was watching 'Baywatch' or 'CSI: Miami' the movie.

50,rgkarim,You Bayter Be Ready for Stupid Humor,5,26 May 2017,"""Are you ready? Never full of fear?"" Poor use of the theme song lyrics aside, one might fear for what is to come with the Baywatch movie. If you've read other websites or seen the google news feeds you know this hasn't been doing well. Yet the question remains, is it bad enough to deserve lower than 20%? Robbie K here to ask that question as I hit the theater trenches to scope out the wonders the bay holds in this relaunch. So once more, here are my thoughts on the latest ""hits"" of the Hollywood Box Office!""LIKES:  Some of the comedy  The Beautiful Cast  Dwayne the Rock JohnsonSummary: If you've seen the trailers, you know this movie is going to attempt to be funny, and at times it succeeds. Despite what some reviews say, Baywatch has its clever moments involving slapstick humor and insult bashing. There are numerous references buried in the sand of this movie, and even more punches at the ridiculousness of the legendary series. These quips are fun, tasteful, and on many levels so true at how we ate up the drama. And yes, the cameos are certainly fun to watch and well-timed. But outside of comedy, the main selling point of this movie is the beautiful cast of lifeguards assembled for this movie. The trailers have not sold you any lies in regards to the anatomy in this movie and the sex appeal contained within. Female audience members will certainly enjoy the chiseled features of former wrestler Dwayne Johnson and former Disney Channel singing ""sensation"" Zac Efron. Beefy bodies and plenty of shirtless scenes had a number of my fellow audience members drooling, or at least making sounds. Fear not guys, you'll get plenty of chances to make your own sounds and gawk at the lovely figures of Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach, and Ilfenesh Hadera These visions of loveliness not only have a little spice to add to the mix, but plenty of ""bounce"" to their step that brings energy to the film. In regards to the acting of most of the cast, not bad I must say, but many are reduced to mere shadows of what I had hoped to see. All with the exception of one.The Rock is still cooking up a storm in terms of his acting. He led the comedy for me with solid delivery and timing, his lines perhaps the best written of the whole cast. Using his physical attributes, he does some nice stunt work into the mix helping to add excitement to a rather bland movie. But his greatest contribution is the energy brought to the film, which kept things fun, balanced, and moving at various points. You can guess that this reviewer felt the most solid aspect of the movie was the Rock. DISLIKES:  Most of the comedy  Predictable story  Zac Efron's characterSummary: I said there was some witty moments, but we all knew this was going to be a run of the mill modern comedy. Baywatch is loaded with shallow comedy that is stupid, crude and in many cases lazy writing. You can guess that much of it is centered on the stereotypical sex jokes, including a few shots of the genitalia itself. Other comedic ploys focus on prolonged banter between two characters, who randomly stop in the middle of a crisis to argue their pointsyeah that's funny. Yet many jokes involve taking the clever dialogue and quickly dumping it foryes pointless cursing that quickly grew stale for me.You would think the story could try to make up some of the shortcomings, but no that too failed. It was a predictable plot from start to finish, with all the relationships, turning points, and big twists known within probably 30 minutes. While this should not be too startling, I had hoped that the stunts and suspense could break it up the mundane plot, but this too failed considerably. I get it, it's a cute attempt at making an extended episode reminiscent of the show, but the execution was poor and I think that a stand-up comedy approach might have been better. Yet the worse thing for me was Zac Efron's character. Don't turn click off the review quite yet, hear me out, this is in no way all Efron's fault. The former High School Musical star is playing the same role he always does and is starting to go off the deep end. However, the design of this character was annoying on so many levels that it was hard to not wish a swift end for him. The development was weak at best, minus a few well-developed scenes, and the fact that he had some of the lamer comedic moments didn't help things at all. But when you got the body he built up, I guess you don't have to do much in this movie to win the favor of the audience. The VERDICT:Baywatch is clever at times and fulfills its promise of shallow laughs, Dwayne Johnson having energy and of course the sex appeal. They certainly polished their actors for this one so that audiences would get a feast for their eyes, but sadly that's the only thing this reviewer can share. Baywatch has much balancing to do for the sequel that could come, and really needs to focus on the wittier comedy and less on the innuendos. Certainly, you should hold out for this movie to grace Netflix or RedBox. My Scores are:Action/Comedy/Drama: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",Baywatch
51,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Baywatch,4,29 May 2017,"Have you heard? It's a trend. First with March's CHiPs and now with Baywatch (my latest review). Yeah I'm talking about two hard, R- rated comedies that have almost nothing to do with the television shows they are based on.Baywatch, with its banal outtakes and self-satisfaction at the end credits, is basically CHiPs but with a little less vulgarity. Both flicks have cameos from their former series stars, both have visible penis gags, and yup, both films are pretty freaking stupid. The cheesy, opening titles sequence says ""with Pamela Anderson"" but she has about five seconds of screen time (and a little reconstruction to boot). Then it says ""and David Hasselhoff"". He makes a slightly better impression. Hey, at least Dave's not appearing drunk on YouTube with double cheeseburger in hand (ha-ha).Anyway, Baywatch the movie is not really predicated on saving lives in the water. It's more like a jovial Miami Vice episode by which the tanned lifeguards uncover a criminal operation involving hard drugs. I guess that makes sense. Otherwise, there would be nothing gravitating to fuel Baywatch's surprisingly long, 116-minute running time.In between leads Zac Efron and Dwayne Johnson flexing their jagged abs (Efron is clearly headed towards appearing in this kind of piffle forever), you get flagrant jokes and innuendos that just fall flat. Listen, I like stupid humor and grossness if it actually makes me laugh. With Baywatch, I only chuckled once. Talk about slack writing with the addition of passive character development by Mark Swift and Damian Shannon (as a pair, they mostly pen horror films).In conclusion, if you decide to view Baywatch, you'll get clips involving slimy corpse drippings and full frontal nudity in a morgue. Also, you'll experience an abundance of slow-motion running (of course), incredibly fake CGI fire in a rescue scene, plenty of annoying hip hop tunes as background music, and a main villain that clearly looks like a Kardashian (ugh). In truth, 2004's Starsky and Hutch and 21 Jump Street are films based on TV shows that did it better and with more jocular tones. See them instead. Bottom line: Don't make an effort to ""watch"" Baywatch. Natch.",Baywatch
52,Kingslaay,"Entertaining, fresh and not all that bad",8,27 June 2017,"Baywatch was surprisingly an entertaining film. While a movie like this mike look like a car wreck because people assume its filled with eye candy and lacks substance it actually wasn't. In reality the film was a fresh reboot with a new spin. The plot was decent and nicely tied to the beach where a lot of the illegal drug transport occurred. The cast do a great job to carry this film. They excel in the looks department which is always nice but they manage to deliver on their performances to carry this film. The plot and its villain played very well by Priyanka Chopra were interesting and believable and it also set the stage nicely for the Baywatch crew to overreach and take matters into their own hands. The side plot involving Zac Effron and his inclusion in the team wasn't all that bad either. The focus amid the jokes was on the emphasis of the team and how he flied solo and needed to be a team player, he had earned gold medals individually but never as a team effort. The humor is nicely done and the jokes are actually pretty funny. Most films today have their humor forced and it's often just vulgar and nothing else. Baywatch does its humor very well and it flows well with the film. The scenes with The Rock calling Zac all kinds of names worked well and at one point even called him High School Musical. Another strength is the feel good factor of this film and how it remains mostly positive throughout to give a good experience. Some criticisms include perhaps showing the evil plot in more detail and more screen time for the villain to increase the sense of danger. One big criticism is the soundtrack and the terrible music used mainly throughout the film. The only good song was Lionel Richie and old music would have worked better. Having said that it was somewhat disappointing that this film received bad reviews and ratings. The beauty of this site is the ability to voice an independent opinion based purely on the integrity of a film. If we were going to act like sheep and react the way others do then what is the point of coming on here? This film wasn't all that bad and in reality was a great fresh look at an old classic TV show and good homage was paid. 7.7/10",Baywatch

54,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,The cast does more for the material than the material does for them.,6,1 June 2017,"I've never watched the television series, so I can't compare the two, but this film, judged on its own merit, is all over the place, unable to decide if it's a satire or not, likely due to its lengthy writing credits: the story was begun by Jay Scherick and David Ronn, then rewritten by Thomas Lennon and Robert Garant, before the final screenplay was written by horror film writing team Damian Shannon and Mark Swift.The trio of leads ( Johnson, Efron, and gorgeous Alexandra Daddario ) all have more than enough charisma and charm to carry the threadbare, generic plot about drug smugglers, lead by the lamest villain since that tech geek from Die Hard 4. I couldn't even remember the character's name, until I looked at the IMDb page again. Her character's death is more memorable than the character itself. Also memorable, but for the wrong reasons, is the lengthy scene of Ronnie getting his wang caught between the slats of a deck chair ( in a much maligned scene ) , Efron fondling a corpse's balls, and the numerous puke jokes added merely for gross-out enthusiasts. All of those bits could easily have been edited out, and the film would have been all the more better. Not that it really matters, but the trailer gives away far too much of the film: we don't need the melodrama about whether or not Efron will pass the physical evaluation, or the melodrama about Johnson possibly being fired, the trailer shows what will happen with them, even the dippy little subplot between Robbie and C.J. was revealed in the trailer.During the lengthy closing credits, outtakes are shown, and Johnson talks of a sequel. Naaaahh. I didn't mind this movie as much as others, but have no interest in a sequel. My slightly high rating for this is largely due to my fondness for the cast, who does more for the material than the material does for them. Without this cast, my rating would probably drop to a 4/ 10",Baywatch

56,bkrauser-81-311064,Baywatch is Awash in Suck,6,26 May 2017,"It's a warm, beautiful day on the beach. The pristine waves crash gently against the sand as the sun-kissed folk of Southern Florida come out to play. Lifeguard Post 1 stands like a sentinel - its windows permanently cocked forward towards the horizon. There's a change in the wind. A wind surfer looses control of his sail and is catapulted upward towards the sky before plummeting, head first into a coral reef. He's knocked unconscious...all seems lost. Then Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) appears on the scene.What results is a valiant rescue that inexplicably involves slow-motion running, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson flexing his pectorals underwater, fireworks and dolphins for some reason. The movie could have stopped right there as by that point we got the best version of what could have been the cinematic version of a far-fetched TV show. Unfortunately the first fifteen minutes aren't so much a harbinger of the hilarity to come but rather a visual metaphor for the movie's inflated sense of self.The film energetically sets up its main characters with all-too-brief introductions on tryout day. We immediately endear ourselves veterans Stephanie (Hadera), C.J. (Rohrbach) and Mitch as they judge incoming trainees the tough and brainy Summer (Daddario), the dorky Ronnie (Bass) and disgraced former Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (Efron) whose ego Mitch sees as a liability. Much of the film's prouder moments are spent with The Rock and Efron doing what they do best; The Rock deflating Brody's ego with real-deal charisma and action hero one-liners - Efron playing the dim-witted, put-upon jock who deserves everything he has coming to him because he was in High School Musical (2006).But just when you think everything will turn out for this movie, the narrative drastically shifts to a crime story that stops the movie's momentum cold. The narrative thrust involves the new owner of the beach's fancy yacht club (Chopra) and her suspicious connection to a new designer drug called Flaka. The rest of the movie doesn't so much spend time exploring that connection or its implications (Chopra compares herself favorably to a Bond villain pretty much from the get go) but instead it lays every aspect of the conspiracy out on the table and waits for the lifeguards to connect the dots.This ploy not only doesn't work but it basically splits Baywatch into two completely unsatisfying pieces. The first piece brings a diversity of comic set-pieces which on their own, probably couldn't make a good sketch on Key and Peele (2012-2015). They lack a depth of character requiring one or two of them to be more gullible, less resourceful or otherwise dumber than what was previously established.The other half of the movie plants its flag firmly on The Rock's ability to recap what we already know while Priyanka Chopra chews unhelpfully on the scenery until the timer runs out. All throughout the film drops hints that you should care about this or that - an insert shot of a watch brings more pause than a fiery boat rescue. Yet because nothing new is ever revealed, the film's call for attention becomes soporifically annoying.The overall tone of the film is also aggressively reductive, treating the, in retrospect quaint misogyny of the original series with an uncomfortable amount of contrarian glee. Every time one of the girls of Baywatch justifiably call out the boys for being pervs, the payoff by the end of the film amounts to nothing more than quid pro quo ribbing or worse - they end up with the dude at the end. If Baywatch had just treated the subject as window-dressing, I might have been inclined to let it go (after all trash TV is trash TV). Unfortunately the movie stops just short of waving its d**k in the air while saying ""you think we're being sexist, f**k you bruh!"" Thus I think its worth a brief mention.Baywatch has all the necessary ingredients to make a pretty satisfying comedic soup. Unfortunately apart from The Rock and Efron standing out as the film's sole saving graces, everything else is squandered on a useless story, oblivious editing and a unifying tone that's unnecessarily combative. Unless you're the type of person who truly believes Kelly Rohrbach's slo-mo runs along the beach are enough to maintain your attention, I suggest skipping out on this aggressively unfunny movie.On a related note: Stop with the dorky guy gets the hot girl for doing nothing cliché. It's been done a hundred times before, you're bringing nothing new to the table and it's come to the point where if you do it at all it just feels icky.

Her acting was awful. So much make up but still she was looking ugly man.In Emerald Bay, Florida, Lt. Mitch Buchannon and his team of lifeguards, including second-in-commmand Stephanie Holden and veteran C.J. Parker, protect the beaches and the bay as part of an elite division known as Baywatch. Having made over 500 rescues in his career, Mitch is beloved by the community, to the annoyance of local beat cop Garner Ellerbee and Mitch's superior, Captain Thorpe. During one of his morning patrols, Mitch discovers a small pouch of drugs washed up near the Huntley Club, which is now under the ownership of businesswoman Victoria Leeds.At the upcoming tryouts for new lifeguards, three people stand out: surfer Summer Quinn, an old friend of Holden's, Ronnie, a chubby nerd with a crush on C.J., and Matt Brody, a former Olympic swimmer who fell from grace after vomiting during a race and now has to perform community service as part of an unspecified plea deal. Quinn and Ronnie both pass the trials, but Brody refuses to do so and insists that his celebrity alone entitles him to a place on the team. Despite Brody demonstrating his abilities by assisting in the rescue of a drowning woman and her son, Mitch complains to Thorpe that he is unfit. Thorpe, in turn, insists that rehabilitating his image is necessary to convince the city not to further cut Baywatch's funding.",Baywatch
60,arungeorge13,"Humor, or the lack of it! [+41%]",4,17 August 2017,"Well, here's a film that thinks shoving tonnes of dick jokes (and dicks!) in the face of the viewer will induce laughter. I'd liked Seth Gordon's ""Horrible Bosses"". It sortof struck a balance between good humor and crass humor, and the cast shared great chemistry amongst themselves. But 'Baywatch' is a different scenario altogether. The ensemble comprising of Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Kelly Rohrback all felt like they were playing 'wannabes' in the film. In fact, they seemed to be playing semi-parodies of themselves. There's a far-fetched plot line where a bunch of life-guards try to expose the drug-ring run by Victoria Leeds (played by Priyanka Chopra) and their sordid attempts at evoking hilarity. The group seems to tick-off every stereotype known to hamper the fun element in films such as these. There's the out-of-shape I.T nerd (Jon Bass) who lusts after the hot blonde (Rohrback), the tough woman (Ilfenesh) who's exuding tough-woman vibes 24^7, the young spoilt achiever (Efron; who needs external help to realize his true strengths and the gratification of work in a team rather than alone), the brunette who helps the spoilt dude in 'finding himself', and led by the biggest badass of them all - Mr. Tough Guy Mitch Buchannon (Johnson). The biggest flaw with 'Baywatch' is that the movie sticks to either one of the extremes - deadbeat or downright ridiculous. The women are more or less eye-candy placements, the men make terrible decisions and are subjected to dick-jokes every now and then..in short, the character arcs are not one bit worth the buy. Although, I should be honest in saying that the actors could've performed better had the writing been of higher quality. Even the cameo placements of Hasselhoff and Anderson are executed in a slipshod manner. Chopra impresses in her comparatively less screen-time-occupying role. If your idea of 'awesomeness' is an abundance of boobs, dick-jokes and sloppily executed set-pieces, then this film is for you. 'Baywatch' is at best, a throw-away afternoon watch.Verdict: Not exactly the movie that turns things around for the brand!",Baywatch

62,Troy_Campbell,A fun time at the beach.,6,2 June 2017,"Nobody wanted a cinematic remake of the campy 90s show that cemented David Hasselhoff's enduring legacy as the butt of all jokes. But alas, here it is anyway, in all its Mickey-taking glory. And it's actually better than you would think. Turning up the tongue-in-cheek humour to maximum levels, this updated version throws in everything but the kitchen sink to garner a laugh: toilet and genital gags, racy double entendres, ironic meta-jokes, and ludicrous slow-mo shots. Whilst it's more of a quantity over quality plan of attack—resulting in its fair share of jokes that fall flat—there's a giddy energy that keeps it afloat, with a cast who are game to poke fun at the stereotypes they're playing. Dwayne Johnson is the beefcake leader, Zac Efron is the thrill seeking renegade, Alexandra Daddario is the hardworking rookie, Kelly Rohrback is the blonde bombshell and Jon Bass is the goofy sidekick; and all ham it up wonderfully. When it veers into action territory it loses momentum and interest. A couple of the bigger set pieces, including the finale, are drowned out with cluttered editing, shaky camera-work and poor CGI — and, quite simply, are completely boring. Those sporadic actions sequences threaten to sink proceedings but with its no-holds-barred comedic onslaught and enthusiastically self-deprecating performances, Baywatch is a fun time at the beach.",Baywatch

68,phubbs,Baywatch,3,28 August 2017,"Right, so I know precisely feck all about Baywatch the TV show apart from the fact it starred the legendary David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. Baywatch was always one of those popular things that existed in the background of my younger years, but I simply wasn't interested in it (much like 'Power Rangers', 'Neighbours' or 'Home and Away' for example). It seemed that most young lads would watch Baywatch simply to see Pamela Anderson and co running around in their tight red bathing suits. Being a fan of Ms. Anderson I understood the potential of this but it simply wasn't enough to get me to watch the show. It always came across to me as very lame and extremely vanilla softcore porn, like looking in a women's underwear catalog.This movie is basically all about a team of lifeguards that work together to bring down a nasty entrepreneur who is planning on buying up the whole beach area so she can sell her synthetic street drugs easily. Is that what tended to happen in the TV show each week? Also, I thought this series was set in California? This movie seems to be set in Florida, why is that?Anyway before all the action kicks, in true 'Police Academy' style, the lifeguards are recruiting so cue a lengthy montage of so called comedy and pretty people in swimwear. This also introduces us to the whole gang basically. Lifeguard leader, Lieutenant Mitch Buchannon who is generally an all round perfect human specimen but thinks he has the authority to do anything on and off his beach. Stephanie Holden (IIfenesh Hadera), second in command, cocky and Asian? And C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach), hot blonde who isn't as hot as the original played by Anderson. That's it, that's the team, three people. The new recruits are Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) who is the standard hot brunette. Ronnie (Jon Bass) the stereotypical fat nerdy guy who is somehow picked despite being clearly too fat. And young good looking hotshot Matt Brody (Zac Efron).So as you might expect there are egos flying all over the flippin' place in this movie, satire or not. The movie is pretty much The Rock vs Efron for the most part. Dwayne Johnson is doing his usual all round nice guy charm act interspersed with being really hard when he needs to be. There is also a strong family theme running though the movie that Mitch himself promotes at every turn with his team (ugh!!). Whilst Brody is the stereotypical dimwitted pretty boy that starts off all big-headed, gets taken down a peg or two and then proves himself. At the start Brody must complete this pointless obstacle course only to find out he must then complete Mitch's weightlifting obstacle course, which was equally pointless. I guess it was to show Brody up and prove he wasn't ready? Or it was just pointless, you decide.Admittedly the fast put-downs that Mitch throws at Brody are highly amusing and brutal. Whilst in conversation Mitch calls Brody 'High School Musical', 'One Direction', 'Bieber', 'Malibu Ken', 'Baby Gap' etc...At the same time Mitch also throws out some epic lines such as 'I'm oceanic motherf*cker!'. Most of the reasonably funny stuff comes from either Johnson or Efron as they clash nipples. The rest of the cast are useless and merely there to either look pretty or attempt to be funny. Jon Bass as fat Ronnie is not funny, he is of no use in the movie and he does literally nothing. The opening visual gag of him getting his nuts stuck in a wooden deckchair was pitiful. The girls were...umm...very nice in their red swimsuits. Attempts were clearly made to give them brains and useful scenes but alas...The villain was also a female played by Priyanka Chopra, she was very beautiful, that is all.The main joke in this movie that obviously pokes fun at the TV show (presumably because I don't actually know), is the fact that these lifeguards actually have no real power. They are merely lifeguards that stop people from drowning and keeping the beach safe from...littering, sexual acts, crime I guess...whatever. The whole point is they aren't cops, they can't go after drug dealers, they can't have car chases and they can't infiltrate anywhere. Mitch has a hard time understanding this with his heroic gung-ho attitude, plus he's also backed up by Stephanie and C.J. which doesn't help. Ironically its only dumbass Brody that seems to understand this.The main problem I had with this movie aside from the terrible dialog, horrendous acting, f*cking dreadful CGI, f*cking dreadful green- screen, God-awful action sequences, immature facepalm comedy and completely unstructured plot, aside from all that. One single thing, is this supposed to be an actual serious action flick? I know that sounds incredible because you'd think this was an obvious spoof like many other movies of dated TV shows. But yes, I ask, is this supposed to be serious because at times I just couldn't tell! At points there are moments of stupidity for sure, as if the director forgot to put that kinda of material in. But for the most part this felt like a genuine action movie, like they actually took it relatively seriously. Hilarious really because its so unbelievably bad.So yeah, this movie is flippin' garbage. Chock full of obligatory rap music. Lots of little jabs using identity politics, again apparently obligatory now. And a cameo by David Hasselhoff that doesn't make any real sense. Hasselhoff appears to Rock-Mitch and begins to teach him in a spiritual kind of way. So he's supposed to be some kind of mentor? From where? Mentor of what? Then we also get a mute cameo from Pamela Anderson; just walks on screen in slow motion and done. A predictable, throwaway, waste of everyone's time and money. 3/10",Baywatch
69,aciessi,"Washed Up, Dead on Arrival.",2,24 May 2017,"Comedy is dead. Baywatch has made me lose any hope of any movie being funny in 2017. If this is the best Hollywood can do, they are done for.There is no inspiration or creativity to be found. The idea is: Hey, 21 Jump Street was hilarious! What would happen if we did the same thing for (fill in the blank)? 21 Jump Street was one of the rare occasions where a TV-adaptation film was worth seeing, and ultimately, ended up being better than the source material. What was Baywatch originally? A horrible TV show in the 80's. It existed only to show off the glistening, bouncing, beautiful bodies of it's lead actors David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. There isn't much material to make a film off of. That is, unless, the filmmakers went nuts and turned the source material into an absurd farce.. lets say of the Will Ferrel variety. Instead, Baywatch 2017 is a lopsided, painfully stupid, unbearably dull, cringe- inducing insult to the intelligence of the filmgoing public. Pain and Gain had more nuanced humor. Mike and Dave was the funnier Zac Efron movie. Let that sink it.I might have said, ""This makes no sense"", out-loud in the movie theater about 10 times. They made a film completely out of action-comedy clichés, strung together incoherently. The big laugh set- pieces are desperate. One joke in particular is a genital mishap lifted directly from ""There's Something About Mary"". That joke is 20-years old. If you're going to be a thief, at least steal something timely. The cast might be the only positive thing I can note. They are all really charming, and sexy to look at, but at what cost?I couldn't think of a worse film to be slated for Memorial Day weekend.

Apparently there is just way too much testosterone when they are together in the same movie. The screen (big screen included) is just not large enough to contain their competing egos. I was so disappointed to see the Rock basically bullying Efron at ever chance he got. The script was a total mess. One is never sure if this was supposed to be a fluff piece or a semi-serious murder mystery, or WHAT???!? Not sure if I can really recommend this, even to Johnson and Efron fans.",Baywatch
71,rockman182,Baywatch (2017),7,29 May 2017,"I'm a giant fan of Kelly Rohrbach. I met her three times and at the latest time I asked her about her role on Baywatch. She said she was nervous about it, I told her she would do well and I'd be there in the theaters to watch her film debut. Fast forward a year, and this has happened. Kelly was so great and unbelievably sexy in the film which is great. That's really not all though. I'm not gonna lie I had a bit of a blast watching this film. Its stupid and crude but its a lot of fun and gave me all of what I was expecting.The film is about a group of lifeguards on a beach and three trainees who try to make it into the squad. Once they join the team they realize all is not what it seems on the beach. Murder's are being covered up and drugs are being embezzled through the beach and the team must take the responsibility of uncovering what's going on while protecting their beach. I have never seen the TV show but from what I've heard the film is more R-rated and a bit more comedic than the TV show. I'll take it. I don't care what the critics say this film was satisfying. Its raucous and cheesy but fun. Its excessive on dick jokes, but you'll leave. The plot is pretty predictable but I can forgive it. The soundtrack is GREAT too, although I'll say the song placement isn't always great.The main complaint I have is some characters really being bland. Especially that of Alexandra Daddario and Ilfenesh Hadera weren't developed and had no real depth. Hadera should have had more going on and it seemed like the ""love story"" between her was a bit under-filled. There was longing with these characters. Also wasn't that keen on the beauty and the geek scenario that was hammered in. I also didn't buy Priyanka Chopra as a villain. Hasslehoff and Pamela Anderson's names should be taken off the opening credits just for the nostalgic surprise appearances.I also really liked that the film was self-aware. It was aware of the climate of the TV show, just like how they mention how everyone can see people moving in slow motion. I can't deny that Dwayne Johnson is a born movie star. Can do action and comedy equally and he always has great compatibility with Zac Efron (he always does well in the buddy scenario). All the jokes don't land but Efron provides some good comedy. Overall, there's a few laughs, a generic and predictable plot, but its a very fun time. It's a perfect summer movie with some 10/10 babes on the bitch. Its a lot of fun, enjoy. I hope there's a sequel.7.5/10",Baywatch
72,jon.h.ochiai,Beauty doesn't conquer Stupid,7,28 May 2017,"In ""Baywatch"" beauty doesn't conquer stupid. It ends up a tie at best, on points. People Magazine's 2017 Sexiest Man Alive Dwayne Johnson, ""The Rock"", stars as iconic lifeguard Mitch Buchannon in Director Seth Gordon's ""Baywatch""—his recreation and homage to the worldwide TV syndication phenom. All the lifeguards, sans one by narrative, are stunningly beautiful. In reassuring self-mockery Gordon vividly recreates the classic ""slow-mo"" running shots of his stars in homage to the original series. In the introductory beach sequence, wannabe life guard Ronnie, played by charming soft-bodied geek Jon Bass, gazes longingly at the crush of his life C.J. Parker, played by beautiful, sweet former Sports Illustrated Model Kelly Rohrbach, as she runs emerging from the ocean. It's a shame on several levels, because the cast like Rohrbach and Johnson are amazingly beautiful, and they are also charismatic, funny, and charming. Unfortunately, those attributes are distinctly lacking in Damian Shannon and Mark Swift's dreadfully erratic screenplay. A real embarrassment. Along with Rohrbach and The Rock, Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario bring their comically charming A-games. Efron is totally jacked; his body is ripped beyond, giving even The Rock competition. Efron plays disgraced 2-time Olympic swimming Gold Medalist bad-boy Matt Brody, a thinly veiled caricature of Ryan Lochte. Except here, Efron infuses more heart and character to bear as Brody. Daddario plays Summer, the young marine biologist whose dream is being the lifeguard who saves others. Efron's Brody quickly falls for Summer upon their meeting at Baywatch tryouts. Daddario endures the movie's blatant boob punch line, brilliantly understating her smarts, and radiance. Well, nuance is not inherent to ""Baywatch"" given the campy source material of the TV series. However, the narrative tonal currents make your headache. At the lifeguard tryouts Johnson's Mitch iterates that at Baywatch, ""We save lives."" In the awesome opening scene Mitch courageously saves an unconscious surfer from certain death. Later Mitch and Brody dramatically save the drowning Mother and her two young children near the pier. Offset this with Director Gordon numerous penis jokes, and incoherent story-line, and you'll both laugh and scratch your head. Farce and self-mockery don't mix, mainly because they are redundant. ""Baywatch"" is stupid, funny. More often it is stupid, stupid. There is one sequence where Johnson fights the bad guy with baby toys. Yeah. The Rock is the coolest action star, so this makes absolutely no sense. Johnson is at his movie star best as Mitch—charming, bright, and swag. He and Efron have the very cool screen partnership and bromance. When Efron's Brody arrives at Baywatch he expects his entitled pass to lifeguard, because of his Olympic Gold. Mitch and second-in-command Stephanie played by gorgeous and under leveraged Ilfenesh Hadera, tell him, ""We don't give a f***!"" Brody predictably lets Mitch down. In the nice scene Mitch tells Brody, ""I watched you win your 2 gold medals in the Olympics. It was amazing"" But Brody did that alone. He is part of a team now. He enlightens Brody that he is a selfish jerk. Mitch sees greatness in Brody; he needs to grow up. Shannon and Swift's script fails miserably, instead opting for the ridiculous story-line about evil femme fatale Victoria, played by exasperating Priyanka Chopra, and her drug trafficking scheme of the meth-like designer drug in hopes of owning all real estate in Emerald Bay. However, not at all threatening, Victoria lands as extremely annoying, more the effect of the writing. Instead of more charm of the whimsical Mitch-Brody bromance, we get stupid morgue jokes that extend way too long. In the inadvertent signature moment Brody offers his hysterical misinterpretation of computer networks while Ronnie attempts to hack into the villain's secure server. Ronnie tells Brody, ""It's a good thing you're pretty."" Pretty alone isn't enough to save ""Baywatch"". There is the spectacular montage as the Baywatch lifeguards all run in classic slow-mo on the beach. Seeing those perfectly sculpted bodies in red Speedos is stunning and the sentimental homage. The actors in ""Baywatch"" are both beautiful and gifted. It's a shame that ""Baywatch"" didn't save them as well.",Baywatch

74,RforFilm,"While it's stay in the water is over-welcome, Baywatch embraces it's own stupidity enough that I think It's misunderstood",6,3 June 2017,"If you go back and look at the old Baywatch episodes, you can tell that not only was this show pitched by men, but men who were probably twenty-plus year subscribers to Playboy. Yeah, there were stories about sharks, diamond smugglers, and beachcombing thieves, Baywatch was merely an excuse to show pretty people, especially women in tight bikinis, trying to do things that lifeguards mostly do. It wasn't anything special, but it was popular (so much so that people used to call it ""Babewatch"", given that a lot of the cast members were former models of Playboy) and is a piece of the 1990's culture.Making a movie of Baywatch is a tough, but not impossible task. Sort of like how The Brady Bunch Movie was a parody, I can only see a Baywatch movie working in the same stance. The same idea had been adopted for movies based on Starsky & Hutch, CHiPS, and 21 Jump Street. Baywatch can fit within these other movies as they all share the distinction of being time capsules of their era by accident. Not that they were bad series', but they could only embrace their setups rather then try to be one of the best. Let's see if Baywatch can make the cinematic translation.In Emerald Bay, Florida, Lt. Mitch Buchannon (played by Dwayne Johnson) runs the ""Baywatch"" lifeguard patrol with both an iron fist and a high ego. His fellow guards include C.J. (played by Kelly Rohrbach), and Stephanie (played by Ilfenesh Hadera) are holding their annual tryouts where several hopefuls come to join the team. Newcomers include the geeky Ronnie (played by Jon Bass) the quick-thinking Summer (played by Alexandra Daddario) and Olympic swimmer Matt Brody (played by Zac Efron). Matt had disgraced himself in the last games to the point where his lifeguarding is a part of a plea deal for community service. Mitch isn't too happy to have him on the team, but his superiors tell him to deal with it.After an incident where they all save a bunch of people from a burning yacht, a body on board is identified as a city official. Mitch starts to see this along with bags of drugs washing up on shore started to happen when businesswoman Victoria Leeds (played by Priyanka Chopra). Despite being told that the crimes are out of their jurisdiction, Mitch, Matt, and the rest of the Baywatch gang try to see if Victoria is behind all of this. Let me make this clear. Baywatch is dumbbut the movie is completely aware that it's dumb and honestly has fun with it. It's clear that the movie is trying to replicate 21 Jump Street where not only is a comedy, but goes for the R rating to allow F-bombs and a couple of penises on screen. Does it all work. No, but there is a lot of moments where I laughed. The film does it's best to utilize it's stars, especially the comedic potential with Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron.That is probably its biggest strengththe stars. I know nothing about the Baywatch series, but I'll guess that it took some creative liberties with their characters. I doubt there would be someone as geeky as Ron or dumb as Matt was on the series. Again, the movie is a parody and understands that by embracing it's own madness, it has a better chance. What's odd is that my favorite was the villain, Priyanka Chopra, who carries a lot of charisma for an actress I haven't heard of (No, I haven't seen her Bollywood work). I hope she becomes more prominent.What prevents Baywatch from reaching the same levels as 21 Jump Street is it's story and pacing. While there is nothing wrong with a drug invasion story, it still feels too standard and confining for the world it's in. At one point, they point out some plots of the old TV show that I wish I'd see used for the movie (like surfers smuggling diamonds). The pacing unfortunately drags to a two-hour movie that not only makes it too long, but allows a lot of unfunny jokes to stay. In fact, there were a couple of characters that if you were to cut out (like Ron and C.J.), I don't think it would have affected the story. At least a half hour should have been cut.I'll give this six lifeguard rescue tubes out of ten. While I'm glad I saw this movie, it does get lost a couple of times. Though it could have used some more saving, it does enough to stay afloat.",Baywatch
75,Anurag-Shetty,Could have been so much better.,7,6 June 2017,"Baywatch is the big screen remake of the 1989 TV series of the same name. Mitch Buchannon(Dwayne Johnson) is a dedicated lifeguard who would do anything for the bay. Along with the rest of his team including, Stephanie Holden(Ilfanesh Hadera), CJ Parker(Kelly Rohrbach), Summer Quinn(Alexandra Daddario) & Ronnie Greenbaum(Jon Bass), Mitch saves lives on the bay, at any cost. A reckless new recruit named Matt Brody(Zac Efron), joins the lifeguard team. Mitch & Matt have to reluctantly work together, when a sinister plan threatens to tear the bay apart. Baywatch is a good movie. However, it could have been so much funnier & entertaining than it was. With comedy experts like Dwayne Johnson & Zac Efron, this film could have been laugh-out-loud hilarious. However, the script by Damian Shannon & Mark Swift is pretty tame & all this movie elicits, are a few chuckles here & there. Director Seth Gordon tries his best but, this film pales in comparison with his previous directorial effort, Horrible Bosses(2011). The cinematography by Eric Steelberg is gorgeous. The beaches of Miami look breathtaking. The action set pieces are brilliant. Acting-wise, there is nothing to fault. However, with this talented ensemble, there was potential to make Baywatch as iconic as its TV counterpart. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Mitch Buchannon. Zac Efron is amazing as Matt Brody. Priyanka Chopra is mind blowing as Victoria Leeds. I just wish Chopra was given more screen time. Alexandra Daddario is superb as Summer Quinn. Kelly Rohrbach is impressive as CJ Parker. Ilfanesh Hadera is effective as Stephanie Holden. Johnson, Efron, Chopra, Daddario, Rohrbach & Hadera all have perfect bodies, in keeping with the look of the TV show. Jon Bass is hysterical as Ronnie Greenbaum. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is outstanding as Sgt. Ellerbee. Hannibal Buress' vast comedic talent is wasted in his minor role as, Dave the Tech. Rob Huebel is awesome as Captain Thorpe. Amin Joseph, Jack Kesy & Oscar Nunez are decent as, Frankie, Leon & Councilman Rodriguez, respectively. David Hasselhoff & Pamela Anderson are excellent in their cameos as, The Mentor & Casey Jean Parker, respectively. Baywatch is not a must watch.

After watching the new action/comedy BAYWATCH, I can firmly state without hesitation:ZAC EFRON IS A VERY GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MANBased on the cheesecake television show of the 1980's that made ""The Hoff"" a household name and launched the careers of a bevy of beauties, this incarnation of Baywatch made an interesting choice.It has toned down the cheesecake (girls) and turned up the beefcake (boys).Don't get me wrong, there still is a myriad of ladies in bathing suits and plenty of slo-motion running, but Director Seth Gordon (HORRIBLE BOSSES) has chosen to linger more on the ripped bods of the two male stars of this film - Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and the aforementioned Mr. Efron. I'm sure the excuse that the filmmakers will trot out is that the plot is centered around the Mentor/Mentee relationship of Johnson and Efron while the entire Baywatch team focuses their attention on an undercover crime that...Oh, who am I kidding. The focus of this film is the beefcake and cheesecake, the plot is superfluous and the humor and plot machinations are just there to get the good looking leads in this film to strip down to shorts or bathing suits. If they can get wet at the same time - all the better.This film purports itself to be a comedy. You might ask me, ""is it funny""? My answer is ""meh"", funny enough, I guess. There are some funny folks in this film - Hannibal Buress, for example - that aren't utilized to the extent that they could have and cameos by the 2 most famous folks in Baywatch history (I'll let you figure this out) aren't nearly as effective as they need to be. But the relationship between Johnson and Efron is good enough and Alexandra Daddario (SAN ANDREAS), Priyanka Chopra (QUANTICO) and Kely Rohrbach (some minor roles, but - basically - her big screen debut) are all equally ""good enough"" to make this movie a passable way to spend 2 hours. Only Jon Bass (LOVING) rises above the material. Ilfenesh Hadera (CHI-RAQ) had a chance to rise above - if only they would have given more (or at least SOMETHING) to do.But...let's be honest...you don't come to this movie for the acting, the intricate plot lines or the comedy. You come to see good looking people in swimsuits running on the beach.And...on that score, this film delivers.Letter Grade: C+5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Baywatch
77,Ruskington,"As long as you accept it as a goofy comedy, this is actually pretty decent",6,13 April 2020,"I watched this film with extremely low expectations, fully expecting to hate it. And it certainly shared a lot of the characteristics that make many Hollywood blockbusters so unpalatable.Impossibly attractive lead characters? Check. Ridiculously unrealistic plot? Check. Over-the-top special effects? Check. Predictable romances? Check. Cheesy dialogue? Check. Coarse vulgarity? Check.And yet despite all this, I actually quite enjoyed it. This film doesn't take itself too seriously and is quite satirical in places, almost to the point of being a parody of the original TV series. There is a refreshing lack of pretentiousness and the cast are surprisingly likeable.Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario are so ridiculously good-looking they actually stop being good-looking and basically just become a meme. Both perform pretty well throughout the film, striking up a decent enough on-screen chemistry. Kelly Rohrbach has all the beauty of Pamela Anderson but is a lot more wholesome and congenial. Jon Bass plays the all-too familiar quick-witted goofy nerd, but he does it well and has some good moments. I reserve judgement on Dwayne Johnson however, as I still cannot be sure if he is taking himself seriously or not. He's either a great comic actor or the most cringeworthy guy in Hollywood.The film is let down by a dire plot that chugs along aimlessly. Pryanka Chopra is a tedious Bond-villain and most of her scenes are fairly painful to watch. The long-winded ending of the film is a bit excessive and, coupled with the unnecessary two-hour duration, it makes it hard to remain interested. With a more original script and a shorter runtime, this could have been a really solid production.This sort of movie does have its place- as long as it's done well- and Baywatch scrapes a pass mark. Anybody expecting more than lowbrow tomfoolery will be rightfully disappointed, but those looking for a nice Friday night wind-down movie should be reasonably satisfied.",Baywatch
78,dave-mcclain,"Almost everything in ""Baywatch"" is ridiculous and unfunny.",1,25 May 2017,"Fun fact: The original TV show ""Baywatch"" was cancelled after only one season. True story. Ratings for NBC's skin-tastic lifeguards-save-L.A. action-drama placed it in 73rd place out of 103 shows for the 1989-1990 television season and its studio (GTG) went out of business. But, as Norm McDonald used to remind us from the desk of SNL's Weekend Update, ""Germans LOVE David Hasselhoff."" (And people in lots of other countries do too!) Keeping the show from becoming a footnote in TV history, series star David Hasselhoff brought it to first-run syndication, where it ran from 1991-1999. Having become an international sensation, it then continued in a new setting, with a mostly new cast and under a new name, ""Baywatch Hawaii"", for two more seasons. Along the way, the show became a major part of the careers of Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, Yasmine Bleeth, Carmen Electra, Brooke Burns, Parker Stevenson and many others. Given the show's small screen stamina and enduring popularity, it seems natural that the TV show ""Baywatch"" would eventually become the movie ""Baywatch"" (R, 1:56), much like ""CHiPs"" earlier in 2017. Unfortunately, much like ""CHiPs"", the big screen ""Baywatch"" sucks.On a Florida beach, Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) leads a group of lifeguards that he calls ""the elite of the elite"". Mitch himself has over 500 water rescues under his trunks, while teammates Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera) and C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) are similarly brave and skilled. In order to expand their team, Mitch and company hold try-outs for an additional three lifeguard slots. The new trainees end up being: the beautiful and brainy Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario), an awkward, out-of-shape but hard-charging nerd named Ronnie (Jon Bass) and Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a cocky, selfish 2-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming, who has since become persona non grata in the swimming world – and in society. (His new job somehow counts as community service for unspecified legal trouble.) As Ronnie harbors a not-so-secret crush on C.J., and Brody flirts with Summer, training commences. Brody has to learn what it is to be a real team player and that there is more to being a lifeguard than just being able to swim fast. Meanwhile, a local police officer (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), Mitch's supervisor (Rob Huebel), and even Brody, want Mitch to learn that he is a lifeguard – NOT a cop.The reason that Mitch and the other lifeguards feel the need to act like cops is found in the person of Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra from TV's ""Quantico""). She's the new owner of a bayside resort called The Huntley Club and it looks like she's up to no good. We hear her accused of running drugs and she doesn't deny it. We see her colluding with a city councilman (Oscar Nuñez) on some real estate deal and see bribes him with an expensive watch. We understand that Mitch doesn't trust her and she invites him to a party. At this ""meet the neighbors"" gathering, Mitch and company do their best to dig up some dirt to back up their suspicions, but Leeds is a wily woman and proof is harder to find than body fat on Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron. When packets of a dangerous designer drug pop up, plus a suspicious fire and a couple of corpses, naturally it's up to a few lifeguards to solve the mystery, right? That's what the Baywatch babes and boys think anyway. And that's just part of what's wrong here.""Baywatch"" is mostly ridiculous and unfunny. What passes for character development are back stories which raise more questions than they answer. What passes for acting are one-dimensional characterizations which aren't believable or even sensical. And what passes for humor basically falls into one of three categories: references to the areas of the human body usually covered by swim suits, vomit jokes and seeing how many pop culture references Mitch can come up with to insult young pretty boy Brody (although some were funny) – and the best gags are all in the theatrical trailers. The screenplay, by writing partners Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, puts the characters in situations which are more insulting to the intelligence of the average Movie Fan than they are humorous. Seth Gordon's direction is too weak to make sense of it all or to give the audience more than a few chuckles along the way.The acting is across-the-board bad, but the worst of the worst is a tie between Bass, for simply doing a 2-hour Josh Gad impression, and Chopra, for showing nowhere near the gravitas or menace necessary to be an effective villain with a (dis)honorable mention to the usually entertaining Johnson, who ends up in his worst role since 2013's ""Pain & Gain"". For a few amusing moments and for poking self-aware fun at its source material, the film scores minor points, but it basically can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a parody or a drama and it doesn't do any of those very well. (But don't gloat Dax Shepherd. ""CHiPs"" made most of the same mistakes.) ""Baywatch"" would be better titled ""No Way Watch"". This movie is as lame as that pun I just made. In a mid-credits scene, Johnson talks sequel with a cast member from the original TV show. Don't hold your breath, Dwayne.

The slow motion stunts or Dwayne Johnson jumping into the water in slow motion really got old after some time. Zac Efron wasn't much better in that case but at least some of their little intimate battles were fun, at least more fun than the story itself which felt like it was copied from a TV episode and enlarged into an overlong episode or overlong movie in that case.

There were a lot of problems with the film but above all that the characters talk like they are trying to make it entertaining knowing that it's filled with problems. A lot of scenes and dialogues felt like taken right out of a cartoon show and it worked for me. Then there was Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach who helped me forget the rest of the problems.

87,CANpatbuck3664,Baywatch is Uneven and Silly but It's Also Funny and Entertaining,8,22 May 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) is the head lifeguard and public face of Baywatch. He takes his job seriously and he not only saves lives but he's also beloved by everyone on the beach. The story picks up on a day where new recruits are trying out to enter Baywatch's training program. We meet a few of the possible finalists, they range from the enthusiastic Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) to underdog Ronnie Greenbaum (John Bass). He's a regular on the beach but he spends his time drooling over lifeguard CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrback). Another potential lifeguard, Matt Brody (Zach Efron) is a former 2 time Olympic gold- medallist who has fallen on hard times. The head of the Baywatch program; Captain Thorpe (Rob Huebel) is shoving Brody down Buchannon's throat as he's only available to them through Brody's community service. Adding to Buchannon's troubles is business mogul Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra). She's swiftly gaining more power in the Bay area through her newly purchased club. Will Mitch be able to properly indoctrinate his chosen recruits and get to the bottom of Victoria's shady behaviour? I got to see Baywatch early through an advance screening. The success of the original Baywatch was something that didn't make sense. The show was before my time but it was regularly mocked for being extremely cheesy. People often used it as an excuse to check out Pamela Anderson and Yasmine Bleeth. So the 2017 movie version of Baywatch has to pay tribute to the source material yet update this story for a new generation. I'm happy to say that Baywatch has no problem making fun of it's roots and they often come up with creative ways to do it. They aren't quite as meta but the constant slow- motion running and these lifeguards working outside their job descriptions are repeatedly mocked and skewered. The overall plot is outlandish and ridiculous but the movie doesn't sidestep that issue, it addresses it continuously and has fun making fun of it alongside the audience. Does the movie drift too far into implausibility? Absolutely but you can't take this movie seriously. It completely unravels if you do. This isn't an issue just for Baywatch. If a movie can acknowledge how unrealistic it is, I can try to go along with it and Baywatch had the good sense to do this.I really liked most of the marketing for Baywatch but the movie I got to watch was different from what I expected. The trailers billed this as more of a straight comedy but this ended up being more of an action/comedy. The action in this is decent, the movie is pretty fetishistic for slow-motion but I would still give it a passing grade. They luckily keep most of it light and it largely looks good (minus some pretty bad looking CGI fire). But the reason to see this is the comedy. The movie relies on gross-out humour a little too much at points but the comedic dialogue was really solid and the theatre I saw it in was laughing throughout the movie. The strong chemistry between Dwayne and Zac helps and while I had some small issues with the jokes, I thought they were pretty good.This movie has a big and admittedly attractive cast that help this movie skirt around narrative issues. Dwayne is his normal charismatic self and his likable demeanour is key for this movie working. Zac shows again that he's an underrated comedic actor and he's really strong with The Rock and by himself. Kelly Rohrbach is funny but even the movie makes no bones about how she's there because of stunning she is. I liked Alexandra and Ilfenesh, both were good but the movie didn't give either of them much to do. I was kind of mixed on Jon Bass and I liked Hannibal Burress in his role. If someone surprised me it was Priyanka Chopra. Her character of Victoria is really cliché and the movie seemed almost determined to make you roll your eyes whenever the story moves back to her. But through her ability and her charisma, she takes a lacklustre character and actually delivers a memorable performance.Getting to what I didn't like about Baywatch, the biggest thing is that the movie can't seem to quit while they're ahead. They fail to realize when to move away from certain jokes and they're guilty of this more than a few times. This is especially evident when you focus on Ronnie. Jon Bass is funny as this character but his awkwardness is dialed up so much that they run his material into the ground almost every time. It's also a little hard to determine how much Baywatch wants to be taken seriously. The movie goes for straight slapstick and then they will suddenly launch into how the Bay is in serious jeopardy without any transition. That kind of tonal switch can be done but they just couldn't sell it completely. This movie faces an uphill battle because it will be compared to cinematic success stories like 21 and 22 Jump Street. More recently, you also had the re-imagining of CHIPS. Does Baywatch hit that extremely high bar set by the Jump Street franchise? No but it also laps CHIPS pretty easily. The comparison to 21 Jump Street is fair with this being in the same genre but I feel like people forget how special those movies were. Jump Street came out of nowhere and they achieved universal acclaim when you just don't get that for comedies. Baywatch can't completely distract from how ridiculous the plot is and the movie needed a tighter edit. But the movie is really funny, it features a good cast of actors/actresses that sell out for it and the movie does a good job celebrating/making fun of it's source material. I might be in the minority for this one but I'd give it a 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10.",Baywatch

93,The_Light_Triton,A sexy movie that is understandably disliked,5,29 May 2017,"Let's get the obvious out of the way. This is a remake of the '89 to '01 TV series, Baywatch. How does Hollywood remake it's classic TV? First, they take what was a serious show and turn it into a comedy. Then, they throw in a few unnecessary F-bombs. Then they include a lot of sex jokes, some of which are funny and others that are just stupid. They usually include one or two cast members from the original show (Of course it's going to be Hasselhoff and Anderson, who else?) And they throw in a bad guy, or in this movie, a bad girl.And that is how Hollywood does remakes. They did that with Dukes of Hazzard, They did it with Starsky & Hutch, they did it with CHiPs, every remake had the same setup.Set at Emerald bay, Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is a lifeguard who takes his job seriously. Backed up by the lovely C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) and Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) and a few other co-workers, Mitch is setting up tryouts for the openings to the Baywatch team. While several potential lifeguards are putting an effort into their work, Former Gold Medalist Matt Brody (Zac Efron) is there for his own benefit. He and Mitch are at constant odds, when a series of drug packets, and bodies wind up on the shores of Emerald bay.To be honest, I enjoyed this movie despite not really seeing the original show. I only watched Baywatch once during it's run. I was 7 years old at the time. It wasn't long after the episode ended I walked around with rigor mortis in my shorts that my mom said I shouldn't watch it anymore.I can understand why people hate this movie - It takes it's source material, beloved by many just the way it is and dirties it up with a lot of swearing, unnecessary sex humor and other gross material. Some moments are funny, others make you shake your head.But, I liked it. I'm not saying it's the greatest movie of the summer, because it's not.

96,EthanBJones_03,There is a solid 1 1/2 minutes of this movie dedicated to Zac Efron groping a dead guy's genitals; That is this review summed up,4,21 June 2017,"'BAYWATCH' was directed by Seth Gordon and stars Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron and Priyanka Chopra. When a dead body washes up on shore, Mitch and his team of lifeguards launch a full scale investigation to uncover the truth behind this sinister plot.Let me start by saying I've never watched the TV show and thus have no bias either way in this review. That said, I actively disliked this movie. Johnson's charisma and Efron's dead guy fetish do not keep this movie from sinking(no pun intended). It's a lazily written script that devolves into toilet humour, which some genuinely clever and funny jokes sprinkled in that NO ONE aside from myself laughed at at my screening. The demographic for this movie will be primarily fans of the show, and fans of this toilet humour. If you like that, fine but don't tell me it is comedic genius or the best comedy ever made because I will punch you.I mean you don't watch this film for the plot but I may as well comment on it for those who have a positive intelligence quotient. It's a messy, incoherent blur of random plot threads that are messily stitched together to form something resembling a plot. It's not interesting. It's not clever. It's not even cheesy in the fun way. It's just a bland, dull by-the-numbers drug plot that tries to act smarter than it is(the villain actually says that mid film) and ultimately fails.Now for the positives. All the acting was spot on from Dwayne Johnson to Zac Efron to Alexandra Daddario, with the exception of one. Johnson is disturbingly charismatic and Efron is a dumb guy. Both actors have been typecast but it works well in the context of the film. Jon Bass was good as the comic relief and didn't come of as forced(sometimes). He was funny in most of his scenes. The only performance in this movie I cannot praise was Pryanka Chopra. She was a cliché villain with a cliché plan and gave a very dull, not even cheesy fun performance.This movie is competently shot and edited but if you are considering watching this film(or have already watched it, disagree with me and are gonna down-vote this because our opinions differ) then you probably aren't looking for technical perfection. There was an overuse of slow motion, however. I get this was a thing in the show but they could have reigned it in... a lot. The visual effects in this movie are some of the worst I've ever seen put to film, with any indication of effort. 'The Last Airbender' was more realistic in its entirety than this movie was in TWO fire/explosion effects. They were abysmal and even George Lucas would cringe looking at them.Now for the main concern, is the film funny. Yes and No. There are some jokes, as stated before, that are clever and will make you laugh if you pay attention. That and the comic relief was also pretty good. Aside from that and some of Johnson's charisma, the comedy devolves to toilet humour. TWO of the leading jokes in this movie and related to a man's (use your imagination) and neither of them work. They are lazy, go on way too long and are played just as a cheap gag and as a way to bloat screen time. Then there is the atrocious action. This movie had two main action sequences and both are awful. They look fake as heck and don't have the credibility to make them fall into the cheesy fun category. If you enjoyed this movie, good for you; don't rub it in my face. If you haven't seen this movie(which I imagine you haven't), I cannot recommend it. It's cheap, lazy and has little redeeming qualities. I'll rate it a generous 4 Taint Jokes out of 10.",Baywatch
97,Mike_Devine,Better off just going to the beach,2,13 May 2018,"'Baywatch' was a long running series that was largely successful because it didn't take itself too seriously. 2017's film adaptation pays homage to its source material, but instead could not possibly take itself any less seriously.Unsurprisingly, the cast of characters who make up the Emerald Bay crew include Dwayne Johnson (what movie isn't he in?) and Zac Efron, plus standard eye candy in Kelly Rohrbach and Alexandra Daddario. Since this is a silly, juvenile comedy, we are graced with the likes of Jon Bass's Ronnie Greenbaum, who does anything he possibly can do to embarrass himself in front of his crush, CJ (Rohrbach).At its core, 'Baywatch' is a loose drug bust wrapped in a slapstick comedy (sound familiar, '21 Jump Street'?), as the lifeguards try to get to the bottom of why mysterious drugs keep washing up on their beach, which then leads to other, more sinister things. Efron plays a disgraced Olympic swimmer who is sentenced to serve as a lifeguard, and let's just say people do not take too kindly to him at first. Businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) also charms the lifeguard crew with a fancy club, but not all is what it appears to be.But who cares about the plot?! 'Baywatch' is probably a low point for all of the actors whose names are attached to it, most specifically for Johnson (who will act in just about anything). There are pretty much no redeeming qualities here, and while there are some funny scenes here and there, most everything is rehashed, sloppy and just plain stupid.Instead of giving 'Baywatch' a watch, just spend the day in the bay.",Baywatch

99,Ramascreen,Unlimited supply of sex appeal,4,23 May 2017,"Here's my review of #Baywatch movie and the reason why I don't hate the film as much as someone who probably over analyzes it is that I wasn't expecting this to be any better than the long-running cheesy TV series that I did grow up watching. If you recalled, the show was basically just about attractive people in swimsuits patrolling a beach and it had the occasional soap opera romance. It produced such hot babes as Pamela Anderson, Brooke Burns, and Yasmine Bleeth. Teenage boys watched it religiously whenever they can't get their hands on a copy of the latest Playboy magazine.With that said, this movie throws the drama out the window and cranks up the sex- crazed raunchiness that the TV version could only hint mildly. The action sequences are not well-staged, the jokes more than often don't land, but from time to time it does exactly what it's supposed to do, it entertains.Starring Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Priyanka Chopra, Alexandra Daddario, Jon Bass, Kelly Rohrbach, Ilfenesh Hadera, directed by Seth Gordon, the story is about veteran lifeguard Mitch Buchannon who finds himself butting heads with a brash new recruit, 2-time gold medalist named Matt Brody (Zac Efron) who thinks highly of himself. Meanwhile, a certain local criminal plot is operating an underground drug ring that threatens the future of the Bay.This is a movie that from the start wants you to know that it doesn't intend on taking itself too seriously. There are scenes that I'm thinking the writers and director thought were going to be solid when they viewed them during storyboard process perhaps, but on screen, they're actually uneven and off-putting.The whole crime investigative aspect of it is anything but smart, sure one can argue that's because these guys are lifeguards and not cops, a point which by the way keeps being hammered again and again throughout the course of this film, but what I mean is that there really is nothing clever about solving the drug ring because everything about it is obvious and out in the open. But I am a sucker for a comedy about nerd guys and hot girls falling for each other and so I find the dynamics between Jon Bass' character and Kelly Rohrbach's character to be adorable, it's like those impromptu in-between moments that I consistently look forward to.Overall, I think people are going to want to watch this movie for the very same reason they watched the TV series, and that is: the beautiful people. Girls will come for shirtless Zac Efron and beefcake Dwayne Johnson, and guys will come for Kelly, Alexandra, Priyanka and their voluptuous bodies, I'm just keeping it real. Attractive people in swimsuits have always been the essence of ""Baywatch,"" they are what this franchise banks on. So the story quality and the jokes may not be up to par, they're silly, they're lousy, they're ridiculous, but ""Baywatch"" has an unlimited supply of sex appeal.-- Rama's Screen --",Baywatch
100,jayjaycee,How many people died because no lifeguard was on duty?,4,21 January 2020,"""Baywatch"" is a 2017 action comedy directed by Seth Gordon starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. There has been an era in the history of TV when a show about sexualized lifeguards in way too tight, red swimsuits who tend to walk in slow motion and like to pose as detectives delighted the audience with it's sheer cheesiness. I asked my mother whether she liked it then and her genuine answer was ""Yes, we all did back in the day, but I think a show like this wouldn't work in modern times"" and I think that's the quintessence of the film's general reception - mine included. From the beginning on it appeared to me that Michael Bay watched over the whole production (pun intended) as it's already shown in the first sequence how silly and overstated it is. The whole editing style was simply ridiculous and what in the actual hell was that thing with the dolphins, the title epically rising from the water and the apotheosis of The Rock? I knew I was in for some cheesy stuff, but that was already more than I have asked for. In the same manner the film went on and introduced us to characters who couldn't have been more irrelevant. Bass, who I expected to be the comic relief and the appealing figure, was just a laughingstock who just fulfilled the stereotypes of the group dork. Also the other actresses were reduced to their outer appearance. Don't get me wrong, they all are smoking hot, especially Kelly Rohrbach, but I think it's a wasted potential that all of them, particularly Alexandra Daddarrio, who I consider as a talented actress, only had the chance to present their two most convincing arguments. It's a shame, least to say. I mean, it's undeniable that they are pretty to look at, but if that is what I'm looking for I'd be watching porn instead. The same applies to Efron, the HSM glamour boy who should rather consider a career as a model instead of trying to be a serious Hollywood actor. I like him, actually, but he isn't quite the most talented man in the business. The only notable performance is probably The Rock's. He reached mediocrity with it and you can clearly see how he put blood, sweat and tears in this flotsam of a film and literally is as solid as a rock in it (again, pun intended). I don't wanna say it's good, but it's acknowledgeable that he tried his best. He made the best out of this mess. Although it's supposed to be (or tries to be) a comedy the movie had no scenes I'd consider as particularly funny, except for probably the names Efron's Brody is called on a regular basis. But aside from that there were only unfunny dick jokes and ... no, I think that's the only kind of humour I'm able to remember, maybe it's because the film miserably tries to be an action film in the first place. Remember this somewhat trashy cult game ""Hitman""? This plot feels worse than the most idiotic of all missions. That's enough said. A forgettable villain and embarrassing dialogue create this special feature and it is not redeemed by the attempt to be self-ironic. Oh, before I forget: Have I mentioned how terrible the visual effects look? Was it really so hard to create flames that don't seem to come straight out of a PS2 game? Apparently, it is. All in all, this remake is more of a rip-off of already terrible source material and I'm once more disappointed that this film was actually green-lit and that someone actually thought it's a great idea. Where's the originality? They lost this perspective in favour of making lots of money. This film was doomed to sink and drown from the beginning and there's nothing that could really create a feeling of pleasure in me, it's even too dumb to be a guilty pleasure. Not even the cameos could save it from painfully drowning. They might not have disappointed the Hasselhoff, but they disappointed me. I'd rather suffer from asphyxiation than ever watch it again. And oh lord above, please, don't let there be the sequel that was hinted ... Now let's go back to the good films.",Baywatch

102,ginocox-206-336968,It is what it is,7,19 August 2017,"""Baywatch"" suffices as mindless entertainment. I've never seen the television program, other than a clip shown in ""Red Corner,"" so can't compare it. It has the feel of a script written for television, but with a bigger budget and greater freedom to present adult-ish content, which actually seems geared more to adolescent boys. As such, it seems a bit incongruous at times, trying to titillate without getting raunchy. There are several action scenes and car chases that are well executed, a few nods to the original series, some self-deprecating humor and self-parody of the type seen in ""22 Jump Street."" Although the premise is unrealistic, the actors never seem self-conscious and don't wink at the camera, which helps make some of the weaker humor funnier, as if the entire cast is playing straight man to the original program's screwball. It doesn't try to be the least bit cerebral or cathartic. But as light entertainment, especially for somebody who missed the television program, it gets the job done.Kudos to the filmmakers for using some sort of rigid camera mounts, avoiding the jigglycam shots that are overused in many films.",Baywatch

It is very stupid, makes fun of itself, lots of crude humor and swearing. After all was said and done I felt like I had watched an episode of Baywatch, the same formula the same plot all very straight forward, there are no twists, you know how it will end before it ends but you don't care because it's funny as hell to watch the characters do what they do. Good (enough) acting, hot people, funny people, The Rock is awesome in it, Zac Effron isn't bad either. The two play well off of each other. I would totally recommend if you just want some cheap funny thrills, or miss the old Baywatch and need a little more.",Baywatch
105,ritera1,A special kind of bad,3,11 June 2017,"Not the bad that is good. The bad that is bad. The bad that is not good.Why? It just didn't work. Not funny. Not clever. Often too serious to be a satire and not quite funny to be a comedy.A big fan of Dwayne Johnson. He's done some very good work and a natural actor. His strongest efforts were Faster (no, not any of the Fast and Furious) and I thought a Supporting Actor Oscar-worthy turn in Pain & Gain. Wasted in San Andreas and Furious 7. Did an entertaining take in Furious 8. Central Intelligence was a very original and funny character only he could do. Nothing beats his turns as The Rock in WWE on his occasional returns.But this? On the dull side of doing his patented charm, like Robert Downey Jr does, over and over.The first time I've seen Zac Efron in a full film. A very good comic actor, which I find surprising vs. his very good looks. Seen him in several trailers for films I never caught up with but thought he would be good. Don't think I can compare that to anyone else working. Usually roles he's had are for regular Joes, not heartthrobs. He might have a Brad Pitt career ahead of him.The rest of the cast was competent and very pretty. I needed to groan yet again where the fat kid gets the hot lifeguard.I see the budget was at $69 million. How? The two effects scenes (the boat on fire and the fireworks at the end) were an embarrassment. Not even good for straight to DVD or SyFy channel. Other than that it was maybe $20 million at most. There was no money and no imagination in the action. No really big crowd scenes.If I were to spitball, I would guess the failing was trying to make a movie for two cultures. The credits had not one but two Chinese production companies, so I would assume they influenced greatly the content for a Chinese audience, which did not translate well. I'm very familiar with Chinese action films (which are generally done very well but the stories and characters lack in Western criteria). I don't have any knowledge of Chinese comedies.From just a Western perspective, there was not nearly enough satire to make up for the plot that had way too many holes, not to mention the plausibility.I guess if you're a Dwayne Johnson fan, there might be a curiosity factor. But even that with me doesn't make me not recommend it.",Baywatch
106,kaptenvideo-89875,Passable entertainment for raunchy comedies crowd – but not really a recommend-worthy for anyone,5,19 June 2017,"I love TV series in general but somehow have never really delved into the legendary Baywatch"" (1989-1999), starring David Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson and other megababes of the time. At its peak times, it was followed by over billion viewers! Whatever qualities the original action drama"" series must have relied on, the movie is very different aquatic mammal altogether. 65% of the original's audience were women but the remake is clearly a raunchy mainstream comedy for guys. There's a recent successful example of how to serve cheesy old TV hit to modern cinema audience – 2012's 21 Jump Street"" starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill –, so the new Baywatch"" goes down the same road, only with less hilarious or fresh results. The movie is watchable enough for the first two thirds or so, when it's mostly about beach, good-looking people and dirty jokes. All this is, sadly, followed by switching to action mode, which makes nonsensical events less bearable and more forgettable – and doesn't offer much thrills for compensation. Perhaps surprisingly for boys' comedy, Baywatch"" concentrates on its stars Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron, so the cute girls are relegated to the sidelines, even the Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra. But this may have been a conscious choice of those who gave the movie its final form in post-production, because Rock & Zac have way more charisma than anybody else here. Which may be the fault of mediocre material (they couldn't even make good use of obligatory guest appearances by Hoff and Pam!) So, it's passable entertainment for modern raunchy comedies crowd – but not really a recommend-worthy for anybody, even for its target audience. Still, there's something likable and winning about Johnson, although most of the movies starring him are mediocre at best. And Efron's cool too, beefed-up muscles and good looking stupid guy roles fit him extremely well.",Baywatch
107,srdjan_veljkovic,Some good jokes don't add up to a good movie,5,12 June 2017,"The problem here isn't that it's different than the original Baywatch. That's fine. The problem is that it doesn't really work on its own, so you end up comparing to the original.There are several good jokes. But, others are actually not that good.Story is too shallow to make an impact (or sense). That worked for the original Baywatch, but, the show knew what it was and didn't push it. This movie does push it, and fails.So, you go to comparison. First, new girls are hot, but, not as hot as the old ones. The new Stephanie Holden is the only one ""in the same league"", but, she's way less charming than Alexandra Paul.New Mitch does the usual Rock's ""I'm a benevolent giant"" routine, which doesn't work. Yes, original Mitch was ""larger than life"" and it was silly, but, it somehow worked for him, he was interesting. This new Mitch, who is only larger than everybody else, isn't interesting.The original Mitch cameo is very bad. Pamela Anderson cameo is too short to make an impact.With a little better story, trying less and cracking more jokes, with a different Rock Mitch and a better old Mitch cameo, this might have actually been a good piece of entertainment. As-is, it's not terrible and not hard to watch, but, there's not much to see, either.",Baywatch
108,trublu215,"Much like the show it's based on, this is STUPID!",1,23 May 2017,"A little over 20 years ago, the world was introduced to Baywatch the TV show. This was an awesome show for any pre-pubescent boy or middle aged pervert who liked to watch Pamela Anderson run in slow-mo. Much like the TV show, the film is all brawn and beauty and doesn't have a brain cell to its name. Starring Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne Johnson, the cast can't even save this atrocious excuse for a film. It is far from the comedic romp that was promised in the trailers. The film takes itself seriously and then other times it knows it is a parody. The only problem is, the filmmakers and writers can't decide on a tone. This really killed the film in more ways than one. Those who are expecting another Neighbors will be sorely disappointed and those of you wanting to see Dwayne Johnson kick some ass, you get to see that a little bit but there is much MUCH more to this film that could have been. I normally would go into a longer review and really talk about the film itself but I stopped myself short of this because any longer than this and it would simply be a waste of time, much like this film.",Baywatch

I am a huge fan of the t.v show and I own all 11 DVD seasons too plus the two Baywatch nights seasons and I really enjoyed the movie for what it was.not great like the show was but good enough with few boring and unpleasant scenes.David and pamela were paid tribute and even the classic song I'M ALWAYS HERE was also included in the movie but not in the opening credits like it was done with the original show.really my main issue was that David was not the only MITCH in the movie and he with duane even talked about this matter in a post movie credit scene like I also told you above.Hope there is a sequel cause u can relate to the chemistry the cast had like u did with the original series.not great....not perfect but good enough to like it.grade // B,Baywatch
110,asifahsankhan,This movie nudges you in the ribs with a pneumatic drill... but it's still pretty enjoyable!,5,2 June 2017,"But I'll lay it all out for you. Honestly. In an effort to match hit-TV-version and the collective heft of its cleavage, (or Pamela Lee) - ""Baywatch"" the-film-version renders all its characters as silly-iconic pairs of Boobies. Those famous slow-mo's of the 90's are upgraded to a full pro-mo's just to fit the 2010's of ""what exactly are we into now, seriously?"" For instance, in the film, CJ only runs in slow motion...every single time she runs, she's in slow-mo. Never mind that, I mean, the movie is funny on a pretty good level (and in a good way) if you're being honest. It's better than being a Gluteus-Maxi- Mus, for sure, although there's plenty of those in the movie, too. I believe this is pretty much in line with the (sexy, yes but kinda' corny) TV show inspiring it, although I've never seen it's seasons, completely. I recall ""Baywatch"" as it was the television equivalent of a suicidal diet: 90 percent cheesecake.Dwayne ""The Great One"" Johnson stars as the legendary head lifeguard Mitch Buchannon and Zac Efron as the cocky and reckless trainee Matt Brody. Mitch isn't just some forty-something guy in a wooden tower, twirling his whistle and keeping an eye on the tides. In fact he's more of a superhero than a mere lifeguard. Hardly a day goes by without Mitch performing amazing feats, from saving a woman and her two children from drowning to boarding a boat that's engulfed in flames and dragging multiple hot women to safety. In fact we're told he has saved more than 500 lives on his beach. Five hundred! Apparently that beach is more dangerous than many a war zone.Efron's Matt is a two-time Gold Medal winner who fell from grace after a night of partying led to him throwing up in the pool during an Olympic relay race, costing his teammates their shot at gold and turning Matt into ""The Vomit Comet.""Gee, can you guess what happens?It's a thought we should find comforting.Just because you acknowledge you're in a movie based on a kitschy TV show doesn't necessarily mean you're in a GOOD movie based on a TV show.""Baywatch"" is the latest movie to raunchy-FY its small-screen source material, a la ""21 Jump Street"" and ""CHIPS."" The formula isn't the problem. Laughter trumps critical analysis every time. Alas, laughter was in short supply in the theatre. Nothing is louder than silence in the wake of a joke. It's the sound of a vacuum sucking all the oxygen from the room. ""Baywatch"" is comedic asphyxiation. If you absolutely must see it, I recommend renting a pressurised suit from NASA first.The series ran for 11 seasons, anchored by David Hasselhoff, who is to the '80s and '90s what William Shatner was to the '60s and '70s - a tongue-in-cheek irony machine. Hasselhoff's character, champion seaside lifeguard Mitch Buchannon, is played in the movie by Dwayne Johnson, who has a similar cornball charm. Hasselhoff enjoys a cameo in the film - not a spoiler, as his name is in the opening credits - which means there are two Mitch Buchannons on the screen at the same time, and if this caused a rift in the space-time continuum, I didn't notice it. At this point, so many modern comedies have broken the fourth wall, the space-time continuum likely shrugs it off, and continues its unfeeling, uncaring, nigh-infinite trudge forward to the heat death of the universe, an event that will at long last make dumb Hollywood remakes of dumb TV shows extinct. Overall, Dwayne and Efron are as like-able as ever, but they've played better-developed characters on ""Saturday Night Live."" Still though, if you're in the mood, give it a watch, it ain't that bad.",Baywatch
111,FelipeCarrillo,Something is happening with the creative minds of Paramount Pictures,4,20 August 2017,"The cohort of people belonging Generation Z, hidden in their homes from litigant summer sun, was ""lucky"" of witnessing the transmission of a series focused on the adventures—independent in each episode—of the lifeguards of a beachfront city in western Los Angeles County, California, which was on-air a laughable period equivalent to a decade. The main promoter and only beneficiary of real fame thanks to the show—relegating, of course, the sexual symbol in which Pamela Anderson became—, was David Hasselhoff, who created a ridiculous and superfluous succession of feature films and spin-offs in order to keep afloat a TV series that since its beginnings were buried in the mess of simplicity and silliness. A few years later, definitive cessation of audiovisual products on the lifeguard group was declared, however, the satisfaction did not last forever by informing, shortly thereafter, that a powerful Hollywood producer would take to the big screen the underworld of the bay with much younger faces, muscles, and buttocks. It is today when it premieres its homonymous cinematographic idea, a kind of hybrid between 21st- century comical vices and analogies of vacuous modern blockbusters of the forebear decade.Having as a main culprit the inordinate budget Paramount Pictures bestowed director Seth Gordon—I don't understand why, but it was really surprising to me watching Andy Garcia and Eli Roth as producers on screen—, the film manages to leave, momentarily, the superficiality of robust, suntanned and perfect bodies to tell a joke of criminal story about drug trafficking, which employs a spoof of contemporary action movies while trying to keep a bearable aura by comical gags (moderately funny), ending in a high-calorie recipe, the equivalent of a super comedy production brought to disappointing levels. At present, there are noteworthy works which were released on similar dates and that had the same tone, the difference is that they had solid ideas from its origin, a quick and timely sample: ""Spy"" by Paul Feig.They are giving hints of the jolly and trivial tone from the very start, that will prevail in the story with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson emerging victorious from the water with a bather in his arms and the film logo, with emphatic pride, as a backdrop, adding dolphins gambolling—perhaps lacking oxygen among such megalomania—out of the water. I must confess I felt an intense good foreboding in the kind of initial video clip, nevertheless, it fell apart as soon as I watched that the first two names in the opening credits are masculine, explicit significant that some actresses are merely eye- candy, in the same way, the detail of the dolphins provoked that, almost automatically, I took my hand to my head, a disappointing posture lasting at least the half of the extensive almost hundred and twenty minutes. It should be pointed out that this action had a brief lapse of laughter, but, they were so provisional, that I don't remember the causes.The storyline is as bad as if it were an episode of the series they forgot to transmit on TV. Matt Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) and his pair of stunning workmates oversee a competition to find new and suitable members of the Emerald Bay life-saving squadron. In parallel, the corresponding subplot is unfolded about a network of criminals who use the beach as a camouflage for narcotics trafficking, with multimillionaire Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) as the key ringleader. The story honors its source by flaunting big men and voluptuous women in extra small bikinis stammering cheeky jokes.Neither inherent vis comica of ""The Rock"", Efron nor rising star Alexandra Daddario manages to consolidate an unambiguous definition for this work from the beginning, and although some of the humorous circumstances, especially those expressed graphically, are quite jolly and acerbic, the lax direction by Gordon, regrettable screenplay by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, some word-for-word absurd special effects, raccord detectable mistakes, and the way in which ideas are let out, cause the film to finish as an adolescent, summer, rated-R film prospect with one of the most valued acting teams today, an enviable budget and an audiovisual result, fatally drowned.",Baywatch

The characters are bland, the dialogues are too basic, most of the jokes are predictable and some of them take too long without evolving. You need a heck of suspension of disbelief in order to follow the events of this movie.On the other hand...well this is a remake of a tv show that was not known for being good but for including hot women in bathsuits. this film has that. it also has the likeability of the rock and the cockines of zac efron that actually bland well together. Priyanka Chopra is criticized by most people as a villain, but i actually enjoyed every minute she was in. she was completely cartoonish don't get me wrong: not very further from an inspector gadget villain. But at the same time the film is self aware of that: so i had real fun everytime she appears on screen.so i did laugh sometimes and i was pretty entertained throughout this film. It's too long? probably but still doesn't fade. its self awareness of knowing this is not exactly a gem of a film is the best part of all.

So, is it any good? While Gordon does his best to put a solid effort into Baywatch, the problem is it feels like it wasn't made for him to direct. The other movies he has directed in the past felt like the perfect projects for him, but this one just doesn't seem to work. Whilst filming hot babes and hot guys on the beach running in slow motion (like in the show) is all fun to look at for everyone, it never really gets to the point. Sometimes you wonder if it even has a point.The cast members do everything they can. They improvise, they take off their tops (mainly Efron and Johnson), they do weight lifting, loads of running, etc, but they just can't seem to save this movie no matter how hard they try. The villain Victoria Leeds (played by Priyanka Chopra) is also not a very good choice for a villain. She didn't have a good presence and wasn't intimidating enough to make us think she was really evil.The chemistry between Efron and Johnson is actually quite interesting, and a lot of the gags work between them. Using references like Justin Bieber and High School Musical, it does have its moments of comedy genius. The problem is there are several of these kinds of jokes thrown in there and 80% of them just don't work. So much of the movie's comedy revolved around dick jokes, and while there's nothing wrong that, the problem is it felt extremely overplayed and overdone.Another problem would be the CGI. In comedy movies normally CGI shouldn't matter because it's a comedy and comedy is a joke, but come on THIS IS TOO FAKE! Whenever there is fire or explosions you just aren't convinced and it felt like you were looking at a bad 70's movie, and some of those movies had better fire effects. Even some of the regular backgrounds were fake at times it makes us wonder if Efron's body is fake! I know we sound like we're bashing this movie extremely hard, but there is goodness in it. The casting of everybody was perfect. John Bass (who looks and acts like Josh Gad) was quite good, as were the Baywatch girls. With a better director, better script, and a better special effects team this movie would have definitely been in much better hands. It's not disastrous, but it's definitely something unmemorable and we won't be watching it again. 2/5 stars. Check us out on facebook and Instagram. The Autistic Reviewers.",Baywatch
122,danielharden,Not worth the Hasselhoff,4,31 May 2017,"It's the start of the summer movie period, schools almost out, the sun is out and the blockbusters start rolling into town the cinemas. What better way to start the summer blockbuster season than with Baywatch, the most summery of all the summer blockbusters.... Well the answer is literally any film that isn't Baywatch, because Baywatch is a broken mess on a mix of Viagra and testosterone. But seriously who wanted this movie anyway. To quote pretty much the first 10 minutes of dialogue in this film; ""Not a single f*ck was given.""The saving grace of this film is by far the acting. Although obviously cast on their looks due to the nature of Baywatch, surprisingly the entire cast was decent. Dwayne Johnson is always a treat to see and is often or not the best part of every film he's in. Zac Efron also does a great job, playing the same role he played in the Neighbours films. He's definitely broken away from his vice grip like connection to High School Musical films... Well almost. The rest of the Baywatch team (Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach, Ilfenesh Hadera and especially Jon Bass) were pretty decent also and help carry whatever is left of this shipwreck of a film.... To be honest there isn't even enough room for Jack Dawson on this wreck no matter how much this audience quarrels.The real issue of this film lies predominantly with its script. Firstly the film is not funny, every joke has been done a million times before and with a hell of a lot more punch than in this film. The attempts of cringe comedy just come across as cringey and the attempts of irony lack any effort whatsoever. There are several times where this film ironically mocks the whole idea and infamous slow mo of the original Baywatch, and this sets up great opportunities for what could be some great jokes... But no we get lines that sound like they have been improvised poorly, and merely points out the fact they run in slow mo and solve crimes they have no right to be solving. Error 404, effort not found.Let's now acknowledge the fact that, for the first half of the movie there is basically no story, plot or anything really. There are hints of something shady with the antagonist and a super forced love/hate relationship between Zac Efron's Matt Brody and Dwayne Johnson's Mitch Buchannon, which frankly doesn't get any better. The problem with their relationship is the fact that Brody never learns, the plot is pieced together with an endless number of Brody f*ck ups. His character eventually makes a complete 180 switch from useless to useful, and thus there is zero development to his character and he just comes off as a cocky failure. And finally, last and by all means least is the actual crime story that this film is primary about.... I just didn't care. Sure it send them on a wild goose chase and into some weird and wacky scenarios that are somewhat amusing, but honestly between the utter vagueness of the first half and the heavy bullsh*t expositional scenes in the second half, I just couldn't care less if the rich lady was killing people Mafia style and selling drugs on the beach..... In real life this actually happens, especially in California.To be blunt, Baywatch is a dumb and flawed film that no one ever asked for. The Rock isn't enough to save this one even if the rest of the cast is decent as well. Unfunny, cringey and unable to make you care about anything, Baywatch is a waste of time that should not have a sequel and should be left to drown. On the bright side however, at least this isn't Baywatch Nights... Don't you dare get any ideas Paramount!",Baywatch

124,joshbarton15,So many dick jokes...,2,24 May 2017,"It's fair to say that Baywatch was never a great television show. Sure, it was popular but for reasons very different to it actually being a quality show. It was trashy as hell and combined slow-motion with a number of scantily clad supermodels running down the beach in bathing suits so no surprises at all that it attracted viewers. There seems to be a bit of a trend in reviving franchises that were popular back in the 80s and 90s, and right now, it was the turn of Baywatch. Quite why is something that I'm still scratching my head about.When Mitch Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) butts heads with new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron) over how to run Baywatch, they uncover a local criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay. As soon as the film started and we see Dwayne Johnson saving someone before Baywatch rises from the sea in giant letters behind him, I immediately thought this was going to be exactly what a Baywatch film should be if it was to be successful. A self aware comedy made as a parody of the show, in the same way that made the Jump Street films such a critical and financial success.We get flashes of that formula however, for the most part, Baywatch is just an awful film. Painfully unfunny and not one memorable action sequence means it utterly fails as the action comedy it set out to be, and with a runtime of two hours it becomes one hell of a slog to sit through. I tried to enjoy it and take it for what it is but the problem is I just can't do that when there seems to be no effort into making the film funny, particularly when watching a comedy. Literally every other joke is a dick joke, including an overly long joke about one of the new recruits getting their dick stuck in a deck chair. I knew it was going to be silly and I didn't have high expectations at all but sadly they weren't even met.Coming to the performances, Baywatch is absolutely lifeless. Even Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron, who has shown good comedic timing before, can't save this from becoming the absolute car wreck that it is. Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera are sure nice to look at but the film fails them totally in giving them anything interesting to do, Daddario in particular who is actually quite a talented actress. Then there is Jon Bass who delivers an irritant of a performance as he hopelessly lusts after Rohrbach's CJ Parker. I felt embarrassed for them as they had to perform such a terrible script.I won't even waste time in talking about the pathetic cameo that David Hasselhoff makes in the film. All I will say is what a waste of a cameo that had much better potential if they'd actually stopped to think about it. So there you have it, Baywatch is an awful film that fails as both an action and a comedy. It's already one of the worst films I've seen this year and I won't be surprised if it's still up there come the year's end.",Baywatch
125,yongkang-27205,"A fun to watch, bad movie",6,7 October 2021,"I mean, I have to be honest. This film is like 80% eye candy, 20% plot. The plot is well, as to be expected, mediocre at best. But hey, it's not trying to be those cerebral and deep films you see winning the Emmys but instead largely a comedy film to have a couple of great laughs. And for that, it sure did pretty well. So while not perfect, I can't really fault it either. Still, a fun lighthearted watch that did its job decently.",Baywatch
126,barbagvido,Unintentionally funny parts are funnier than the intentional ones,3,9 November 2017,"Baywatch is a movie based on a classic TV show (that no one really watched for the plot) starring Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario. It's about a group of lifeguards who discover a hidden conspiracy and try to resolve it.It started out decent enough with some parts that were actually funny, but as soon as the actual story kicks in it comes crashing down. There is one particular scene with the fire on a yacht that kick-starts it and it's probably the funniest scene in the entire movie because of how laughably bad the CGI is. Honestly, I've never seen such bad CGI in a studio movie. So yeah, sadly, the funniest scene in the movie wasn't even supposed to be funny. What's even worse is how long that scene goes on and tries to be intense, but it looks like something out of a freaking mock-buster! That scene alone is a story for itself. At least that story is stronger than what follows. The characters are completely one-dimensional with a completely forgettable villain. And it just doesn't feel very realistic. There is no chemistry between the characters, there is one plot point, one scene, that was probably supposed to bring them closer together, but it doesn't work. At all. It really doesn't change much about them. But apparently the writers thought it does. At least it seems so.But at least it's fun and the acting is decent enough. It's not to be taken seriously (even though it's still not very good if you don't), but it's problem is that when it tries to be funny it mostly fails and when it tries to take itself seriously it's laughable. Even though it's dumb fun, I don't recommend this.",Baywatch
127,chloegalley,Not a bad film to watch!,6,25 August 2019,So at first I was like another remake of tv series.

130,gerry_barnaby,Refreshing a film not taking itself serious and pretty funny because off it,7,29 May 2017,"Likes : Seriously the review on this film are ridiculous negative from almost everyone, which begs the question what the hell we're you lot expecting, come on we all knew from the trailers what this film was gonna be like. I seriously can't believe anyone would expect this film to actually be perfect, to be honest this film is very self aware of itself that it doesn't take itself serious; which is why this film was funny.Ya some joke kind of missed it make but i'l be honest this film is pretty funny, even the audience in the cinema was laughing at some antics special at the beginning with Jon Bass playing Ronnie Greenbaum, even though it was a little over the top it was genuinely funny because you we're expect him to do what he did which made the scene funny.The film as a whole felt well balance from the action scene to the comedy while respecting the source material from the 90's TV series Baywatch, with a clear message that life guards are more than just being a star as it take a lot of be a beach life guard special our the sea as the sea can kill you in so many ways.Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron we're brilliant in this film show the macho banter which was funny at times, Dwayne playing ex marine LT Mitch Buchanan a hard ass life guard that respect his job, while training new recruits he come across a cocky ass gold medallist Matt Brody played by Zac Efron.The acting between these two is great special the typical Dwayne banter in movie's adds to their on screen chemistry with this male testosterone, although adds eye candy for the lady, yes you know what i mean. (laugh out load). Lads you not left out as the film does have some beautiful woman as well special Alexandra Daddario incredible beautiful, who spend most of the film act like she shocked or playing a bimbo.Got to hand it to Kelly Rohrbach as a full time model she done pretty well on screen with her character so fair play to her, Priyanka Chopra very beautiful playing the villainies of the film with a pretty serious role and pretty ruthless as well.The film as a whole is Pretty much what you would see in a Baywatch series, mixed with some good comedic moment, action and eye candy for both woman and men it not a film to take seriously it know it special from the tile screen so going into this film you should know from the title screen what your getting your self into.Its fun guilty pleasure film that is actually funny in place, worth checking out.Dislikes : As much as this is a guilty pleasure for me i did noticed that this might not be everyone cup of tea for a film, maybe this film would of actually been better as a series on TV, like a reboot series of Baywatch starring the rock and the others.I think the racist jokes we a little to much in area.",Baywatch

136,feyipuk,"Good looking, with not much underneath. Nice bit of fun.",4,3 July 2018,"In the quotes section on here, there's part of an exchange between Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron where they're discussing the kind of things the Baywatch team have done: 
Mitch Buchannon: ""How about diamond smugglers who are putting the rocks in surfboards and bringing them ashore?""
Matt Brody: ""Everything that you guys are talking about sounds like a really, like, entertaining but far-fetched TV show.""I used to enjoy the original Baywatch series; it was fun to watch and added a bit of Californian sun to a dull weekend and had pretty ludicrous story lines that didn't feel forced; the diamond smuggling episode reference was back in 1993, and also included a group of frantic UFO experts.
Zac Efron was five when that episode first aired, and this film watches like it's been made by someone who is that age now. Given the cast, it could have either been a decent, feature length Baywatch adventure - akin to the episodes of old - or a poke in the eye parody, spelling out every cliche and plot hole from the old series. I mean, it could have worked if it had been a self aware comedy - breaking down the fourth wall like Deadpool, poking fun at the original series - yet switching between cock jokes and over serious spy scenes, it didn't get into a good stride.Yes. they included plenty of nice shots of the beach. Yes, they included plenty of the signature slow motion shots (and mocking them accordingly). And, yes, they included plenty of good looking people doing daring do.
Yet the ""baddie"" is so obvious, they don't need brain boxes to work out what's going on. Jon Bass as the comic relief - we get it; he's not the same as the other chiseled Life Guards - would probably be the lead in many other underdog films. And the cameos from Hasselhoff and Anderson don't evoke a sense of nostalgia but more a sense of depression that it's been almost three decades since the original series came out.",Baywatch

138,eparazak,Ridiculously stupid and corny...,3,28 May 2017,"Baywatch is a movie based on the TV show of the same name that ran from 1989 to 1999. It is about a lieutenant of a group of lifeguards called Baywatch, who is played by Dwayne Johnson and he begins picking out three new recruits for the team, one is named Summer, another Ronnie and the last one is named Matt Brody who is played by Zac Efron. Out of all of them, Matt needs a lot of training before becoming an official member of the team, but as he receives his training from the lieutenant, it seems like there is someone causing trouble around the beach and it is up to the team to investigate and stop the trouble before it ruins their beach.Now I've never gotten into the Baywatch TV show, so therefore I just don't care about it. When I brought the movie up with my father, he told me that the TV show was plain stupid, so I kinda knew what I was going into. By two minutes in, I knew exactly what I was getting into. The movie utilizes a lot of slow motion as if they want to make the characters look sexier or something. I didn't find it sexy though, I just found it hilariously corny. I'm not even kidding when I laughed at every slow motion scene in this movie. In fact, I laughed at every cheesy and stupid scene and joke in this movie. Since I knew that the movie was going to be stupid after the first two minutes, I just embraced it and enjoyed the experience while I could.The story was confusing at times, but hey, it was at least coherent most of the time. I know what it was trying to be; an adaptation to the TV show from the 90s. While I can't judge it as an adaptation since I haven't seen the source material, I can say that it lives up to the corniness of the TV show that my father described. There were many dramatic slow motion scenes of the actors, mostly the women, running. The action scenes were okay. They were one of the few tolerable parts of this entire movie. The action and acting in general were fine. Most of the jokes missed, but I found them enjoyable in an ironic way. Even if I did enjoy this ironically, I can't call this a guilty pleasure. I can't say I enjoyed it simply because I laughed at it. This was an incredibly stupid movie that I can only recommend to those who enjoyed the show.3/10",Baywatch

The slow motion scenes were unneeded and annoying!!!! Matt Brody is good alone and very talented, but with the contest between him and Mitch Buchannon he did nothing but making him a joke...

Trashed by critics? I take a chance, go to a bargain matinée and make up my own mind, and, frankly, most of the time I've been rewarded for doing so. ""Baywatch"" was one of those films for me--only one publication I tend to respect for film reviews, ""Time Out New York,"" liked it, almost everyone else trashing it unrelentingly. Well, this time around, the majority of critics were right: while there are a few laughs (very few), the bulk of this bloated, nearly two-hour ""comedy"" is just plain bad, and not, unfortunately, in a fun way. There were scenes where I involuntarily groaned out loud (something I'm usually careful not to do because someone in the audience around me may be enjoying the film) and marveled that the scene made it past the director, screenwriter(s?), editor, actors, and, well, even the crew. I kept thinking ""how did people on the set not realize just how lame and badly-written this scene is?"" To also think that anyone involved in creative control of the production sat through the finished film prior to release and didn't see clearly and immediately that it needed to be trimmed by at least a half-hour is also a shock. The audience around me agreed: there was very little laughter throughout the interminable run time, and, amusingly, one scene that had me laughing out loud was actually for personal reasons unrelated to any cleverness on the part of the filmmakers. It involved the use of the BeeGees song ""How Deep is Your Love"" during what at first appears to be a dark moment and a possible drowning (huh??). I used to be a DJ decades ago, and that song was one I had to play way too many times at the time due to its popularity back then. Just hearing those opening notes had me cracking up remembering just how tired I got of the song back then (I actually like it now, after having given it a rest for a long, long time), but I also realized no one else in the audience knew why I was laughing. There is also a completely pointless guy-in-drag moment that is so out of touch with 2017 it's truly an embarrassing groaner (no one in the audience laughed at even one moment of it) and single-handedly knocked down what respect I do have for Zac Efron's comic chops several notches (I generally like him in comedies, by the way).

Its not a bad overall movie, but like most of the remakes of television shows, they completely miss the mark in terms of tone of the original. Baywatch (TV) never took itself seriously and knew it was just about oogling the girls. The movie seems to want to be taken seriously.Dwayne Johnson is Mitch (Hasselhof's old role). He treats Baywatch like its the last line of defense against an oncoming apocalypse. His character is way too intense and he gets the motivation all wrong. Its actually kind of understandable why the local law enforcement thinks he's nuts. Zac Efron is Matt Brody, a former Olympic swimmer being forced to join Baywatch as part of his community service. He comes off as arrogant, privileged and cocky. He actually played the character pretty well. The rest of the cast are kind of indiscriminate. Kelly Rorhbach, Alexandra Daddario and Ilfenesh Hadera as the fellow lifeguards are gorgeous and Daddario is so easy on the eyes, you want to fall asleep in her hair. Priyanka Chopra as the villain was wasted.The plot appears to have been written by a 13 year old boy. Its both giggly over the jiggly and so dumbed down it was comical.

I thought it was going to be like the show and the seriousness of it, but then The Rock knows how to do both, so I was iffy. I saw a few minutes of the original when it aired and I did not like it at all. I could not finish it. Everyone talked about the show and it wasn't for me. My husband wanted to watch the movie and I found it enjoyable. I hope they make more and keep Hasselhoff off. He aged horribly. I don't know why they made The Rock's character Mitch Buchanan. They should have named him something else, passing the torch or a relative. It would have still been enjoyable and Pam looked wonderful. I hoped they would give her a better part.",Baywatch

So I will give Baywatch an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Baywatch is worth seeing if you like comedy films like Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates, Dirty Grandpa, Bad Neighbors films, Central Intelligence, Spy amongst others.So if you get the chance to see Baywatch in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Baywatch

The trailer teased an entertaining bro-down with The Rock and Zac Efron, slick references/cameos to the original TV show, a silly premise not taking itself too seriously, and lots of beautiful bods. To viewers' disappointment, it didn't deliver any of that -- except the funny parts already shown in the trailer, and of course the beautiful bods. Instead, viewers were treated to a feast of lame jokes, a predictably melodramatic story, wasted cameos, bad visuals, and the wrong kind of R-rated nudity (i.e. small, white, non-threatening dingus).",Baywatch

159,inforaza,Baywatch is a completely mediocre & forgettable film!,3,10 June 2017,"Baywatch is a completely forgettable & second-rate film, made only for youngsters and people with low IQ!-1. There is not enough Adventure! 2. There is not enough Thrills! 3. There is not enough Action and Stunts! 4. There is not enough Sensuality! 5. There is not enough Romance!And there was enough of those in the TV series of the 90s which I'd regularly watched.-1.The ""comedy"" in the film is crude and infantile (as is common in most English movies). People with low IQ will love them.2.The acting is just passable. 3.The beaches look unkempt and almost deserted. (the beaches in the TV series was way more gorgeous)4.The blowing up of the helicopter (using a Roman Candle) looked very amateurish.5. There were some gory scenes of amputations which should not have been shown in a so-called comedy film.-Priyanka Chopra (as the villain) has only a fleeting role. Nothing to write home about. Just like in Quantico her acting and speech sounds fake.I wasted time and money watching Baywatch in the cinema. Next time I will pay more attention to reviews.-Examples of some STUPID comments on Baywatch:1.I have not laughed so hard in such a longtime. I recommend this to everyone. The entire theater was laughing their butts off, I could barely breathe! (this is the reaction of a ""retard"" who is still living in the comic books era)2.Laughing is this movies goal.(oh yes...me too going breathless...LOL)3.There are some really good action scenes that are beautifully shot. (Action scenes are ordinary and almost negligible. We've seen much better action scenes in Bond movies.)4.But through her (Priyanka) ability and her charisma, she takes a lacklustre character and actually delivers a memorable performance. (oh really...may be I was sleeping during her ""memorable performance"". How stupid of me! LOL!)5.With comedy experts like Dwayne Johnson & Zac Efron, this film could have been laugh-out-loud hilarious. (""comedy experts""??!!! ROFL!)6.The acting was first rate, all of them. (OMG! Here's an expert on ""acting""! It is time to redefine ""acting"" based on the performance of the Baywatch cast. Again ROFL!)PS: Contact me, if you want: inforaza@gmail.com",Baywatch

161,adam-may-bower,Fails to be A Good Comedy,5,2 June 2018,"'Baywatch' may produce a few laughs here and there, but overall it falls short of being a good comedy. I didn't have many expectations going into this film, as I was well aware that it wasn't going to be more then a raunchy comedy. Essentially, I went in for the cast as I'm a big fan of Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron and I was really excited to see their comedic chemistry. Unfortunately, their chemistry wasn't enough to save this failure of a film. The script is lazy, the plot is predictable and the fact that the majority of the film was filmed behind a green screen, and not an actual beach, shows the little passion that went into this film being made. Even the cameos of the main characters from the original Baywatch television series came across as silly and unnecessary. The only moments when the film seems to redeem itself is through the characters of the hilarious (yet clichéd) Ronnie Greenbaum, played by Jon Bass and the main antagonist, Victoria Leeds, played by Priyanka Chopra. Both of these actors play their characters really well and make the movie a little more bearable. In general, this film was a messy and uninspired excuse of a film, which was only partially redeemed by a few funny one-liners and an all-star cast.",Baywatch
162,suicidea,Mitch was right!,1,22 September 2017,"Charles Bronson once said ""I don't make films for the critics."" He had a point: His films were often unjustly criticized for having little social or artistic value, glorifying violence, etc. But like late great Roger Ebert said, every film must be evaluated within its genre. You can't compare Bronson's movies to, say, Frank Capra movies. Bronson made action movies and thrillers, and as far as those go, they were well made.So when Dwayne Johnson echoed Mr. Bronson as a response to the criticism Baywatch has received, I was surprised. According to the IMDb trivia, Johnson tweeted that ""the film wasn't made for critics."" Who was it made for, then? Can't be adults, with a virtually non-existent plot and the humour level of Sesame Street. Can't be children, with all the swearing and sexual ""jokes."" Can't be teenagers, who are drowning in movie action and comedy, which this film delivers none.This film is totally devoid of any kind of cinematic entertainment. There is literally no action apart from a fight scene and an explosion. No eroticism, which is a miracle: It's quite an accomplishment to have so many semi clad women and have zero sexuality coming from any of them. (I guess the best way to put it is, they are all very pretty but very unattractive). There's no homage to the Baywatch series, except one scene with David Hasselhoff and one with Pamela Anderson (she doesn't even have lines, just walks for 15 seconds).As for comedy: now, where to start... First of all, I have nothing against sexual jokes. If they're done well, they're hilarious (American Pie, Animal House, many 80's comedies) But there has to be a joke, some funny situation. Sex itself is not funny. The famous scene in American Pie had the actor get his penis stuck in a pie, and caught by his parents. The situation was funny. The audience laughed. Baywatch does not aim for that audience. They aim for the audience that laugh at the word ""penis."" Hence we have long dialogues about penises. Try as hard as you can, and you won't find anything remotely funny. And just when you think it has become painful and start checking your watch, that's when it starts: more penis jokes.The film even uses the ""nerdy, slightly overweight guy with glasses who stammers when he sees girls"" character. The first million times this cardboard character was used in movies, it wasn't funny. It still isn't funny. Plus, it doesn't work in 2017. This guy works at a beach, surrounded by women every day. He was born into the internet, he has seen more nudity than five generations of his ancestors combined. And he still goes bk... bk... bk... when he sees a girl? Ho ho and one more ho for you, dear writers.He also has a dance scene that has to be seen to be believed. Just visit Youtube and you'll be out of breath from laughing at the funny dance videos of drunks, kids, bad dancers, etc. And here is Baywatch, presenting you the first unfunny bad dance video. It makes one cringe that this is the best an ""actor"" can come up with.Then there are the leads... Dwayne Johnson spends the whole movie explaining things, since the plot can't. Teamwork among lifeguards is very important, one should never act alone. Since the writers have no idea how to demonstrate this with a couple of scenes, we have repeated lectures from Johnson about teamwork.Zac Efron, who plays basically a drama queen, is stuck with the worst written character in his career, and that's really saying something. There is one particular scene where the ""team"" goes to a party to find out about drugs, and Zac is supposed to be the lookout. He happily agrees because he wants to be a part of the team. (Because teamwork is very important, remember?) Then out of nowhere, he decides to botch it up. Why? For the sole reason of playing out another cliché scene: He goes to Mitch (Johnson's character) the next morning, teary-eyed, and says he's sorry, and throws his swimming medal into the ocean.Then comes the best part. Mitch is set up and removed from his position, and once the team finds out about it... oh, brother. Efron starts chanting ""Mitch was right! Mitch was right! He was set up! Mitch was right!"" Since neither the writers nor the director has any idea about how to create drama and suspense about an injustice done to the lead character (through editing, writing, music, or God forbid, acting) they choose the easy way and have the other characters talk about him. ""Mitch was right! He was right.""Other reviewers have pointed out the numerous plot holes, inconsistencies, ridiculous mistakes, etc. Here is my favorite, if someone hasn't pointed it out before: The tech guy in the team (nerdy, chubby guy with glasses, of course) hacks into the drug lord's computer, and what does he find? Photographs of cocaine or heroine, neatly packed, ready to be smuggled. I'm sure all drug dealers take and keep photos of their operations on their computers, as souvenirs.It's a small miracle that this film cost 69 million dollars. In its grueling 116 minutes of running time, there's nothing to justify that kind of money. Even the boat fire scene is obviously CGI.The best thing in the movie is David Hasselhoff's cameo. He also appears in the ""credits roll"" which looks like they're saying ""Oh, the fun we had while shooting this!"" If you haven't had enough of penis jokes, we have more in the credits roll. D. Johnson's hearty and sincere laughter after these jokes is sad: It makes one think that he actually finds the word ""penis"" funny. They also mention a sequel... Heavens forbid.But most important of all, it leaves you wondering: Was Mitch right?",Baywatch

164,iamjacksmoviechannel,Not as painful as I thought it would be,6,11 May 2017,"Baywatch is a movie based off the popular TV show of the same name which launched the careers of such acting talents as Yasmine Bleeth and Pam Anderson. And then those quickly died right afterwards but hey, the show ran like 11 years andlittle known fact, Jason Mamoa was on spin-off show Baywatch: Hawaii. The movie is very much like the show; as in if you walk in expecting to take it seriously you're already watching it wrong. The situations people need to be rescued from are just as ridiculous and far-fetched and the main plot here gets far more convoluted and hackneyed than the average day of any real lifeguard. And like 21 Jump Street and a bunch of lesser TV to movie adaptations, this seeks to make fun of all of it, plus all the slo-mo beach running. Does it come off as good as Jump Street? No. Do we need this? God no. I mean didn't the show basically already make fun of itself enough as it is?But all I can say here, and I guess the only thing anyone interested in this might want to know is, it could have been so much worse. I'm not saying this is the best movie of the summer so far. I don't really even know if i'm saying this is a good movie. But it's easy enough to sit through and the laughs, while not great, are consistent.Where the script sucks, the cast knows how to make fun of itself. The Rock is the head honcho who takes the job very seriously. Zac Efron is the selfish, cool pretty boy new trainee who clashes with him. Both have a plethora of jokes for one another that work with varying degrees of success. There's a fat lifeguard and the movie takes the shots you would expect it to take but actor Jon Bass also does have some comedic talent here in the Josh Gadd sense of the word. Actually he may even be funnier than Josh Gadd. Point is he works the best here from a comedic perspective. The movie gives us quite a few dick jokes but this dude actually has one embarrassing moment that may rank up there with ""There's Something About Mary"", just with not as good a payoff. Hannibal Burress also gets a couple scenes for a cameo and I love when he gets those. It's time for Burress to headline a movie though. The women aren't as funny but I guess you can say they add some nice support to that and the action. Alexandra Daddario has shown a few times she's a pretty decent actress, and the others don't just seem like stiffs there to just show off a hot body. Priyanka Chopra is also here as the villain, and she's fine. The whole movie can really be described as fine. It's funny and doesn't take itself too seriously and the cast all seems game for it. You don't have to see, but if you do, know it's already planning on sequels. But overall I say 6 out of 10. If you guys liked this, check me out on Youtube for more.",Baywatch

You just cannot mix the elements of a dirty comedy with anything which wants to be close to a serious crime thriller.And its second problem is that its two main lead male characters are a serious miscast.

Check. Stereotypical villains? Check. Sophomoric jokes? Check. Happy ending? Check.I was familiar with the original TV show although I never watched an entire episode. My time is too valuable. From what I have heard about it it was just an excuse to show babes running on the beach and bouncing boobs. All of the babes are moderately good looking; but not so good looking as to overshadow Pamela Anderson's cameo.I went to see this movie because I had nothing better to do. I didn't feel the need to check my watch; and when it was over I didn't feel as though that was 2 hours of my life that I would never get back. However, they could have chopped 15-20 minutes and it wouldn't have hurt.Oh, I almost forgot about the performance of Hannibal Burress. This guy is not an actor. I was glad when his character got killed off. A lump of clay has more range than this guy. I've seen his stand-up routine. He is funny like Norm Macdonald.

The main story of the movie is there's a drug being distributed around the beach but that isn't all that's going on the villain Victoria Leeds is trying to make the beach private property by blackmailing the property owners into signing over their properties to her that's what I understood anyway. To me this is probably one of the best movies of 2017 so far I enjoyed it more than I thought it was I actually thought this wouldn't be good at all so I was pleasantly surprised there will hopefully be a sequel but not if it bombs so I do wish it picks up and gets back the budget so they can work on a sequel.

175,connorbbalboa,Just another stupid comedy,2,27 August 2017,"Having never seen the Baywatch TV show, I went into this judging it as a stand-alone film. Not that this is a film I really wanted to see. From the posters and TV spots, it already looked stupid, and now that I've watched it from start to finish, I will simply say that this is clichéd, desperate, and awful drivel of the lowest order that is little more than another buddy-cop (or buddy-lifeguard in this case) movie with nothing that stands out. Sure, people will say that this was never meant to be anything more than a fun movie with The Rock and Zac Efron goofing off and spouting quips. Sorry, but that's no excuse, since buddy-cop movies can be funny, have great characters, and most importantly, be well-written. Baywatch did not have any of that.There's hardly any plot to describe. The Rock is the chief lifeguard of the Baywatch community, Zac Efron is the cocky rookie who learns to be responsible, they argue at first but learn to get along as an evil woman is trading drugs with corrupted officials, The Rock gets fired and has to solve the case himself, blah blah blah. Most of the familiar tropes from any buddy-cop movie. There's just nothing original here. There is a constant argument about police doing investigative work, but it doesn't have any meaning. Along with Efron and The Rock, all the characters are clichéd: there's the fat and awkward guy who wants to date the pretty girl, the pretty girl who wants to sleep with the awkward guy for some reason, the rookie's love interest, the henchmen, and so on.The comedy is also just. not. funny. Nothing more than sex jokes and Zac Efron acting like a huge jerk. The film treats it as if lifeguards are cool supermodels who save people. A scene with Efron, The Rock, and a dead body in the morgue is especially deprived of any humor to speak of. With references to pretty girls in the movie going in slow-motion, it's almost like the film is half-heartedly attempting to be smart. If that's what it was trying to be, I must have missed something.I'll admit, I haven't seen The Rock in much else, besides The Mummy Returns (2001), where he was given a horrible digital render as the Scorpion King near the end. Watching the movie, I think I can understand why people like him. In a lot of his movies (from what I know about them), he's such a muscular powerhouse, and yet his characters seem pretty approachable and he acts like he's really in the moment when it comes to the action. In that sense, he's like Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was in his prime as an actor. The Rock may have been the best actor in the film, not Oscar-worthy, but he did make the film slightly appealing. Much more appealing than the tired slow-mo with all the girls.This was awful. I'm not going to be elaborate here. I just couldn't stand this movie and I feel disheartened when I hear people legitimately thinking this is funny. I say, when it comes to buddy-cop movies, 48 Hours (1982), Lethal Weapon (1987), and Hot Fuzz (2007) are all you need.",Baywatch
176,razzakahmed,A Remake of the original,7,10 October 2021,"Alright .. the world famous Baywatch . Basically one of my grandfather's favorite TV shows was Baywatch , he used to watch it a lot on Star World and would tell me about it and he used to tell me how distinguished these people were as lifeguards on the beach, but from the Baywatch, they were a lot more than just lifeguards on the beach, they were crime-fighters and mystery solvers as well. The original Baywatch TV show went on for a long long period , around more than a decade . I used to feel really weird why he's praising up this show .. Nan (grandfather) used to tell me if you can't find a job then just be a lifeguard on the beach 😂, that's how much he used to love this show . And I've seen some episodes as well . So this is like a remake movie of the original Baywatch in today's times . And I think they've given a super job with it .

The film is mostly a parody of the original series that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't, the biggest fail being that they simply don't know when to quit; just like the unfunny shock jokes that go on way too long, they keep hammering in the same jokes that lose steam with every repeat. That all said, the actors all seem to be having a good time and even I cracked a smile at least once, so I really can't say that I left the cinema angry or upset in any way.

That the reviewers couldn't grasp this and wanted an Oscar winner under the name of Baywatch... they really don't get it! I had far more fun watching this than most of the latest 'super hero' movies.

The characters, the story arcs, and yes, the dick jokes, all send ups of the original. Dwynne is so straight and serious, it's sad, because this is a guy with one of the world's most winning smiles, but by playing it straight, he allows Zac Effron, not a natural comedian, to come off as funnier than his acting suggests. The female villain (villaness?)is not real, or believable and has had a lot of plastic surgery, I wondered for a while if she was a transgender person. (No, she's not, but both her parents are doctors)But were any of the original series' villains believable? This is a film that never takes itself seriously. It's natural audience is teenage males.

182,HollywoodJunket,If Porky's and Scooby-Doo had a Baby it Would be BAYWATCH Movie,7,23 May 2017,"Be one with the ocean and the ocean will reveal secrets that may greatly impact your life. Crazy talk? Or, maybe just the type of talk to spew out of your subconscious after being attacked by a poisonous sea urchin. Just one example of the wacky and campy scenarios laced throughout the new ""Baywatch"" movie.In the case of head Baywatch lifeguard, Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson), there's a bit of truth in this as well. Proved to be the ultimate lifeguard which is showcased in the opening scene when Mitch anticipates a tragic situation before it even happens and emerges from beneath the ocean, with arms cradling a male rescue as the words BAYWATCH in block letters erupt through the water behind Mitch. This set the tone for the semi-slapstick, semi-campy ""Baywatch"" revival of the TV show perfectly.Set in Miami beach, Scooby-Dooisc crime solving has never been sexier. The amateur detective, but all pro lifeguard is played by the perfectly chiseled Dwayne Johnson who leads the cast of life- guard characters. Raunchy comedy is back. ""Baywatch"" is reminiscent of a sexual comedy genre popular in the early 80's with films such as ""The Last American Virgin"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", and ""Porky's"". The style became popular again in the late 90's with movies such as ""American Pie"", and ""Something About Mary"". In fact, if ""Porky's"" movie and Scooby-Doo cartoon had a baby it would be the new ""Baywatch"" movie. It's a fun and sexually explicit film (though more for the female audience than for the male audience). One particular scene in ""Baywatch"" involving a man's junk, is very similar to a famous boys' locker room scene in the ""Porky's"" movie. Viewers old enough to remember that will know exactly what that is. Everyone else, look it up! The amateur ways that the lifeguard crew goes about putting their puzzle together of stalking the bad guys is very much like the characters from Scooby-Doo. The caught criminals would have definitely gotten away if it had not been for those ""pesky"" lifeguards meddling! The ""Baywatch"" film has a cartoonish feel when things magically pop- up out of nowhere with no explanations (this very well seems more like an editing choice, as we saw in the post credits bloopers). For example, HOW did Mitch and Matt Brody suddenly not only get into their disguises in a scene, but also where did they find them?

184,stereo_1999,I'm really glad I watched this on prime instead of renting it.,3,18 July 2018,"I normally like Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, and Priyanka Chopra but this was straight out poorly written with some ok moments. The first scenes seemed like it had the making of something interesting show and I really liked the names Dwayne called Zac's character. Sadly the small name calling in the front was the only funny parts. It seemed like most of the ""humor"" was only the cringey awkward moments from Jon Bass's character or how disgusted you feel about what happens to Zac's character. Honestly if they took Jon Bass's character out completely the show would have been a lot better. I also think they should have made the reason they went after the bad guys more organic instead of straight up looking for them right off the bat. I feel so embarrassed for the actors and actresses involved in this film and I hope the lesser known ones get a second chance after this movie.",Baywatch

But I didn't go in to this thinking it would be a mind blowing, Oscar-winning experience, I wanted to watch a fun movie with some life guard-action - and it was. Some of the CGI could have been better but it was nicely shot and directed. Would watch it again :)",Baywatch
186,flamingbeargrant,I gotta give it credit,7,18 June 2018,Baywatch is the type of movie that is supposed to be bad but film is made to tell you yes this is a bad movie and they I know it too. But honestly it's really funny and I would suggest it. I think they should've cut back on the dick jokes. Baywatch has probably the same amount dick jokes as probably Deadpool.,Baywatch
187,darryl-42069,"It's bad, but kinda ""wanted"" to be bad",5,22 July 2017,"Baywatch... Based of the 1990s TV series starring David Hasselhoff, about lifeguards... with some bewbs in between... And now, it's a movie, starring The Rock... Now in theaters, in my country...Everyone already knows when your source material is ""this"", it was a recipe for disaster, and oh boy, it IS bad (but they know it!)Let's start with the acting. Literally all the main characters are great. Dwayne Johnson is likable as always. Zac Efron is also good in this movie. The bromance between The Rock and Efron is probably the best thing in this movie. Alexandra Daddario... from Percy Jackson to this, she really does improved and in this movie, she probably gave her best performance so far. What's surprising is the comic relief guy, played by Jon Bass. He's no annoying/trouble making guy, he's actually helping the team, which is great, well done writers. Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera is also great as C.J. and Steph respectively (although C.J. was overly sexualized, but that's pretty normal in this movie, obviously). Priyanka Chopra is way to good for this movie. I mean she could took something else rather than this. The cameos from Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson were also great.Everything else is... 70% garbage. The story is awful. So convoluted, so many plot holes. The pacing is uneven. The fight scenes were so disappointing. There so many quick​ cuts and close ups in the fight scenes, especially those involve The Rock. You don't need quick cuts and close ups for the fight scenes, you got a former wrestler in this movie! He definitely can fake fight scenes. The visual effects in this movie is a joke. There's not a single CGI looked convincing in this movie.Every scenes that should be intense is gone thanks to the easily noticeable CGI fires and CGI explosions. I was expecting more practical than CGI, but now I'm disappointed. (But again, they kinda know it! They know it's bad, so they kinda tried to be more bad that the original!)Let's talk about the humor. It didn't work, like 80% of it. They tried so hard to make you laugh, but most of the time, you'll be like: ""..."" The recurring jokes also gets annoying the more you've heard it. There's​ a lot of penis and bewbs, and most of them were so unnecessary. There's a conversation between Daddario and Efron in which Daddario kinda ""forced"" to bounce her bewbs (personal opinion btw). I mean: WHAT. (-_-) You don't needs bouncing bewbs and big balls all the time! Just give me a good movie that has a good story that is based from a really bad source material and I give this movie a immediate 9/10 stars. Seriously, are the writers writing an actual script for Baywatch, or a fan- fiction version of Baywatch? Because I'm pretty sure every 90 seconds in this movie would involve bewbs, or penises.Overall, this is definitely a bad movie that knows itself is a bad movie. It's the perfect disposable stupid fun movie. If you're a casual movie-goer like me, you'll have mixed feelings for this movie. For anyone else, skip this movie and watch Dunkirk or Apes 3 instead. But you'll probably enjoy this movie more if you're drunk (or if you dare, drunk while you're mind is ""flying"", then you'll woke up finding yourself leaving the world, or if not, you'll woke up in a rehab facility.)Final Score: 5/10. The acting is the only saving grace of this movie. And slomo bouncing bewbs.On a personal note: *SPOILER ALERT* How could a fat guy can get laid with a blonde sexy chick, while others don't? What logic is this? What kind of sorcery is this?",Baywatch

189,brandinscottlindsey,Bad Comedy and Generic Plot,3,12 September 2017,"Baywatch is a 2017 comedy film starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. The story follows Lt. Mitch Buchannon, played by Johnson, and his team of lifeguards as they patrol and protect Emerald Bay. Conflict arises when Matt Brody, a former U.S. Olympic swimmer played by Efron, arrives to join the team as part of his community service. Brody's rebellious personality clashes with the close-knit team of Baywatch and Buchannon must find a way to rein in the young swimmer.The scenery of Baywatch is beautiful. It will make you want to turn off this film and take a vacation, which is a good thing because this movie is awful.Baywatch is full of faulty premises, bad acting, and has a lame and generic villain. Everything about this Disney Channel-esque movie is corny. You have the embarrassing ""coolest guy in the world"" trope and it's used multiple times. Every character is overly friendly, overly cocky, overly tough. This replaces any and all character development you would get from a movie. She's the cocky one, he's the cool one, she's the friendly one.The worst part about this film is the comedy. Every single joke, with the exception of one or two, does not work. This isn't helped by the fact that the jokes come at you non-stop, and nothing is funny. It's horrible Disney Channel humor with obvious puns and situational comedy with premises so bad that they don't work. A bad joke hammered in to death is a terrible experience and that's all you're going to get out of this film: a terrible experience.Overall, Baywatch is one of the worst films I have seen in a while. The entire movie makes me feel uncomfortable and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The entire movie, including the ending, is completely predictable and boring. If you're interested in seeing a comedy film that is never funny but never stops trying, then check out Baywatch.",Baywatch
190,mherrin-43253,An unfunny mess,2,29 June 2018,"Baywatch: Directed by Seth Gordon and written by Jay Scherick, Thomas Lennon, Robert Ben Garant and David RonnI knew better. I didn't care about the show. I saw through what they were trying to do from the trailers. They were going for that 21 Jump Street thing where they basically make fun of the show while still remaining true to the spirit of the show. It's just too much. It feels like Michael Bay made this movie. The camera is always swirling around making me nauseous. It has constant slow motion not just for the jokes on the show's liberal use of it. It has that trying to be bad ass slow motion. It has that Michael Bay thing about it. I know this is the point. It's the whole joke behind the film but it made me roll my eyes too many times. The Rock is naturally fine in it. He's funny in the role and just enough over the top. Zac Efron is also good playing on the frat boy Olympic athlete image. It works for him. The problem is the women are window dressing. They have no character to speak of. They're only there to ogle and for the male characters to win. The original show wasn't like that. It felt off to me. I understand that everyone is meant to be watched and enjoyed for their physical appearance. The main problem with this movie is it's just not funny. At all. I didn't laugh one time. It's gross out humor and it didn't need it. The schlubby guy wasn't funny either. The whole joke is he didn't fit the whole super physically fit aspect of the lifeguard and that's funny that he tries to fit in feeling awkward. It's not funny. None of this is funny even the jokes at the expense of the original show. I say skip this one. I give it an F. I should have stuck with my gut feeling on this.",Baywatch

192,writeguyr,Babe Watch AKA Baywatch,2,29 May 2017,"Babe watch AKA Baywatch!Babe watch is the name that many guys tagged the popular TV show Baywatch 1992-1997. I admit I was one of those guys that loved to tune in the watch the hot babes in their patented tight red swimsuits. Among these beauties who delighted any red blooded male over the five years the TV series ran were; Pam Anderson, Donna D'Errico, Carmen Electra, Erika Eleniak, Yasmine Bleeth, Alexandra Paul, Krista Allen, Nicole Eggert, Traci Bingham, Gena Lee Nolin. Whew! Wow!! Some of these girls were also Playboy models so they really filled out their swimsuits! While there are some attractive women in the film version the TV series they don't stack up to the babes of the original Baywatch TV show. Kelly Rohbach as CJ Parker is a cute curvy blonde Ilfenesh Hadera as Stephanie Holden and Alexandra Daddario as Summer Quin who comes close to the original Baywatch babe. Daddario gets most of the acting time here and her comedic timing is very good. I must say that the early introduction to CJ Parker here is not impressive. She comes running in slow motion onto the beach, with strong sunlight behind her, to give her the look of a halo light around her. Yet the camera man and film crew did not give her enough fill-in light. Being a fashion photographer myself I have shot many beach swimsuit models using the back light halo effect. I always use a good fill in flash. In this scene in the film CJ Parker's face and body are covered in an unflattering shadows. OK, the film itself is a six pack (opposite of a chick film) buddy all guy film. It is basically an ego tug of war between (Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson) Mitch Buchannan and new dude on the beach washed up gold medal swimmer now washed up onto the shore of Baywatch (Zach Efron) Matt Brody. There are some yawn!!! ridiculous plots in here like Mitch's boss wanting Brody as a PR prop for the beach. Then (Priyanka Chopra) Victoria Leeds the gorgeous crime boss and drug dealer who wants the beach as a part of her drug dealing empire. Mitch and his gang of lifeguards decide to play detectives to help save their beach. Earlier an out of shape lifeguard hopeful (Jon Bass) Ronnie Greenbaum has a fantasy dream desire for hotie CJ Parker. In his first scene with her he gets his erection stuck in a wooden pallet. Then onward its Dick jokes upon Dick jokes. For any guy reading about the graphic nudity in this film. Don't too get excited that you will see any of the Baywatch babes here in the nude. No! Sorry, the graphic nudity pertains to tubby Greenbaum showing his bare ass in a shower scene. The other is a somewhat funny scene as Mitch and Matt examine a dead corpse on a slab, where Mitch asks Matt to pick up the dead man's penis and balls and examine them for anything strange looking. This scene shows the man's penis for several minutes. So you will be disappointed if you expect to see the Baywatch babes in the buff. I saw this film at the first 1PM showing on Thursday. The audience demographics were 99% male, with the age range at 20-30 years. The guys came in groups of five and six. They looked like athletes or recruits for Baywatch.

Anyone could have written a better story.
The acting is so bad that it is painful to watch.
The characters have no personality, none at all.
The jokes have been heard so many times before and they are just clumsy and not funny. It's like a bad Seth Rogen movie.
And the filming and cutting is very bad/annoying.

It's almost as if someone out there wants to deliberately humiliate Mr The Rock and destroy his career, though it's probably just those drug-addled, sex addicted producers again thinking it would be a great idea. Then there's Zac Effron, another mediocre actor who looks like a male Barbie doll and plays a character who is someone you would just like to kill with great satisfaction.

One a top and the other a bottom.Then there's the bevy of bimbos, some of which are fun to look at sometimes, although there's more attractive women out there these days they could have gotten, not to mention probably more talented too.

Sometimes the tone doesn't always work; there are parts where its stupid, parts where it tries to be more serious, and parts where it tries to be more self aware and it doesn't always work. The acting is mostly good. The stand outs are The Rock and Zack Efron, they also have the most to work with. As for the supporting players, Jon Bass probablystands out as the comic relief. You may be wondering about the women. Alexandra Daddario has a couple good comedic moments. Kelly Rohrbach and Ilenesh Hadera were fine although they didn't have much screen time. The characters have little depth but like I said decent acting helps. The weak link is Priyanka Chopra. SPOILER If you've seen the trailer you know she is the villain. Unfortunately while she tries to come off as seductive it ended up being more awkward. Also, the plot and character arcs are very predictable. Still Baywatch is entertaining enough to satisfy summer moviegoers. I give it 6/10 for being far better than I expected ( I was expected a disaster along the lines of the recent ""comedies"" Chips and Snatched.",Baywatch

The movie looks good, but it's just too silly, the characters are not really that likeable, the cast is giving a good job, but the humor is just all over the place and seldom manages to find the right tone or keep it for more than 2 minutes.

Didn't we already do this with 21 Jump Street? This reboot has a lot of good parts that just couldn't come together to make a good movie. The plot was barely there and wasn't enough to string together the enjoyable bits, leaving the viewer with a feeling that something was off. There was no one bad thing about the movie and — to be clear — the cast and characters were great, the writing had its moments, the premise might have been successful had they tried a bit harder – but what we were left with instead was a lot of wasted potential, hanging plot points, and a bad taste in the mouth that most unnecessary reboots do.",Baywatch

It had great comedy, chemistry between The Rock and Zac Efron. Support cast was also likable.The only downside is that after the first half of the movie some scenes started to drag a bit and kinda lost it's charm, that the first hour had and some jokes felt forced on.

I wasn't expecting much and the film didn't deliver much. The plot is crazy and most of the jokes fall flat (most of the jokes are of the lowest type of sophomoric humor which I'm not a fan of to start, but there are funny sophomoric jokes, just not for the most part in this film). But that being said the women were beautiful and looked great in their swimsuits and I'm sure the ladies will appreciate Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron, both of whom are absolutely cut. Of course next to Dwayne Johnson, Zac looks pretty small, but pretty much everyone does. The three female lifeguards are all very tall so as to not look ridiculous standing next to Dwayne (he still towers over them of course), but that means they are of course also taller than Zac. He gets most of his screen time with Alexandra Daddario who is about his height while Kelly Rohrbach and in particular Ilfenesh Hadera are taller than him. Tough to cast actresses who aren't too short for scenes with the Rock who aren't going to be too tall for Zac. The Rock really needs male co-stars at least 6' tall or so to not be totally overwhelmed by his size at 6'5"".

Like me you probably don't expect much of this and with some pretty terrible films coming out of the USA with some really poor plots. However, Baywatch is different.They have not gone down the crude and stupid that we see in many US comedy films lately. No sign of Adam Sandler, James Franco or anyone called Seth. The plot makes sense and the characters are true to Baywatch's history of being slightly over the top. There are realistic stunts and as such it almost feels sensible. The jokes are mostly PG and corny. In this film they do all the things from the TV series, such as investigate and occasionally save lives on the beach and yet the police constantly remind them this isn't their job. All in all it's better than expected. It won't win an Oscar and the Rock and Zak Effron add their usual talents. While they have been joined by some great new talents including the very beautiful Kelly Rohrbach, who reminds me of Margot Robbie. I will even consider watching it again and if a sequel comes around then I'd like to see Erika Eleniak make a cameo.",Baywatch

It really is tiresome have strictly the story sticks to these tired and utterly moronic and sexist stereotypes. To further push the semi-anti male theme running through this film you have the key characters keep on harping on about how female characters should be in charge and that ""if a man had said this or that it would of been OK""Quite frankly not worth anyone's time and a complete waste of money.Avoid like the plague.",Baywatch

I eventually caught up with it on tv and honestly, I didn't think it was all that bad.I chuckled pretty consistently throughout and there are some genuinely funny moments. The interactions between Zac & the Rock were enjoyable and reminded me of the squabbles between leads in much better 'buddy' movies. It knew its premise was stupid and sent up the 'lifeguards as private eyes' ridiculousness quite well.Fair enough, it does linger on some of the beautiful bodies on show which has drawn criticism as being gratuitous, but hey, it's a movie set on a beach, what do you expect? It's weakness though is the plot (kinda of a big one I know). When it tries to move the 'villainous property developer' plot forward the movie tends to lose it's humour and drags a little (especially at the climax) but then there are very few comedies where the plot is a strong point.

Brody is perfectly cast and played by Zac Efron, as washed up ""vomit comet"" Olympic swimmer (Ryan Lochte esque) who blows his career by vomiting in the pool during the Olympic relay. Now he finds himself down on his luck, offered a job on a reluctant Mitch's lifeguard crew. Mitch challenges young Brody with inventive belittling nicknames and endurance course antics. It is an amazing thing to see the fitness challenge between the equally impressive Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Somehow, I really believe they could carry two refrigerators on their shoulders. Ronnie is a new character actor, and is incredibly funny as the ""IT"" lifeguard recruit and love interest of ""slow mo"" hot girl with daddy issues CJ. Priyanka Chopra does not quite hit the mark as the gorgeous villain who is buying up beachfront and running a drug empire. Still, the cast appear to have had great fun and good chemistry in the filming of this movie. The theatre I attended was full and there was plenty of spontaneous laughing throughout.

246,tripper-09331,More then I expected,7,18 August 2017,"Based on the reviews and ratings I saw before hand I expected this film to be a weak plot with horrible acting. I was, however, presently surprised. Being in my early 30's I vaguely remember watching the original Baywatch on TV. I do remember just enough of it to get a few of the easter egg jokes in this movie.This is a comedy! The movie purposely does not take itself seriously. The whole concept of the movie is this group of over-zealous lifeguards who take their job way too seriously, while the real world around them is ""tolerating"" it. The dialogue between the characters is actually well delivered by the actors. I legitimately laughed and replayed a few scenes. Any corny one-liners or cringe moments are obviously done on purpose as the other characters will react to the cringe appropriately.One of my favorite scenes is when all the characters are sitting around the table trying to explain to Zack Effron why their job is so important. Reminiscing about situations (old Baywatch TV episodes) when these ""lifeguards"" had to stop thieves from smuggling diamonds in surfboards or ""sand-grifters"" stealing from people on the beach. To which Zack Effron says ""That sounds like a really entertaining but far-fetched TV show, but if that was the case I would definitely just call the cops"".Dwayne Johnson does a great job of being the ultimate boy-scout lifeguard as ""Lieutenant"" Mitch Buchannon. A military title every questions yet he never actually explains. Kelly Rohrbach fills the role of blonde bombshell CJ Parker (originally played by Pamela Anderson) with her slow-mo runs down the beach while looking sexy then walking into a plant off-center frame. Zac Efron's Matt Brody is called everything from ""One Direction"" to ""Highschool Musical"" by Dwayne Johnson in the movie. I don't think he ever called him the same name twice.This is definitely a funny movie with enough ""R-rated"" jokes that anyone can appreciate. You don't even need to have ever seen a real episode of Baywatch to get the humor and appreciate this movie. It's a fun movie to watch with friends or by yourself at home. You don't have to pay attention too deeply and it comes with lots of laughs. I do not regret watching this movie.",Baywatch

I think it could have worked if it was a meta comedy, or they went full in with the idiot plot and all the characters thought they were much more capable and smarter than they are. The current version feels like an early draft where they were trying to figure out the tone of the movie, and just throwing stuff at a wall. I have no idea who the audience of the movie is. It's not fans of the old show, or rebooting for a new generation. The movie turns into a ""And then"" movie where stuff happens and none of the characters really grow.",Baywatch

No, seriously. All these crazy things from the movie. First five minutes I thought that Dwayne Johnson not only main actor, but also writer, producer, director and The Rock! of the film. Nope, my mistake. By the way, Dwayne Johnson also was in the previous movie that I reviewed (Fast and Furious 8). Maybe it is fate of Rock?Reason two Boobs and dicksAnd a dick of a dead man. Nope, I'm serious again. Humor in the movie concentrated around this parts of human body. Well, I like some of these parts. But the quality of jokes is very low. Reason three Really ""family team"", but you don't remember any namesAs in the original Baywatch the main characters is rescuers. How can we characterize them? That one blonde with great boobs, another one with boobs and another I was looking in Google about her boobs after last few words – and yes, she has boobs, but didn't show.Another half of the team is more interesting. Dwayne Johnson, ""the guy who vomits (with two Olympic gold medals)"" and this fat guy who loves that blonde with tits. Must say that Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron (vomiting guy) looks good. Very good. Maybe I'm envy, because I'm fat. That is real reason to watch movie. But would you watch only for fifteen minutes??? (and all movie is about two hours!)Reason four You adore a very simple scriptI mean very-very simple. And the script of more than two pages is a scientific sh*t. The script has as many clichés as you can accommodate on this two pages. It is story about friendship, love, betrayed stop, stop, stop. We have one guy (Zac Efron) and team of rescuers. Our guy is bad at the beginning and good at the end. Somewhere you can find also drug dealers, story about friendship between Johnson and Efron, several love stories All this are so uninteresting, that you will be shocked. But there are boobs! Reason five You can wait for two hours only for 30-second with Pamela Anderson and David HasselhoffI don't remember original Baywatch. Frankly, I remember only boobs. And I have never been a fan of this series. So, I can't say that true fans wouldn't like new Baywatch (guys, are you really like a dicks in the movie???). But if it is remake of old TV series then the connection is very weak. There are several references and David Hasselhoff with Pamela Anderson appear. But there are no atmosphere of previous series.

The characters are underdeveloped and poorly written, the Bad Guy is barely in this and is so boring. Most of the time the female characters could've been replaced with cardboard cutouts labeled ""Romantic Interest"". Their attempt at Meta Humor is shallow and weak. The pacing is painfully slow.

My limited exposure to the series was covering a weekend shift at work when it was still airing. And I am pretty sure every time that happened it was the same episode each time. Yet, I never did see the whole thing. So, when I first heard they were doing a movie based on the series, my knee jerk reaction was to snort and give it a hard pass. Then I saw that it was starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and saw a trailer and I said, ""Okay, now I have to see it!"".So, where to even begin on this one?WARNING: If you are lactose intolerant or suffer from dairy sensitivity, avoid, I repeat, AVOID this film at all costs. Content within contains extremely high levels of cheesiness. 5 times more that recommended USDA allowances.Baywatch should also be avoided if you take life too seriously, have chronic uptightness, and are woefully lacking a sense of humor or appreciation for complete ridiculousness.That being said, I confess Baywatch is an awful movie. Absolutely terrible. The plot is thin, the acting amateurish, the characters two dimensional, and with few exceptions the dialogue forgettable. In good conscious I cannot recommend seeing this film at all let alone in the theater except under the following condition. Baywatch is primo Mystery Science Theater 3000 fodder and should be approached accordingly. Even better if done so as a group.You can neither take this film seriously nor should you try. You will find yourself crackin' on this bad boy and as a result, against all rhyme, reason, and self-respect enjoying yourself. This is one of those it's so bad it's good, train wreck of a film that while horrifying to watch, you can't tear your eyes away and secretly find entertaining.At the end of the day, if you're looking for a good, quality film, let the sun set on Baywatch and see something else. If, however, you're up for complete, over the top, tripe and a guilty pleasure, brave the breakers, slather on the sunscreen, hit the beach and movie theater and check out Baywatch. It's awful.

I think they did.First, you need one or two good actors that can be very corny and still convincing. With Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron you have two actors that are a delight. The fact that Zac Efron's character is a good-looking guy but still has a very unattractive and cheesy demeanor is a nice touch.When it comes to the jokes, I think they are often fairly good. They are not hilarious but not boring. Yes, there is a lot of dick humor, but I guess that people with only swimsuits brings forward that kind of comedy.The plot is thin but not a catastrophe. They solve a simple drug mystery, not more or less. The jokes about them not being cops or characters in a classic American hero-movie like Top Gun is entertaining even if they lose their freshness after 20 minutes. But hey, it is just some light Baywatch entertainment.",Baywatch

Zac effron was okay, but a bit more could have been expected from him. Rock as always like in all his movies played the his role similarly.

Throughout the film there is lots of action which is exciting and all the actors and actresses do an excellent job!

Baywatch(The movie) based on the popular/cult TV series is an action packed comedy with a great cast and epic punchlines that will have you gasping for air from the non laughter .Less than 20 minutes into the movie , you will be rolling on the floor laughing and it only gets better ! The script follows the familiar story-telling of the TV show where you don't need great mystery or detail to create a great story . There is plenty of suspense and plenty of comic relief to keep this movie well balanced and true to the feeling of ""Baywatch"" .There are many many haters that are slamming the movie for being too vulgar , not funny etc etc . Trust is , they propably expected a 2 hour slow motion strip show to drool over . All in all , this movie is hilarious and has you crying in laughter with the epic punchlines and trolling while at the same time paying its respects to the original TV series with cameos and a special treat!Don't listen to the haters .

279,Film96,"Not particularly good but not particularly bad either, just painfully in the middle",5,31 May 2017,"I wasn't expecting anything great from this movie, so I wasn't too disappointed. What can you expect from a Baywatch movie? Of you're going to get a few cheap jokes, sexual references, the occasional violence and a lot of camera ogling (albeit mostly focusing on Zac Efron during a workout scene). What damages this film the most is the fact that it tries too hard to be as good as 21 Jump Street. 21 was, and still is, a very funny film and Baywatch has clearly taken note of the ""pro-takes-on- the-bumbling-apprentice"" style of comedy of which is so brilliantly portrayed in movies like 21 J S, Hot Fuzz (etc). However, Baywatch is not the new Hot Fuzz and it isn't the new 21, it is just Baywatch.The humour is very predictable, often relying on bad language to add some sort of risqué edge to the painful, slapstick humour throughout the movie. It has its moments of humour and the action is exciting enough for the purposes of the film, but it just doesn't have enough in it to make it interesting. The film itself is roughly 2 hours, that is ridiculous. Trim it down to a 1-hour one-off reboot special and you'd probably be watching a very good episode of Baywatch, but as a standalone film, it is painfully bland.",Baywatch

Simple, funny, beautiful to watch, for me it was a relaxing moment.At the writing level, we could have had better,the jokes have a some dust on the corners.

I never even saw the original Baywatch but it doesn't matter. I literally laughed out loud in the first 20 minutes and there were many more funny enough moments to keep it going.

This is the saddest attempt at humor this year - easy.  This movie is surrealistically politically correct except to white men.  Dwayne Johnson disappoints here especially, just like in the majority  of recent movies he's made he appeals to a generation of self-entitled,  brainless teenagers and should-be-grown-ups. Fist-bumping with a black  police officer whenever he can because he's half Samoan or whatever  while ridiculing the white male sunny-boy type of a character at the  lowest levels, who is depicted as a braindead, mush-for-brains  super-athlete who is so reckless and egocentric that it hurts following  his dialogue, while not surprisingly the virgin-type of a  character played by Jon Bass is getting all the attention of the ladies  despite his much-less-than-athletic bodytype and shyness around women.  It is so obvious that it seems as if this movie was funded by George  Soros himself. On the other side the female characters are depicted as  smart and witty. No exceptions. In addition the female villain  character is depicted as a feminist (the extremist nonsensical type)  who talks-down at her own bodyguards/henchmen in such an incredibly  rude manner I am generally surprised this is acceptable for the  theaters leaving a bad image for the younger viewers as to what is  acceptable behavior for women towards men. This does not exclude the  majority of other female characters though, it's pretty much standard  through and through. Except towards Dwayne Johnson and his  friend Jon Bass of course.  Seriously. If it wasn't for the sex-sells premise this would have  deserved zero stars.  I do not recommend watching this movie, ever. If you can watch it for  free, maybe, if you have absolutely nothing else to watch. Don't give  such terrible writers your money in the theaters. It only encourages  them to feed you sh*t movies in the future - and get away with it  making millions just because The Rock is in it and it's based on a  'classic' from the 80s.",Baywatch

The plot was extremely predictable, the characters had no emotional depth or chemistry (even if the actors had fun working together), the villain was absolutely horrendous, a vast majority of the ""jokes"" didn't land and the special effects were simply terrible just to name a few things wrong with this unnecessary re-imagining of an old TV Show famous for showing women in tight lifeguard suits (that probably being the best aspect of this film, too). It wasn't even fun to watch for someone like me who was just looking to sit back and watch a dumb comedy on a friday evening with the lowest expectations imaginable, despite it being one of the more raunchy comedies I've seen recently. The only thing keeping this mess from being the absolute worst film of 2017 is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, he's just a likeable guy and is solely responsible for making me chuckle maybe once or twice during the entirety of ""Baywatch"".

It could have been so much better. The Good: Most of the acting is good, totally loved Dwayne's quips towards Zac Efron in calling him Boy Band names - hilarious and well executed. Some of the humor was solidThe Bad: Not all the acting was good, not all the execution was solid, and not all of the writing or script was great - - meaning, some cases the jokes were short and some carried on too long, didn't sink into you or grab you or kept you into the character. IMO a lot of mis-fires. Would have loved to have seen Dwayne throw some of the ""The Rock"" eyebrow look - especially during the fighting scene in the kid's room. Would have loved to have seen more beach goers and bikinis and nice girls -- that's part of what Baywatch is about - - bikinis and babes and the 2 main female characters were good but could have had more of that with the public, beach people, parties, etc. I think they missed out on this.

(Spoilers, but u shouldn't care, the film's that bad!)",1,12 June 2017,"This film is bland, horrific, poorly written, poorly acted, and downright terrible!I'm not going to talk much about this one because I don't feel like wasting more time on this movie. Let's just point out 4 awful scenes:1. In the Morgue, a character must bring a dead man's penis into full view of the audience, and while a reason is given at first, we then get the classic ""lol, it was just a prank bro!"" And thanks to this unfunny attempt at ""comedy"" the audience is subjected to a dead man's penis. Lovely. 2. So, Zac's character is at a party, and while he's meant to be unseen, he is in no disguise at all. No one recognizes him until he does something he's now infamous for in this film's 'world' and even worse, the previously mentioned 'world' has him as an Olympic gold medal winning athlete! And absolutely no one recognized him! What fantastic writing. 3. Speaking of fantastic writing, one scene shows a character being called out for looking at another character's boobs. She then proceeds to jump up and down to draw more attention to them. Then she's like ""omg, you looked at them again!"" And the guy's like ""lol, u got me, guess I goofed it!"" And that's the joke. THIS SCENE IS USELESS AND NOT FUNNY. 4. About 7 minutes of this movie are dedicated to a character's erection being stuck in a beach chair. After he body slams himself into it. First, this scene is unfunny and useless, like all 'comedic' scenes in this film. But oh my god, why! The scene could have been left out and NOTHING would have changed except the audience wouldn't be forced to watch it. SPOILERS! They kill the bad guy and all live happily ever after. And yes, this film has some plot. Except it's so damn generic it could barley be called a plot! Like I said, I'm not getting into it because this film is a waste of my time and I've already wasted enough time telling the few people that read this about how godawful it is. Overall, I wish I could give this movie a negative star rating. Mr. Rock really wasted his time in this generic mud puddle of a film and he wasted the audience's time as well.",Baywatch

I'm a subscriber to Netflix and requested this movie with a ""what the heck, let's check it out"" attitude. It was very entertaining.Dwayne Johnson just has something about him that I find enjoyable. I've seen him on Saturday Night Live and he was a great host. People who can laugh at themselves without taking it too seriously are my kind of people. Sort of like Arnold in Terminator.There is a plot but not really important. The beach babes and dudes are also there but again, not really important. What does count is the absolutely entertaining atmosphere that follows this film. There are lots of jokes and situational humor and I laughed out loud quite a few times.I thought it was well cast and everyone did a good job. I would give it 10 stars if the plot was just a bit more coherent.When it's all said and done, movies like this are about entertainment and this movie is very entertaining. Well worth the rental.

313,UweBollFan1,Wasted Talent,2,30 May 2017,"To start, I had high hopes for this movie...well maybe high hopes is a little strong...let's just say a lot of good vibes. The cast is strong with very likable and funny actors all through the movie, even in the ""bit parts"", (Rob Huebel, Oscar Nunez, Hannibal Buress) However, the comedy falls flat throughout the film. Dwayne Johnson and Zac Effron have a talent for comedy and natural charm and there were one or two scenes that made me chuckle (Heimlich Maneuver, Coroners Office, The Rocks insults to Zac Effron) but most scenes felt like the jokes had somehow been edited out. For example, every scene with the Beach Patrol Officer. Every line is delivered as if it's supposed to have you cracking up, except the dialogue is as bland as baby food. There are literally no jokes in anything he says...I felt bad for the actor, hell, I felt bad for all of the actors. Instead of witty or even mildly amusing dialogue, we are left with shoe horned in curse words. Don't get me wrong, I love a good f word here and there and everywhere (Midnight Run is in my Top 10 Comedies) but there is a feel for it that good comedies can pull off. Deadpool had a feel for it... Baywatch definitely does not. The plot was all over the place and nonsensical, but that can almost be excused, as it's a Baywatch movie after all. However this wouldn't have passed a script reading for Baywatch Nights. (Google it, it's dreadfully amazing) Seriously, they could have done a mashup of different episodes of the show and had a better story (Brady Bunch Movies) or even a mashup of Son of the Beach episodes (totally underrated) and been better off. As I left the theater, a quote from A Bronx Tale kept playing in my mind; ""The saddest thing in life is wasted talent.."" Amen to that.",Baywatch

325,csauces,Truly the best!,10,6 June 2017,"Baywatch was brought back to life on the big screen after the most successful TV show in the early nineteen nineties. The show castes David Hasselhoff as Mitch Buchannon, and Pamela Anderson as one of the beautiful Baywatch babes, C. J. Parker. The movie in turn, has made people around the world feel ecstatic, heartfelt, and sometimes even anxious. In addition, several of the actors showed us each of the iconic characters in a whole new light. The movie starred Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson(as Mitch Buchannon), Zac Efron(as Matt Broody), Alexandra Daddario(as Summer Quinn), Jon Bass(as Ronnie), Ilfenesh Hadera(as Stephanie Holden), and Kelly Rohrbach(as C.J. Parker). The Hoff himself does a short cameo, along with Pamela Anderson in the film. In the first part of the movie, you see Mitch running alongside the ocean, watching everyone with eyes like a hawk. He stays calm, cool, and collect. However, Mitch still sticks to his job in a very serious manner ensuring, everything is as it should be, but with a warm touch. Later on, he gets even more assertive, as he has to deal with the brand new recruit Matt Broody, who thinks he is hot stuff because of his skill set, or the lack of. Matt Broody tries to get by with a half hearten work ethic, but fails miserably. All the while, having no knowledge of what a lifeguard is all about, and the never ending drinking habit. During which the offer lifeguards see him as some kind punk wanna be, trying to impress them. When instead, he proves he is just a total lazy butt, who craves everyone's attention. As the movie progresses, Mitch becomes more reluctant about having Matt on their team knowing he will just drop the ball again. The other lifeguards such as, Summer Quinn and Stephanie Holden even object him for a while. Broody has no respect for women, or what they do on a day to day basis to save their beach. Near the end though, he has a change of heart once he realizes the issue is much bigger than himself. I felt like the actors did an amazing job portraying their roles on screen. I definitely noticed how each character developed throughout the movie. I was also impressed with how the director, Seth Gordon, the whole crew, as well as the cast stuck to the story line the entire flick. The movie flowed smoothly from beginning to end. Also, Vaywatch had a very good message to give to the audience. Which it consists of looking out for your team, but doing it the right way, even if you have to go out of your comfort zone. In conclusion, I recommend Baywatch for people ages seventeen and older. There is language throughout, nudity, and crude adult content.",Baywatch

329,dcipledude,Just plain old fun - review from a 39-year old former Baywatchfan,8,19 August 2017,"I honestly don't get the negative reviews, I was 13 years old when Baywatch aired and immediately I was hooked and had major crushes on Eleniak, Anderson and Eggert. I watched many seasons back then so I know very well how campy the series was and how 50% of the time useless slow-mo scenes were added, just to fill the story-gaps. I had no expectations at all, the trailers were quite funny but I feared it would be a National Lampoon's or Broken Lizard Baywatch, too much slapstick funny stuff .. Luckily that wasn't the case, the movie doesn't take itself too serious and SFX is almost laughable compared to 2017 standards but frankly : you don't care when watching this movie, you just go with flow and accept its a silly flick about 2 beefcake lifeguards doing many things ordinary lifeguards wouldn't dream of doing (just like in the series). There is NO nudity at all, some dick-jokes, some sexy ladies in a tight swimsuit and the Rock & Zac Efron playing the ""destined to become buddies"" story line. Yeah so what the bad guy (lady) is miscast, Kelly Rohrbach isn't as pretty as she should have been and Daddario wears too much clothes .. Btw, don't expect too much of the cameo's from Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson, its just stupid how they forced in an extra scene for these 2.",Baywatch

331,gyrex-au,Another movie ruined by political correctness & unrealism,1,30 August 2017,"Another Hollywood movie which couldn't help itself engage in depicting unrealistic, cancerous, politically correct scenarios. The most poignant is how an overweight, geeky, unfit, awkward man can somehow beat out an entire squadron of fit, healthy and more suitable contenders to become a lifeguard - because he tries hard. The fact that the producers would even try and entertain this notion is mind-boggling. Coupled with the flagrant overuse of super-women stereotype makes one nauseous.

332,tleefent,Waste of Time,2,30 June 2018,"I used to watch Baywatch on TV not because it was great drama but it was just pretty clean enjoyable fun. This movie was so far from that. The script from the show wasn't great but far better than this movie. Why do script writers think it is funny to have the f-bomb dropped about 10 times in 2 minutes of dialogue? There is nothing cool or fun about that. Oh then there are the ""dick"" jokes that never stop. They could have made this into an fun and enjoyable guilty pleasure kind of movie but no they have to go and do what every other writer does that remakes an old tv show into a film....they ruin it with an incredibly terrible script and stupid juvenile toilet humor that just isn't funny or entertaining. The only reason I finished this was to see if it got any better. I expect a little better from Dwayne Johnson and a whole lot better from Zac Efron. who I admit was the best part of the movie for me.

The writers didn't make them so immoral and stupid like most recent comedies that you couldn't care less if they all died 8n the film or not. I will probably watch more than once. Efron and The Rock great as ALWAYS! Dwayne and the perfect straight foil for Efron's comic genius. He's never afraid to be the jerk or goof. Warm and interesting supporting cast members!

The women in this film are there to show of their boobs, the writer and the director seem to be oblivious to the fact that we have heads on top of our bodies. One man in this film are so taken by all these boobs that he end up in strange situations, why do the director want to give fire to the old (very old) belief that men are victims to their urges and can't control themselves? Really? And this in 2017? What will be the next project? A movie about a rape where they blame it on the victims dress? So, it is worse than After Earth? Yes. Both movies suck, but this one is sexist beyond belief. Spend your money on some corn seeds and watch them grow, that will definitely be more interesting.",Baywatch

There's a running gag in this film about the Baywatch lifeguards refusing to understand that they're not law enforcement. It's hilarious satire of the original show and the entire premise, and the film almost starts to sound smart in these moments. The script keeps returning to this joke and it remains humorous, but there's no real payoff. Other humor in the movie is sporadic. The Rock and Zac Efron have chemistry as rivals. Efron is especially funny and the highlight of the film. Aside from that, there is some gross-out humor that doesn't work, and the rest of the story is played as a straight and dark action piece. There was potential for the action sequences to be played for comedy, but they're strangely earnest. Even when an action sequence strives for humor (in particular a tussle between Dwayne Johnson's Mitch and a henchman), it feels like a weak attempt.In the end, this film doesn't gel. It wouldn't have worked at all if it was just a self-serious action spectacle. But the comedy that's there is lazy and occasional. There was probably a better version of this film that went further into Police Academy-level absurdity. What we got was a mish-mosh of a movie that feels unfinished.",Baywatch

366,JacobWayoff,It's Fun!,9,1 January 2018,"Is the movie going to win Best Picture? No. Is it a fun movie to enjoy when you want to relax and be entertained? Absolutely. The movie is some good comedic moments, it doesn't take itself seriously, it has explosions, fighting, and cutie people in bathing suits saving the day. Enjoy it for what it is. You can tell the cast and crew had fun and it does a great job of being silly and paying tribute to the original source material. If you don't like a little crude humor or some action sequences, this isn't the movie for you.",Baywatch
367,ASFan213,One of the most frustrating movie experiences I've had in a while.,3,16 June 2017,"I was looking forward to the Baywatch movie with certain expectations, as a dopey, silly summer comedy that had cast most of the right people in their respective roles. The trailers, while not perfect, I thought showed some potential for the movie to be akin to a 21 Jump Street style adaptation of an older cheesy TV show albeit not as good, but still enjoyable nonetheless. But it falters on so many levels that I cannot defend it, and I'm usually able to defend certain movies I've looked forward to before that weren't well-received by others.I'll get the brief positives out of the way first. For the most part, they got the right people to star in this. Dwayne Johnson (playing David Hasselhoff's part) and Zac Efron do make a solid pairing, even if they're playing their standard character archetypes. No one in the cast is really at fault her. They're just victims of bad material. And there are some minor amusing self aware moments including how these characters, who are lifeguards, are inexplicably solving crimes.Now onto the first big negative. Although, like I said, the trailers suggested an adaptation of the show akin to 21 Jump Street, from the opening frame of the movie, it does not feel like such a movie. It starts with a rescue sequence shot in over-dramatized fashion. And the problem is, while the movie goes for deliberately ridiculous, it's not played out in a comedic fashion. It feels more like a Fast and Furious movie. There are numerous action sequences in this movie that play out in this fashion. And the filmmakers didn't seem to understand the difference between playing up ridiculousness for thrills or laughs, playing up its ridiculousness without fully addressing it head on like the Jump Street movies did. And quite frankly, it falters on both fronts, especially in the action bits which feature some very shoddy CGI. That, in turn, makes the actual attempts at humor, most of which were spoiled in the trailers, feel shoehorned in. It doesn't help that most of the humor is just simple raunchy humor. The movie seems really unsure of itself. This is reflected in the editing where it seems like they filmed a lot and couldn't decide what to keep.The second big problem this movie has is that most of the actors aside from Johnson and Efron are sorely underutilized. Kelly Rohrbach clearly has a bubbly personality playing Pam Anderson's part, but she's relegated to manic pixie dream girl to Jon Bass's role as the out of shape character in a cast full of pretty people. Ilfenesh Hadera probably fares the worst out of all the cast members in terms of development as she's just there as a steely personality type to function as Johnson's number 2, even though she was supposed to be his love interest which is clearly not shown at all.This lack in character development was particularly irritating to me when it came to Alexandra Daddario. I've been a solid fan of her for a while now and I was rather excited to see her in a Baywatch movie. Yes, it was partly for the wrong reasons *cough*True Detective*cough*, but she's shown herself to be a very capable actress when she's given the right kind of material. Considering she was the first female they cast in the movie (I personally predicted she would be when Efron was announced to join), I get the sense her role was originally bigger, but it seems like it had been reduced through a combination of rewrites and scenes left on the cutting room floor, leaving her with a character with little to no development. She's shown to be excited to be a part of the lifeguard squad without explaining why. And she's set up as the sassy romantic interest to Efron's standard douche-bro character without the relationship fully developing. Once the plot kicks into gear, she's just relegated to tag-a-long status where all she's allowed to do is give reaction shots.Speaking of the plot of the movie, it represents the third big problem, that being the plot involving the villain played by Priyanka Chopra. The plot itself is an already thin one that's stretched even thinner. Now, before people throw knives at me, the problem lies not with Chopra or her performance. If she had given a bad performance, that would have added to the problem regarding her. The problem is that she's only as good as her *character's* presence allows her to be. Those who try to highlight her as a positive element of the movie are just undermining the issue her character presents for the movie, of which there are two. Between her casting announcement, later marketing and opening scenes, she's established as the villain very early on in the movie, so that means most of the scenes afterward involving her or her henchmen until the climax are just there to reestablish them as the villains of the movie, who are cookie cutter villains. And when it doesn't involve them, it involves the investigation into her. That, in turn, removes any sense of mystery or surprise from the movie. The second issue those scenes create is that they just waste screen time that could have been used to develop the supporting characters, which the movie could have used a lot more of. At that point, I didn't really care one way or another for how pointless the requisite show cameos were.So yeah, I wanted to enjoy this, but I couldn't. I had been Tweeting with the writers hoping that we were on the same page about what this movie would be, but it doesn't seem like the case. If they had intended to go for the R-rated comedy route, they would have been better off attempting an ensemble character comedy in the vein of Wet Hot American Summer and put much less emphasis on a plot to stop a villain.",Baywatch
368,soju1664,"Beautiful Bodies, Beaches, Sunsets, Stupid Jokes.... What's not to like??",7,24 June 2017,"I saw this as we had a toss up between this and Pirates of the Caribbean. We couldn't face another rehash of that franchise, so despite the negative reviews we went for Baywatch. We were both very pleasantly and humorously surprised. Baywatch isn't going to win any Oscars or cause me think about it again and again like some movies do (Covenant & Prometheus being good examples) but it did entertain me solidly for two hours. It has funny bits throughout the film which caused me to laugh out loud and is well paced, although a little formulaic with the story. The cast were good, especially Dwayne Johnson who seems to have had the part written for him. The humour isn't high-brow but there is a good amount of the film parodying itself. Much better than The Mummy and a good waste of two hours, which is exactly why I go the cinema.",Baywatch

Lots of laughs! There are the generic breast and penis jokes, lots of butt and boob close ups, but also genuine hilarity. The men and women at my movie theater couldn't stop laughing. In fact, I had to cover my mouth several times from laughing TOO loudly. There are moments of warmth, lessons to be learned, and a lot of Zac Efron's abs. With the amount of ladies' butts shown in this movie, it rivals the latest Fast and Furious movie. I also feel that the people who wrote reviews who say they got up to leave in the middle, or thirty minutes in, sorely missed out on a wonderful film. Don't listen to the critics, go see this film!",Baywatch

The bottom line is this is a 90s TV series, so people should stop calling it an 80s TV series. It is important to do your research and state facts correctly. Unfortunately we cannot even count on costume designers to do their research. For example kilts in Braveheart well before they started wearing them in Scotland.",Baywatch

418,abshaw26,"Don't listen to the terribly negative reviews, it was satire and it was hilarious.",7,27 March 2018,"I'm shocked by the terribly negative reviews. They read as if the writers were expecting a movie that aims for Oscar consideration or ""serious 'art,'"" or as if they expected it to be built with a George Carlin like comic style and genius. Baywatch should be judged on its own merits. If ""dick jokes"" as many have called them and or the kind of machismo humor used here offend you than perhaps you need to brush that chip off your shoulder and grow up. ""Childish?"" Maturity has more to do with an ability to cope and laugh at anything. An inability to do those, along with a need to appear adult like by rejecting some humor as inappropriate is by definition immaturity. If you don't like it, fine. But the horribly negative judgments are incredible. This movie was HILARIOUS. Every movie has its place within every genre which also has its place, so this should be rated accordingly. This movie will make you laugh right from the start as long as you see it for what it is. It is a satirical comedy with an exaggeration on real life people, their egos, and the craziness they can get into. Along with Girls Trip, by far the best comedy of the past 5 years imo. I only gave it a seven because, after all, it still isn't ""great art"", nor does it have the strongest story line, but nevertheless, it entertained me so much it is only the second DVD I have purchased after seeing a movie in a decade.",Baywatch

Dwayne Johnson takes over Hasselhoff's role as Lt Buchanan a man dedicated to his job as a lifeguard, keeping the beach safe and clean as well as training the newbies. Zac Efron play his part well as a cocky athlete riding high on his two gold medals representing USA in the Olympics to serving community service.Alexandra Daddario has some good comic moments. Kelly Rohrbach and Ilenesh Hadera were fine although they did not have much screen time. Jon Bass's character of Ronnie as the Tech lifeguard who has the hot spot for CJ.Last of all Priyanka Chopra's big Hollywood debut after starring in Quantico was the weakest link in this movie as the villain. She plays the owner of the bay side resort The Huntley club, whilst dealing with drugs and forcefully buying out existing businesses so that she can expand her drug trade. This leads to Buchanan finding drugs on the beach and investigates how they ended up on the beach and who is dealing them.All I can say that this it's a good enough movie to watch if you would like to have a good laugh and kill some time.",Baywatch

After the hilarious over the top open sequence it's clear this film as no intention to take itself seriously, and neither should you. It's not trying to be a gritty hard hitting detective themed action drama masterpiece and I feel that's the standard to which this film is being held by many reviews. There are plot holes and some of the action scenes are over the top and unrealistic. One moment in particular when the main characters are hiding, laughing and making jokes not 5 feet from a couple of thugs without so much as a curtain to separate them, but it is a funny scene. The plot is thin and there is little character development but it doesn't matter. It's a silly, self-aware and ultimately fun film that makes no excuses for what it is or isn't. Don't go into this film thinking it's trying to get Oscar nominations and you'll probably just enjoy the ride.",Baywatch

They are so mad at The Rock for the R rating that they won't watch him at all anymore! Which means I'm stuck with things like Trolls for family movie night. Thanks a lot, Johnson! :) As for the movie, I think it actually would have been better (same for other TV remakes like CHiPs) without trying to change the tone or feel of the original so drastically.

440,hivahamzavi,Worst 2 hours of my life!!,1,18 August 2017,"I cannot believe I didn't walk out!! It was horrible!!! And here is why: 1. The story. It was cheesy, clishe, boring, over dramatic, and kinda immature. 2. The characters. Their actions did not make any sense WHATSOEVER! A Lieutenant who fires his man without knowing the whole story or helping him through it and then quits and gives up soooo easily , a kinda depressed and broke Olympic medalist who has never had the sense of a family or loyalty so he doesn't want anything to do with it and covers it with his ego and alcohol yet the exact next morning of his big screw up and embarrassment he decides he wants in again just because??? (Also he says ""i'm sorry i know i screwed up"" 5 times in 10 mins. Not accurate but you know) and then the clishe chubby smart and desperate-for-love character whose penis was more important in the movie than his brain!! And then the girls which gets me to my next point 3. What was the point of having the character ""Summer""? She had, I think, 5-6 lines. But her boobs had pages after pages written about them. And she was basically pointless, if she wasn't in this movies, nothing would change!!! At all! And then cj character, typical hot blonde girl who FINALLY falls for the chubby and desperate guys... And Stephanie who was like ... ummm... WHAT WAS SHE? They went and hired a Woman to be the bad guy why to promote equality and yet there are the girls that seemed so uncomfortable in their swimsuits in the BTS showed during credits. 4. Cinematography. Awful. Terrible. A 4 year old with a 50 year old camera could do better! Doing a slow motion whenever someone's running??? Really?? And the up and down shots of a boat that based on the sound seemed to be going pretty fast but on screen looked like the handbrake was still on! 5. The music. Ahhh they butchered it. It did not match what was happening AT ALL! I felt like the music belonged to another version of the movie with different editing and someone somehow missed it!! 6. The unbelievably unrealistic visual effects. Dude! A 4 year old on an iPad could do better ! 7. The fact that Dwayne Johonson's character ended up doing EVERYTHING , saving EVERYONE including himself WHILST HE WAS SHOT which he also managed to keep under control BY HIMSELF!!!! Way to teach teamwork guys.... bravo.... .... Not gonna lie, I think Priyanka's acting was actually good. But other than that.... I believe this movie and how it portrayed men and specially women, is exactly what we've been trying to teach our kids NOT to do for the last years. Nice job on going 10 steps backwards!!!",Baywatch
441,stakismavridis,A Nice summer comedy with lots of jokes,9,5 June 2017,"I had a really great time watching this movie and I am quite glad I chose it over the Pirates of the Caribbean. There are lots of nice jokes and contrary to my initial thoughts, there are very few nude scenes. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Effron are both great leads and they inarguably take part in all the funny scenes of the movie. I have to admit that I was quite cautious before going to see the movie due to all the negative reviews and I finally came to a conclusion about all the people who believe that every movie should be reviewed as a potential Oscar nominee! Not all movies have to be ""serious"" and dramatic. I know most of the reviewers out there were expecting to see something like ""The Pianist"" when they bought tickets for ""Baywatch"" and that is the reason why this movie let them down. My advice is to watch movies that make you have a nice time (Baywatch is one of them alongside Piranha 3D, American Pie). Not all movies are filmed in order to become Oscar Nominees! Many of them are made with the goal of making the viewers have a great time! Please take that into account the next time you are criticizing a movie!",Baywatch

This movie is dump, unfunny and boring.First of all: I didn't expect anything like a deep story, cool characters or even good effects. I just wanted to watch this movie with some friends to see if its funny. But after I saw the credits, i can say that it is not even that.I only laughed like one or two times in this movie, although it is a comedy film. Most of the jokes are not funny, some are even really bad.The actors are not good at all, just one or two. Something like a character development or a tiny bit of a story doesn't exist at all. Everything is too predictable.It' s not even entertaining to watch! There is never something like tension or a plot. And the computer effects look like there were made by a 14 year old tennnage boy who just learned about Windows Movie Maker.I normally don't write reviews.

But there is few things that made this movie not 10/10.
The action was 'meh' i mean, it wasn't something special, and its really underrated compare to other Dwayne Johnson movies. -1 for that.The 'fire-boat' scene was waste of time, not because i think it was boring. NO! Its looked like someone just forgot to do something and they made that like 1 day before the film had to be released. I mean the green screen looked really bad and even some YouTube videos creators made better green-screen stuff. -1 for that.I think some of the characters just didn't play so good like these 2 body guards of the Bad Mexican Girl. They like wasn't necessary and didn't do much. And they had a lot of screen time. -1 for that.
Overall? Well, as i said before the movie is GOOD, but not GREAT! It's answer the 'comedy' category because the jokes were good but its not really 'big-time' movie.
It's really good movie when you are just sited with couple of friends and eating slice of pizza and just wanna laugh a little bit!",Baywatch
445,crsmial-32649,Not A Single Fart Joke Was Given!,9,29 May 2017,"I am forty-six years old and I'll be one of the first decry Hollywood's descent into 'nothing but potty humor' notions of what passes for comedy these days. Also, having been seventeen when the show first aired I can tell you that the gratuitous shots of bouncing breasts in slow motion we're not nearly as prevalent as people remember, in what little I saw of it. That said, I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews and poor opening of this film! I can't help but wonder what in the world people were expecting. To be fair, I may have watched about five episodes of the TV show when it was on, but my assumption was that the show was about a group of lifeguards getting into situations and capers well outside the purview of a group of lifeguards. For me, this movie was practically perfect at being what it set out to be. It never tried to take itself too seriously, yet was only just campy enough to let the audience know that. I thought everyone performed well in their given roles, the jokes were hilarious and no more excessive than what I would expect the 2017, rated 'R' film version to pull off. At times I even felt like I was in the middle of a seasons long binge on Netflix. This movie did a decent job of making the outlandish 'not-so-mysterious mystery' somewhat believable and I even half-expected a scene near the end with Priyanka Chopra's villain saying, 'And I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling lifeguards and your bigger, stronger Hasselhoff!' Now as a disclaimer, this was the first 'R' rated movie I took my teen-aged son to see so I thought perhaps my laugh meter was ratcheted up, but the theater that was 85% full at 9:20PM on a Sunday night all seemed to be laughing as hard as we were. I think perhaps people were just upset with this film for having not enough naked women and sexual situations, or contrarily didn't want their Baywatchers using foul language and making penis jokes? I don't know. I say go see this movie with zero expectations, let it be what it is, don't be a prude, and you will laugh a lot and have a good time!",Baywatch

They probably didn't watch the same movie I did or simply had no sense of humor. Here's the thing... Baywatch is not about the Oscars. It's not about great acting. It's not about being focused. This movie is a parody to the original show and it LIVES UP TO THAT. So, if you didn't enjoy the original Baywatch show, then you will hate this movie. Why even watch it if that's the case?You don't go to the movies expecting to see anything specific from a movie because you will always be let down. Go expecting nothing and see where the writers and director(s) take you. That's what I enjoyed about this movie. I read too many bad reviews and saw a horrible trailer. But when I went to watch it, I said f*ck all the bad reviews and let's see what they got. They impressed me because it made me feel like I was watching a modern day Baywatch plus gave me an action plot line on top of the comedy. Newsflash: The original show is not meant to be serious or have great acting, it's supposed to be comedy.So yes, the movie lived up to what it was meant to. Those who expected more, hated it.

The movie as a whole ... was at best ordinary ... just capitalizing on named stars ... with half nude women and vulgar language to appease the masses.",Baywatch

469,tteape-75371,Movie was funny with a simple plot,8,30 June 2017,"People are dogging on this movie in other reviews, but I thought it was funny. It was like 21 Jump street but with life guards instead of cops and that isn't a bad thing. It was pretty funny at parts and it was a comedy through and through. No serious plot and the characters made a lot of dumb decisions like most comedies do. I think this movie is worth a watch despite the reviews",Baywatch
470,bhankee,I really liked it!,10,14 August 2018,"I am reading through all of these reviews, and I am surprised by how many people disliked this film! Many people complain about the 'sophmoric humor' and I disagree. Now, I am not the type of person to enjoy movies such as 'Dumb and Dumber', but I am surprised by how many people like that one compared to this one! The humor in DaD is AWFUL but is loved by so many and the humor in Baywatch is good and hated by so many.",Baywatch

472,skihjacob,Not so Baywatch,3,4 September 2017,"The main reason i went to see this movie was due to the exact reason the original Baywatch series is known for. Gorgeous ladies part of lead cast, their bodies, in bikinis, slow mos etc (likewise probably true for people interested in opp sex, shirtless men, muscle running in short swim trunks).Now add some decent simple plot and humour to it that's all I needed. Simple and straight. Now you can call me pervert, ogler, creepy for it. You can see all this stuff online why go to a movie blah blah.Its simple,not every movie do i go with the same expectations. Not every movie you get to see A rated cast with Baywatch kind of a setting.In the end its a freaking Baywatch,it is what it is, what do you expect. the trailers promotions all suggested the same. No pretensions here.Now that I got my viewpoint/expectations out of the way let me talk about the movie. It came across as a damp squib on multiple fronts.Let me start with the characters.Beautiful ILefenesh Hadara as Stephanie. Her character isn't developed much, not even her relation with Mitch.And also she in spite of playing a lead lifeguard always on the beach, makers decided to cover her up as much as possible for reasons only known to them. Maybe one of the crew is her brother or something i don't know.Next is gorgeous Alexandra Daddario.She is like a ticking time-bomb ready to explode but only that she didn't. She could have Single Handedly pulled this movie to success but makers had other ideas. They downplayed her character, didn't use her acting skills, has this confused expression through the movie as if first grader looking for teacher's approval or something. And to add to it she's put in this top and shorts in few scenes that don't complement her body well. You don't get to see either of these two ladies in bikinis, and even when they are in their lifeguard suits, which again is rare, they are like intentionally put out of focus(except the last montage scene). And then you call this Baywatch??Stunning Priyanka Chopra as the antagonist. She tried her best, at times over-tried I have to say to bring life to her lifeless character. lots of boob-show from her. But Lazy writing coupled with weak plot didn't help things much. Overall she was OK.And then finally we have the ultimate Kelly Rohrbach as CJ Parker. Shez the only saving grace in this otherwise disappointing film. She was beautiful, hot, confident, lively and everything what the original Baywatch offered us. From bikinis to lifeguard suits to party wear she was rocking.Pamela is not replaceable as CJ Parker, but least we can say Kelly is the best as far as this film is concerned. Moving on to male cast,John Bass as one of the lifeguards. He's out of shape doesn't have a single qualification to be a life guard yet selected since he has heart and the will.Lol.The only reason he is here probably is for humour which was just OK.But He plays love interest of Kelly/CJ. Not fair. Then we have Zac Effron who is so over toned, I'm not sure if i can even call it healthy anymore. At least it didn't look that way to me. And finally Dwayne Johnson his usual self. Both Zac and John get much of the screen presence,they did OK. But again there is only so much they can do with no support from either writing or direction.I feel sad especially for Zac and Alexandra, both are fine actors let down by a poor script.Btw For ladies or other people interested in men, yes you get to see both of these men Zac and John shirtless in at least 2-3 sequences.Coming to the plot, this movie suffers from confusion whether to be a true Baywatch film with cheesy humorous plot or a movie with some emotional depth or a super hero larger than life action movie kinda plot and on top of it add some political correctness, cover-up the ladies,show bare ass of some fat men, dead man's dick for prolonged time(yuck). In the end it miserably fails on multiple fronts.Shout out to Kelly Rohrback for being the only life in this otherwise lifeless film.",Baywatch
473,hunnieheadquarters,Was funny at first but then...,3,7 September 2017,"I love raunchy comedies ranging from American Pie, Bad Grandpa, The Interview, Bad Neighbors, Horrible Bosses, and so on, you get the idea. However, going into this movie with high hopes of just as funny material, which we get the first 20 minutes of but after a while, it seemed the movie didn't know what kind of movie it wanted to be anymore. It went from adult humor to a plot from a Fast and Furious movie with a added side of Tooth Fairy humor. It was confusing and I ended up doing only a few chuckles during the rest of the movie. I thought it was going to be something funny, got hyped up when I saw Pamala and Hasselhoff included in the movie too but it was only for a 20 second peptalk and Pam with not even a line in the movie. This was a missed opportunity for sure and I was a little disappointed. Pros: Love Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efon. Girls were even hot too. Zac and Dwayne's banter was funny for the first half of the movieCons: 1. The amount of times they switched camera views was unbearable. Nothing was focused on one thing for no longer than 3 seconds. 2.Caught two times of the characters sneaking into an restricted area without being noticed by the staff there 3. Clichés to the point ofbeing cringy. 4. Dialogue seemed like it was written in 20 minutes 5.Did Dwayne just purposely let Zac make out with him? 6. ""Antagonist"" tried to be evil but didn't do much really but be sexy7. Other side characters were forgettable and they all tried to fight to be the funny one in the movie. But this is my review, don't let me sway you on what you decide but from someone who loves comedies, I didn't really enjoy this one.",Baywatch

I especially like the part at the beginning where they save the drowning kids and drowning mom. Please make another one by Christmas. or by thanksgiving it would be the best thanksgiving ever if another baywatch came out or San Andreas 2 please anything with Alexandra Daddario she has beautiful blue eyes and I want to be her I have brown eyes and I hate it.

475,evencrook,Nice movie to watch,8,1 November 2017,"It is not the best movie but could have been better. I wish there was some suspense in the movie, as everything was predictable. There can be the sequel to this movie which I feel could add some missing things in first part. I liked Zac Efron, he had made a much better look than before which is quite inspiring. Looks cool as well. I am from India, and good to see Priyanka Chopra in Hollywood. I would not like to go with the other's review. However, the movie was good!!",Baywatch

481,marlawatson,A fun distraction,10,16 May 2018,"I waited for Baywatch to come out on Hulu so I am just now getting to see it...gotta be honest, I'm a little shocked at all the bad reviews from both critics and audiences. I thought it was a fun movie and really enjoyed it. With the way the world is right now, it was really refreshing to watch something that wanted nothing more than to just make you laugh. And it did make me laugh, so thanks to the cast and crew. Laughter has been hard to come by lately when it comes to entertainment. Everything is just so heavy anymore--brutal and nihilistic.I grew up on cheezy action movies in the 80's and have really missed watching movies (well anything) with that same lightheartedness. In the opening scene when the rock rescues the kite surfer and the logo came up over the horizon with dolphins jumping through the letters--it was glorious. The rest of the movie did not disappoint.Baywatch never takes itself too seriously--enjoyed the music and the dialogue. Also enjoyed the cameos--was especially surprised and happy to see Oscar and AJ from the Office. I really have nothing negative to say about it.Too me, low brow, juvenile, or crass comedy that's not funny at all would be something in the vein of National Lampoon or Adam Sandler...you know, the comedies where the premise is to get laid and culminates at a house party. I didn't get those vibes with this movie at all, which is why I'm surprised to see people lumping it in the same category over a couple of silly dick jokes. I really don't feel that it objectified women at all. There may have been some shots of women in bathing suits, but nothing overtly sexual. The men in the movie were far more objectified than the women. And I happened to enjoy all that masculine eye candy, political correctness be damned.If you can successfully remove the stick from your ass before you sit down to watch this movie, you will have a good time.",Baywatch

I am utterly disappointed by watching this movie. Just body exposure is the worst form of objectification of women. The movie makers have tried to inject exotica by featuring an actress from the Third World. This could only satiate the sexual fantasies of the already over-sexed American male audience. As a pro-feminism male this is utterly unacceptable in a modern progressive society where women have been making giant strides in all walks of life.",Baywatch
