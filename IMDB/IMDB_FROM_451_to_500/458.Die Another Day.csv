0,TheLittleSongbird,My main problems with this entry are with Madonna...,7,18 August 2010,"I am going to start with the strengths of this Bond entry. It is for me one of the better-looking Bonds, both the cinematography and locations are truly inspired, and I loved the Icelandic snow palace. The pacing is relentless and the direction is done with fluid style, while the incidental music is good enough. The script has some nice moments too apart from some cringe-worthy one liners, while the action is very intense. In terms of acting, Pierce Brosnan is on fine form as the betrayed and vengeful secret agent. Bond is still charming and witty in some ways, but also tough and angry, Brosnan portrays this excellently. Halle Berry is a nice addition, and Judi Dench and John Cleese are solid too as is Toby Stephens as villainous Graves and especially beautiful Rosamund Pike as chillingly frosty Miranda Frost. However, the plot is quite familiar and quite preposterous in a sense in the second half, and there is an overload of CGI and sadly it's awful. My two main problems though are both to do with Madonna. One is that her theme song is truly grating and one of the more forgettable theme songs. The other is that her cameo as a fencing instructor is truly dire. In conclusion, a mostly solid if slightly disappointing entry in the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Die Another Day
1,bkoganbing,The Power Of The Sun Itself,5,24 November 2009,"Pierce Brosnan's last outing as James Bond takes place in Die Another Day which finds 007 trying to stop a rogue North Korean general from starting the Korean War all over again with the attending consequences. The North Koreans must have been watching Plan 9 From Outer Space because the gimmick they've come up with sounds remarkably like what those aliens were warning the Earth against developing.The power of the sun itself is brought into play here. There's a giant mirror in space which seeks to focus and concentrate the sun's energy for peaceful power purposes. But it sure can be an effective weapon of war as we see towards the film's end as Brosnan and his American counterpart agent Halle Berry.Part of the charm of the James Bond series is that you don't take it too seriously, but there are times that it becomes more like Indiana Jones and his narrow escapes than a modern espionage story. Die Another Day takes this point to the extreme.The year before Halle Berry won her Oscar for Monster's Ball and Die Another Day was her next film. Of course she's forever in the record books as the first black woman to win a Best Actress Oscar. But that's for history. I wonder if film fans remember her better as a Bond girl.There's another Bond girl as well, another MI6 agent played by Rosamund Pike. She's one deadly female and most resourceful. Toby Stephens, son of Maggie Smith plays a wealthy industrialist with a mysterious past and a cunning adversary for Pierce Brosnan.One thing I really liked towards the end was Ms. Moneypenny fulfilling her fantasy with James Bond. She's engaged in an early version of the Star Trek holograph deck. The poor woman has been carrying a torch for 007 for almost 50 years now, you'd think one of the Bonds would have given her a tumble already. Poor lovelorn Lois Maxwell now Samantha Bond ain't that ironic casting.Die Another Day is not as good as some of the other Brosnan entries in the Bond series, but should satisfy the cult of fans out there.",Die Another Day
2,Leofwine_draca,A middling swansong for Brosnan,5,21 June 2016,"Bond is brought smack-bang into the 21st century with DIE ANOTHER DAY. It's a long way from the likes of Sean Connery and DR. NO, but still holds true to the formula that made the films work in the first place: a powerful and creative hero, not superhuman but just very very good; lots of attractive female companions who can hold their own against the guys; some truly memorable villains, and a thin storyline over which plays out tons of action and excitement. Forget the non-excitement of the passable but uninteresting THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH and instead sit down to watch an action-packed ride through danger, thrills, spills and fun.The story isn't the best that Bond has seen but it will do for the film. The first hour is the main set-up whereas the last is the payoff, basically consisting of one long set-piece that unfolds into another, altogether more gripping set-piece. Nothing wrong with that in my mind. True, things start off a little oddly. First is the title song, this time some ridiculous techno-funk nonsense performed by a down-on-her-luck Madonna (who cameos pointlessly later on in the proceedings). It wins the award for worst theme song hands down and doesn't bode well for the rest of the movie. But things pick up for the opening, which sees Bond expertly extract himself from a sticky situation and engage in another ferocious chase, this time on hover crafts. Expect to see plenty of heavy weaponry and firepower in this splendid opening battle which follows the classic Bond trend. After this things go a little strange again, with Bond incarcerated for over a year in prison and systematically tortured and beaten. A first for the series, scenes which attempt to give some grit and darkness to the franchise. Why, I'm not too sure.Thankfully things straighten out soon afterwards as a go-it-alone Bond tries to find an enemy to extract some very personal revenge. Judi Dench is back as M, this time sharing some heated arguments with a Bond whom she now feels is useless. There are some other returning faces, including John Cleese who has now taken over the role of Q since the sad demise of Desmond Llewellyn, as well as a few new ones – it's nice to see Michael Madsen in a major film role again, even if he is totally wasted as the American adviser. Bond finds himself caught up in the clutches of Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike to spread more of the witty one-liners and suggestive double-entendres which are more cringe-worthy than ever. Nothing new on that front, then. Sadly, both actresses are at their very worst here. Pike seems frightened and unsure of herself, while Berry is just irritating and a definite contender for 'worst Bond girl' award.The one thing that DIE ANOTHER DAY has over its predecessors is the villains. Two of them to be exact. Succeeding where Robert Carlyle failed in the last film (and who really remembers his scarred, bald villain?), Rick Yune plays an unstoppable bad guy in the same class as Oddjob and Jaws. His bald, blue-eyed, diamond-scarred Asian is a superior villain, a powerhouse of brimming muscle and sheer evil and one of the best bad guys we've had for a long time. Hooray then that Bond has some exciting battles with this undefeatable foe, including an incredibly tense fight in a hospital and a fantastic car chase later on in the movie. Toby Stephens is the lead villain Gustav Graves, younger and more athletic than the likes of Curt Jurgens and Donald Pleasence. He gives the best performance in the movie, and with his smug smirking and unlikable face he more than succeeds at creating a villain you love to hate. Watch out for that classic fencing scene he has with Brosnan, the best scene of the film.Bond films are primarily about the outlandish action and stunts more than anything else and here it succeeds. Fun is had with a laser satellite capable of protecting the rays of the sun down to a specific point on Earth. There are surfing spies, violent punch-ups between villains, lasers, face-swapping technology and more firepower than is decent for one movie. The car chase in the melting ice palace is original and the special effects used to create the illusion are passable. As is the final ruckus on board a damaged aeroplane that provides a setting for the fraught and hectic (although a little too conventional) climax. The only negative side is some majorly dodgy CGI work (including a CGI Bond surfing a CGI wave – not too realistic then) that takes the viewer out of things amid the sheer destruction, violence and excitement.",Die Another Day
3,SnoopyStyle,Promising start fades,6,27 November 2013,"Pierce Brosnan returns for his fourth and final appearance as agent 007. It started great but then fades. It introduces the delicious Halle Berry as NSA agent Jinx. She makes a great Bond girl.James Bond is sent to North Korea to kill a renegade colonel selling weapons for diamonds. He is double crossed by someone and is captured. An American agent is killed and 007 is suspected to have cracked. He is quickly returned in a trade for Zao but now British intelligence doesn't trust him. Bond runs away to track down Zao himself. He finds him working for British billionaire Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). They go to the ice hotel to play with his ray beam satellite.The North Korean start has some decent action, but it's the fact that he's captured that makes it great. When he had to go to the Chinese for help, I thought this could get interesting. The high point of the movie has to be Halle Berry coming onshore with that bikini. From there, the movie slowly grinds down with one silliness after another.The worst has to be the villain played be Toby Stephens. His character is unimaginative and can be best describe as a twit or a douche. I was hoping for threatening. Then there's the ice hotel. That just screams trying too hard. And finally the ray beam satellite. It's been done so many times. The movie started off with some grittiness, but slides into cartoon action.",Die Another Day
4,Horst_In_Translation,Brosnan's work could have ended on a higher note,6,12 June 2020,"""Die Another Day"" is British/American co-production from 2002, so this film is almost 20 years old now and of course this is another entry to the super successful James Bond franchise. In fact, these over 130 minutes were the final film for Pierce Brosnan as 007, so when this came out, he was basically in the same spot as Daniel Craig is now, also almost the same age as Brosnan was just minimally younger, namely slightly under 50, while Craig is slightly over. Then again, the current Corona pandemic also takes its turn on the release of the new film. Not sure how old Craig was when they made the movie. While waiting for the new Bond, I am enjoying the older films these days again and also writing a bit about those. Now away from Craig though and back to this one here: The director is Lee Tamahori and perhaps you can say that he is the most forgotten Bond film director ever. Hardly anybody remembers the name and looking at what he did before this movie, I must genuinely say that I am surprised he got cast for this film here. I mean his career is not packed with highly flawed movies, but there is also really nothing that makes me understand why they got him for this huge project. It cannot just be his name and the strong connection this film has with Asia and Asian chraacters, especially because Asian is not even his main origin. We will never know. Speaking of the Asian impact in this movie, I come to think that Bond films just like to use this background. Connery had one, Moore did as well and so does Brosnan, even if there is no Asian Bond girl in here. Yeoh happened earlier already. The Asians in here, also the women, are just in charge of torturing it seems. Also this film takes us to many other interesting corners of the world again like Cuba for example. It all starts in North Korea though and there is a crucial change, however. Bond manages to defeat the guy he is up against early on, but is still arrested by the man's father eventually and spends more than one year as a prisoner in North Korea. Certainly not a pleasure. Pretty unusual because Bond otherwise manages to get out safely, especially during the opening sequences. But there is a bit of pain attached to the character here, something Craig used a lot more in his moves in terms of suffering. Eventually, it is not his captors that he has to flee from (because they let him go in exchange for another prisoner), but his own. We see Dench's M speak really harshly to him, but then it seems she still helps him in getting away. I must say there were a few moments where I struggled with everything Bond managed, dealt with and achieved in this movie we have here. How he is still as strong, versatile and ruthless as he has been in other films, although this time he got tortered in the most severe manner by North Koreans. It felt a bit unrealistic how he was back to his usual invincible self so quickly. But maybe that is just me. By the way, interesting how we see Bond being tortured in the animated title sequence that was used to depict the story. Really unusual for Bond movies. Normally, it is just effects linked to the movie. The theme song we hear at the same time is from Madonna, so a real global superstar. It was okay, not one of my favorite songs, but it isn't bad either. It got nominated for a Golden Globe too. Madonna also has a brief cameo here on one occasion. Her character seems linked to the main antagonist and introduces Bond to the latter (and his assistant), but we don't find out anything about the details. She is not won over by Bond's charme though. She does not like dick waving contests, so sure played a pretty confident character. Next that follows is the spectacular fight between the two alpha males. That was nice and also showed us the main antagonist's hatred towards Bond right away. And at the end we know why there is such hatred, which would have been really unjustified if they had just met. But yeah this was one moment I found unrealistic, like how can Bond be on par with the man there after the time in Korea. That dude was a contender for the Olympic Games apparently. Come on, guys.Said main antagonist, who really has a lot of screen time, is played by Toby Stephens. And despite how much he is seen here, especially in the second half, he is almost forgotten now as well. It's pretty interesting though how he has been a voice actor for 007 himself in many video games. I think he was alright overall. His material was not always top-notch, but he tried to make the most of it and frequently succeeded. The one many people will know about is Rosamund Pike, who was really, really young stiill when this was made and she is an Oscar nominee now, certainly managed to make it big in Hollywood in contrast to the actor who plays her boss in this movie. Pike plays a triple agent you could say, a really complex character and early on she seemed to be another Bond girl, maybe even the main Bond girl with how they emphasized she is not an easy get for 007 (who was like twice her age), but things sure take a different turn. The one Bond girl at the center of it all is played by Halle Berry and this film came out the same year she won her Oscar. What can I say, she is indeed pretty attractive, but if there is as much to her role as there is to other female agents (from other countries) in Bond films, I do not want to be the judge of. Probably not. Also I remember how she went really quickly to bed with Bond after they met, but then again Bond has not only not had a great woman like her for a while, but has not had a woman at all because of his forced stay in Korea. So no surprise things become heated quickly, especially after the beach sequence that had a touch of Ursula Andress and Anita Ekberg in their trademark water-related scenes and with the latter I do not mean Bond films obviously. So yeah, Berry was alright, was there, but never really memorable. Also the idea and execution of the idea that the two central female characters fight for their lives at the very end was also nothing that I liked too much. Bond's fight with the main antagonist was better and the latter's outfit, uniform, whatever, was pretty big and spectacular there, just like his ego. If you like the idea that he is indeed the Asian son from the very start is up to you to decide. A bit on the absurd side I'd say, also how apparently nobody knew about his past and who he really was and yet he is a public figure, even considers participating at the Olympics. They also used a similar twist in Brosnan's first already I think, the one with Sean Bean. Not gonna go into detail though to avoid spoilers, but I guess you should have seen Brosnan's first when you read here about his fourth. One character who did almost nothing for me was the other Asian with the scarred face. Quite a pity. They definitely could have improved there. In the end, nothing stays memorable except maybe the moment when he is lying there and Bond gets his attention. Even the main antagonist's father was more interesting and he had almost no screen time at all. But what he had was an achievement that almost nobody ever managed in Bond history. He controlled 007 for over a year. Something to be pretty proud of I'd say.I was a bit disappointed by this movie here I must say. I remember really liking it when I saw it years ago for the first time and back then, it was among my favorite films of 2002. This time, it is nowhere near. I even hesitated at times if I could give a positive recommendation here. But in the end, it was good enough, even though it is probably among my least favorites from the franchise, also from the Brosnan quartet. I read there were plans for Brosnan to make a fifth movie that could have been directed by Tarantino, but it wasn't mean to be. Nonetheless, Brosnan is still an active actor way into his 60s now and I read he would like to play a Bond villain once, perhaps opposing Craig's successor. That would be nice, a former Bond as main antagonist. Although, if I could choose, I would take Dalton for the role. There is an aura of dangerous mystery to him. We'll see. Brosnan, even if I like the actor, was never my favorite Bond, on the contrary actually, and seeing once again and afterwards reviewing these four films did not change my opinion one bit. I prefer the others. He is a bit of everything looking at who else played Bond, but not really defining in any area. Still his films have positive moments too. Like the virtual reality glasses (talk about predicting the future there!) and the fun Moneypenny has with them. Well, she got killed the first time they were used, so let her have some fun. This was an interesting inclusion. Those were made (or at least supervised) by Q and with Llewelyn not alive anymore, Monty Python's John Cleese took over for him and he did with a bang gadget-wise! With a friggin' invisible automobile! Even Batman can only dream of that. Cleese was introduced in the previous film already, but sadly did not return for the Craig films when they went with the younger Ben Whishaw. I definitely would have preferred Cleese. Moneypenny (Samantha Bond, perfect name, wonder if it helped her in getting the part) also showed us a potential successor in Brosnan's third film, but that successor did not appear in this one here and it's still Bond. Samantha Bond. Oh yeah, Tarantino regular Michael Madsen is in here too. I found it nice to see him. He may not be the most versatile actor, but he is always as cool as they come. Okay, that's all. ""Die Another Day"" gets a cautious thumbs-up from me because it sure has its flaws. Also how they used the film's title as a quote by Brosnan's character sure felt a bit clumsy. Or the entire plot why the main antagonist was in fact evil and what plan he had that was so dangerous. In my memory this was a better-crafted film. Sadly, not really. The critics are probably correct. It's still worth seeing unless you despite the genre and/or 007.",Die Another Day
5,claudio_carvalho,An Old Formula with Nothing New,7,8 July 2003,"When you watch a 007 movie, the plot is always predictable: the same formula is being used for years, supported by lots of stunts, special (status-of-art) effects and beautiful and sexy women. Therefore, there is nothing new in this latest James Bond movie. Fortunately North Korea and Cuba do not have petroleum, otherwise the screenplay would probably threat with the beginning of WW3. The character of Jinx (Halle Berry) is supported by an excellent actress with a beautiful face. But trying to make her sexy, maybe because of her role in Monster's Ball, is funny. If you go to the beach in Rio de Janeiro in a summer day, you will find lots of sexier women. Halle Berry does not fit as a 'Bond girl' and she deserves more than that. The movie is not bad, but I myself am tired of the basically same James Bond screenplay, this time with part of John Woo's Face/Off. At least, Triple X is more original. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Um Novo Dia Para Morrer"" (""A New Day For Dying"")",Die Another Day
6,classicsoncall,"""You'd think he was some kind of hero.""",7,6 January 2019,"I don't think the 6.1 user rating here on IMDb is entirely fair for ""Die Another Day"", but when I enter the title in my list of Bond movies I've rated and reviewed, it comes in dead last, a '.1' behind ""Never Say Never Again"". So the fans speak, and who can argue with that? There were some thrilling moments in the picture highlighted by the opening action sequence, and it's got the iconic walk out of the ocean that got Halle Berry a lot of attention. There's a neat nod to the fact that this was the twentieth film in the series when 'Q' (John Cleese) remarked that he was giving Bond (Pierce Brosnan) his twentieth watch, and as I write this, there appears to be great anticipation for ""Bond 25"". So even though I wasn't a fan of the series when the movies were coming out, I've gotten on board recently and had a pretty good time watching the pictures in order of release. In the grand scheme of things, this one strikes me like most, a work of fantasy action adventure that relies on exotic locations, gorgeous women, fancy gadgets and a good looking lead to wear the mantle of James Bond. What I wasn't entirely happy about in this story was the unexpected turn of double agent Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) near the end. That was a twist I didn't see coming, and with that revelation, you knew it wouldn't be too long before she wound up a gone girl.",Die Another Day
7,gavin6942,Good Fun,6,17 July 2017,"James Bond is sent to investigate the connection between a North Korean terrorist and a diamond mogul who is funding the development of an international space weapon.There are some cheesy moments in this Bond film. Mostly the strange use of CGI or green screen or whatever makes Brosnan look like he is floating in places he obviously is not really. Or Halle Berry's dive into the water. If you cannot find a stunt person and cannot make good effects, why do it? Beyond that, this is a pretty good film. I really enjoyed the focus on North Korea, which is not your usual Bond nemesis. I am not at all convinced that the real North Korea has technology as good as is shown in the film, but I suppose that is part of the Bond fantasy.",Die Another Day
8,lee_eisenberg,Why don't they just put the James Bond franchise to rest?!,4,13 May 2006,"By the time that Sean Connery left, the ""James Bond"" movies were getting very gimmicky, and by the 21st century, they weren't really movies anymore. ""Die Another Day"" sure doesn't feel like a movie; it feels like they wanted to see just how ridiculous they could get. Portraying Bond (Pierce Brosnan) trying to stop North Korea from getting weapons, the whole thing is just plain silly. Not even Halle Berry can save it.Personally, I think that they should just put the James Bond franchise to rest. As far as I know, they aren't even based on Ian Fleming's novels anymore. And I hear that they're remaking ""Casino Royale"". I, for one, like the 1967 version, and don't see any incentive to remake it.",Die Another Day
9,jboothmillard,Die Another Day,6,4 March 2005,"This is the 20th Bond film for the 40th anniversary of James Bond 007 on screen. Pierce Brosnan plays the hero that we have now known for 40 years at the cinema. This film has sequences you may remember from the previous films, but it still ties in. Bond teams up with the beautiful agent Jinx (Halle Berry) and goes up against a very interesting villain named Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens), he met before in the opening sequence, and diamond faced Zao (Rick Yune). This is filled with marvellous scenery and fantastic effects, we also see the return of the Aston Martin with a new name, the Vanquish, or the Vanish as the new Q (John Cleese) calls it. Also starring Dame Judi Dench as M, Michael Madsen as Damian Falco, Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny, Will Yun Lee as Colonel Moon, Colin Salmon as Charles Robinson and Razzie winning and nominated Madonna as Verity. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Halle Berry was number 99 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Dame Judi Dench was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actresses, and she was number 8 on The World's Greatest Actor, John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 9 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for Madonna's Golden Globe and Razzie (why?) nominated title song, and it was number 80 on The Ultimate Film.

10,ccthemovieman-1,Typical Brainless-But-Fun Bond Film,8,29 August 2007,"This is a typical James Bond flick which means a lot of good things and some bad ones but at least, if you're a fan of the series, you get what you expect.In other words, you get outrageous action scenes, Rambo--like mentality, a wild and fun villain, a ""hot"" female lead helping Bond, a bunch of sexual innuendos, a hokey-but- interesting story and some outstanding opening credits.I never had any complaints with Pierce Brosnan playing Bond. I thought he very credible in the role, sincerely macho and debonair at the same time. Halle Berry was at her peak, so male viewers had no complaints watching here. She wasn't in here just for looks; she was in fighting shape, too.I enjoyed most of what I saw in this film but I am getting tired of seeing Americans portrayed as trigger-happy cowboys, something the Liberal film establishment loves to portray. It's all part of the phony, elitist attitudes they carry. In this story, Michael Rooker plays what I just mentioned. He's a good candidate for that kind of role, usually sounding kind of stupid and effective as a killer. I mean, this is the guy who played (and did it well) serial killer Henry Lee Lucas (""Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer."")Is the story far-fetched? Yeah, a little! Ludicrous? You bet. Entertaining? Sure. Who watches these films for their intelligence? If so, you're going to be disappointed. Read Ian Fleming's Bond novels instead and you'll be happier.If you want brainless fun with a lot of noise, boobs, eye and ear candy, then this is a good Bond movie.",Die Another Day
11,rmax304823,Bond -- James Bond.,5,25 November 2012,"The first few Bond movies were kind of interesting. The first, ""Dr. No"", was eagerly welcomed because, for one thing, the Fleming novels were so popular that President Kennedy read them. And Sean Connery, ex muscle man, was splendid as the hero. Then, too, they reflected the values of the 1950s so flawlessly. Saville Row, Aston-Martins, Dom Perignon 1953, mates with provocative figures, martinis shaken but not stirred. It was what Hugh Hefner wanted. It was what everybody wanted.Now, I don't know what they reflect except the producer's conviction that there is still more money to be squeezed out of an action movie starring James Bond. The tricky expensive cars no longer come equipped merely with bullet-proof windows and machine guns behind the grill. Now, with the flick of a switch, they become invisible to the naked eye. Nobody cares about Dom Perignon '53 anymore because now everybody has it already.Dr. No governed an underground empire from which he planned to knock American space exploration out of orbit for some reason. Not here, where gigantism prevails. The chief villain, Toby Stephens, controls a device in orbit that will capture sunshine and turn it into a kind of laser beam that will allow North Korea to invade the south and conquer Japan and then, I guess, everyone else who demurs. Lasers are small potatoes now.I won't bother getting into the plot, which takes Pierse Brosnan from North Korea to China to Havana to England and finally to Iceland which, you'll be surprised to learn, is covered with a glacier whose surface is as slick as an ice-skating rink. The danger, the treachery, is all over the place, the escapes impossible.But none of that matters. There's still another nickel left in the franchise.",Die Another Day
12,Tweekums,Neither shaken nor stirred,4,18 April 2008,"Oh dear, oh dear, it is sad that James Bond has come to this. I can see why they had to reboot the series in Casino Royale.While I think that it is the worst film in the Bond series it isn't totally rubbish, the opening scene where Bond surfs in to North Korea at night, infiltrates an arms deal then tries to escape in a spectacular hovercraft chase is top notch for a start.Sadly things then go down hill when Bond is captured, during the credits we see Bond being tortured while we are tortured by the worst ever Bond-song. A year later he is freed in a prisoner exchange. He is soon chasing those responsible for his incarceration going to Cuba where we have a subtle joke when Bond picks up a copy of ""Birds of the West Indies"" by James Bond... after whom Ian Flemming named the character. Here he meets CIA agent Jinx, played less than well by Halle Berry although that may be largely down to the script. He then heads to London looking to find a connection between conflict diamonds (issue of the moment) and Gustav Graves who claims to have found diamonds in Iceland.He is soon off to Iceland with fellow agent Miranda Frost, who is undercover in Graves' organisation, played by the excellent Rosamund Pike. Equipped with possibly the most ridiculous gadget in any Bond film, a car that can become totally invisible.Of course it turns out that Graves is doing more than trading conflict diamonds, he is using them to power a satellite based weapon. As things get more and more over the top we see Bond surfing once more, this time however it is a very tacky CGI scene and a finale aboard an aircraft that seems to be able to fly despite being on fire and most of the wing surface missing.",Die Another Day
13,ma-cortes,The legendary British agent returns again well incarnated by Brosnan in a spectacular action movie,7,16 May 2007,"This outing begins when James Bond(Pierce Brosnan) is taken prisoner by two evil Corean men(Rick Yune and Will Yun Lee).He flees but again is prisoned,later is freed .He's accused by M(Judy Dench: Shakespeare in love)as informer and is forced to renouncement.He goes to Habana(Cuba),while he's drinking a typical beverage called ¨mojito¨,he knows a gorgeous NSA agent named Jinx(The winner Oscar,Halle Berry)who makes an explosive appearance emerging from the seaside.They teams up to investigate the rare operations in a clinic ruled by a suspect medic(Simon Andreu,an usual Spanish secondary).Then he follows clues and contacting with a cocky megalomaniac(Toby Stephens: son of Robert Stephens and Maggie Smith)and begins an exciting fencing duel.Besides a sexy woman and fence expert(Rosemund Pike),who is actually an MI6 agent.Later they're going to an ice hotel located in Island ,where are developed pursuits,fights and incredible feats, plenty of frenetic action and suspense.There by the crazed industrialist is used a laser-satellite named Icarus against Bond.Ultimately, the story again torn to Corea frontier where inside a Boeing happen a hair-rising final highlight.Pierce Brosnan as James Bond is nice,he gets toughness and coldness characterized by Sean Connery blending with irony,sympathy,suavity characterized by Roger Moore.As always,this is a globe-trotting spy tale set in several countries(Corea,England,Cuba,Island) where is developed an international intrigue with unstopped,interminable action,sophistication and extraordinaries special effects. It's brimming with impressive scenarios,stunts and gimmicks. Usual appearance of ¨Q¨(John Cleese substituting to Desmond Llewelyn)who delivers the ingenious gadgets like a prodigious ring or an invisible car, objects with special transcendence for the movie.Again Samantha Bond as MonneyPenny in an enjoyable intervention of wet dreams with James Bond.Eye-popping cinematography by David Tattersall.Madonna sings the main title and makes an uncredited appearance as a blades expert.The habitual the last entries ,David Arnold musical score fitting to James Bond action movies.The motion picture is professionally directed by Lee Tamahori.Fun to watch for Bond lovers.",Die Another Day
14,BA_Harrison,Bond surfs the tidal wave.,4,18 January 2013,"Michael Madsen and Madonna are in this one; their appearances are only brief (thank god!), but it is enough to tell me that this particular 007 adventure is going to be hard going. Sure enough, Die Another Day proves to the worst of the Brosnan 007 movies, a bloated mess that strays too far into the realms of science fiction (even further than Moonraker) and relies far too heavily on ridiculously OTT special-effects laden set-pieces in an effort to impress.The film starts well enough, with Bond getting the best of a nasty North Korean villain in spectacular fashion, but it soon descends into preposterousness with an overload of fantastical gadgetry, first with a pointless virtual reality training device (a pair of sunglasses), then with the introduction of DNA-changing technology, followed by the infamous 'invisible' Aston Martin and—last but not least—a giant 'space ray'.As for the silly set-pieces, a fight that occurs amidst haywire lasers, a car chase that takes place in a melting ice building, and a finale on a disintegrating plane are all extremely daft, but pale into insignificance when compared with the rocket sled/collapsing glacier/tidal wave scene, which was the moment a small part of me died inside.",Die Another Day

But then Brosnan goes to Cuba, then to England, and so on, and the film's interest trickles down the drain- while Halle Berry does what she can in her role of Jinx, she doesn't really click as the love interest of Bond's, and there isn't much value as the film spirals in over-done action set-pieces.  Overall, the Bond series seems to be running out of more and more steam with each passing Broccoli production, and thanks to parody pictures from Mike Myers, the material is getting all too old and familiar after a fourty year trek.

Who betrayed us in getting movie goers to see this awful 007 film of 2002?We actually find a North Korean leader who is a moderate politically, but has an off-the-wall son, involved in diamond dealing and dealers who are financing technological stuff to invade South Korea and cause all kinds of mayhem.At the beginning of the film, Halle Berry comes across as if she is a cat burglar. Her every movement reminds me of that.The film, a first-class stinker, has its beautiful scenery and usual spectacular car chases and other great special effects, but where is the substance here?The fact that Bond was betrayed in North Korea makes his credibility factor much less. Dame Judi Dench, as M, makes that perfectly clear. Therefore, Bond has to spend much of the film winning back her respect as well as others in the agency.

The formula is turned up to the hilt, but without (or at the expensive of) any real substantive plot intrigue. Notable as Mr. Brosnan's last in a run of four appearances as the Cold War-created spy; there were some comments about Brosnan's age being a factor in his vacating the role, but he certainly looks fit to be tied herein. Adding to the box office lure is (then) recent ""Academy Award"" winner Halle Berry (as Giacinta ""Jinx"" Johnson). Toby Stephens (as ""Gustav Graves"") is fine as the main villain.

18,BandSAboutMovies,Not bad!,7,21 April 2020,"All things come to an end with Bond, as this is the last Pierce Brosnan movie. It's packed with product placement - even more than many Bond films - and was nearly the pilot for a series of films with Halle Berry's Jinx Johnson character. MGM wanted to move on to a new series, to the dismay of Eon. It would have been interesting.This film starts with Bond enduring 14 months of torture in North Korea and stripped of his 00 status after MI6 believes that he gave up information under torture. This puts him on the case of Gustav Graves, a seller of conflict diamonds who ends up being the very same Colonel Moon who held him as a POW.For all of the derision tossed the way of this film, the Aston Martin V12 Vanquish ice castle sequence is - for me - on par with the Lotus Espirit scene in The Spy Who Loved Me. Roger Moore disliked both these scene and the CGI in this film, calling it a franchise low. This is the man who made A View to a Kill, so just imagine that.Piling on the scorn, Elton John claimed that the Madonna theme for this film was the ""worst Bond tune ever."" Madonna also shows up in a brief cameo.Director Lee Tamahori has an interesting resume, with everything from Once Were Warriors, xXX: State of the Union and Along Came a Spider on his IMDB list.As this film was released on the fortieth anniversary of Dr. No, former Bond actors Moore, George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton joined Brosnan at the premiere.

20,bevo-13678,What,10,14 June 2020,I think the title is quite funny. Yeah a witty title for these type of movies,Die Another Day
21,hitchcockthelegend,Sigh Another Way.,5,8 August 2012,"Die Another Day is directed by Lee Tamahori and written by Neil Purvis and Robert Wade. It stars Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, Toby Stephens, Rick Yune, Rosamund Pike, John Cleese, Judi Dench and Michael Madsen. Music is scored by David Arnold and cinematography by David Tattersall.Bond 20 and 007 is captured and tortured by the North Koreans after being betrayed by an MI6 mole. After being exchanged for a deadly enemy operative, Bond has his 007 status revoked and is forced to go rogue to find who the mole is.As the Bond franchise celebrated 40 years of being, the film to mark the occasion, ironically, forgot the subtle ingredients that make up the best Bond movies. What we get is a chaotic movie, excess is the order of the day, with Eon allowing Tamahori to stack up scene after scene of video game standard ideas. There is no lack of effort here, the heart is full of good intentions, but some big cheese in a suit should have reined the director in. It's also a sad day in the Bond universe when a Bond film uses homage's to homage itself, only for that idea to tire itself out as well. There is barely any time for reflective silences, for a show of character depth, on the odd occasion the film slows down, gasping for air, Tamahori rushes into the next bit of noise annoys. While the action is often as laughable as the dialogue. This may have made a pot load of cash, but few serious Bond fans would have returned to see this again at the cinema. It's Bond for the non Bond fans, a lazy popcorn no brain for the gamers who just want crash, bang and wallop with no substance. Ssshh, did someone say Batman & Robin?As the film unfolds in a blur of sledgehammer editing and lack of restraint, not to forget CGI that is shameful, the cast struggle to keep the good ship Bond afloat. Brosnan is on smug auto-pilot, this film proving to be a sad farewell for him from a role he had previously graced with some distinction. Berry is gorgeous but looks awkward with the action scenes and can't carry off the chirpy aspects of the script, though in her defence she's not done any favours by the writers and Tamahori is more concerned with showcasing her twin assets. Pike is OK, sexy and feisty, if a little difficult to accept as a MI6 agent. Stephens, who went on to do very good acting work later in his career, hams it up for all he is worth. Meant to be a shadow characterisation of Bond, Stephens plays Gustav Graves as some posh cartoon character from a Brit sit-com, a world away from the much needed dastard villain opposing Bond. His motives unclear and a victim of one of the film's more berserker twists. Yune is fun with his diamond studded face and old pros Cleese and Dench at least come out of it with reputations still intact. While Madsen is criminally underused.Elsewhere on a technical front there's also not much to shout about. Madonna's title song, the worst in the series by far, is only beaten in awfulness by her cameo in the film. Tattersall's photography barely registers above the ordinary, with sub-standard location filming not helping either, and Arnold's score is about as far removed from Bond flavours as it can get. There are some good scenes within, a machismo pumped sword fight between Bond and Graves and a laser beam (hello Goldfinger my old friend) dodging fist fight stand tall above the messy quagmire, but the memory of the good sequences are quickly vanquished once the ""invisible car"" is put to field duty use! And with that there really is no more to say about the ""quality"" of Die Another Day. For Bond fans it's about a 5/10 movie, for casual blockbuster fans after a cheap thrill it will no doubt score higher.",Die Another Day
22,Theo Robertson,Better Than I Expected,6,28 October 2004,"DIE ANOTHER DAY is a unique Bond film for me because I had seen the other entries in the franchise before I discovered the IMDb . In other words my only knowledge of its reputation is down to the comments I have read on these pages and because many commentators are so loud in their condemnation ( Bad CGI , awful title track etc ) I was expecting a really bad movie never mind a really bad Bond movie , but DIE ANOTHER DAY wasn't as bad as I was expecting It's interesting to note that the Bond series never really concerned itself with painting communists as bad guys . OCTOPUSSY ties in with the cold war very much as does THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS to a lesser degree but in no way can the series be criticised as being right wing or reactionary with GOLDENEYE wearing its heart on it's sleeve that Russian gangsterism is more of a worry than Russian communism so it's something of a shock seeing Bond battle Stalinist commies in North Korea . That is in no way a criticism either .We're then treated to a bizarre title sequence composed of a torture montage with quite simply the worst theme tune ever devised for a Bond movie . I don't know what is about the Pierce Brosnan Bonds but they all have very poor title songs despite having all round superb production values and DIE ANOTHER DAY continues the high production values , a lot of people complain about the CGI and I must admit the cartoonish jet at the end does look like a cartoon but compare this sequence to all the action scenes in the 1980s which were composed of Roger Moore standing in front of some back projection and no matter how much you don't want to say it you must confess we've come a long way since then Some people have also let rip that the film is ruined by post modernist self reference but I disagree . Come on chaps when you've seen one Bond movie since the late 1960s you've seen most of them . Plot wise DIE ANOTHER DAY is very , very similar to GOLDENEYE with a "" British "" villain in charge of a death ray in outer space with a fair amount of LICENSED TO KILL thrown in . It should be remembered both YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME had the same identical plot with serious hardware being stolen from the USSR and America in order to start a nuclear holocaust . There is a ridiculous amount of humour though involving John Cleese as Q . I know you shouldn't take James Bond movies seriously but did we need an invisible car ?The other thing I disliked was Jinx . Think about it , she's tough and kills without hesitation so how come she needs rescuing from Bond ? She's just a cypher there to create a love interest and it's amazing that the producers seriously considered starting a spin off series with Jinx as the heroine . It would have been as successful as CATWOMEN . There is a problem with a plot twist involving both Gustav Graves and Miranda Frost , the twist is good but unfortunately the surprise only works once which means on second viewing the shock value of the plot revelation is gone therefore DIE ANOTHER DAY doesn't have the same enjoyment second , third or fourth viewing unlike classic Bond movies I'm not a big Bond fan but have been fairly impressed with the standards of the franchise from GOLDENEYE to DIE ANOTHER DAY , they've really come leaps and bounds from the Roger Moore debacles like MOONRAKER and VIEW TO A KILL . One aspect that is over looked in the series is the character interaction between Bond and M ( Convincingly played by Judi Dench ) and I hope to see this abrasive relationship continue when the series returns with a new actor in the lead role",Die Another Day
23,preppy-3,"Very noisy, very fun Bond movie",8,16 December 2002,"The plot--well, who cares?  James Bond movies aren't about plot--they're about action, sex, gadgets and this movie has plenty.  Basically Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is teamed up with Jinx (Halle Berry) to fight this time around.  Brosnan is very comfortable in the Bond role by this time and Berry is just fantastic as Jinx.  She's one of the few Bond females who is sexy and can hold her own in a fight.  She matches Bond punch for punch. 
The movie is a bit too long (other Bond films have that same problem), but it's a huge movie.  Big, extremely loud with almost non-stop action--there are some truly incredible stunts in this movie.  A big, fun, mindless roller coaster ride.  Highly recommended.Also John Cleese is on hand in a funny bit; Judi Dench pops up looking tired and miserable and Rosamund Pike gives one of the worst performances ever as Miranda Frost.",Die Another Day

Some Say that there were Way Too Many Bangs in this the 20th Bond Movie.But for all the Complaining Coming from Bond Purists, and others, this was the Highest Grossing James Bond Movie. That is until Daniel Craig's Debut. It's also Not Fair to Blame Brosnan.He Voiced His Objections to the CGI Laden Film and Begged to have the Series Return to a Darker, more Down to Earth Style. But it was not to be. That is until Daniel Craig's Debut.This Movie can be Enjoyed by a Wide Audience. Bond Fan's and Cultists can Revel in the References to the Previous Films, as All are Given a Nod. One of the Funniest is When ""Q"" is Doling Out Gadgets and says...""Must you touch EVERYTHING?""...Bond Spots the Jet Pack from ""Thunderball"" and Flips the Switch while Saying...""Does this thing still work?.""...as it Roars and Shoots Flames.Audiences in 2002 were becoming Excited with the New Technology of CGI and its Unlimited Applications and the Film's Producers wanted to Take Bond to the New Millennium Riding a Wave of SFX. They might have Gone Overboard.The Bond Girls are a Prominent Sidekick Role for Halle Berry (who gets a lot of bad ink for this one) as She Shares Screen Time with Bond and Spouts One Double Entendeur after another, and the Film Debut for Rosamund Pike who would go from a ""Bond Girl"" to a ""Gone Girl"" in a Few Years. The Bond Villain (Toby Stephens) is Badly Acted and Lacking Charisma despite the Hyper-Activity.The First Half of the Movie is the Best, before Things Get Out of Hand, and is More Spy Bond Stuff, with Weapons Dealing and Imprisonment in North Korea. From there Madonna's Song starts the Title Sequence. Then Things are a Grab Bag of One Liners and Over the Top Action Scenes Non Stop.Overall, Not the Worst Bond Film and Far from the Best.

26,zardoz-13,Brosnan's Last Outing As 007 Is Very Commendable!,10,23 May 2010,"The twentieth installment in the long-running James Bond film franchise, ""Die Another Day,"" concluded Pierce Brosnan's tenure as 007 and celebrated the 40th anniversary of the series with references galore to previous Bonds. The credibility of this epic 133 minute extravaganza suffers mildly from some hopelessly unrealistic but nevertheless exciting predicaments that challenge our globe trotting British secret service agent. Ultimately, New Zealand director Lee Tamahori doesn't let Ian Fleming fans down and he directs with a vivid sense of flair. Despite its outlandish reliance on obvious computer generated imagery, this inventive Bond adventure qualifies as one of the better 007 sagas and a fitting conclusion for the Brosnan Bond. The ice chase is the primary culprit here as well as the chief villain's frozen Icelandic residence. Interestingly, ""Die Another Day"" incorporates African conflict diamonds in its serpentine plot, four years before the fashionable Edward Zwick thriller ""Blood Diamond"" (2006) with Leonardo DiCaprio dealt with these controversial gems. Naturally, Judy Dench returns as Bond's superior M, and John Cleese was on his own for the first and last time as Q. The most incredible gadget that Bond receives is an invisible Aston Martin with the usual arsenal of weapons. Toby Stephens and Rick Yune make two audacious villains and ""Reservoir Dogs'"" Michael Madsen appears as a duplicitous, high-ranking C.I.A. executive. ""World Is Not Enough"" scenarists Neal Purvis & Robert Wade maintain the larger-than-life action with exotic locales, lovely ladies, but a somewhat darker tone. Bond amounts to a renegade British Intelligence agent out for revenge against those vile dastards who framed him for security transgressions that he would never made. In some ways, Purvis and Wade were inspired not only by John Glen's ""Octopussy"" with North Koreans committing criminal acts just as the renegade Soviets but also Guy Hamilton's ""Diamonds Are Forever"" with a villain who commands a satellite constructed of diamonds. Hardcore 007 fans will spot the encore of Commander Bond's small ""Thunderball"" underwater breathing gadget. ""Die Another Day"" opens on the Pukch'ong Coast of North Korea as 007 and two other agents surf into the beach. Bond and his companions steal an attaché case filled with diamonds from Mr. Van Bierk (Mark Dyman of ""Until Death"") and appropriate Bierk's helicopter to fly to a secret rendezvous in the de-militarized zone in North Korea. Bond places two bricks of C-4 explosives with a timer under the diamond trays and set off to keep an appointment the arrogant Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee of ""Elektra""), son of General Moon (Kenneth Tsang of ""The Replacement Killers""), who has no qualms about trading arms for African conflict diamonds during a U.N. embargo. Moon's second-in-command, Zao (Rick Yune of ""The Fast and the Furious""), takes a digital picture of Bond and uploads it to the Internet. He shares the results with Colonel Moon and they discover that Van Bierk is really a British assassin named James Bond. Immediately, Colonel Moon arrests Bond and destroys the helicopter with a tank-busting weapon. General Moon calls his son because he is approaching the de-militarized zone where he has his headquarters. Hastily, Colonel Moon orders his men to disperse and take the weapons with them. He orders Bond executed, but the explosives in the attaché case ignite and Bond escapes. Zao is stricken by a shower of diamonds that embed themselves in his face. Colonel Moon and Bond battle it out on the hovercraft that Moon used to transport the weapons to the location. Thousands of land mines on the border of North and South Korea pose no problem to Moon because the hovercraft can float harmlessly float over them. Bond and Moon exchange small arms fire and Moon even resorts to a flame thrower. They run out of room to maneuver and Moon plunges over the edge of a cliff while Bond seized a bell and survives. ""Saved by the bell,"" he quips until he sees General Moon arrive with an army. Moon takes Bond and turns him over to North Korean interrogators and during the title credit sequence, Bond is tortured. Eventually, months after his arrest, Bond is released as part of an exchange for Zao. M (Judy Dench) isn't pleased to see 007 because not only did Zao kill three Chinese agent when he tried to blow up a summit meeting, but also because British Intelligence suspects that Bond spilled his guts and a deep mole in North Korea was exposed. M gets Bond out to ensure that he doesn't expose more agents. Bearded and ragtag, Bond vows to get the individual who set him up. He escapes from British Intelligence and begins his search for that mysterious person. Initially, he heads to Cuba to find Zao. Several things differentiate Brosnan's final outing as the redoubtable civil servant earlier as well as later entries. First, the bullet is finally seen entering the gun barrel during the pre-credit sequence. Thus far this represents the one and only time that this has occurred in the series. Second, the title theme sequence continues the narrative with Bond enduring torture while incandescent women appear on screen and scorpions are seen scuttling about to Madonna's song. Third, this is the only time that James Bond appears with a full beard, giving Brosnan look like a 17th century buccaneer. Fourth, the initial action transpires in Korea, the first time that this location with its volatile real life implications for possible nuclear war has been appropriated. Fifth, the plot later takes 007 from places like Cuba to Iceland. Sixth, the C.I.A. has its own agent out there in the form of Halle Berry's Jinx Johnson. Seventh, the pre-credit sequence qualifies as one of the livelier ones with Bond battling a crazed North Korean colonel as they sweep over a mine field in hovercraft blasting away at each other with machine guns and flamethrowers. As usual, Bond still finds the time for the classical throwaway witticism and the women are seductive.",Die Another Day

The fact that Bond is taken prisoner and is tortured for over a year is surprising and makes the character more realistic and human. But not only Bond is different. The Bond girl has also changed in this one, Jinx (Halle Berry) is the female version of Bond and not as helpless and desperate as other Bond girls. The cinematography and editing has also changed in this one, in a good way. Also the story is more serious and has lesser jokes in it compared to other Bond movies.The movie introduces some great new characters such as Damian Falco (Michael Madsen) and Judi Dench (M), John Cleese (Q) and Colin Salmon (Charles Robinson) return in their roles. The villains are excellent and the best bond villains in years (since GoldenEye).The story is well written and is one of the best. The movie is action packed and the story is told in a quick pace and the movie is actually tense and exciting. It's funny that after so many decades Bond still knows how the surprise and amuse in an original way.So all in all a great Bond movie with a good story, nice characters, cool new gadgets, great performances, and some superb action in a different kind of Bond movie.Very enjoyable!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Die Another Day

And since (as any '90s kid will attest to) he was the best James Bond, his movies are the only ones worth watching.In this one he shows his super-human strength by mentally willing his heartbeat to slow down so much he's able to pretend he's dead. From there, he can escape the terrible torture chamber he's spent the beginning of the movie enduring (it's a little too graphic for my taste) and get back to business with M, Q, and Miss Moneypenny. Pierce and Halle team up to find out who the bad guys are, and while it's not difficult to guess that the pseudo-friendly exterior of Toby Stephens and Rosamund Pike is a front, you'll still get to see tons of action scenes, double-crosses, and seductions.And, of course, there's Halle Berry's orange bikini. Orange is my favorite color, but even I can admit it's ridiculous to boil a Bond picture down to a swimsuit.

Rick Yune is on hand as the secondary villain, Zao.""Die Another Day"" (2002) was Pierce Brosnan's fourth and final performance as James Bond and it has the most pizazz of his four movies by far. Its heightened comic book-ness gives it a bad rap, but that's what makes it stand out from the previous two installments, which had a muted palette and were somewhat forgettable (although entertaining enough). The villains are more memorable in this one and the Bond women are certainly acceptable. The best part of the film, for me, is the over-the-top sword fight at the manor. Although it's so overdone it's somewhat goofy, it may very well be the best sword fight in the history of cinema.The second half, which mostly takes place in Iceland, has several good action sequences as well, even goofier than the sword fight, like the iceberg tsunami on which Bond surfs (Why Sure!). But it's not like this is the first time an action scene was totally ludicrous in a Bond picture (Remember the 'Bat Boat' in the opening of ""The World is Not Enough""?).The first time I saw Brosnan my initial thought was, ""He'd make a great Bond,"" and so he does; but it's a different Bond than Connery or Moore and it takes time to get used to him.Madonna sings the title song (and has a cameo).The film runs 2 hours, 13 minutes, and was shot in Maui, Hawaii (opening surfing scene); England (including as a stand-in for Korea); Andalucía, Spain (Cuba); Austurland, Iceland, and Norway (ice car chase and ice palace environs).GRADE: B+/A-",Die Another Day
35,zetes,Fun enough,7,5 July 2003,"A cinematic sinner am I, as I have only seen one James Bond film not starring Pierce Brosnan, Dr. No, and I have seen each of the films starring Mr. Brosnan (although I've never seen Goldeneye in its entirety). I quite loved Dr. No, and I have no good excuse for avoiding all the ones between it and the Brosnan Bonds other than I have a feeling I would get bored with them after two or three. I know I'll have to check them out someday. The four Brosnan Bond films are so incredibly formulaic that one can guess each plot development half an hour early. I always go through the exact same cycle of emotions when watching them. Step 1) This is dull. 2) Eh, it's getting better. 3) Hey, that was pretty neat. 4) Ugh! What an awful double entendre! 5) Hey, that was really neat! 6) Hey, this rocks! 7) Oh no, not another double entendre! It always takes far too long to start rocking, but when it does, it does seem like it was worth the price that I paid to watch it (I watched the movie for free). Die Another Day takes much longer to get good than the previous two Bond films (does anyone really care what they were called?), but it has one enormous saving grace: the villains are extraordinary. Toby Stevens as Gustav Graves and Rick Yune as his main henchman Zao are great characters, well designed and with nicely developed personalities. I can't even remember the names of any of the other villains in the Bond series, except that the last one was played by that guy from The Full Monty. The stunts in this one are quite often remarkable, especially the extended car chase late in the picture (you'll find that I go out of my way to praise car chases twice this week, which probably labels me as a something or other). I really look down on the couple of scenes where computer animation replaces the actors, most notably the parasurfing scene. That was quite obvious, and quite embarrassing. I also find the Matrix effects groan-inducing. Hopefully we're done with those after the monumental failure of The Matrix Reloaded.",Die Another Day

37,mm-39,They finally got it right for Pierce.,10,23 November 2002,"Spoiler!!After three movies as Bond, the producers finally got it right.  It has got to be Bronsan's best as Bond. It is more comparable to Roger Moore in the Man with the Golden Gun. They finally did changes in that it was different than the other Bond films.  Halle Berry had to  many cheesy quips.  The beginning is different where he actually gets apprehended.  The music score shows his ordeal and actually suits the film.  Many new parts of the film has the viewer guessing.  They make this Bond more dirtier especially in the fight scenes.  They went back to the Sean Connery type of Bond.  The sword fight was great.  It reminded me of the movie the duelest.  They are finally running out of Communist countries that Bond can go to;  North Korea and Cuba only remain.  The car scene at the end of the movie was terrific.  The endings of the movie are getting predictable.  This is the 3rd movie where they use a satellite. See this one in the theater, it is worth it.

38,Mr-Fusion,"Man, they were not kidding. This really is the ""Batman and Robin"" of Bond movies.",2,20 October 2012,"I'm no expert on Bond, but I've seen and read enough on the legend to know that ""Die Another Day"" is genericized to the point of being a pale imitation. It doesn't help matters that Brosnan's heart isn't in this outing, and neither are those of the writers nor the director. This is the movie that results from a franchise either becoming fatigued, out of ideas, or a combination thereof. It's more concerned with the trappings of OO7, rather than character or even a decent story. To include a detailed synopsis is to relive this garbage, so here it is in broad strokes. Bond gets captured by the North Koreans, and is traded back to MI6 for a really bad guy named Zao. Being traded makes Bond angry, so he goes off to Cuba on a revenge jag in search of Zao. There, he meets Halle Berry. They bang, and then it's back to London. There, he meets celebrity playboy Gustav Graves, and they have a proverbial pissing contest with dueling épées. From there, it's off to Iceland where Graves has an ice palace, and he's holding a demonstration of some space-based superweapon. After that, some more stuff happens, but the movie really should've ended at the ice palace. It could've also benefited from the absence of Madonna, who not only provided the inappropriate pop song for the opening (Christ, it's bad), but also appears in a bit part as a fencing instructor. ""Dick Tracy"" should've been a big enough warning to everyone with a heartbeat: don't cast Madonna. The oft-heard comparisons to ""Batman and Robin"" arise from the movie's over-reliance on flashy gadgets and gimmickry. Well that, and it's a terrible movie (exhibit A for reboot). It doesn't help that there's a significant amount of green-screen work involved in this film - and most of it is glaringly second-rate. The script takes Bond from one continent to the next, and it truly becomes wearisome very quickly. Such a script also features Bond mentally stopping and restarting his own heart, and credibility-snapping absurdity like that doesn't help, either.What's worse is that ""Die Another Day"" commits the worst offense a Bond film can make: it's boring. When Brosnan picks up a gun and kills someone, the energy involved in such an act is gone. It's like he just doesn't care. When your lead double-O agent is just going through the motions, you're in serious trouble. ""Die Another Day"" is a bloated affair; a half-hearted homage to a once-great super spy. It's a movie that is far more interested in lavish setpieces and blowing things up at the cost of a reliably thrilling brand. The powers that be were completely justified in going back to basics and rebooting this dead horse with a different star; this is a cautionary tale of what happens when a franchise is in desperate need of an overhaul.2/10",Die Another Day
39,SimonJack,Too much of everything in this Bond film,6,19 March 2018,"One can understand why this might be his least favorite James Bond film that Pierce Brosnan made. ""Die Another Day"" resembles more the hodgepodge of modern action films than it does the secret agent thrillers created by Ian Fleming. The hodgepodge being nearly constant action films devoid of any acting. While this entry in the 007 series has considerable plot, with complicated subplots, the nearly nonstop action has so few pauses that the film seems to be three or four stories pieced together. Besides the action scenes, this film has more of just about everything. That includes the gadgets and gimmicks. The dialog is rife with sexual innuendo. And, it's also the most graphic Bond film with vivid sex scenes. The filmmakers just put too much in this film that weighed it down. This is a classic example that more often is not better. This is also the first film in which a female character has a huge part of the action. Halle Berry's Jinx Johnson seems to have as much action time as does Brosnan's Bond. When the mole in MI6 is finally uncovered, it proves Bond right. Let's see if M doesn't follow his hunches and advice in the future. Most of the Bond films have as antagonists a global conspiracy or terrorist group. This is one of the few that also involves a foreign government hostile to the free Western world. Here, it's North Korea, where Bond is being tortured after being captured in the opening credits sequence. A couple of interesting notes about this film. A real Bond is in it - Samantha Bond is Moneypenny, and has played that part in all the Bond films that star Pierce Brosnan, beginning with Goldeneye in 1995. As with Brosnan, this was her last Bond film. And, John Cleese finally gets promoted to the post of Q. His banter with Bond in this film is the best of the exchanges between the two characters in more than 20 films.Unfortunately, the few good aspects of this film can't elevate it above a ho-hum action movie. The six stars are mostly for the tremendous sets, camerawork and varied shooting locations.",Die Another Day
40,ShadeGrenade,Beyond the ice,7,24 June 2012,"The first Bond film of the 21st century, Lee Tamahori's 'Die Another Day' was the last to star Pierce Brosnan. Bond is on a mission in North Korea to nail terrorist 'Colonel Moon' ( Will Yun Lee ). He is betrayed, captured, tortured and imprisoned for 14 months. Swapped with another terrorist - Zao ( Rick Yune ) - Bond is told by M ( Judi Dench ) that his usefulness as an agent is at an end. He escapes from MI6 custody, and heads off to a Cuban gene replacement therapy clinic. He later discovers that Moon - whom he had previously believed to be deceased - has changed himself into the Richard Branson-like entrepreneur 'Gustav Graves' ( Toby Stephens ). Bond goes to Iceland where Graves has his headquarters - a fantastic ice palace - and at his disposal is a laser satellite system called 'Icarus'...As 9/11 had only occurred a year before, it was decided to make 'Day' more of an escapist fantasy than the other Brosnan Bonds. They got it badly wrong. It starts off well enough ( though Bond's torture incorporated into the opening titles is a little bizarre! ), but once in London turns into a pseudo-Roger Moore film, replete with outrageous ideas such as an invisible car! It is like watching the first half of 'From Russia With Love' grafted on to the second half of 'Diamonds Are Forever'. 'Day' is the only Brosnan Bond to lack script involvement from Bruce Feirstein - and it shows. Neal Purvis & Robert Wade's screenplay has all the subtlety and finesse of their 'Johnny English' farces. The perceived over-reliance on C.G.I. was criticised - most notably Bond para-gliding through icebergs. Toby Stephens's sneering 'Graves' is like 'Flashman' out of 'Tom Brown's Schooldays', and could have been a great villain but the weak script lets him down. Halle Berry's 'Jinx' is a bland clone of 'Lara Croft' ( it is hard to believe she almost landed her own spin-off movie ), while Rosamund Pike's 'Miranda Frost' is beautiful but uninteresting. Among the action sequences are a pre-titles hovercraft chase, Bond fencing with Graves, a pursuit across icy landscapes involving 007's Aston Martin, and the destruction of the ice palace. The finale looks as though the writers looked at the climax of 'The Living Daylights' ( 1987 ), and imagined they could do better.As 2002 was an anniversary year, it was decided to litter 'Day' with references to past-Bond films, many are forced and contrived. M16 is using a deserted London underground station as a base, and Bond gets to see again old gadgets such as the 'Thunderball' jet pack and Rosa Klebb's spiked shoe. John Cleese takes over full-time as 'Q', though this would ultimately be his final appearance in the role.'Day' is good entertainment on the whole ( I loved the ice palace. It evokes memories of the heyday of Ken Adam ), but the shift in tone makes it wildly uneven. The Madonna theme song ought not to have been used, ditto her cameo as a fencing instructor. Though the film was massively successful at the box office, it was widely perceived not to have worked - four years passed before Bond was seen again. Brosnan, the man who, only seven years before, had been hailed in some quarters as 'the definitive Bond', was not asked to return. His advancing years ( he was 49 when it was made ) and competition from other franchises such as the 'Jason Bourne' films ended his tenure as 007. The biggest ever shake-up in Bond's cinematic world was about to happen...",Die Another Day
41,JamesHitchcock,Should have Won the Award for Most Ecologically Friendly Film- the Plot is Recycled,6,28 April 2006,"The beginning of ""Die Another Day"" is much darker in tone than most of its predecessors, apart from ""Licence to Kill"" which was a violent revenge thriller masquerading as a Bond film. On a mission to North Korea Bond is captured after being betrayed, thrown into prison and tortured. He is eventually released in exchange for a North Korean terrorist named Zao, but discovers that his superior ""M"" has only agreed to the exchange because she believes that he has cracked under torture and has given away information to the North Koreans. (In her previous outings, Judi Dench's ""M"" was played as a relatively liberal figure, but here her ideology is one of cynical Realpolitik). After about the first twenty minutes, however, the film reverts to a standard Bond movie. Bond escapes from MI6 custody in order to uncover the real source of information and to hunt down the dangerous Zao. He discovers that there may be links between the North Koreans and Gustav Graves, a mysterious British industrialist who has made a fortune after discovering a major source of diamonds in Iceland, and has perfected a solar-powered laser that can be used as a dangerous weapon.This was the last of the Pierce Brosnan Bonds, and in my view the weakest, although its weaknesses have little to do with its star. Although Brosnan is visibly older than he was in ""Goldeneye"", at 49 he is still trim and fit enough to be a convincing secret agent and he always manages to preserve the vital balance between sardonic humour and the sense of being a dangerous man of action. His performances in the role did not deteriorate with age in the way that Roger Moore's did. (Perhaps the reason was that Moore attempted to continue in the role until he was nearly sixty). Its weakness also has nothing to do with the leading lady, the lovely Halle Berry. She makes her character Jinx, a smart, streetwise and sexy American secret agent, one of the best Bond heroines of recent years, probably the best with the possible exception of Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".Not all the performances are so good. Rosamund Pike, who plays the secondary Bond girl, the treacherous MI6 agent Miranda Frost, has the looks to suggest the glacial beauty implied by her character's surname, but in manner she is too hesitant and soft-spoken to seem really threatening. Madonna's horrible theme song was by far the worst of any Bond film. The film's main weakness, however, is that the film-makers seemed to be running out of ideas. To celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the franchise they studded it with references to all the previous Bond films. (Jinx, for example, emerges from the sea wearing a bikini similar to that worn by Ursula Andress in ""Dr No""). The title is clearly modelled on ""Live and Let Die"" (just as ""Goldeneye"" was modelled on ""Goldfinger""), with a possible reference to ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". The importance of diamonds to the plot is taken from ""Diamonds are Forever"". The film should have been awarded the Oscar for Most Ecologically Friendly Script, as most of the storyline consists of used plots recycled from previous Bond movies. Graves, for example, is a reincarnation of numerous earlier villains from Auric Goldfinger, via Stromberg, Drax and Max Zorin, to Elliott Carver. He is not the most memorable of Bond villains, but this has less to do with the way Toby Stevens plays the part than with the fact that sinister megalomaniac tycoons have become all too familiar in Bond films.The North Korean angle in the film never really seemed convincing. Kim Jong-Il's strange Marxist monarchy may be, together with Cuba (also featured here), one of the last outposts of Communist tyranny, a sort of political elephant's graveyard where worn-out old ideologies go to die, but it is also too much of an impoverished, famine-stricken backwater to pose any serious military threat to the West.It is perhaps a good thing that there have been no Bond films for the last four years. On the evidence of ""Die Another Day"" history seems to be repeating itself. In the late seventies and eighties the series was in trouble with a number of weak plots which the producers attempted to disguise unsuccessfully by the over-use of hi-tech gadgetry. The re-launch of the franchise with the early Brosnan films in the nineties was a success, but the series now seems to be stagnating again. The use of gimmicks like that invisible car (far-fetched even by the standards of Bond gadgets), the elaborate ice-palace and a man with a diamond-studded face cannot prevent the film from looking over-familiar. The break, coupled with the introduction of Daniel Craig to bring a fresh approach to 007, may mean that the series will be in better shape when it returns. 6/10",Die Another Day

She is the best part of the film. Pierce Brosnan is OK. The cast is OK.The script is extremely poor as it does not generate a lot of interest in the film. Worse yet are the terrible special effects. I understand that computers are cheaper than real special effects but these look so terrible, that the film is almost unwatchable.I can understand after watching this why Pierce Brosnan said never again. Maybe if they had told him they were going back to Ian Flemings material he might have reconsidered but this film here would make me quit the series too.

I really don't think this is that bad of a movie. But maybe I am going easy on it since it's not as bad as ""Batman & Robin"". As a matter of fact the first half of this movie is a okay Bond film with action combined with a passable story. Than it completely falls apart during the second half when it shows the ice palace and the orbiting satellite. Minus the Twisted Metal style battle scene. It just become too much after that, I think it might have been alright if this movie came out in the 70's or 80's. And I think that is one of the main reason why this movie got so much hate. The super campy, cheesy and ridiculous aspects of this installment just didn't fly so well in the 2000's. Halle Berry was like at her peak of stardom when this movie came out and it probably also did a lot of damage to her career as well. Or the ""Catwoman"" movie that came right after, but then again Halle just kept making poor decision after getting some credit for ""Monster's Ball"". She starts off like she is going to be a standout Bond girl, but that quickly fades when you just can't buy her as this tough badass. Mainly because of how she carries on with the action sequences, by the way she runs and holds her weapons. But yeah, the second half just because absurd and silly to the point I couldn't take the situation serious at all. It's kind of sad to see Pierce Brosnan make his final outing as Bond with this film. I do think he played a big part in making Bond relevant again. He just has the look, the charm and charisma to play Bond. Overall, I give this movie a 5/10 because the first half started out quite well.5/10",Die Another Day
45,OllieSuave-007,Bond's 40th anniversary went all out.,6,11 March 2014,"This is Pierce Brosnan's fourth and final portrayal as James Bond 007. Here, Agent 007 is betrayed and captured in North Korea after investigating a terrorist named Zao (Rick Yune). 14 months later, Bond is set free in exchange for Zao's release of custody from MI6. Back in freedom, Bond attempts to track down Zao and investigate British billionaire Gustav Graves and his connection to a space-borne mirror designed to beam solar light and heat anywhere in the world, which is highly detrimental to the well-being of peaceful countries. Bond teams up with fellow CIA agent Jinx (Hally Berry) to stop Graves and Zao, and find out who betrayed him.As this film marked the 40th anniversary of James Bond in motion pictures, I enjoyed seeing the many tributes and nods to past Bond films in this movie (i.e. Jinx rising out of the ocean water in her first appearance, similar to that of Ursula Andress' scene in Dr. No). The acting was pretty good and the North Korea settings provided much tension and exciting thrills to the story. However, I think the action and visual effects are overkill in this film, from Bond's torture scene at the beginning of the movie to Bond's invisible car sequence (too sci-fi for a Bond movie). Back to the acting, Halle Berry just misses on the chemistry with Pierce Brosnan, and her performance turned out to be pretty campy. Rick Yune makes a ruthless yet charismatic villain and Rosamund Pike makes a reckoned and striking Bond Girl.Overall, the story is fresh and stimulating, but the action and visual effects went overboard. I guess the filmmakers wanted to go all out for Bond's 40th anniversary bash.Grade C",Die Another Day
46,bensonmum2,"""I know all about you, 007. Sex for dinner, death for breakfast.""",3,11 November 2017,"When I first saw A View to a Kill back in 1985, I thought the Bond series had hit rock-bottom. I didn't think it possible to make a Bond movie I would like less. However, in 2002, I witnessed the hot mess that is Die Another Day and realized that, yes, you could make a Bond movie that would make A View to a Kill look like a masterpiece in comparison. This movie is so bad and makes me so mad that I actually prefer listening to Tanya Roberts yell ""James' from the back of that firetruck than watch this junk. The plot - what's the point - it's as stupid as the rest of the film. I could literally write multiple pages detailing all of the issues I have with this blight on the Bond series. Instead, I'll do the now familiar laundry list:1. Let's start with a big one - DNA replacement. The whole notion that a Korean dude could turn into a white Englishman in just a couple of years by using something preposterous sounding like DNA replacement is ridiculous. I can't believe anyone actually wrote this and thought viewers would just buy into it.2. Madonna's title song - There have been a lot of great songs to appear in the Bond opening credits - Shirley Bassey in Goldfinger, Sheena Easton's song in For Your Eyes Only, Paul McCartney's Live and Let Die theme, and Garbage's The World is Not Enough (a real favorite of mine). Madonna's song, in comparison, is BAD. It's a trendy, auto-tuned pile of dung. It will never appear on this list.3. The Invisible Car - Plain old stupid. And the way Bond uses it (or doesn't use it) and the way it's discovered - again, plain old stupid.4. Jinx - Fron the moment Halle Barry does that over-the-top swivel-hip walk out of the water, I knew instantly she would be a horrible Bond girl. Her character reached a real low with the ""Yo Mamma"" joke. 5. The villains - These guys are more cartoon characters than super-villain. They're impossible to take seriously. 6. Pierce Brosnan: the Quipping Machine - Some of Bosnan's quips would make even Roger Moore groan in pain and disbelief. A lot of the sexual innuendo would be more at home on Three's Company than in a Bond movie. It's too silly for words.Seroiusly, this could go on and one. I haven't mentioned surfing Bond, the crappy CGI effects, Madonna's acting, the ice hotel, John Cleese, Bond's unbelievable escape from the death ray, a bloated run-time, etc. And if I could be bothered, I could probably come up with another bunch of things that bother me about Die Anotern Day. Combine it all together and you end up with what I consider the poorest entry in the Bond franchise. As I alluded to before, I don't just hate this movie, it makes me mad watching it. Die Another Day came as close as anything to destroying the Bond franchise. Despite my dislike for Die Another Day, I've still rated the film a 3/10. I do so because in the end, it's still James Bond and there are a set-piece or two throughout the film that work for me.",Die Another Day
47,Lejink,Too much is not enough,8,15 May 2011,"This is the kind of Bond I like. Half way between the suave, flippant Roger Moore and the tough and laconic Sean Connery is pretty much where Pierce Brosnan pitches his tent and a reasonable place it turns out to be. So we get the odd wise-crack, a fair smattering of sex and gadgetry but lots and lots of fights, chases and high-tech thrills.The pacing is as fast as you'd expect but the plotting is more direct and less inscrutable than some latter-day plot-lines. There's an interesting prologue, featuring the usual pyrotechnics but for once Bond doesn't escape capture and has to undergo the ignominy of being traded for a crack Korean assassin and worse, be suspected of being the mole who has sold out his fellow-agents, which sees his licence revoked.Of course it's not long before our man is hot on the trail of his two nemeses, taking in, along the way, encounters with beautiful American agent Halle Berry and his beautiful replacement as 007, Rosmund Pike. The fact he has two master-villains to pursue means we get two climactic chase/fights while the locations at an ice-hotel in Iceland (where else), South Korea and Cuba add exoticism.Most of the stunts are excellent although one or two falter over poor C-Gen execution (when Bond improbably slaloms his way through the debris of a mini-tsunami), but there are plenty of others to savour, including a superb back-dive escape by Berry off a cliff, a no-holds barred sword-fight, a car-chase over and under ice and a final thrilling fight in a rapidly de-pressurising aeroplane.I do like Brosnan in the feature role, good looking but with a degree of physicality about him which make his stunts seem, mostly believable. The baddies all get good deaths and it was nice to see Moneypenny finally get her man, sort of.It has its faults, some of the situations seem second-hand (how many times do space satellites form the big hardware threat in Bond films), Toby Stephens rarely seems to exude malevolence, more a Public School irksomeness, while Halle Berry makes little of her admittedly stereo-typed paper thin character. Then there's Madonna's irritating bleep-bleep theme tune - how come she can pull off a cracker for a Bond spoof (""Beautiful Stranger"" for Austin Powers) and fall so flat for the man himself. And quite how the Clash's "" London Calling "" made it onto the soundtrack is beyond me.But on the whole I found this Bond outing to be cracking entertainment with more than enough bang for my buck.",Die Another Day

But slowly it grows on you. Pierce Brosnan is a very English and surprisingly human Bond, while John Cleese is funny as the new Q.  And it's not without a sense of humour, with its relentlessly over-the-top style and incessant punning.  It's not a film to take seriously (or even as an action flick), but it works quite well as a spoof of itself, and is arguably a subtler send-up of the whole Bond idea than the Austen Powers movies.",Die Another Day
49,bowmanblue,A slightly ironic title...,7,19 January 2016,"...considering this was the Bond film which partly forced Bond to 'reboot.' For what it's worth, I liked 'Die Another Day.' Okay, so it may never be up there with the best of the Bond movies, but it certainly doesn't deserve to be down there with the worst. I'll go as far as to say that it is a little effects-laden and the Madonna cameo just really shouldn't be in there, but it's still good fun (and isn't that what a Bond film should be?).This time Bond is captured by the North Koreans for a good year and a half near the beginning of the film (don't think that should be too much of a spoiler – as it's basically covered in the typically-weird opening credits montage) and tortured. When MI6 finally get him out, it's because he's being exchanged for a North Korean war criminal – in fact the very same war criminal he went to North Korea to assassinate.Anyway, MI6 don't really see much use for poor ol' Bondy and consign him to the scrap heap. Only Bond has other ideas and kind of 'goes rogue.' Well, slightly rogue. Not quite as 'rogue' as Licensed to Kill' but still rogue enough to be not on MI6's payroll. And those dastardly North Koreans better watch out and not try starting a war with the rest of the world.As I said, I quite liked it. It's topical (what with the North Koreans regularly scaring the world with their sabre-rattling) and rolls along reasonably well. Maybe I'm just nostalgic as I liked the old 'happy-go-lucky' Bond films (before the darker and more gritty Daniel Craig era) and this was the last of its kind. A lot of people hated it because of its awful use of 'green screen' special effects. Okay, you may expect to be able to tell the hero is up against a green screen in your average B-movie, but this is a high-budget Bond film – it really is pretty awful. And then you have the invisible car. Over the decades Bond has had more than his fair share of cool gadgets to get him out of trouble. It seemed that a car that completely disappears at will was suspending the disbelief a little too much.Overall, Die Another Day will never be a classic. There is a fair amount wrong with it. Halle Berry, although being a great actress, kind of suffered from the 'Bond girl curse' and didn't really live up to expectations (there was even talk of a spin-off film series based on her character – never going to happen now). Don't expect too much from this, but if you're still okay with the lighter side of Bond (even though this one does try to 'go dark' - or as dark as anything pre-Craig ever will) and fancy a load of dodgy special effects and Pierce Brosnan's smirk then there are worse films out there (there are also better Bond films out there, but you probably already know that).And I still like John Cleese better as 'Q' than the kid they currently have.",Die Another Day

The problem is that this film category is now becoming very crowded, and the series authors answer conservatively by keeping strictly the film in the Bond tradition. However, the competition, even while paying respects to the original is taking both viewers money and mind share. Such 'innovations' as having a betrayed and fired Bond out of work for a quarter of the movie, new gadgets, or even bringing Oscar winning stars to the set will not be enough if more serious changes, really new ideas and fresh air are not brought in the next series. James Bond may retire, after all!Still decent entertainment - 7/10 on my personal scale.",Die Another Day
51,ThomasDrufke,Worst Bond Film of All Time,2,3 November 2015,"The first mistake this film made was hiring Madonna (and I don't mind Madonna's music) to sing the opening credits song, and make a cameo in the film? Come on now. That music has no place in this series. The last mistake the film made was making it to theaters at horrible state it was at. The film isn't unwatchable bad, no Bond film is. It just ticks me off so much when I watch it or hear anything about it. It's not a Bond film. It not only does it try to do way too much with special effects, but the story is just plain stupid. A lot of Bond films have an issue with being too formulaic and at times Die Another Day is just that. But it's also a horrible CGI fest of characters that either don't make sense, or the performances are are completely overcooked.Getting Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike as the lead Bond girls is a good idea on paper, but neither of them fit in with the rest of the film, Berry especially. Then we have Toby Stephen's Gustav Graves. A performance so over the top that you constantly feel like he's playing a villain trying to be a Bond villain. What are his motivations anyway? Not once do they really clear that up. There's no originality or any grounded realism to what he's doing. It all feels too comic-booky, as do the fight scenes. Seriously, who's idea was it to bring in slow motion fight sequences? It' felt like another wannabe Matrix film at times. Don't even get me started on the last 15 minutes where it literally copies action straight from any of the Matrix films. Not only that, but the fact that Bond at one point slows his own heart rate down by himself made me laugh out loud. Like, what the hell?Speaking of action sequences, since when did Bond become a master swordsman? Because that's also a good chunk of an action sequence. Yep, a master swordsman. I just feel like there wasn't any care at all to the directing of the film, or really any aspect. At one point when M and Bond were talking you can clearly see Bond's mouth moving without any words coming out. That may be nitpicking, but with a tent-pole franchise like Bond, you would think that the editors would take extra time with little scenes like that. So with awful CGI, and I mean awful CGI, bad dialogue, over the top performances, and no real sense as to what a Bond film should be, Die Another Day is the worst installment for Bond to date.-Where did Bond go-Unfitting music-Wretched CGI-Over the top villain-Nothing is realistic2.6/10",Die Another Day

54,ironhorse_iv,This 007 spy movie was Jinx from the start!! It's too campy to taken seriously!,6,14 January 2016,"I absolutely love the Bond movies, however, as a devoted fan of the series, I acknowledge that the films vary dramatically in terms of artistic quality. Die Another Day is one of the stupidest 007 movies, I have ever saw. It's the 'Moonraker' of the modern era. A over the top escapism film that try too hard to be young and hip, that it tire itself out, with its old and heavily clichéd premise. Not only did, this movie derailed the spy franchise for years to come, it also put the franchise in so much deep ice, that 2006's Casino Royale had to come and reboot it with its Jason Bourne like realistic style. While, I wouldn't say, it's the worst Bond movie, ever. I do have to say, that the movie is so bad, it's kinda good, in how entertaining bad it was. However, that doesn't make it, a good movie. Directed by Lee Tamahori, the movie tells the story of James Bond (Pierce Brosnan), being sent to South Korea to investigate the connection between a North Korean terrorist named Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee) & a diamond mogul, Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). It's there, that he find out, that both are funding the development of an international space weapon call Icarus that could wipe South Korea from the face of the earth using concentrated sunlight. Can Bond stop this weapon from doing that, or will the villains gain the upper-hand? Watch the movie to find out, if you want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the whole kill sat plot is nothing new. This is fourth time, a Bond movie use the killer satellite plot, after 1971's Diamonds are Forever, 1979's Moonraker and just recently, 1995's GoldenEye! Honestly, in my opinion, these killer sat plots are just really ridiculous, and childish. It's almost borderline into self-parody. You would think, they would have learn, their lesson, after seeing 1999's Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, lampoon the idea, to the ground; but no, they still thought, it was a good idea. Like really, what was Moon's plan should the good guys attack during night? I ask this, because Earth's shadow extends far enough into space to eclipse the Moon! No viable orbit would be high enough to ensure that Icarus always had sunlight to reflect. I don't think the writers for this movie, Neal Purvis & Robert Wade thought of that. They're so idiotic. Not only that; but a lot of the crazy sci-fi elements, they wrote, fail to impress me. Among them is ""The Vanquish"" cloaking car, in which the filmmakers already forgot how it works after explaining it. It's clear by what they wrote, that if objects pass, beside the car, it would appear on the other side, making it visible. So they isn't anywhere, Bond could honestly hide, besides going in. Another sci-fi element that seem unbelievable, is the DNA restructuring sub-plot. While, the science for it, seem off the wall, impossible, because how bone marrow and voice therapy honestly works; that isn't my main problem with it. Honestly, I found the whole subplot, somewhat offensive. The reason why, is because I felt like the writers only brought this sub plot up, because the filmmakers must have, thought that the Asian actor, they hired, didn't seem very appealing or believable as a main 'Bond' villain to the mostly white English people. So they hired an English Caucasian actor to replace him in most of the film. I call it as it is, it's the filmmakers having cold feet and playing to stereotypes that Asians actors cannot act. Anyways the twist that came with this move, was very predictable, lame and not really needed. Don't get me wrong, Toby Stephens is a fine actor, but his character is one of the weaker James Bond villains, I ever saw. I found his henchman, Zao (Rick Yune), to be more appealing. However, that diamonds still sticking to Zao's skin doesn't make much sense, in the long run, if the villains are trying to change his face. Anyways, the worst sci-fi gadget, this movie adds is the virtual-reality simulator. Not only does it has nothing to do with the main plot, it felt like a 'Bobby Ewing in the Shower' cop out. Those trolling action scenes are just filler, at best. Talking about action, I have to say, it's a mixed bag for me. I kinda do like the Iceland car chase, in the middle of the film, however, the CGI parasailing surfing on a tidal wave, heart stopping sequence, ice palace melting and cyborg suit is a serious no-no for me. There were all badly done. And while we're at it, the hovercraft chase and disintegrating airplane scene had some really blatantly obvious green screen as well. It was a bit jarring to watch. But by far, the worst thing about this film is the opening torturing scenes, with the title music by Madonna. I hate the horrific auto tune and repetitive lyrics. Still, I have to say, that Pierce Brosnan in his last appearance as the character was alright for the most part, however it's clear that he can't do much, realistic stunts, as he used to. About Halle Berry being the bond girl, Jinx; she was believable in the action scenes, however her sassy acting is really bad. 100 percent line readings, pointless whining, and awkward blaxploitation one-liners like lame 'yo mamma' jokes made her, very unwatchable. Thank god, that Jinx never got her own spin-off film series. I like Rosamund Pike as bond girl, number 2, Miranda Frost in her film debut over her. She was amazing. Still, the age-gap between Pierce Brosnan and her, is somewhat alarming, and disturbing. They also don't have any chemistry together on screen. Overall: I found the movie to be subpar. The 50th anniversary of the first novel, and the 40th anniversary of the film canon, deserve better than this. Check 2012's Skyfall, instead.",Die Another Day
55,kenjha,Die Already,6,9 April 2010,"In the 20th entry in the series and the fourth and last with Brosnan, Agent 007 tackles a North Korean villain who has undergone a DNA transformation to become a Caucasian British big shot. Berry looks fine as an American agent but she lacks the mysterious allure that a Bond girl calls for, something that Pike is better suited to, here playing a newcomer in Bond's agency. As has been the case since Dench took over the role, there is continued tension between M and Bond. Running out of ideas for Bond's gadgets, the filmmakers here opt for an invisible car. Of course, this series has been running out of ideas for decades, recycling the same old basic plot line time and time again.",Die Another Day
56,The-Sarkologist,"Yeah, More of the Same",3,19 June 2020,"Yeah, I get the feeling that the Bond franchise is starting to hit the skids by this stage, and that they seem to be really scrapping the bottom of the barrel with regards to stories, and enemies. Yeah, this time we have North Korea as the bad guys, and while in part it might be laughable, there has been reports about the fact that they do sit at the head of a pretty large criminal enterprise, especially due to all of the sanctions that have been laid against it.Well, the movie starts off with Bond going on a mission into North Korea, and then gets captured, and is tortured. However, he is eventually released when a prisoner swap ensures. However, it turns out that there is evidence that during his imprisonement, and torture, that he may have released sensitive information, so the film ends up being another film where Bond goes off on his own in an attempt to clear his name.Yeah, this sounds like it has been done before, which was the case with License to Kill, where Bond also has his 00 status revoked, so it just feels pretty much the same. Mind you, that seems to be the case with a lot of the Bond films in that they basically follow a formula and really just have the faces, names, and other things changed to sort of give a hint to originality. Then again, it is a franchise that has worked, and worked quite well, especially since it is the longest running franchise of any film.But, the problem is that the fact that the subtly of the earlier films disappearing does put me off somewhat, namely because I do pine for the charm that Sean Connery seemed to have, and Roger Moore to a lesser extend. Yet, there are also aspects of those earlier movies that sort of put me off of them, particularly looking back on them from this point in the future.Still, half the reason that I watched it was because I am slowly making my way through all of the Bond films, though this particular one I feel that I never actually seen, probably because there was a period of about five years when I wasn't actually watching movies. Yeah, in part it was okay, but in reality, the series really just seems to be dragging along at this particular point, which is probably why the next one ended up being a, well, 'soft' reboot.",Die Another Day

It's just awful. Not as bad as the Garbage one, but still horrible. I don't even hate the invisible car!! Did that car chase on the ice influence one of the awful F&F movies?I really enjoy the opening twenty minutes - half an hour. But after the awesome fight at the fencing club and the arrival in Iceland, the movies seems to lose its way and all the character building/development and good dialogue is out of the window as the movie goes from one action set piece to another. It's too cgi/green screen heavy and I hate the fight amongst the lasers. Too ridiculous for too long (Though it was pretty cool how jinx saved Bond) and the less said about Bond surfing a tsunami the better.Judi Dench isn't given much to do this time around which is a shame, Michael Madsen is wasted in a small role, he is just sort of there and Rosamond Pike is good, though I'm not sure why she was in just a bra for the final fight lol Bond girls gotta Bond girl I suppose.As for Halle Berry (this was her first movie after her Oscar win) she looks great and is really good in her action scenes, but like Denise Richards her delivery isn't the best. Admittedly she is hampered by some god awful dialogue. Thinking about it, I don't think Bond Girls should be played by someone as famous as Halle Berry or Denise RichardsI didn't check the run time, but this flew by.

62,johnnyboyz,Loosley enjoyable edition of Bond which cracks under its own weight; ironically allowing the franchise to die so that it may live another day.,6,6 January 2013,"Die Another Day's final act is so bad that it very nearly undoes all the relatively good work that preceded it. It is a rare thing indeed when one observe a film that careens off into territory so bad, and so absurd, that it finds room to encompass all of: a car chase in a hotel made out of ice you'd think was too small in size to accommodate such a thing anyway; a man out-para-sail an avalanche and two people manage to successfully chase down a jumbo jet about to take off on account of their sprinting skills, and STILL come away from it with an overall stature of ""positive"". Indeed, if people DO come away from the film hating it, then it will be because the final forty-five appalling minutes of a film that doesn't ask its audience to do an awful lot of remembering is the freshest thing still in the memory.As it happens, I didn't particularly mind Die Another Day; the best sections were bits that I enjoyed to a relatively meek level, the worst sections were parts I merely did my best to tolerate. Granted, this is hardly a glowing endorsement but I think it would be fair to say that the positives outweigh the negatives in Lee Tamahori's effort – albeit at some absurd ratio of around 52% to 48%. In the pantheon of Bond films, this is close to one of the worst but worse still has been made. In 2002, extreme stunts and such are here to compensate for when journeying into space in the 1960's was the thing to look on and gawp at; further still, when the threat of nuclear war in the 1970's and 80's was still a palpable ingredient for drama. The ultimate irony is that the best second unit sequence is a straight-forward sword fight: a simple scene between two blokes going at it in a corridor.The New Zealand born director takes very little time to drop us in a world we feel could be Bondian: a surfing sequence under the cover of darkness, as three figures do their best to infiltrate a North Korean beach, eventually gives way to gadget usage on the shore and the abduction of a diamond smuggler so as to infiltrate a nearby arms deal: so far, so good. We are, of course, still in the pre-credits sequence; that famous cinematic passage wherein the seeds that usually come to form the bigger picture are planted. This one is just as impressive; Tamahori keeping things fresh in the sense Bond dukes it out with new enemies (the Koreans) with some new weaponry (large machine gun/bazooka hybrids) on top of some new modes of transportation (hovercraft-like vehicles which cruise over land). However, a double cross from within the British secret service leads to Bond being caught, and a credits sequence depicting interrogation seems to eerily cross pollinate what we've come to expect from these sequences with Bond's own hallucinations of scorpion drenched jail cells and sculptures of women made out of ice as he battles madness; the torture and mind affecting drugs.Things develop when he is exchanged for a Korean prisoner the British have named Zao (Yune), the same individual that was present in North Korea the day Bond was captured and of whom was right-hand-man to Bond's target that day: a certain Moon (Yun Lee), someone we observed go over a waterfall in an apparent death. Zao is established as a force to be reckoned with when Judi Dench's M reiterates to Bond how he managed to kill three Chinese agents in a failed act of terrorism. After being suspended from the force, Bond must escape his newfound British surroundings if it means finding who set him up that day; the man coming to work for the Chinese before jetting off to Cuba in this impressive opening act built on a pleasing ""starting from the bottom and working one's way up"" atmosphere you might find in a revenge picture as you piece together the clues and acquire clothing; a firearm; a mode of transportation, etc.It's around the hour mark that the film decides to think bigger than it needs to. It snaps, it wakes up: it suddenly realises it's a James Bond picture and opts to box-tick its way through a second act which is just about on the right side of ""tolerable"" before sinking like a stone into what often resembles some sort of sick pastiche of every bad action film you've ever seen. Enter Jinx (Berry), an African-American C.I.A. operative with a big silver firearm; a red catsuit and a tendency to blurt out double entendres as if there were someone off screen with a gun pointed at her ready to pull the trigger should she get it wrong. A point of interest is that she's African-American, a rare occurrence in a Bond film: but the biggest disappointment is that she might just as well be of any racial ethnicity, since her race is a complete redundancy. Jinx herself is indeed ultimately superfluous and an unpleasant addition. In Pierce Brosnan, we have a solid lead whose presence we entrust to guide us through proceedings; we have an interesting premise and a story with the potential to be quite engaging: we're fine as things stand, but because it's Bond we alas need a supporting bimbo. Failing miserably to feed off what was provided in For Your Eyes Only and The Spy Who Loved Me, Jinx is hardly the film's finest ingredient. The plot comes to revolve around Toby Stephens' Gustav Graves, someone looking to begin a Second Korean War: a Bond villain in the mold of Max Zorin with a Mayday-like assistant in Rosamond Pike's Miranda Frost. Regardless, the film is a minor success with room to be a spectacular failure; I didn't like it, few truthfully will: but I don't hate it and recommend it only with a heavy awareness.",Die Another Day
63,filipemanuelneto,Everything went wrong.,2,2 April 2016,"Directed by Lee Tamahori and produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, has script Robert Wade and is the twentieth film in the franchise. In this film, Pierce Brosnan plays 007 for the last time, next to Halle Berry, in the role of Jinkx, Rosamund Pike, in the role of Miranda Frost, Rick Yune, in the role of Zao, John Cleese, in the role of Q and Toby Stephens, in the role of Gustav Graves.In this film, James Bond returns to active after being captured and tortured in North Korea, where he remained abandoned by the country he served. He will try to pursue those responsible for his arrest, in particular the traitor who he suspects exist within MI6's ranks. For this, he will have to investigate a network of smuggling of blood diamonds and an eccentric millionaire who has a reputation for never sleeping.This is undoubtedly the worst film of Bond franchise, to date. If there is any Bond movie where everything went wrong, is this. Pierce Brosnan, who in this film says goodbye to 007, was never convincing as James Bond. He tried, did his best and that's positive, but he never truly fit in the role. And if his previous films had been saved by the excellent quality of the villains and other stuff like that, it doesn't happen in this movie. Toby Stephens works well as Graves, but his character proved to be an unlikely villain. The public simply don't believe in his character or the history around it. Rosamund Pike is a terrible choice for a Bond-girl, as her character tried to be, at some point. She is the antithesis of any bond-girl, but the script was able to make up for it in the end, when Miranda showed not be as friendly as she (ever) seemed. Finally, we have the worst participation of all: Hale Brest... ops, Berry! This actress simply has no talent. She has big breasts, only that. And if that is enough to be a good bond- girl, the world is lost. The script is another problem: despite giving focus to strong and relevant subjects such weapons and diamonds trafficking or the constant military tension in North Korea, the way the film deals with it is simply unacceptable, unlikely and far-fetched. We could accept that in the early films of the franchise, but now the public expects more and that was simply forgotten. Last but not least, the film continues to suffer from continuity errors, paradoxes and faults unworthy of cinema professionals, in addition to the massive advertising sponsors, showed in all sequences and almost every scene. Bond is a action character or a pretty face to sell things?! The opening theme of this film, sung by Madonna, was very trendy to be precisely Madonna's.

68,Anonymous_Maxine,"The high-flying, outlandish variety of vintage Bond style.",7,8 November 2008,"After re-watching Casino Royale yesterday, I'm really struck by the wildness of the action, the villains, and the overall plot of Die Another Day. In Pierce Brosnan's last outing as 007, we get the kind of super-villains and super-villainous plot that can only possibly exist in a Bond movie. The movie starts in North Korea in the middle of a shady diamond exchange. The movie's opening action sequence is great, and it is unusual because it ends with Bond being captured and imprisoned for an extended period of time. Years, it looks like. Eventually, the British arrange for his release by agreeing to release a North Korean terrorist named Zao, who is also the only person who knows who betrayed Bond in North Korea in the first place. As Bond sets off on a personal quest to re-capture him and discover who betrayed him, he is led to the mysterious billionaire Gustav Graves, whose involvement in diamond trading is for the sake of the development of a massive satellite with a diamond-encrusted solar panel capable of harnessing and concentrating the energy of the sun, creating a laser beam powerful enough to destroy anything on earth in its path. There is also a bizarre sub-plot involving a high-tech procedure which can alter a person's DNA and completely change their appearance, basically transforming any person into any other person. Zao undergoes this procedure early in the film but is interrupted in the middle of it, which is why one of the villains is a Asian man with sky blue eyes, albino skin and scars all over his face. Interesting, but as we can see from Toby Stephens' performance as the psychotic Graves, special effects and make-up are totally unnecessary to have a good villain.It's too bad that all of the supposedly North Korean characters are so inauthentic. I've always thought that, in situations like this, it's always best to just have them speak their native language and give us subtitles, but evidently the film's producers have no faith in the American audience's attention span, so all of them speak not only perfect English but perfect American English and all authenticity goes flying out the window.Nevertheless, the special effects are generally good and there are plenty of great action sequences. There's also a great location in Iceland of a building made of ice, and even a cool car chase through it. Of course, Iceland is actually green, while Greenland is full of ice, but there you have the producers' dumbing down the movie for an ignorant audience again. There is some cool technology in the movie, too, particularly Bond's Aston Martin, which now has an invisibility function. Definitely the most expensive 007 film starring Pierce Brosnan, although not necessarily the best.By the way, I have to ask a question. At one point Bond is driving his car through the ice house and he flips over, sliding along on his roof.

Madonna set the record for the all time worst Bond song in the history of Bond songs.And she set the record for one of the all time worst Bond villains in franchise history.It doesn't really feel like a Bond movie, it feels like a movie that was trying to make a mockery out of past Bond movies.Nothing comes together, everything is just flat out horrible, and, in the end, you want it all to be over.It's honestly worse than Moonraker",Die Another Day
70,freemantle_uk,Brosnan's Weakest Bond Film,5,21 April 2008,"Pierce Brosnan was a very good James Bond in my opinion. He made Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is not Enough were all good films in the Bond franchise. However Die Another Day was a weak film in comparison and forced the Bond franchise back to his roots, make the realist and excellent Casino Royale.Die Another Day starts out very promisingly. Bond is sent on a mission to North Korea to assassinate a sadist colonel. He gets found out and ends up fighting a whole army base before getting caught and tortured for eighteen months. It had real life geo-political situation and Bond is show to be a little more real and seen as a tough nut for not giving in during the torture. When Bond is release he was exchanged for a North Korean terrorist Zao (Rick Yune, the only other thing I know he done was a couple of episodes of Alias). Bond finds out that M exchanged him because she thought along with the American that he had broke was was giving out information and he loses his license to kill. He ends up having to escape from a British warship and go to Hong Kong before going off to Cuba to find Zao. It was went Bond going to Cuba when the find starts going downhill.This Bond film has a number of problems. Firstly the plot was poor, it was similar to Moonraker which was one of the worst Bond films. The North Korean hardliners, using a western agent to make a giant laser in space so that it can destroy the mines on the 38th Parallel and allow North Korea to invade the south. The plot was too sci-fi for a Bond film and that was what made Moonraker a weak film. They were other sci-fi, unrealistic aspect that also ruined the film: the DNA transplant and the invisible car which a number of critics have said nearly destroyed the Bond franchise. The director Lee Tamahori was a poor choice. He did Once Were Warriors, a film I want to see, a few Sopranos episodes, and that's it. He had made some weak action films afterwards: XXX2: State of the Union and Next. He was unable to whole to story together and did no get the most of his actors. The action was run in the mill and the CGI was weak. I believe Bond films should only use CGI when they have to, for example, showing a mission going to its target. Halle Berry was a poor choice as a Bond girl. She was too self-centred and making the film about her as well as Bond. Her character Jinx had a stupid name and she was meant to be the equal to Bond. The whole of Bond films that he is the best, no one is able to match him. Halle Berry also gave a poor performance and the only good film she had done since Die Another Day was X-Men 2. They was talk about they being a Jinx spin-off movie, but this was cancelled. If it was made that would have killed the Bond Franchise! Madonna also affected the film, given it a poor title song (I never really liked her music) and had a laughable cameo which was not needed. She has ambitions to be an actress, it just a shame she can't act. The filmmakers also had an anti-Bond type character, Gustav Graves. He was really Colonel Moon, the Korean army officer Bond was meant to kill. He was played by Toby Stephens who is a good actor, but I thought the anti-Bond type character didn't work and was done in Goldeneye. The film had a lot of product placement. They was Jaguar, Aston Martin, Panasonic, the list is long. I know it does happen in films and I accept it, but the audiences wants it to be reasonable. Finally the film relied too much on humour and self-referencing. Humour didn't work for Roger Moore's films in the long run and it is not going to work now! John Cleese as R was a poor choice because he type of humour doesn't fit with the type used in Bond films. Self-referencing was numerous, such as Bond's 20th watch, Bond loosing his License to Kill, Graves and the Union Jack parachute and Jinx coming out of the sea in bikini are some examples.The filmmakers were also worried about XXX starting Vin Diesel, believing that it was going to be a threat. XXX was a poor film and its sequel was a box-office bomb. There was talk that Vin Diesel was considered as a potential Bond which was laughable. The real threat to Bond was the Bourne Identity which brought spy thrillers into a more gritty realist world, not a far-fetched world like XXX.Its best not to watch this film because it would just ruin the Brosnan era of Bond. The only good thing about it was that it forced the filmmakers to bring in Paul Haggis as a scriptwriter, brought in Daniel Craig and make the excellent Casino Royale",Die Another Day
71,ebiros2,Totally average,3,19 October 2005,"There used to be a time when going to the theaters and watching James Bond movies was a treat. As one critics said, James Bond's world is a world like ours but kind of a parallel universe where things are little bit brighter and more brilliant than this one that we live in. Now James Bond lives in a world just like our own. In fact he looks just as worn out and busy as the rest of us who wakes up in the morning and goes to work, being chased by the endless details and speed of the information age. So why the heck do we have to go to Bond any more to find an escape from our life for 90 minutes ? Transcendental meditation may even be a better alternative to find a place where we can be free from our daily lives.Bond girls are really average too for this and previous four or so movies. What's funny is James Bond spoof Mike Myers in the Goldmember has better looking girls than James Bond, and watching Mike Myers is more of transporting experience than watching the original Bond.So I could see why James Bond franchise is suffering these days. It stopped being the brighter world that we wished our daily life was like.",Die Another Day
72,dfranzen70,It's alive! It's alive!,7,3 December 2002,"James Bond must be feeling old - it's now be 40 years since the first movie, Dr. No, came out. And thankfully, all of the characterizations of Bond as a womanizing cad who escapes great peril through use of his wits and a Walther PPK gun (not to mention a few nifty cars), are intact.Sure, Bond's a fossil. Do you think that a  Bond franchise would fly if it were begun today? Probably not. Activists would picket the theaters, claiming Bond is demeaning to women, animals, and children. But he's been here for four decades, and we're all used to him. Kind of like an old sweater that has a few holes in it but still fits okay.Speaking of holes, a James Bond plot is never something that should be examined too closely. One might then discover unfathomable peculiarities; it's best to sit back and enjoy the ride, as they say in my favorite theme parks.Die Another Day begins very well - Bond is captured during an operation in Korea. He's been set up, you see. Okay, so that kind of thing happens a lot to these superspies, but this time he's set up and captured and... and tortured! Yes, Bond! No, you don't get loving, lingering looks at Bond being tortured, so it's a quick 14 months in captivity.It's not giving away much at all to let you know that he does escape. This is Bond, after all. It's not likely he'd be kept for the duration of a film.Bond's stripped of his 007 title, and he sets off to avenge his wrong. His travels take him to Iceland, where he runs into a sinister mastermind who's doing something nefarious that will likely bother the heck out of a lot of people. Bond manages to pick up enough of the baddie's plans to thwart them.But all of that is just an excuse to see the other two big draws in Bond movies: the girls and the gadgets. Halle Berry appears as Jinx/Miss Swift, who may or may not be on Bond's side. Seems she shows up at the same places he does. Oh, and it's lust at first sight. Bond also much somehow seduce the public-relations director for the bad guy. Do you think he's up to the challenge? She's a bit of an ice queen, too - her name is Miss Frost.There's a lot of snarkiness and sly putdowns, and sometimes these get a little tired. Sometimes we get beat over the head with crappy puns. But if you put that aside and instead concentrate on being entertained, you'll be fine. Pierce Brosnan's growing into the role rather well - after all, while he's not Connery, he's also not Dalton. And he's better than Roger Moore and that other guy, the one who played Bond one time only. I'm speaking of George Lazenby, who starred in perhaps the worst Bond film of them all, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Is this a bad movie? Nope. Is it a Bond movie? Yep. Is it a good Bond movie? Sort of. Let's compare this not with other action movies but with other Bond movies. It's better than A View to a Kill and Moonraker, but not as good as From Russia with Love or Goldfinger. It's serviceable Bond, par for the course Brosnan has set for us.",Die Another Day

75,drqshadow-reviews,"The Bond Franchise Struggles, Again, to Maintain",3,6 May 2020,"Pierce Brosnan's last ride on the 007 carousel circumnavigates the globe, with key scenes in North Korea, China, Cuba, London and Iceland. It's a whirlwind tour that's accented with garish, perplexing film techniques and complicated by too many subplots and side characters. The primary story, that of an insane face-swapping military man whose plans to reignite the Korean War involve ice castles, blood diamonds and an orbiting solar laser beam, would be confusing enough without the added distractions.Die Another Day's supporting cast is weak - Halle Berry is especially hammy in a co-starring role as this month's femme flavor - and the special effects are completely inept. Embarrassingly bad, in fact, in most of the important action scenes. Compounding matters, the fresh release of a contemporary spy/action franchise (The Bourne Identity opened six months prior) makes poor Mr. Bond look absolutely ancient by comparison. How quickly Eon wasted the fresh potential of Goldeneye and fell into the same traps that made the character seem like such a staid relic in previous incarnations. Time to tear it all down again and start from scratch, I guess.",Die Another Day
76,Chris_Docker,"Gadgets, Babes, and Lotsofexplosions",6,20 November 2002,"I went to see the latest Bond - Die Another Day last night and have to sheepishly admit I quite enjoyed it.      I personally liked the opening sequence that gives us a frantic hovercraft chase, Brosnan being tortured by scorpions, and surreal mtv-style opening credits to go with Madonna's theme song. The website also has a good Madonna music video, with elements stolen from the film and re-hashed to feature Madonna. Concentrate on what people are good at, was maybe the motto of esteemed Director Lee (Once Were Warriors, Along Came a Spider, Mulholland Falls) Tamahori. Madonna's acting presence is wisely kept down to a cameo appearance where she looks every bit her age and not very charismatic.    As current spy-chase-caper movies go, Die Another Day isn't bad. Dedicated 007 fans will hearken back to the days when we saw real stunts instead of CGIs (some of the present special effects are poorer than could be achieved with less adventurous but more realistic live action). But this is very much a give-'em-what-they-expect movie and the plot (which takes a while to twist and turn to its cliche ending), script (classic 'Bond-style' one-liners that are more self-referential than new), babes (Halle Berry is very modern day and at-home in super-hero movies), and a star-studded cast add up to an enjoyable movie night. People who want depth have got a bit of a cheek expecting it from a Bond movie after all.      The weakest point of the film, for me, was Pierce Brosnan who, at almost 50, hardly looks capable of the sustained action with which the special effects credit him. Vin Diesel set a hard act to follow as the realistically fit action-hero spy in XXX, and Matt Damon gave us the intelligent intelligence-agent in Bourne Identity. Austin Powers has set the standard for out-and-out comedy. The attraction of Bond has  been very much a fantasy world where people drink martinis, dress impeccably and do lots of fun dangerous things, all with a British, or especially English, nonchalance. Connery carried it off well as he has tremendous presence, a passable acting ability in set roles, and a Scottish accent to add a bit of spice. Brosnan is something of a stuffed shirt by comparison, his Irishness is never optimised and his idea of being an English gentleman type is undermined by a story that is heavily Americanised. His limited acting skills are well-covered by surrounding him with Oscar-winning actors Judi Dench and Halle Berry, not to mention the here very capable John Cleese and tough-looking Michael Madsen. It would appear Brosnan aspires to be playing James Bond for as long as he can rather than scaling any great acting heights (and there's nothing wrong with that - he's delivering a product that is repeatedly successful by all mainstream commercial standards).      It's not a film that would pull me out to the cinema over and above curiosity but it's better than I expected for all that. I suppose my ideal Bond movie would be made by someone like Michael Mann - but then again he might expect a certain degree of artistic control, which studios and licensees will be reluctant to grant where a £142m dollar movie is concerned. Balancing that sort of money on a knife edge is not left to chance if studios can help it - even to the extent of cutting 12 minutes of Halle-get-yer-kit-off for an American optimum film-censor certification. It's a testament to Berry that she brings life to such dumb lines as ""Well that's a mouth full!"" (after being given Bond's full name and glancing at his crotch). The sadness is that the original Bond character still has the potential to be the basis of a really memorable movie - intellectually engaging, brilliant characterisation, a movie for adults, basically. It would cost a fraction of the present Bond budgets to make. But what right have film fans to expect this when they are so outnumbered by moviegoers? Accept Die Another Day on its own terms, gadgets and all, and you'll have a fun family night out at the pictures.",Die Another Day

Featuring atrocious special f/x and a lame story that would've seemed cheesy even in the Moore era, this film's only saving grace is that it likely paved the way for the franchise's reboot (It was a big hit, but I think the negative response helped to convince the powers that be it was time to change things up). Don't even get me started on the theme song.But my biggest disappointment in this re-watch was Halle Berry. I remembered a stronger performance and a more memorable character from her here, but at times her performance seems unsure, and Jinx falls out of the movie for a long stretch, robbing her of a chance to form the requisite relationship with Bond and with us.

Pierce brosnan is a very good choice to play James Bond and I like his performance here. The movie also features other great actors that turn in great performances. Halle Berry is one of those great actors, and I loved her performance here as Jinx, very bondish, which is how it must be. Judi Dench is of course great as M, as always. The movie has special effects that are for the most part alright, at times they are a little hokey. They switch from being just okay to sort of fake looking. The writing is enough to keep the audience interested enough and it's enough to suffice for a typical James Bond movie, but it never exceeds that standard, which is alright in my opinion. To be honest a 007 movie isn't supposed to have spectacular out of this world writing, that's not really the point of these films, sure it's wonderful to have a very well written script, but for those kind of movies case, it's excusable to not have one.

84,slokes,Suck Another Century,2,9 April 2006,"The first James Bond movie of the 21st century introduces us to a character so sordid and dreary even Austin Powers wouldn't want to parody him.While Bond movies have never been uniformly great, they were for the most part consistently entertaining, at least in the Connery-Lazenby-Moore period. Timothy Dalton inserted a note of seriousness to his portrayal, and greater fidelity to the Bond as authored by Ian Fleming, which worked, too, though at the expense of the meta-humor Austin Powers would later mine.Pierce Brosnan looked the part better than the others, but he never quite fit. Rather studied in his serious-actor approach, he brought together the sobriety of Dalton, the charm of Moore, and the danger of Connery in a way that reads great on paper but came off like a patchquilt zombie on screen.So does ""Die Another Day,"" an overheated, underdeveloped mess of a film which suggests the producers finally stretched the Bond franchise well past snapping. Trying for something original, the movie starts with Bond's capture and torture, followed by a sudden break with MI-6 and M. Alone in Cuba, he seeks his betrayer and comes across a fellow sexual adventurer named Jinx, played by Oscar winner Halle Berry.This was Bond's 40th anniversary, so the movie is crammed full of references to other Bond films. It breaks new ground, too. Madonna performs a techno-trance number with glitch-like audio cutouts that surpasses Lulu's ""Man With The Golden Gun"" for worst Bond song ever. Brosnan, playing down the 007 sophistication, walks into a hotel lobby bearded, shirtless, and sporting a paunch bigger than Connery had in ""Diamonds Are Forever.""Christopher Walken previously gave the worst performance in a Bond movie by a past Oscar winner; now he's in third place behind Berry and Dame Judi Dench, whose M grows more insufferably superior by the minute. Berry has a nice body she relishes showing off, but whatever acting chops she has were left in the gym. Instead, she makes bold single-entendre jokes to show what a liberated woman she is.""I take it Mr. Bond has been explaining his Big Bang theory,"" she is asked, cattily.""Oh, yeah, I think I got the thrust of it,"" Jinx replies. Yes, she's a slut, but she's proud.Much of the time, the film is overserious, as with a pre-credit sequence that dispenses with the familiar feel-good formula of past Bond films and another long scene where M confronts Bond with her belief (a bizarre one, given their past history and relationship) that he is a traitor. When Roger Moore romped in bed with a woman, the only thing in danger of being raised was his eyebrow, but Brosnan pushes the boundaries with energetic thrusting and licking out of ""Last Tango In Paris."" He is a serious actor, after all.Vertically he comes up short, however, challenged with quips lamer than Moore's in ""Octopussy"" and a storyline that bounces him around from one locale to another, and from a swordfight to a Madonna cameo to some labored comedy with the new ""Q"", John Cleese.Cleese really doesn't belong in a Bond movie; except for being British his background is so different. But he did perform in one famous Monty Python sketch involving a dead parrot, which is probably as good a metaphor as any for 21st Century Bond.",Die Another Day

He even made 'Tomorrow Never Dies' entertaining enough, and that is one of the worse from the series. Here one of his Bond-girls is Halle Berry, another nice thing to enjoy, although not as nice as Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards together in 'The World Is Not Enough'. So we have Brosnan, Berry, M (Judi Dench), R (John Cleese), an American M named Damian Falco (Michael Madsen), a silly story with lots of implausible moments, very nice action sequences and the usual gadgets. In other words, we have a typical Bond-film.If you can put reason aside it is hard not to like a film like this. I could tell you about the story but with a Bond-film the story is nothing but an excuse to show cool people, cool cars, special effects, funny moments and beautiful women. 'Die Another Day' succeeds in giving those things. There are a couple of things I don't like very much. The films theme song is performed by Madonna; she also has a cameo. I do not like the song, I do not like her cameo that has no purpose but putting Madonna in a Bond-film, and I did not like the images shown during the theme song. They are part of the story and therefore it breaks with the tradition that the theme song is sort of a thing on itself. The nice little tributes to all other nineteen Bond-films make up for that.In the end I can only say you like this film if you can appreciate an average Bond. For me Brosnan is enough. It deserves its place between 'GoldenEye' and 'The World Is Not Enough', being much better than 'Tomorrow Never Dies'. Of course it is no 'Goldfinger', but then again, what Bond-film really is.

I watched it anyway and I have to say I totally agree with them .James Bond is sent to investigate the connection between a North Korean terrorist and a diamond mogul, who is funding the development of an international space weapon.There is so much wrong with this film .
There's the invisible car , the body swapping , the awful CGI , the terrible dialogue and the pointless celebrity cameos but the most unforgivable thing about this film is that it's insufferably boring .
Not boring because nothing happens because it's non stop action but boring because I couldn't care less what happened to anyone , including Bond.The best thing that I can say about this is that it's not the worst 007 film I've ever seen . That goes the the awful comedy Casino Royale which preceded all the main films .I've now seen every James Bond film and I have to say there are more poor films than good ones .
My favourite Bond by a long way is Daniel Craig and my least favourite is Sean Connery . The best film is Skyfall .

89,davidmvining,Not a good way for Brosnan to exit the franchise,3,2 March 2020,"It's not the ridiculousness that turns me off, it's the complete inability to tell a story. It's the clash of tones. It's the use of real-world dangers in ridiculous ways. Essentially, this is Moonraker, but worse, and Moonraker wasn't very good.The problems start with the film's setup. Bond goes into North Korea to assassinate the son of a general who has indeterminate plans about crossing the DMZ into South Korea (that wouldn't be supported by the North Korean junta because he's operating outside the chain of command), but things go south and, after a long hovercraft chase, Bond gets captured. Over the credits sequence (with Madonna's over-synthesized and auto-tuned title song) we see Bond tortured for fourteen months. This is not the beginning of a weird spy adventure with bikini clad Halle Berry, space lasers, and an invisible car, but the beginning of a down to earth take on the reality and effects of spycraft. And yet, it's actually the beginning of a weird spy adventure with bikini clad Halle Berry, space lasers, and an invisible car. And gene therapy changing a guy's race completely. There's a tonal clash here that feels like this is yet another Bond script cobbled together from different ideas without any concern for how well they fit together.So, the important points in terms of antagonists of this opening sequence are that the errant general (who's the son of another North Korean general) dies by falling into a waterfall and his henchman gets scarred in the face with diamonds. Bond gets released fourteen months later in a prisoner exchange with the henchman returning to North Korea and Bond goes rogue. This is a much less compelling tale of Bond going rogue than Licence to Kill. Bond is essentially just on a mission here, and it's a poorly told one at that.He gets information from a Chinese source (hey! Hollywood making China look good again!) that sends him to Cuba where the henchman was seen in a gene therapy clinic. There, bond sees the Cuba of the movies (everyone on the street all kinds of happy) and immediately sets his eyes on the one woman who is an American asset looking into the same thing, Jinx. They end up going to the clinic at the same time, completely coincidentally, and shooting it up independently, finding the Korean henchman in the middle of a therapy session that's doing...something to him. I assume it's changing his race, because that's what we find out later happened to the Korean general who fell into the waterfall.He somehow survived, used a cache of diamonds, transformed himself into a British looking guy, and because a world famous daredevil diamond miner, or something. Bond follows him to an ice hotel in the Arctic where he's having a big reveal of a satellite that can reflect the sun's rays in concentrated form back to Earth. I swear that I saw this in Batman & Robin. Why would he reveal this to the world? Why would he invite Bond to see the unveiling when he knows who Bond is? When you see the rest of his plan, to destroy the DMZ between North and South Korea in order to create the situation for a surprise attack southward, none of this makes any sense. It's supposed to be a surprise, but he announces this satellite to the world? He invites a dangerous British secret agent, who's foiled many evil geniuses before, to the unveiling? This is nonsensical.Oh, and there's an invisible car, Bond surfing with compositing as bad as it was in the 60s, and the bad guy putting on an electrical suit that kills people with electricity. Oh, and a helicopter falling out of the back of a jumbo jet being piloted to safety.This movie could have been goofy fun, but it has no idea how to handle it. Part of the problem is the contrast between Pierce Brosnan's take on the character and the overall feel of the film. If you go back to Goldeneye, you see a Bond much more in line with the intense, dangerous, and suave take given by Sean Connery, but he can deliver a quip as well as Roger Moore did. It feels like the producers just fell in love with his ability to deliver a pithy one-liner and moved the entire take of the following films to fall more in line with Roger Moore's sillier productions. Brosnan was never meant for these types of Bond films. He should have been given material more like Timothy Dalton's. Instead, we have this straight man in the middle of ridiculous adventures without ever really winking at the audience that he's in on the joke that Moore rather consistently did (to varying results, admittedly).On top of that, the director, Lee Tamahori, chose to shoot the action sequences in very fad-chasing fashion with speed ramping, quick camera moves, and the like in order to create extra visual flair that ends up just drawing attention to itself without really adding much.I can appreciate some of the goofiness to the film, but it's ultimately dragged down by clunky storytelling and a central take on the character that doesn't fit. It's not the worst Bond film, but it's near the bottom.",Die Another Day
90,rosscinema,Enjoyable Bond film,7,25 December 2002,It's not Goldfinger or From Russia With Love or even close to those classics but it's still entertaining and Brosnan again proves he's excellent as Bond. As you watch the film its apparent that they're grooming Halle Berry for her own film and franchise. One of the silly moments is where Bond is held prisoner in Korea for over a year and is beaten everyday and when he's finally let go he looks the same except for a beard. It doesn't look like he lost any weight at all! Good action and some clever devices as we've come to expect so I was thoroughly entertained.,Die Another Day
91,Rob_Taylor,"Dire Another Day....The name is Bland, James Bland.",4,26 December 2002,"Now, with Bond movies you expect a certain level of unbelievable gadgets and ridiculous story lines, but Die Another Day went one step too far and moved into the realm of ridicule. At times, I thought I was watching an Austin Powers movie, it got so silly. From being an enjoyable action romp, it became an endless succession of ridiculous dialogue and ever more ridiculous scenes, with a good few continuity errors and just plain foolishness thrown in. Please note, there are MANY SPOILERS ahead.The opening scene, with Bond vs. the North Koreans was silly enough, with the Koreans such bad shots that even Star Wars stormtroopers would blush. There was some foolishness about a gun that could fire depleted uranium rounds, but which apparently had no recoil. And of course the very opening moments, with Bond surfing in were just foolishness. But, at this point, I was thinking maybe it would be entertaining enough, despite the silliness.Then the credits roll, with the obligatory opening Bond sequence. A very nice fire and ice motif which sets the mood for the ensuing storyline. But the whole thing was totally and completely ruined by the hideous shrieking and caterwauling of Madonna. I've not heard a worse Bond theme song for....well...ever. Later on I decided that her acting was better than her singing, so that just shows you how crap the song is.We move on to when Bond meets Jinx for the first time. Here we experience the most contrived and awful exchange of dialogue between two characters that I've ever seen in a film. The smutty innuendo just doesn't stop and the inane chatter just goes on and on ludicrously. Really, you just want someone to walk up and slap the pair of them.We then see the villain of the show parachuting down into the middle of London from a plane. Now, in the wake of 9/11, I have to say that getting permission for a stunt like that would be unlikely, to say the least. And the parachute had a Union Jack flag design, which is where it occurred to me that maybe I'd stumbled into an Austin Powers movie.There's the fencing scene, where Bond squares off against the villain. They start off with sabres, I believe. But that changes to a sabre vs. katana, then katana vs. broadsword. I wonder how many fencing clubs really have katanas and broadswords just conveniently lying around awaiting use? It was foolish enough that I expected the sword from ""Sword and the Sorceror"" to make an appearance.Then we get to the gadgets. A ring with an ultrasonic sound generator that can shatter glass? Hmmmm...Ok. A watch with a laser built in? Bigger hmmmmmmm...but still ok. A car which can become completely invisible? No, no, no, no, no! Why not just make him a tuxedo that can become invisible? Wouldn't that be more use?Fast forward to Iceland and the car chase/battle on ice. Apart from the ludicrously well armed vehicles, I particularly found it hard to believe in the mini/chain gun that Zao's car had. Not that it was any harder to believe in than the mortars, rockets and point defence machine guns that the cars had, just that it was mounted right behind and above Zao's head by a matter of inches. If he'd had hair, it would have been set on fire by the muzzle flashes and he should've been deafened at the very least. Totally stupid.Next up was the Death Star....er...laser satellite thingy that the bad guys had. One minute, it's carving it's way through a glacier in nothing flat. The next, it has trouble melting an ice hotel and takes many, many minutes to do so. Where's the consistency Mr. Director?Hanging over the edge of a glacier, Bond cleverly uses the drogue chute of his rocket sled to fashion a parachute in order to escape being killed. Why the Death Star beam stops short of the edge and so doesn't fry him instantly is obviously down to some technical glitch and is not a plot device. No, not at all. Anyway, Bond makes a parachute and escapes. Except....it turns out that rocket sleds do not have drogue chutes, but instead have proper parachutes which would rip and tear if deployed at speed, but are dead handy if you find yourself hanging over a ledge.Then there's another car chase, this time inside the ice hotel whilst its sloooooooowly being melted by the Death Star. I lost track of how many times a car struck an ice pillar and sustained NO damage whatsoever. Ice is hard stuff. But not, apparently, as hard as flimsy metal body panels. But maybe Bond's car regenerated? Its stealth mode certainly did..just in time to save him, of course. In fact, the lack of damage made me wonder if it was all some kind of affectionate homage to the Dukes of Hazzard.Then he rescues Jinx from her watery death, by using his sonic ring to shatter the windscreen of his car. Hang on a moment though....even regular cars have laminated windscreens..right? And Bond's is bound to be extra tough and bullet-proof, right? Yet it shatters like...well..cheap glass and there isn't even a hint of lamination about it.Finally the scenes in the transporter plane. Just silly, plain and simple. The bad guy has on some costume that makes him look like a fly and delivers electric shocks through his hands. Supposedly 100,000 volts!! Yet Bond stoically took all this juice and they danced around a little with pretty electric arcs reminiscent of the final scene with the Emperor in Return of the Jedi. Meanwhile the transporter plane slooooooowly disintegrates like the ice hotel.Later they escape the transporter by rolling out the back in a helicopter and guess what? Two highly trained agents have never heard of autorotation to regain control of a helicopter with no power. Instead they struggle to restart the engine from cold.All Bond films are silly, but this one was just too much. If you're five, you'll find it entertaining. But not otherwise. The worst Bond film to date by a big margin. I'm thinking that Pierce Brosnan really ought to abandon Bond, before it kills his career.",Die Another Day
92,eric262003,"Shows Bond In a Newer, Fresher Perspective",7,23 January 2018,"With an open mind and an open heart, I felt so relieved to see a greater fondness for Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. He embarks the character of Bond to a fresher view that even Sean Connery or Roger Moore never entered into. He is more boss and less subservient, he has that dashing appeal while still remaining awkward in delivery, his Irish accent still weaves through in his delivery to perfect the Queen's English, he plays a surreal character while refraining to make him out that way. ""Die Another Day"" is welcomed addition the franchise that has been running for over five and a half decades. At the midway point of the film in a twist of coincidental reality, Bond's superior M (Judi Dench) warned the iconic assassin that the world has changed, when you were gone. Could she be making reference to his incarceration in North Korea or through the reality that Bond thrillers have changed in a subtle tongue-in-cheek matter? Sure there are weird stunt moments like Bond surfing on a glacier that was melted from a laser beam from out of nowhere. However, the action scenes feel more upgraded to stand as a modern day action film. Even the Bond girl has been modernized to look at how well we changed the feelings of how we view women. When we're first introduced to the latest Bond girl Jinx (Halle Berry) , we see a bit of her through the eyes of original Bond girl Ursula Andress from ""Dr. No"". From surfing the waves to the near identical bikini, it truly is an homage to the original Bond girl. But Jinx stands out from all the other Bond girls. Sure she still oozes seductive one-liners like all the other, but in ""Die Another Day"",Jinx is a deadly fighter and isn't a trophy case for 007. The opening scenes garner some original elements as we'r introduced to the villains, not as caricatured cartoon characters, but real and might seem more reality based as of this writing. Located in a North Korean military base under the watchful dictatorship of Colonel Tan-Sun Moon (Will Yun Lee) who is illegally cashing in weapons for African Conflict Diamonds, which seems to have a planted impact on one of the villains Zao (Ricky Yune). The chase scene which includes hover tanks in a mine field may look a bit convoluted, which leads 007 being captured, incarcerated and physically tortured for several months. He gets released via prisoner exchange, however M (Judi Dench) assume that Bond must've been brainwashed. He eventually is back in shape and meets Q (John Cleese) with a new assortment of gadgets like a car that's invisible and the wacky stunts and adventures get underway. For the first time in Bond history, CGI comes into play here like the disintegrating plane must've been made from computer generated graphics. But it doesn't detract from the excitement. The North Koreans are under the leadership of the cliched Bond villain Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) who wants world domination and his device he has lacks in any original merit to it. But what stands out s his secret hideout is in an ice house located in Iceland and his mirror device is used to generate heat on Earth which is more trouble than good as the ice house starts to melt and Jinx is held hostage as the water rises towards the ceiling, though its surreal that the room she's in doesn't melt, but we'll leave that to the experts to theorize their opinions. Other notable characters include the vicious Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) as it doesn't take brains which side she's on, Damian Falco (Michael Madsen) named after villains from cinematic past and Miss Moneypenny (Samantha Bond) has her fun in the sun as she virtually flirts with Bond.
 Under the direction of Lee Tamahori (who directed ""Mulholland Falls""), this New Zealander released much of the humour from the Bond series to hype up more towards the action. This was mostly due to the success of ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" competing against the film it's based on. It still has its surreal ways about it, but its executed in a more subtle way. When all is said and done with Bond having its share of hits and misses, this one is surely a hit. Not the best Bond out there, but up there with the best.",Die Another Day

A Silly, Power-Rangers Esque Bond film...",4,2 February 2012,"The 20th Bond film, 2002's ""Die Another Day"" is a silly, juvenile mess that wastes great talent in order to make room for silly, ""Power Rangers"" stunts, and cartoonish CGI. I plan on keeping this review short and sweet.The plot is all over the map. The beginning is quite fun, and the pre-credits sequence promises a darker, edgier film, but it felt pretty vapid and empty once the credits rolled, and we were treated to silly CGI women, and an auto-tuned Madonna. It only got worse. The suave Bond is a shadow of his former self. Pierce Brosnan is trying his hardest, and plays it well, but the whole film seems so outlandish and silly that he can't salvage anything. Even his charming quips which worked in prior films fall flat. Once he gets (and I'm not joking) an invisible Bond car, I could not take it anymore.The film has all sorts of plots and subplots (gene therapy changing the appearance of the villains, an Ice Palace, a space-laser that is used to destroy a minefield, etc), and all of them feel like a parody of Bond. Nothing was grounded in reality at all. I know the prior films were silly, but at least they tried to maintain a bit of realism. Here, anything goes. It felt like watching Bond wandering through Toon-Town from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""- there are no rules or boundaries.Hale Berry, who I usually like, was merely decent as the new Bond girl. Toby Stephens tries to be menacing as out villain Gustav Graves, but he falls flat to a clichéd script. Everyone fell flat. John Cleese did bring a bit of a snap to the film with a great rendition of Q (after assuming the role in the last film), but his scene (one of the only enjoyable ones in the film) was too brief.I must give credit where credit is due- some of the action is epic and well-shot, the music is fantastic, and a few of the CGI cartoon scenes look OK. But all-in-all, this film is a mess. It felt like a Saturday Morning Cartoon version of the character.I give it a below-average 4 out of 10. Avoid it, unless there are no other options, or you are a die-hard Bond fan who MUST see all of the films.(Note: I usually try to write longer reviews, but the film was so overstuffed with convoluted plot lines, silly characters and pointless, corny action sequences, that I gave up and made this a short one. I wish I had more to write, but I really don't know what to say about this one beyond what I have above.)",Die Another Day

Then for a while doesn't happen much but in the last third there were many special effects and the story kept all the time my attention. Again computer graphics reigns in some key scenes and sometimes it looked very cartooning as I saw in Blade II or Spider Man. What I don't like in movies is when the action scenes are too animated. With the high-tech possibilities of today they should create them at least more discreetly. So that's why I am a little bit disappointed. I have to admit that the ideas are magnificent and the special effects great but they were not developed deeply enough. Anyway check this out for an entertaining evening. 7/10.",Die Another Day

The sex jokes are on a sleepy level.

99,pyrocitor,Reality check,6,28 December 2015,"GoldenEye inspired a video game. Tomorrow Never Dies had Bond playing one. Die Another Day celebrates Bond's 40th by going the whole nine yards, and finally completing the metamorphosis: here, Bond fully becomes a video game. Hell, he even gets to play his own first person shooter of his own life, complete with the ultimate cathartic fantasy of ""shooting his own boss"". The son has become the father; the self-referential-cycle is complete. Appropriately, it's also one of the most dated entries into a franchise replete with antiquated ear- sores like ""That's like listening to the Beatles without earmuffs"" and ""Man talk"". Here, director Lee Tamahori not only curbs to the insufferable topicality of notoriously shaky CGI, but an obnoxious overuse of slow-mo, a Matrix-inspired wall-flip, and Halle Berry uttering the phrase ""Yo momma"". If that isn't a sign that things have gone amiss for the man so debonair he sniffed out a Soviet for ordering red wine with fish, nothing is. Still, Die Another Day's greatest sin is its unchecked excess. Granted, Bond is not normally known for subtlety, but Tamahori pushes it to the extent of an Austin Powers parody, careening from steadily outlandish plot point and stunt with the ""and then...and THEN!"" giggling of a sugar-high toddler. It's a shame, as the story at the core has substantial potential - North Korea brokering terrorism deals to finance internal reform, and Bond working with the Chinese government rather than his own to stop them. Regardless, the film's gaudiness is still, more often than not, hugely (daft) fun. The opening act is particularly slick - Bond sleuthing around in Havana is classic 007 skullduggery, and the pre- credits hovercraft chase is delightfully demented, while Bond being tortured and functionally abandoned by MI6 in North Korea adds a welcome dark streak (particularly when revisited after Skyfall). Sadly, this grimmer, more cohesive start is quickly jettisoned aside. Before you know it - give or take a few sword fights, an Icelandic ice palace and (yes) that invisible car - we've fully committed to some dubious 'racial rebranding' amidst a bizarre retread of Diamonds are Forever's 'diamond satellite sun-laser' MacGuffin (already silly in 1971), complete with smug 'global warming' crack. And you thought Quantum of Solace's environmental commentary was crude. We never drift into fully unsalvageable Batman & Robin territory, but it's only a few puns shy of it. Tamahori's deranged abandon when orchestrating a pulpy action sequence can be fun in satisfying the basest 007 escapist pleasures. It wears thin quickly though, and the film's pace is so zippy it becomes exhausting rather than exhilarating. Bond's missile-hemorrhaging glacial car chase with Zao, in particular, is a video game overkill snore-fest. Thankfully, the (subtler) nods to the past 19 Bonds are cute, and add an extra level of treasure hunting for aggravated diehards. And hey - Tamahori worked in a tune by The Clash, which is never a bad thing...right? But then there's that infamous paragliding scene, now fondly referenced in every ""how NOT to integrate CGI"" feature since. Yeah. I'm just going to leave that there. Brosnan's Bond is too inherently breezy and suave not to love, but even he's on automatic pilot here. He goes through the motions, but delivers particularly dire puns and unacceptably leery come-ons with such detached disdain that he may as well have been replaced by a robot (which would explain how his Bond has suddenly acquired powers like the ability to stop and start his heart at will and casually swim through arctic waters without hypothermia). Halle Berry buys into the campy proceedings gamely enough, and her spunky 'AmeriBond' is independent and competent enough to buy some patience with her too-frequent obnoxious posturing. Toby Stephens' Gustav Graves is the perfect blend of sneering and good in a fight, and equipped with more competent scriptwriters he could have made a far more credible and memorable foe. Such is also the case for pre-fame Rosamund Pike, who grins and bears the worst of the film's sexism, and is talented enough to emerge with dignity and steely charisma after sword fighting in a bra (barely). Rick Yune's diamond-pockmarked Zao makes for one of the better henchmen of the post-Jaws era, even commandeering some quips of his own (I'm a fan of ""how's that for a punchline""), while Will Yun Lee is entertainingly wily in the film's Korea prelude. In spite of the unprecedented camp surrounding her, Judi Dench's M remains a paragon of class, sparring well with Michael Madsen's growly bureaucrat, while John Cleese's solo outing as Q is so supremely enjoyable, replete with dazzling wordplay, impeccable double-takes and a ""flesh wound"" gag shouldered with impressive restraint, that it's almost a shame the Brosnan era didn't span one film longer, if only to spend more time with Cleese. Finally, while Madonna's prancing techno theme tune barely scrapes by on the right side of tolerable, the less said about her fencing cameo, the better.I've probably trod out enough defensive synonyms for ""fun"" by now. Die Another Day has its adolescent joys and a certain nostalgic cheeriness which can prove stupendously entertaining for those with the right temperament, but Tamahori shoves thrills down our throats with such demented desperation it's no wonder they catch and choke along the way. Such a bloated barrage of tropes too often becomes simply noise, and noisily boring at that - and Bond should never be boring. None would deny that 007 had here fallen too far down the rabbit hole, requiring a rather hasty ""kiss of life"". Enter the new 'Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. His name is Craig. Daniel Craig. And he is very welcome.-5.5/10",Die Another Day
100,Maciste_Brother,Suspension of disbelief stretched to the max!!!,2,17 June 2003,"DIE ANOTHER DAY starts off pretty good but when Bond escapes from his hospital bed (after faking heart failure!), the movie plummets to levels of silliness not seen in a Bond movie in a very long time (DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER?). There are simply too many aspects of the ultra thin story-line hurt because of the excessive amount of suspension of disbelief. The hardest thing to swallow (and the most unpleasant one) was the bad guy (played by Toby Stephens) is actually a Korean after plastic surgery!?!? Sure. Then there's the invisible car to deal with. And then there's the whole satellite in the sky/laser beam thingy. Or was it the extremely long and noisy car chase inside the melting ice building? Or Halle Berry playing an action hero? Or the zero chemistry between Brosnan and Berry? Or the scene where Bond escapes the iceberg avalanche? Or the entire scene inside the airplane at the end of the film? On and on and on...The scene in the airplane was the single most annoying climax scene since the one in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM. You'd think that the technologically advanced airplane would have bullet proof windows but no, the whole operation goes down the toilet because Bond shoots at a window and decompresses the entire aircraft. Sure. It was really difficult to swallow Bond and Jinx fighting their foes while the whole airplane was starting to fall apart. And the electrical suit worn by the villain, which electrocuted anyone who touched him, was silly. More eye rolling. Had the film been a bit more believable and the chemistry between Bond and Jinx been more authentic, then this would have been a slick flick but as it is now, DAD is more a cartoon than anything else and in the end, it looked like just another average action film made today.",Die Another Day
101,Sirus_the_Virus,Disappointing.,6,28 August 2009,"Die another day is the Batman & Robin of the James Bond films. It was sort of a mess. I do give Die another day a mild recommendation, though I found some scenes silly. The plot to Die another Day is sort of silly too. There were some action sequences that were rather dull at times, a few actually. Like when he is running from the laser and starts to surf on that ice block. I couldn't help but laugh at the cheese. How anyone could prefer this move over Quantum of Solace is just ridiculous. I have seen 19 James Bond films in my life. There were only a few that I didn't really like that much. Those were Die another Day and You only live twice. I didn't love or hate Die another day, I think it was silly, but it had things that kept it together. Like Halle Berry as Jinx, the Bond girl. Halle Berry is hot, so that's one things. Another thing is that I like Peirce Brosnan as Bond. I don't think he's the best but i like him more than Lazenby and Dalton. Everyone should. I know Die another day is a cheese filled film with a conjoluted plot that doesn't really go anywhere, but I still think it's fun. I liked Rosemond Pike as one of the villains. I think she is kind of sexy in a weird way. I like it when Halle Berry kicks her ass. Most people may find Die another Day as a disappointment. I did, but I still think the movie is fun in it's way.

103,PatrynXX,Not bad for a Bond film. Jinx doesn't live up to the hype.,7,1 December 2002,"(spoilers!!!)
I must say I came into this movie with a small amount of apprehention. Most because some people say Jinx upstages Bond in several scenes.  Not the movie I saw.  The common theme today is of course to empower the women on the bond films.  This one Jinx probably came out of the 70's or so.  No wait. Probably was employed by one of Octopussy's girls. :) On second thought, Jinx probably woulda failed out.  Maybe with Charlie's Angels she might have been a pro.There's two things I'm obsessed about.  1. Is Bond films.  Own all the movies on tape, 6 of them on dvd, have all the 90's soundtracks.  Own most of the books.  (thanx to dads old collection)  haven't read them though. I can stand most of the Bond films.  (Moonraker treads on thin ice) and 2.  Star Trek.  That I'm just getting into.I've been a Bond fan for at least a decade.  So it's fair to say I like the newest movie.  Certainly is a bit better than World is not enuf.  Seeing how Bond can salvage himself thru 14 months of torture was indeed a bit interesting.  As usual, his toys are out of this world.  Can't wait till we have invisible cars.  (it really isn't invisible)Some of the throwbacks to the older bond movies I think hinder the movie a bit.  But R takes up the slack.The soundtrack is totally awesome.  Arnold continues to bring a new face to the Bond music.  Madonna's theme song is pretty darn good too.The only thing really to complain about is of course Madonna's cameo. Totally useless.  And this coldness that's inhabited the Bond films since the last movie.7/10

These include, in no particular order, a mad currency dealer using a diamond-cutting laser, a dorky media conglomerate using well... something, and a former colleague using explosives, nuclear satellites, as well as a vixen any mortal man would be happily crushed by. However, there was one thing Bond never counted on assassination attempts from, and that is the one thing that has more or less utterly destroyed him. In a nutshell, the assassin has been the Bond producers.Things started out well in 1995 with GoldenEye. After more than six years away from the big screen, a thundering introduction and a bold, brassy theme song from Tina Turner let the whole world know that Bond was back. Unfortunately, the producers soon stepped in and introduced a certain element of stupidity. Tomorrow Never Dies featured the weakest, most laughable antagonist since Lethal Weapon 3. The fact that it also featured the most annoying, least appealing Bond girl since Carey Lowell didn't help. The World Is Not Enough was an improvement, but it could not reach the dizzying highs set by GoldenEye. And then Die Another Day, hereafter referred to as Advertise Another Day, struck.It is hard to know where to start with this latest outing. The theme song was indeed a bad sign. Although there have been some great Bond films with terrible theme songs, The Living Daylights and Licence To Kill being two prime examples, there have also been some very lousy Bond films with terrible theme songs. Pierce Brosnan should know, he was in one called Tomorrow Never Dies. But one thing I thought the Bond producers were trying for was a theme song that radiated Bond's class and total superiority to the rest of the male subspecies. Advertise Another Day's theme song might assert superiority... to the rest of the cavemen. For it really is nothing more than the music of cavemen pounding their heads (or sticks if they're really advanced) on tom drums. I don't know whose bright idea it was to allow Madonna onto the soundtrack, but they should have been summarily crucified.Then there's Halle Berry. Maybe you've heard me commenting on her before. I have a funny habit of saying that whenever I see her in the same frame as fellow X-Men star Anna Paquin, I half expect Anna to turn to her and tell her ""I earned my Oscar"". Halle does not disappoint here, turning in a performance that smacks of being convinced that just being there and black is enough. In this actor's market where there are a hundred people all lining up for one role, and many who can play the part better than those who do get it, well, let's just say it is not enough. Berry looks utterly lost trying to convince an audience that she is in a profession where deceit and stealth are requisites. This woman, put simply, could not lie straight in bed.Of course, the film is kept profitable by a series of product placements that linger just long enough to become obvious. Hence the Advertise Another Day moniker. In days gone by, the placements for airlines or wines was acceptable. However, who would have thought they'd ever see Bond flogging electric shavers? Then there is John Cleese, who, like a puppy with no bladder control, practically begs the audience to accept him as the successor to Desmond Llewelyn's Q. Even if Cleese were to put in the hard yards and last through another nineteen performances as the new weapons expert, those who seriously expected a decent performance are probably kicking themselves. Cleese has shown before that he can play other roles without reverting to Monty Python mode. Was it asking so much that he try that extraordinary feat here? I mean, really, we know the franchise has descended into a joke, but you don't have to so publicly advertise the fact. And while we are on the subject of the Q branch, perhaps it is not asking so much that the gadgets or weapons be at least vaguely plausible. An invisible car, I can accept if it is given enough setup. An invisible car that can disguise things like being accidentally tripped over, or having snow fall on it? Get real.In the end, Advertise Another Day's attempts to recapture Bond's past glories doom it. If you want to see the best of Bond, get the DVDs of GoldenEye, Licence To Kill, or From Russia With Love. There is absolutely nothing to see here. In accordance with where it puts itself, I am giving Advertise Another Day the no-man's-land score of two out of ten.",Die Another Day
105,jeremycrimsonfox,Pierce Bronson's Final 007 Movie,7,19 February 2020,"After being released from North Korean captivity via a prisoner exchange after a failed mission in the country, James Bond status as a 00 Agent is suspended as he is under suspicion of having leaked information. Escaping MI6 custody, Bond is in for another mission, as he hunts down the double agent who contacted Zao, a right hand man of the target Bond was after in North Korea, but teams up with NSA agent Giacinta ""Jinx"" Johnson when he finds conflict diamonds in a gene therapy clinic belonging to a British billionaire name Gustav Graves.The last Bond film where Pierce Brosnan plays 007, and the final one before Casino Royale rebooted the James Bond films four years later, Die Another Day is an okay movie, but it is not perfect. While Halle Berry does a good job as Jinx, and having some good action scenes (like the swordfight between Hames and Gustav at the Blades Club), the film relies too much on special effects, making some parts unrealistic, and the fact that some lines sound too silly for a serious spy film. But it's still a good, if not perfect, film.",Die Another Day
106,Joxerlives,Entertaining but you can see the flaws appear,7,24 May 2014,"'Die Another Day' is a worthwhile and enjoyable Bond film but you very much get the impression that Pierce Brosnan was right to leave the role when he did. He really had the undoubted misfortune of starting out strong with Goldeneye which was undoubtedly his best whereas Connery, Moore and Dalton all started out OK but made their best films a little later into their run. Daniel Craig seeming to prove this rule with Skyfall far surpassing its' predecessors although he still may exceed it with his next two. Still there's a great deal to like in this film, we have Bond once again dealing with very up to date problems with a divided Korea, illicit arms trading and conflict diamonds that could easily be ripped from tomorrow's news headlines. We have him captured and for once there is no escape for him, he endures horrific suffering and is eventually rescued by MI6 through a simple prisoner exchange rather than any feat of daring do. In the sex scene between him and Jinx you really do get the sense of a man who has been starved of a woman's touch and for once is desperate for it after all he has endured. Nice real espionage touches too such as MI6's sleeper agent in Havana, just waiting for the correct code phrase to bring him into action. I for one really like the Icelandic car chase, great to see a villain finally has a car to match James Bond's and the finale aboard the burning jet is nicely done. Excellent Bond girl, there was talk of a Jinx spin off film and you could easily see it (I'd mention Halle Berry's incredible beauty but it seems redundant). Strange that they went for a new character in the shape of Michael Madsen's CIA spymaster rather than bring back Wade from the previous Brosnan films?On the bad side the Iceland scenes go on far too long as does the fencing and Madonna is terrible in her extended cameo. The villain could have been intriguing, basing himself on Bond but in the end is underwhelming (although I like the father/son dynamic which is pretty unique in the series). John Cleese is wasted and the whole thing just lacks that hard edge we seek. Also dislike that we have a disfigured henchman, a Fleming cliché I find distasteful.",Die Another Day
107,Beta_Gallinger,James Bond the Power Ranger!,3,20 November 2008,"Released in 2002, this twentieth official Bond film, the last one of four starring Pierce Brosnan, marked the fortieth anniversary for the theatrical franchise, and what a way to mark that anniversary, by bringing the franchise to a new low! Before this one came a number of disappointing Bond films, and Sean Connery certainly didn't leave on a high note with 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever"", nor did Roger Moore with 1985's ""A View to a Kill"", but Brosnan, not only did he go out with the worst Bond film of the handful he appeared in, he went out with an installment in the franchise which turned out to be worse than any of its nineteen predecessors! On a mission in North Korea, James Bond is betrayed and captured! He finds himself imprisoned in the country and subjected to torture for the next fourteen months, but is then finally released in exchange for MI6 prisoner Zao! Bond is then taken to a frigate near Hong Kong, where his ailments from his fourteen months of imprisonment and torture are treated by MI6, but his 00 status is rescinded by M, as he is suspected of leaking information during those months in custody. Determined to find Zao and have his revenge, he manages to escape from this frigate and swim to shore. He then sets out on his own mission, which takes him to several different places all over the world! He meets an NSA agent known as Jinx, and his quest to track down Zao leads him to British billionaire Gustav Graves, who has created a device which can cause a lot of destruction using solar energy!Bond is captured in North Korea towards the end of the pre-title sequence, and during the title sequence, it shows the usual kind of montage, only this time with some torture scenes! Yes, there are previous films where Bond is captured and roughed up, but never tortured for fourteen months, looking a lot like Jesus about to be crucified by the end! Some praise the film for this part, but it didn't do much to me, other than give me bad feelings! Moving on, the action sequences tend to be ridiculous (more so than ever before, I think), and often seem to resemble Power Rangers action sequences! The one where Bond is in a fight and has to avoid a laser beam is definitely a part which reminded me of Power Rangers (it was even filmed on a Power Rangers-like set), but it's certainly not the only one! I would say another example is the absurd action sequences involving ice and water! Some of the action is unintentionally mildly amusing, but not usually. Those action sequences aren't the only thing that makes the film resemble Power Rangers. The special effects can be ridiculous as well (at least for James Bond), including the electric shocks with lightning bolt effects, which also reminded me of Power Rangers! Also, Halle Berry can act, but is not very impressive here as Jinx at all, and the script can be quite poor as well. Lastly, while the romantic scenes obviously don't resemble anything from Power Rangers, some of them may sink the film further!Some may consider ""Die Another Day"" self-parodying, the same goes for certain other Bond films, and I'm not going to contradict those people (at least not those who describe this particular installment as such), but I think this film is worse than a self-parody! To me, it's more like a cross between a self-parody, and, you guessed it, Power Rangers! Not all nineteen official Bond films that were made during the 20th Century are that good, but all of them are better than this 2002 release, the first Bond film of the 21st Century! I think the only positive thing I can say about this film is that it features another rather humorous scene with Bond and Q (played by John Cleese this time, it's hard to imagine him in a film like this), but this certainly isn't the funniest Bond/Q scene in the franchise, and is FAR from enough to make up for the vast majority of this shockingly bad Bond film! Pierce Brosnan made a decent James Bond, and it's a shame this is how he had to finish!",Die Another Day
108,vip_ebriega,A second look: DIE ANOTHER DAY,7,14 May 2008,"My Take: After a second look, this over-the-top 007 entry/tribute is good, brainless fun. DIE ANOTHER DAY, the 20th entry in the long-running Bond film series, which is also the 40th anniversary entry in the series. And to celebrate 40 years of ""Bond, James Bond"", there are many goodies in tradition to the classic Bonds from the past, including cameos of Q's old gadgets (from previous Bond films) as well as references featured in the screenplay, and so much more. This is also Pierce Brosnan's 4th time in the role as Agent 007, and he's still very good. The story, however, is still the same after 40 years. An evil maniac wants to rule the world the same way other Bond villains like Blofeld and Dr. No, but the new baddie, Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens), isn't quite as memorable.When I first watched DIE ANOTHER DAY, I didn't like perhaps because it wasn't the Bond I knew as I watched all the previous entries. But after a second look, DIE ANOTHER DAY is a misunderstood entry in the series. It ain't the Bond I knew, but still, although not a great or highly memorable entry in the long-running series, it's still a very worthy effort, and the stunts and action scenes still kick. As said, the plot concerns Bond try to thwart the plans of a megalomaniac and save the world. But not without getting a few girls in bed. This time, one of these sultry females include Jynx (Halle Berry), an agent with her own agenda (but Bond discovers they have so much in common)who has a real ""thrust"" in Bond's ""Big Bang Theory"", then there's Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike), a sexy femme fatale.Judi Dench is back as M, competent as ever, and John Cleese is the new Q, replacing the late great Desmond Llewellyn, and he's a very good replacement, with humor intact as well as his verbal spar when it comes to Bond's biting sense of sarcasm. Other villains include the frosty killer agent called Zao (Rick Yune) and Michael Madsen in a cameo and Samantha Bond returns as Moneypenny, her fourth time out since GOLDENEYE. The new director this time is Lee Tamahori (THE EDGE), probably retaliating after films like XXX (after which he will be responsible for a sequel called XXX: STATE OF UNION). DIE ANOTHER DAY is pretty much like XXX rather than its predecessors, with overabundance of CG stunts that defy reality and are completely unbelievable. The script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade is a throwback to the famous Bond plot, and could have dedicated with a stronger one.Still, if you take it less seriously and with different expectations, DIE ANOTHER DAY is still pretty worthy to be called a 007 flick, even if it is a slightly distant cousin.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Die Another Day
109,one9eighty,Looking cleverer than it is,5,28 September 2020,"In a nutshell:
Tortured and bruised, Bond is on a mission that sees travel to North Korea to investigate a diamond mogul who is secretly building a space weapon that could have troubling consequences for the world.A bit more detail:
While on a mission to infiltrate a North Korean/African weapons for diamonds exchange, things do not go as planned. One of his targets, Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is killed, and Bond is captured. After being tortured by the North Korean People's Army for over a year Bond is traded back to MI6 in exchange for Colonel Sun's old right-hand man, Tang Lin Zao. Bond is stripped of his double-o 'license to kill' status on the grounds of leaking information during his torture - he's convinced however that he didn't and that he's been set up. He escapes MI6 and begins his search for information to clear himself, which he might get by hunting down Zao. While tracking him, Bond crosses paths with an American agent, Jinx Johnson who happens to be following a similar path to what Bond is on. Together they discover a gene therapy clinic that can alter people's appearance using DNA restructuring. It is here, while confronting Zao that Bond finds evidence linking him to a new wealthy diamond mogul called Gustav Graves. Graves already happens to be under investigation by Miranda Frost, who is posing as his assistant. Bond gets himself an invite to Graves' Icelandic facility. While he is 'pumping' Miranda Frost for information, Jinx gets herself captured. Bond learns some startling truths about Frost and Graves to suggest that they aren't all who they appear to be. Bond also learns of the existence of a space laser, which he must elude if he is going to continue his mission. Thus, begins the race to stop Graves from using his space laser and starting World War 3.Review:
Kiwi, Lee Tamahori comes to this film with titles like ""Once Were Warriors"" (1994), ""Mulholland Falls"" (1996), and ""Along Came a Spider"" (2001) under his belt. He was given a large budget to work with and plenty of top talent who had already cut themselves in the Bond franchise world. Unfortunately, this is one of the less memorable Bond films or at worst, memorable for the wrong reasons. I do not blame the director completely, I think there is some blame that he needs accountable for, but it's mainly for not stopping some ideas to be included. With this being a 40th anniversary, somebody, probably the producers, thought it would be a good idea to pay homage to every Bond film that went before it. Therefore, references to all the films, gadgets, and vehicles feature throughout the runtime this film brings. I found that the more they were shoehorned in - the cringier this film became. The director, the writers, production staff - somebody should have stood up and said, ""this may be nostalgic, but let's look forward instead of swoon for what went before this"". Sadly, nobody did.Rather than it just being the shoehorned relics that let this film down, there are other factors too. The plot and the villain were unoriginal... I mean, come on... a giant space laser??? That might as well be straight from an Austin Powers movie. The script was poor with terrible dialogue scattered throughout. Hearing Halle Berry say ""Yo Mamma!"" or ""Read this, b**ch!"" was supposed to be edgy and cool, it ended up being embarrassing. Speaking of embarrassing, let us consider the CGI for a moment because there is an awful lot in this, and only a little bit of it is credible. The CGI in this film has been voted the worst CGI in some of the circles that I am part of as a film fan and reviewer. Not the worst in a Bond film... the worst CGI in blockbuster films. If you thought that the ""Scorpion King"" was a bad example of CGI, take a look at Bond tsunami surfing after a giant laser burned off some of Iceland. From the moment Graves is in his lair planning to press the fire button on his laser, to the moment Bond lands completely dry and stress-free - the whole thig looks like it was done on a computer in the 80's. In addition, there are scenes that are supposed to be outdoors, but clearly look like they are created in a studio - what happened to the money?? Where did the additional money from the vast amount of product placement go?? Something else that crosses into the realm of CGI in this film are Bond's gadgets, in particularly the invisible car - yes, you did read that right - there is an invisible car. The Bond films which were closer to realism were the ones which were better received by fans and critics - whoever decided to add an invisible car obviously did not take this into consideration. The idea is stupid, and the delivery of it... well the effects used make it turn invisible look like a cross between the fighting forcefields in ""Dune"" (1984) and ""Tron"" (1982).At times this film becomes a tick box exercise trying to cram in as many things that 'fans' would expect to see in a Bond film - despite researching what fans have actually claimed to want from previous films. It could have been so much more original using the 40th anniversary as an excuse to reinvent some new traditions rather than focus on old ones.Despite my feelings on this film (if they aren't clear; I was not that impressed with the film and consider this to be one of my least favourite ones in the franchise), this 12 -rated film is at least a little fun and mostly watchable. It does not have much of a brain and does not treat it's audience like they have much of one either so do not expect to feel engaged or affected - it's more so a lot of loud noises and big explosions. You do not need to have seen the entire franchise to watch this film. It is not too complex; the themes and content are not too adult that I could not put younger viewers in front of it. With a decent amount of action and plenty of nostalgia it should be good for the older audience members too.In terms of Bond films this is a 6 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 5 out of 10.",Die Another Day
110,jhclues,"The Best ""Brosnan"" Bond Yet",10,28 November 2002,"James Bond aficionados will be delighted to hear that 007 is not only back, but with renewed vigor, a great new villain who wants to dominate the world (surprise!), lots of gadgets, girls and Action! a-plenty, in `Die Another Day,' directed by Lee Tamahori.  Pierce Brosnan suits up for the fourth time as Secret Agent Man, joined this time around by a lady named Jinx (Halle Berry), who is not only beautiful but demonstrates early on that she can definitely take care of herself; a decidedly capable match for Mr. James Bond.  But whose side is she on, anyway?The film opens with 007 insinuating himself into an operation transpiring in North Korea, where a certain Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee) is attempting to negotiate a deal to buy South African diamonds in exchange for weapons.  Our man Bond, of course, has replaced the contact and holds the briefcase containing the loot.  As expected, the enterprise quickly deteriorates into an explosive situation, and from that point on the action never stops.Working from a story and screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who also teamed for 1999's `The World Is Not Enough,' along with Bruce Feirstein), director Tamahori digs deep into the All-Things-Bond box to make this James Bond film...well... everything a James Bond film should be, from the fast paced action (it goes without saying) to the snappy repartee rife with bons mots and double-entendre (at which Berry/Jinx also proves to be a match for Brosnan/Bond) to one of the best `henchmen' (Zao, played terrifically by Rick Yun) since Goldfinger's Oddjob.  There is also a touch of nostalgia thrown in for good measure:  As Q (John Cleese) gives his dissertation on the latest gadgets, Bond casually ferrets through the Quartermaster's cache and comes across the lethal shoe that once belonged to Rosa Klebb, as well as a signature item from `Thunderball.'  It's a nice touch that perhaps for the first time tangibly links forty years of `Bond' history together and goes far in dispelling the quite noticeable changing incarnations of 007 over the years; finally, rather than naturally, if subconsciously, categorizing the character into a Connery/Bond, Moore/Bond, Lazenby/Bond, Dalton/Bond or Brosnan/Bond, he's just `Bond.'  James Bond.Visually, this one has a lot to offer, with some extravagant sets, a memorable sword fight and special F/X that are, for the most part, top notch.  There is one scene near the end (suffice to say involving a lot of water and some huge waves) in which the F/X seem to dip somewhat below par and actually take on an almost `60s' look (intentional, perhaps, as an homage that would be in keeping with the rest of the film's nod to `Bond' history?) but overall it's a quality production, and the cinematography (by David Tattersall, who also did `Star Wars, Episodes I & II') is brilliant.If ever an actor was meant to play a specific role, it's Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  From his initial outing as 007 (in 1995's `GoldenEye') he's been a perfect fit, but here he seems to have at last actually settled into the part and made it his own, in a way that Moore, Lazenby and Dalton (for all the individual and unique strengths they brought to their respective portrayals of Bond) were, even at their best, never able to achieve. Brosnan credibly brings Ian Fleming's unflappable, stalwart hero to life with seemingly effortless aplomb, striking a chord in which the seriousness and the levity that defines the character mesh perfectly (Moore, on the other hand, played up the lightness too often, almost into parody at times; Dalton was altogether too serious; Lazenby was simply an anomaly).  Simply put, Brosnan has all of the qualities that personify James Bond, and he uses them all to the utmost effectiveness.Following up her Oscar winning portrayal of Leticia Musgrove in 2001's `Monster's Ball,' Halle Berry, meanwhile, makes her mark as arguably one of the finest `Bond Girls' since Honor Blackman's performance as `Ms.' Galore in `Goldfinger' in 1964.  She definitely makes one of the most memorable first entrances from among the rank and file of the Bond Beauties; emerging from the sea in an orange two-piece suit she looks absolutely stunning, calling to mind Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in 1962's `Dr. No.' Pulchritude aside, however, Berry most importantly makes her character believable, which in no small part lends the necessary support to the anticipated outlandishness of the fiction.  The one female in a recurring role who has yet to be given her due as a `Bond Girl,' is a consummate actor who has added significantly to the Bond legacy with her portrayal of `M.'  Dame Judi Dench came on board along with Brosnan in `GoldenEye,' empowering women everywhere by taking on a highly visible role of absolute authority, albeit fictional, and helping to revitalize the `Bond' series.  Casting her as Bond's superior was a stroke of genius, and the way Dench took over the role and made it her own should at last be acknowledged.  She is, without question, a big part of the renewed strength of the `Bond' of the new millennium.Making her motion picture debut here, Rosamund Pike also adds her name to the roster as Miranda Frost, but though she adds beauty and poise to the film, she is less than charismatic and her performance lacks the kind of spunk that would have made her character more than just adequate.  Still, it would be hard for any actor to get a toehold playing against the radiant Halle Berry, and on a positive note, Pike does lend a decided elegance to the role.As Bond's nemesis, Gustav Graves, Toby Stephens gives an energetic performance and carves out a niche for himself in the annals of Bond bad guys; and with a physical oddity sustained in the opening sequence of the film, Yune makes a lasting impression as Zao.  In the final analysis, `Die Another Day' is the best `Brosnan' Bond yet.",Die Another Day
111,Stampsfightclub,Under-appreciated thriller with best Bond girl of Brosnan era,8,2 November 2008,"James Bond (Brosnan) is being tortured in Korea until one day he is traded for terrorist Zao (Yune). On a mission to track him down again, Bond finds himself involved in the diamond market.3 years after 'The World is not enough' Pierce Brosnan made an eagerly anticipated return as the secret agent and gives another good performance in an under-appreciated action thriller. Brosnan, Berry, Stephens, Pike, Yune and Dench have all cemented their roles into the plot with good performances, especially Rosamund Pike (Pride and Prejudice) who is easily the best Bond girl of the Brosnan era. Her cold heartedness and hard to get approach is similar to that of Sophie Marceau's Electra in the previous Bond and is hailed as one of the best actresses to grace the Bond screen.Brosnan, though again good, doesn't quite have that sophistication and energy that he had in his previous 3 roles as Bond. There is less humour from his side ad the upbeat positivity has disappeared, which is down to the plot.From the get go Die another day looked to be on its way to making another landmark in the Bond era with 007 undercover at a terrorist diamond smuggling in Korea. The hovercraft sequences are superbly directed and fulfil the uses and gratifications for the action viewer. The film then precedes and Bond is held captive in the Korean's camp, being punished as Madonna's terrible theme tune roles on. The title sequence is diverse by the credits rolling as the film carries on and we see a vulnerable side to the British agent as he is cruelly tortured. This sets the tone for revenge and an exciting prospect. However the film tends to lose itself in its political agenda half way through and the weight of information feels awfully heavy for what should be a fairly simple idea of revenge. The confusion continues with the identity of certain characters and from nowhere a space satellite appears, a strange ingredient considering the opening revolved around diamonds and weapons.Bare with the film as you will see one of the best Bond cars to date, an invisible one! There aren't many other gadgets which is slightly disappointing. The action sequences are true adrenaline mayhem with Tamahori excellent in producing the ultimate rush. A helicopter, planes, boats, hovercrafts and fighting there is no let up and is true excitement.With its exciting action sequences, a strong villain and two very attractive and action styled Bond girls, it's a wonder why Die another Day isn't praised enough by its fans",Die Another Day
112,adamscastlevania2,"Not a good effort, but still fun to watch",7,28 August 2014,"(61%) After watching this again I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's by far not the best Bond ever, the over-use of sci-fi trickery is a joke, and there's nothing new or insightful anywhere, but it's just so damn fun. The opening quarter is actually pretty good, with a great over- the-top hover chase, and Bond getting locked up and beaten in a north Korean prison for 14 months adding some weight and quite a level of bite to the production that you don't always get with Bond flicks. The movie does soften up a lot after though as this could be considered the most cartoonish Bond movie to date, with its fun nutty bad guys, and very outlandish set-pieces. As a Bond movie this is quite poor in expanding the series for the future, but as a fun, entertaining action movie that makes 2+ hours just fly by I think this is somewhat overlooked, I know this because overlooked it myself.",Die Another Day
113,gbheron,Another Good Pierce Brosnan Bond,8,17 April 2003,"Put another win in Pierce Brosnan's column. Again, Pierce reprises James Bond, and he and the filmmakers deliver another entertaining Bond film. Set in locales all over the globe, it starts in North Korea where Bond is captured while attempting an assassination. After 18 months of filth and torture in a North Korean prison, he is released, but as a disgraced agent, now held in custody by British intelligence for revealing secrets under torture. He escapes, and while proving his innocence, the movie leaps to Hong Kong, London, and Cuba before ending in Iceland. There's a plot about a massive killer satellite, Halle Barry as a rival agent and love interest, gadgets galore, and some of the best bad guys to grace a Bond film.
My only complaints are two and minor. First, there are a few too many gadgets; I wish Bond would rely more good old spycraft. And secondly, the locales and sub-plots are better early in the movie. By the time of the final showdown at the Ice Palace in Iceland, the action is getting a little too close to 'over the top'.

114,jon.h.ochiai,Promising Start...,7,12 December 2002,"Lee Tamahori's ""Die Another"" starts off as one of the most interesting James Bond movies in a long time. Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is undercover for an arms deal in North Korea, when his cover is blown. The unspeakable happens-- Bond is captured and tortured for 14 month. This is depicted through the opening credits. Bond is released through a political prisoner exchange for Zao (Rick Yune). However, Bond returns as an outcast. Even M (Judi Dench) tells him that he is a liability-- she can't be certain that he revealed information that lead the deaths of other operatives. Bond must find the ones who betrayed him. From this point on Neal Purvis's and Robert Wade's script slides back into formula which is disappointing given the promising start. Pierce Brosnan as Bond brings his game. He is intense and displaying more of a darker edge to Bond. He is great. The rest of the movie is not as good. Halle Berry as Jinx is all right, though her character is not at all captivating. How she will succeed as a spin-off character remains to seen. Berry is stunning and a good actress, but an action star she is not. Rosamund Pike as the icy Miranda Frost fairs much better as the possible femme fa tale. Toby Stephens as villain Gustav Graves is a formidable opponent for Bond, and is charismatic. This Bond outing has great action sequences including the amazing opening surfing sequence. Too bad this Bond does not deliver on the interesting story premise. It's shaken... but not stirred.",Die Another Day

I still think Ursula Andress looked better in a bikini. The plot was bizarre to the nth degree. John Cleese was annoying as the new Q. I would add more It would take way to long.

116,stamper,Jinxed,6,24 February 2003,"Big explosions, foxy ladies, one-liners and loads of sexually tinted conversation: It must be a James Bond film!' and indeed it is. But the fact is, that although this film has everything a James Bond film needs to make it a James Bond film it lacks almost everything to make it a good one. It needs heart, it needs inspiration and it needs other writers. The story of this film is a typical James Bond one and although I cannot ruin anything for you by telling it, I'll refrain from it. 
On the positive side,  I have to mention, that all of the main characters (Q, M, Moneypenny and Bond) are in good shape. They are as convincing as ever and sometimes (I mean Bond with this) even as funny as ever. John Cleese (Q) makes a great debut' as Desmond Llewelyn's replacement and I hate to say it, makes it seem as though there never was another Q. But enough of Q, what about Bond? Well Bond is convincing, although his sexually tinted one-liners could need some work. I do not blame Brosnan for this (I blame the writers), but in this film I had the impression that some phrases came out more or less involuntarily, almost automatic. The one-liners are there because they belong in a Bond film, not because they are any good or because they work (not all one-liners strike out mind you!). Another thing that I thought really stunk and for which I also blame the writers (spoilers ahead) was the: Your mama!' phrase uttered by Jinx (Halle Berry). WHAT A CLICHÉ!!! I think they'd never have a white person say this. (spoilers end) Other than that, Mrs. Berry did a pretty decent job, but an own spy series? Heck no! She wasn't that good, actually she wasn't better than the average Bond bimbo'. Giving her an own series then would not be a result of her great' performance as Jinx but a result of the previously won Oscar. From Wow. Oscar winner Halle Berry is in the new bond!' to Who the hell is Rosamund Pike???'. Well I don't know, but I sure as hell know she was good and easily the best new face in this Bond film. She easily outperformed the not too scary bad guy (Toby Stephens) as well as the henchman (Rick Yune) who I must say did a decent job and was even scarier than his boss. Talking about new faces. Madonna was in the film as a sexy fencing instructor. (spoilers ahead) Too bad she didn't get Bondified, it could have been wild. I know for certain that in the old days Bond would never have let her get away without him having his way with her. But what can I say, he was rather out of shape after 14 months (spoilers end).
Having told you all about the characters and the actors I really have to say some things about the rest of the film. The intro was really good as well as the title track by Madonna (which I hated if played on radio), which fit nicely into the film. The following hour of the film managed to hang on to the intro and was pretty good, but it was the second hour of the film, that really started  to get me bored, for it got more and more unbelievable as the film went on. With the increasingly overdone action sequences, the excitement and interest I had in this film faded and the only reasons this film gets more than a five, are the entertainment value of the first hour and the pretty funny ending (aside from the Berry / Brosnan stuff). 6 out of 10",Die Another Day

It's a classic bikini movie moment just like the original classic scene it pays homage with Ursula Andress in that amazing white two-piece from Dr. No! They're both classic! Pierce Brosnan plays a great Bond!While it is true that Die Another Day does steer away from the early slick and charming Bond motive, even outright abandons it, it realizes it's not a brilliant Bond spy escapade like the originals and doesn't try to be. It delivers spectacular and simple straightforward entertainment that's well done. More mainstream? Yes. Less intelligent? Not really. For better or for worse, you must love Die Another Day's faithful attempt to stay true to itself.I love Die Another Day! It's smart, sexy, cool entertainment. It has stunning visuals, sophisticated action, and plenty of top secret gadgets. Brosnan and Berry are the stars.

118,The_Movie_Cat,`From nothing to everything in no time at all.',5,6 March 2004,"Wow, the critics really had the knives out for this one, didn't they? James Bond's fortieth anniversary and the best reviews he gets are lukewarm.Some of the criticisms are redundant, too, with many centred around Madonna who also got the panned/tolerated theme tune. I mean, how long is she on screen for? Two minutes max? She's not the best actress in the world, but I didn't really think her cameo here was at all bad, and her song was a vibrant experiment while also keeping the Bond ethos.You know though, I now dread reviewing Bond films after only one sitting. I posted a review once saying Never Say Never Again was halfway decent (seen a second time, it's the worst ever made) and that The World Is Not Enough was ""the best Bond film of the last ten years"" (it's merely mediocre). Thankfully I held back before posting reviews of A View to a Kill (it's not just bad, but really bad) and The Man With The Golden Gun, which I initially thought was dreadful, but is actually kitsch genius. I mention this last movie because that's what Die Another Day reminded me of most: it's Brosnan's Golden Gun.I don't normally warm to his surface take on the character, but here Pierce's humour comes out a lot more (""saved by the bell"" is a Bond pun classic) and he's far more accessible as a result. Sure, people can complain that this is a series of noisy, vacuous set pieces thrown together in something roughly approximating a story, which is a perfectly valid argument. But this is a Bond film for God's sake, what did you expect? So it is that a man can outrun half the North Korean army on a hoverboat, walk out of hospital after a near-fatal cardiac arrest, knock a man unconscious for several minutes with a single punch and shag Halle Berry after just a few corny chat-up lines. (On this last note, this contains Bond's raciest sex scene yet, and, with ""that's a bit of a mouthful"", its rudest double entredre).David Arnold's incidental music still feels incongruous in Bond, though this is nothing compared to them splicing a pop song (""London Calling"" by The Clash) into the middle of events. It's a shame that when Bond was banging the slightly wooden Rosamund Pike on that crystal cygnet bed they didn't break into a rendition of T. Rex and Ride A White Swan. There's also an upped ante on the level of violence, with Pike and Berry's inevitable girl fight avoiding sapphic inference in favour of Berry kicking a knife through her heart.Things do start to get a little shaky around the halfway mark, as they do with all Bond films when the initial impetus has begun to die down. The Q scene is the unfunniest yet, though the ""invisible car"" is nowhere near as stupid as it sounds. (It's not actually invisible, it's just miniature cameras projecting a false image to the beholder - shame they didn't still half-work when the system is later damaged by gunfire though, that would have been a nice touch). A friend of mine asked why they didn't just use the technology to make Bond himself invisible, but let's not get into that...If I hadn't seen this film after reading poor reviews, making me want to see the virtues of it, then I'd probably be slating it too. The gradual usage of cheap puns by seemingly every cast member quickly palls, and the lack of anything approaching a storyline is unsettling. Lee Tamahori's direction is good if a little gimmicky, while the increasing reliance on computer effects - not to mention that rubbish toy model of the falling ice plane, a real Benny Hill moment - disturbs. In the old days all Bond's enemies used to have some form of disability to make them, in highly dubious subtexts, more noticeably ""evil"". Here Bond actually mutilates his enemies for him, exploding a bomb in a box full of hard diamonds, and then blasting away with machine guns.This is no great James Bond movie, and there's very little, if anything, that had the feel of a series highlight. The reason why this one was so perfect for a seen-only-once review is that that's the audience it was made for. The popcorn crowd at the multiplex, who want a bit more romanticism than the latest Vin Diesel flick; not the 007 devotee who's going to add this to his DVD collection. I did enjoy this film as throwaway, disposable entertainment, though I won't particularly care if I never saw it again. But surely that's the point of a film anyway? The box office first weekend takings, the cinematic experience? Watching them multiple times and actually hearing lines good enough to remember is not the issue. This has nothing to match the iconographic nature of the Connery Bonds, the better Roger Moore entries, or even the better moments of the shaky Lazenby affair. And unlike Timothy Dalton, who must surely be due a reappraisal any year now, I doubt the Bond lovers of the future will be looking back on this one as a series highpoint, a claim that can be levelled against any of Pierce's excursions. Interestingly, on his DVD commentary track he claims that a man could be ahead of his game if he manages to make one classic in ""four, five, six"" Bond movies. Still two attempts to go then eh, Pierce? Or are the rumours of his retirement true this time?This is full of homages to the nineteen previous 007 movies (you know, the ones where at least a dozen were better than this?) and I do miss the presence of even a vague story if I'm honest. James Bond as dumb action-adventure was something it managed to flirt with, but never embrace. And the rudimentary villains have even less motivation or characterisation than usual, Gustav Graves coming straight out of a comicbook. As stated, this is okay but no great. But with the first half of the movie breaking new ground and taking Bond into previously unexplored areas, by steering it back into formula territory it feels like the biggest wasted opportunity in the franchise's history...",Die Another Day

The stunts were not exhilarating either except for the car chase/battle between Zhao and Bond and the virtual reality training program. Those were exciting.

All quite ludicrous and not down to earth plot features.However, there are some genuinely good moments in the film.

127,timdalton007,The Weakest Of The Brosnan Bond's,4,29 August 2012,"With 1999's The World Is Not Enough seeing James Bond out of the twentieth century, plans were quickly afoot for the film that would see him enter the twenty first with a bang. That film would also be released in time for the series' fortieth anniversary in 2002. That film would be Die Another Day, which also Pierce Brosnan return for the fourth (and, ultimately, final) time as 007. The film was set to be an anniversary celebration of the series' legacy as well as the exciting way forward. Now, nearly a decade on from its release, the question is just how successful was it on both counts? Let's start by examining Pierce Brosnan's final performance as Bond. After the somewhat harder edged Bond of the previous film, viewers would surely be expecting much of the same. To a certain extent, Brosnan and the film deliver just that. The film's first twenty minutes or so see a Bond behind enemy lines, betrayed, captured, tortured and eventually handed back over to his own side that doesn't trust him anymore. For these opening minutes, and indeed the film's first hour, Brosnan shines even when the rest of the film isn't (more on that later). The second hour of the film feels like Brosnan, like Connery and Moore before him, simply going through the motions to earn a paycheck. It's a shame as Brosnan shows he clearly could have been better in his last outing.The rest of the cast though are mixed to say the least. Take Halle Berry as Jinx, the NSA agent turned Bond girl, for example. Both her performance and the writing feels like a walking, talking cliché of the ""tough but sexy"" woman stereotype seen in countless films. It also doesn't help that Berry, despite winning an Oscar in the middle of filming, can't deliver a single one of her clichéd lines in a fashion that isn't cringe worthy. Much the same can also be said of Toby Stephens as Gustav Graves and Will Yun Lee as Colonel Moon. All of these characters come across as little more than clichés and caricatures, something made even worse by most of their counterparts in the other Brosnan films.The supporting cast isn't much better. One can through the characters and spot characters better done in other Bond films be it Rick Yune as Zao, Emilio Echevarría as Raoul, Michael Gorevoy as Vlad or Michael Madsen as Damian Falco who is little more than a clichéd, gung-ho American. There are some bright spots such as Rosamund Pike who absolutely shines as Miranda Frost, playing what is frankly the best role in the film that isn't Bond, Judi Dench's M and John Cleese making what would sadly turn out to be his only appearance as Q. The cast overall then is mainly disappointing.What about the rest of the film then? Well production value wise, the film is mixed as well. Peter Lamont's production design work is up to his usual standards ranging through the film's various locations including North Korea, Cuba, London and Iceland. The editing of Christian Wagner is a major problem however due to an editing style that tries to bring a radical change in Bond film editing (including ""speed ramping"" at what can only be described as odd and random moments) with results that damage the film's pacing. That is only the start of the film's issues.The film's action sequences are another issue. Some of the problem is down to Wagner's editing (especially in the car chase and climatic plane based fights in the climax). The big problem is that they feel stale. The surfing sequence in the film's teaser lacks any kind of danger or tension while the big hovercraft chase that follows it feels derivative of the boat chase that opened the previous film. Derivative is the word that also describes the other two aforementioned action sequences as well as both have had variations done far better in other Bond films. That's also without mentioning the oft-ridiculed CGI iceberg surfing sequence either which is exactly as bad as its reputation suggests. Oddly enough the film's best action sequence, the sword fight that comes midway through, is the one that is done the most traditionally and the most effectively. It seems sad that a sword fight, arguably one of the biggest action film clichés, feels the most original amongst more complex, and ultimately derivative, sequences.Derivative is also the word that best describes the film's script as well. The film's various plot points (diamonds, villain's changing identities, Bond going rogue to get revenge, etc.) all have the feeling of having been just torn at random from other Bond films and then clued together to make a plot. For the first hour or so, the film gets away with it for the most part. Once Bond, and indeed the film, goes to Iceland though, the film becomes little more than a series of Bond film clichés stuck together. It also doesn't help that perhaps the biggest plot twists of the film are given away not by Bond but by bad writing and editing. The script also isn't helped by the fact that it is filled with the worst one liners in a Bond film post-Moore era. In fact, it's the weakest script the series has had since A View To A Kill.Where does all this leave Die Another Day, both as Brosnan's last Bond film and as a celebration of the Bond legacy? Between its various faults, this is the weakest of Brosnan's Bond films by far. As a celebration of the first four decades of 007's film adventures, this much is clear: the film is indeed embracing the series' legacy but doing so with all the wrong elements. While this isn't the worst Bond film by any means, it is clearly apparent why many felt that a change was in order. And indeed change was coming",Die Another Day

129,sashank_kini-1,Bond Jinxed,5,26 March 2011,".  The most memorable part is the fencing match gone awry. The most regrettable: the movie gone awry. The sword duel extending to the courtyard draws the viewers attention for the very reason that keeps ones heart pacing with exhilaration. The gratuitously obnoxious CGI militate the charm of Bond movies. Apart from the overused solar beam which doesn't make the viewer's heart skip a beat (partly because of Pierce's deadpan face during the chase, the invisible car is redundant and pandering to the box office frenzy and Halle makes no impact. Madonna's song is catchy; I mistook her voice for Britney's when I first heard the number. Her appearance, on the other hand, falls flat. The risqué humor and double meaning gags gagged me repeatedly with irritation. The fencing joke, the cock-fight (with emphasis on the first word) and several other puns made my head throb, and with the bounteous CGI, I took a nirvana till the very end where there is a fist fight between the men and a sword battle amongst the ladies. The story never gripped me, nor did it try. It really blew the CGI out of proportion and was aiming for the gadget mongering masses. I sense ten teenagers chorusing 'Whoooh!' in unison when Bond drives the fruity car to the ice mansion with a view to defeat his foe. All I wanted was car sequences, tussles and bit of flirtation between Bond and the girls. unfortunately here they decide to vamp it up. So we have avant-garde gadgetry blazing all over. Halle didn't seem  confident and ready enough to play a Bond girl. I don't remember most of her scenes though she does take quite some screen time. The other girl pulls of well as the female Judas. The nemesis here begins well as the malevolent entrepreneur who turns our to be someone else, but end up being a power-crazy caricature with poor punchlines.   Pierce, at last, is jinxed in the movie as he conveys not much except that he has a striking countenance. I preferred Daniel who was so brooding and slightly perky as Bond. He's too straight-jacket in his approach. A suave, impulsive middle-aged man who gets the ladies and quashes the enemies.All in all, a disappointing output with an impressive start, a dwindling end and a blink and miss Madonna. 5 out of 10.",Die Another Day
130,Bogmeister,BOND#20: Not Just Another Day for 007,8,8 August 2007,"MASTER PLAN: begin another Korean War using an orbiting super laser powered by the sun. I was going to vote lower on this off-kilter Bonder (recalling the problems of ""License to Kill"") until I viewed it again. Despite its problematic nature, this one has such moments of invigoration, of daring, that I have to give credit where it's due. Things veer into non-Bondian territory at the end of the customary teaser, the point at which Bond usually effects some great escape - in other words, he wins. Not here. He's captured, in North Korea, and the disturbing credits, not aided by an annoying staccato song by Madonna, represent over a year of his imprisonment & torture at the hands of his sadistic captors (the filmmakers even include a female jailer, further suggesting the payback that the womanizing Bond should receive by females during most of the Brosnan Bonders). I can accept Bond being captured - it's happened before; but, I'm used to seeing him break free within a week, not stay the helpless captive. As M said in the previous film (""The World is Not Enough""), this will not stand. I suppose this plot point was included for shock effect, to differentiate it as a 40th-anniversary Bonder, and help facilitate the story of what Bond's foe was doing in the meantime - but this last reason was unnecessary: Bond could have been on other missions while 'Mr.G.Graves' was establishing himself. Furthermore, the coldness of MI6 & M is taken to new degrees here: after Bond is finally free (remember, after over a year!), M merely suggests it may have been better had he continued being tortured and that he is useless now. Way to go with the morale-boosting, M; maybe she was purposely making him angry.And that's where the positive aspects begin. This is Brosnan's best turn at Bond. He had 3 Bonders under his belt by now and seems more seasoned, more hardened (a prison term will do that to you), and just plain tougher; he even reminded me of Connery in a couple of scenes. He's frustrated, feels betrayed, but will not give up. His early scenes with the beard and long hair may be off-putting, but even these recall Connery's role in ""The Rock,"" as an agent who had been imprisoned for many years. Against the odds, Brosnan still suggests Bond here, especially when he strolls into that hotel in Hong Kong, a ragamuffin with the demeanor of a duke. The tone suggests rebirth, but not a new direction; in fact, the rest of the film is a blatant redo of most previous Bond films - yes, the homages. The sequence with the new Q (Cleese) and the new invisible car seems a bit forced (lessee, how do we top the old Aston Martin stuff?), but I did replay the scene with all the old gadgets in storage; this is what Bond fans live for, one can't deny it. After some standard espionage in Havana and meeting the latest Bond girl (Berry), much of the story takes place in Iceland, in an ice palace, and where there's lots of ice, everywhere. Visually, it's striking, though the overuse of digital FX, involving icebergs and huge waves, thrusts it into unfamiliar terrain again, no matter how impressive. There's a tiresome chase between two autos in the palace which goes on way too long.The climactic fighting on the airplane is adrenaline-charged and we don't get bored, but it's a bit too much: a lot of sound and fury, not really signifying much. I do have to give some props to actress Pike, who starts out as a demure agent in a very secondary role, but transforms into an exciting femme fatale out of some grand adventure by the time of her final scenes, complete with sword and outfit. She kind of outshines Berry here. Stephens as the main villain and Yune as his henchman, Zao, are less impressive, though both give solid performances, and at least their demises are fairly well done. With all the homages mixed in (the most famous being Berry's bathing suit in her first scene), the line between homage and rip-off becomes blurred. The primary menace, the use of a death ray from orbit, simply reruns the threat unveiled by Blofeld in ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" even if the FX are a bit better. But, there is some resonance in the mixing of hot and cold images throughout, suggesting a chaotic universe - which is Bond. I was most intrigued by the notion of a double agent in MI6, the one who betrayed Bond; this lent some suspense to the whole deal. Brosnan could have returned once more; though he'd be over 50, he looked good for his age and might have done another Bond film in 2004. But, this didn't happen.

And many more on this version of James Bond.For his fourth outing as James Bond, Pierce Brosnan shows us that he can be strong as Bond. This time, Bond is captured in Korea and tortured for 14 months. He gets released in exchange for a traitor, Zao (Rick Yune). He meets up with Jinx, played by Halle Berry. The two go off to Iceland to track a terrorist, Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). Exotic locations and non-stop action ensue.Not being a gigantic Bond fan (love the Goldeneye video game but only have seen one other film), I can't really compare this to others. The action was almost non-stop with fun to spare. The special FX didn't really seem that visible compared to most blockbusters. The invisible car seemed ""stolen"" from I Spy, but it was probably the other way around. Bond got some pretty cool gadgets to work with, including a glass-shattering ring and the invisible Aston-Martin.You can tell all of the product placement plagued from other companies. Bond is being chased in his Aston-Martin by a Jaguar after using a Norelco shaver, etc. That kind of stands aside, though.Brosnan was very good as Bond. I think that he could go on for at least two more Jimmy Bond movies. Halle Berry, whom I love a lot, is also great as Jinx (soon to become a spin-off movie), but if more insight had been given into her character it would have been great. Stephens underplays his role, though menacing enough. It couldn't be a Bond film, though, if the bad guy didn't go for the ""slow but painful"" death that has become a trademark.The locations were very beautifully shot, traveling from Korea to Cuba to, where the majority of the film takes place, Iceland. I've always liked icy conditions (don't ask why) so I thought this would be fun (especially with a car chase on it). It was. Seeing two weapon-packed sports cars go after each other on two-feet-thick ice is my idea of having a good time.Madonna sings a truly terrible song in the beginning, with a subpar opening credits sequence, though FX ridden. She, unfourtanetly, also has a cameo as a fencing instructor. But, you've got to take the bad with the good.The twentith Bond film doesn't lack on fun at all, continuing the tongue-in-cheek humor that it had before, and is definately a high seven on my list.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for action violence and sexuality.",Die Another Day

133,0w0,One of the worst Bond movies ever,4,12 May 2020,"Why does Bond ALWAYS let the bad-guy escape the first time they meet? They do this in every bloody movie! Bond meets the bad-guy, then have a monologue, and then Bond lets the bad-guy willingly escape, dispite Bond always being armed.The dialogue in this movie is particularly terrible... EVERY damn scene involving Bond is just characters spouting 1liners and quips and puns... nothing worthwhile or witty is ever said when Bond is on the screen... it's all just inane babble.And then we get to the plot holes: Bond lowers his heart rate until he enters cardiac arrest... this is impossible. No human on earth can do this, and it creates a plot-hole.Also, it's a running-trend in these movies now that Bond ALWAYS lets the bad-guy escape the first time they meet... but in this movie, they didn't do it just once, not twice, but THREE times! Bond could have ended the bad-guy's life, yet chose not to, which creates 3 extra plot-holes.Also, knocking someone out with a punch, doesn't render them unconscious for more than 1minute AT MOST. So the fact that Bond knocked someone out and they stayed unconscious for over 10minutes, is complete tripe, and a plot-hole.Also, in the movie they shoot 1 single missile at the 'doom machine', but if they fired 10-20 missiles instead, then all their problems would be over... yet OFCOURSE they don't think of that in the movie, because that would be too inconvenient for them. That's another plot-hole.The CGI in the movie is also pretty terrible. It looks like they paid a teenager $100 to do most of the CGI scenes.",Die Another Day
134,Mr_Sensitive,Still Up To Its Standard,7,11 January 2005,This is probably the best of Pierce Brosnan since the Golden Eyes. Since from the very start of the movie that I enjoy the hell out of myself to see something different in Bond and yet still as sophisticated as before. The opening credit has been done brilliantly with fire and ice lady that look really wicked. The concepts of the movie are pack with more action and yet not look so cheap like Mission Impossible 2. It was truly the real joyride watching this movie. The Bond Girls are among the best ever with sophisticated looking Rosamund Pike and Halle Berry. The CGI are not so good as expected so I tell you first.There are different sides of Bond in this movie so if you're not preparing for that you might end up not liking it. But I have fun watching it.Rate: 7/10,Die Another Day
135,cariart,"Fourth Brosnan 'Bond' Starts Promisingly, but Falters...",6,8 May 2004,"Creating new, exciting adventures for 007 after 20 feature films in forty years is a difficult task at best, particularly as public tastes change, and the character of James Bond has to maintain at least a degree of the 'persona' created by Ian Fleming. While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.After an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, ""If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea..."", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.Then Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).As she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007's gaze. In a part equally poorly written, she made far more of her scenes than the writers gave her. The most interesting character in the film was certainly Rick Yune, as Graves' 'enforcer', Zao. Charismatic, ruthless, and nearly unstoppable, Zao was nearly a primal force, far more menacing than Graves at his worst.While a sword-fight sequence between Bond and Graves provided a rare film highlight, and certainly ranks as one of the film series' more memorable sequences, much of the rest of the production was silly, with the story set at a break-neck pace to 'hide' the absurdities. The climax, as a solar 'ray' destroyed the minefield between North and South Korea, allowing an 'invasion' to occur, as 007 and Jinx attempted to commandeer the aircraft controlling the 'ray', stands as one of the most ludicrous finales to a Bond film since MOONRAKER.Although DIE ANOTHER DAY would become Pierce Brosnan's highest-grossing Bond, to date, the film, despite heavily promoting Halle Berry's presence, failed to crack the 'Top Ten' box office attractions in the U.S., and disappointed many fans, worldwide.With the purchase of MGM by Sony, which has wanted to produce a Bond film for years (the studios were entangled in a legal suit that ended just as DIE began production), surprising changes were in store...CASINO ROYALE, the only Fleming title NOT owned by Eon Productions was named as the next 007 adventure...and Pierce Brosnan was FIRED (a sad finish for an actor who'd worked so hard to make 007 viable in the new millennium!) While Broccoli and Wilson are still 'in charge' of Bond productions, they have to answer to new bosses, with definite opinions of their own on where the franchise should go...Can 007 survive THIS? We can only wait and see!",Die Another Day
136,EmperorNortonII,A Flawed Gem from 007,8,17 December 2002,"""Die Another Day"" is the latest movie in the James Bond franchise.  While it is not the best, it does have its good moments.  As with every James Bond movie, this one is all about the beautiful women, snazzy gadgets and fast-paced action.  Halle Berry plays Jinx, this installment's main Bond Girl.  It may seem inconsistent seeing her in this role so soon after winning the Oscar for her performance in ""Monster's Ball.""  But she does her best, looking good in little more than a few diamonds.  Rick Yune plays General Zao, a diamond-scarred North Korean renegade.  He certainly puts on the right look for a Bond baddie.  And John Cleese returns as gadget expert Q, giving the right ""mad scientist"" vibe to the role.  Whether you're a 007 devotee or not, ""Die Another Day"" is worth scoping out.",Die Another Day
137,nicholls_les,Great Bond Film,9,23 November 2015,"Sorry but I have to disagree with all the negative comments about this film. For my money Peirce Brosnan is the best Bond and knocks the spots off Daniel Craig. Craig looks more like he should be working on a building site and has zero style or charisma, Brosnan has both as well as an edge that makes him believable both as a ladies man and an assassin. Craig's attempt at cashing in on the Bourne films doesn't work for me but I do appreciate that lot's seem to rate him so it is just a matter of taste. Im my Opinion the best Bonds were: 1. Pierce Brosnam 2. Sean Connery 3. Timothy Daulton 4. George Lazenby 5. Roger Moore 6. Daniel CraigI loved this film, it was fast and full of action, plus it has Halle Berry looking hotter than any Bond girl I can think of. The villains were all believable and Bond like.

139,statuskuo,Moonraker: Take Two,4,30 October 2020,"I know people like to use this one as a whipping boy since it goes to a weird place. Face reconstruction, sun energy weapon and just paint-by-numbers plot, but as James Bonds go, there are worse.That isn't to say this is worth your time. The story is of James Bond's (Pierce Brosnan) capture by the North Koreans who trade him back for one of their terrorist Zao (Rick Yune). While investigating a diamond trade, he comes across a English playboy Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) who is ridiculously rich which matches his obnoxiousness. Logic aside, no one knows his past, really. But he is surrounded by nefarious characters.
Okay, here's the thing...I will and have never got Halle Berry. In anything she's done. Pretty to look at, but she is that type of arrogance that is annoying. She does it in everything she's in. She can't let her guard down. And she delivers lines like she's pooping her pants. Nothing about it rings true. This token hire doesn't pay off, at all. But I think that has something to do with Brosnan's Bond characters. He always seems to be overshadowed by big name, awful acting women. Denise Richards, Halle Berry, Teri Hatcher. All horrid. But that could also be the writing. They aren't much more than their occupation.
In this. EVERYONE is obnoxious. Toby Stephens seems to relish his role, but his stupid mugging fast ruins every moment that is suppose to feel sinister. Instead, he looks like a spoiled brat. The casting is horrid which deflated this inflated story to begin with.
The marginal light in this is Rosamund Pike. Who probably gets by because her English accent makes her appear smart. She does her best to lift the weak material.
But this is escapism. And you do get the gadgets and the Bond tropes. It fulfills what it needs to. It just seems Lee Tamahori was in over his head.",Die Another Day
140,Rickting,Possibly the stupidest action film of all time,3,1 October 2015,"James Bond's 40th anniversary present was one of the worst anyone could receive: This. A turgid, CGI heavy, brainless car crash of an action film which isn't so much James Bond as laughably bad science fiction. Easily the most hated Bond movie to date and for good reason, this isn't quite at the bottom for me. Bond fails a mission in North Korea and is held in prison and tortured for 14 months. This is a powerful opening and shows one of the most indestructible movie heroes of all properly messing up for once. Unfortunately it then dissolves into a ludicrous plot involving diamond smuggling led by one of the worst Bond villains of all time which is so keen to reference every other Bond film that it's just a mess of undercooked elements with no tension, soul, realism or worst of all- fun. So the opening half hour is good, Rosamund Pike gives a good performance and there are thrilling moments occasionally. Also, the villain's plan is interesting and there are ideas which could have worked in a less silly film. This is supposed to be a celebration of James Bond. The equivalent would be celebrating vampire fiction with the Twilight franchise.Pierce Brosnan gives his worst performance as Bond while Halle Berry doesn't fare much better as the Bond girl. Toby Stephens is embarrassing as the main villain. The action sequences are literally drowning in fake looking CGI (Don't even get me started on that CGI wave Bond surfs), nothing in the film looks real, everything feels unrealistic and stupid and the action sequences aren't tense or fun. Die Another Day is just too over the top. It's so over the top it stops being fun and becomes exhausting. The pace is fairly poor as well and the film isn't structured properly. The pathetic finale feels like an afterthought. The way in which it pays tribute to earlier instalments is good, but not good enough to distract from the monumental stupidity which dominates much of the run time. Add in uninspired direction, a going the motions script filled with awful innuendo and a complete, absolute absence of anything resembling Ian Fleming's novels and you're left with a near unwatchable Bond movie.3/10",Die Another Day

Lots of impressive action and stunts, good chemistry between Brosnan and Halle Berry as an American spy and some apropriately scenery chewing Korean baddies... sure the plotline is the typical fantasy hokum about space lasers and plastic surgery and other nonsense that doesnt make sense but that end battle over the exploding ice palace is real cool.

142,TheMan3051,Bond 40/20,10,1 December 2002,"40 amazing years and 20 great movies!Well, not all 20 films were great but this has been a great series/franchise which naturally has had it's ups and downs but they always manage to get back on there feet after a major downfall. Die Another Day is the 20th Bond film (21st counting Never Say Never Again) and the fourth Brosnan film and I must say I was impressed with this picture. It's an amazing thrill ride which starts with a ""controversial"" beginning. After viewing the film there was much debate about the beginning. I myself must say that I loved it because finally after 19 movies Bond is just not imprisoned but tortured. In the past 19 movies James Bond has always just been a prisoner and that's it. So seeing him being captured and tortured for 14 months is probably the most horrifying event of his life next to his wife being murdered. So it's a very interesting first act.
The film itself is great. Director Lee Tamahori does an amazing job and is perhaps the best director since Martin Campell. The action sequences are amazing, a little exaggerated at times but still exciting. John Cleese does a good job filling in for the AMAZING Desmond Llewelyn and Halle Berry is one of the series most beautiful and sexiest Bond girls. Ranking next to Bond beauties like Ursula Andress, Honor Blackman, both Dominios, and Denise Richards.What's interesting about this movie is that after 40 years there still hasn't been a Bond movie to beat ""Goldfinger!"" Goldfinger is such an extraordinary picture with amazing characters and direction and music and plot! It's an amazing achievement in filmmaking. No wonder that's the Bond movie they make more reference too. Still the whole Bond franchise has been an amazing achievement in filmmaking.*Raises cup* HERE'S TO 40 MORE YEARS!4(****)out of 4(****)starsA LITTLE SIDE NOTE: (MAY CONTAIN SPOILER) I fear the Bond series is heading for another law suit. Not from McClory but from Batman! The whole laser thingy is such a rip-off from the laser satellite used by the Joker in ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker!""

It is a complete and utter mess. The story is difficult to follow, you don't know who the bad guys are, or why they are bad guys, nothing that happens makes sense, and ultimately it looks like a script for Batman that someone inserted Bond into.By the way, when 'M' and Minister of Defense got upset with Roger Moore while he was playing Bond, it was endearing and funny. Now they have some old granny who is for no reason always upset with Bond, and watching her scenes is dull and irritating.I guess I enjoyed Halle Berry's bikini.

144,FilmFanInTheHouse,Just plain over the top action,7,23 March 2007,"Die Another Day, the twentieth Bond film, is more like a dedication to Bond rather than an actual serious film. Pierce Brosnan returns looking slightly too old for the role. Also returning are the regulars Judi Dench (M), Samantha Bond (Moneypenny) and John Cleese (Q). Joining them as Helle Berry, as Jinx, who is far too serious to be seen as the Bond girl. Toby Stephens as Gustav Graves an unbelievable villain. Rick Yune makes a decent henchman as Zao, and Michael Madsen makes a nice surprise as Jinx's boss, Falco.Lets start with the music. The music is totally different to previous Bond films, but this doesn't mean its good. There are a few highlight, but just sounds too techno. Madonnas theme really doesn't fit in as a Bond theme, and don't get me started on her cameo.The action is so-so. The best sequence is the car chase on ice, between Bond and Zao, but some of the action relies on CGI too much. For the first time in a Bond film, they have had to use a CGI model of Bond. It doesn't look good. The film is just too unrealistic. When are there such things as invisible cars at the moment?

145,dfle3,The ultimate comic book/popcorn 007 movie. Bond distilled...100-proof.,9,29 September 2010,"21st of 23 Bond movies (20th of 22 official Bond movies) Pierce Brosnan exits his role as Bond in by far the greatest farewell of any of the long term actors in the role. I'm probably being harsh giving this movie 9/10 instead of 10/10...but if I give it the same score as my next favourite Bond movies (""On her majesty's secret service"" and ""For your eyes only""), then I can give differing reasons as to which one can be considered the best. Character wise, George Lazenby's movie is easily the best. Entertainment wise, Brosnan's final outing is in the same league as Roger Moore's ""For your eyes only""...if I'd scored that Moore movie when I saw it, it would have undoubtedly been a 10/10 movie for me. I was a child when I saw it, and the excitement of it wasn't as intense having recently seen it as an adult...albeit on the small screen at home. Hence the 9/10 I gave it.In many ways this movie is the essence of certain Bond elements instantiated. Some elements of the story will be familiar to followers of the franchise. These are brought to life in a way never before possible, due to a big budget and improvements in special effects. For instance, it homages and surpasses a certain scene in ""Goldfinger"" involving a laser.Exotic locations: North Korea, Hong Kong, Cuba and Iceland.Plot: Bond's mission in North Korea is compromised by a mole, presumably, and his status as top spy is made to look compromised. His licence to kill is revoked and he goes rogue to find the person who gave him up in North Korea and then made it look like he had given away secrets to his adversary.Franchise clichés: Pre-title sequence - Gun barrel sequence has a funkier beat this time, but the iconic bass line returns in a big way. A new element is the bullet which flys right at you to end that sequence. If you're wondering if there is anything that Bond can't do, you'll have to scratch ""surfing"" from your list of candidates! Brosnan does a bit of a Jack Nicholson impersonation in once scene (with the sunglasses scene) before his mission goes pear shaped when he is with Colonel Tan-Sun Moon. The colonel is dealing with blood diamonds (I think that they're called ""African conflict diamonds"" in this movie, though in a more recent movie they are called ""Blood diamonds""...that could even be the name of the movie).Theme song - By Madonna. It's auto-tuned, and she sounds like a little girl as a result. Has a techno feel, mixed with symphonic elements like violins. Not a bad song. For the first time in a Bond movie the theme song and action proper bleed into each other. Some credits are faint as a result. The end credits have a remix of this song...called the ""Dirty Vegas mix"". The song writing credit is attributed to Madonna and someone called Mirwais Ahmadzaï. The conventional visual style for the song is perhaps the best in the franchise...good use of computer generated images. For the first time, I think, an existing song is used in the movie and given an end credit...in this case The Clash's ""London calling"".Q - The transition to a new Q is completed...John Cleese plays the new Q. Some more background info is given on this role...Bond calls him ""Quartermaster"" initially, which Wikipedia states is a role in the British army concerned with provisioning supplies and provisions. Later Bond calls him ""Q"", thus cementing the name to the role, not the individual. For once, Q actually has a good line in the series...the exception to the rule is the one and only hilarious thing he had said prior to this movie...his final line in ""Moonraker"", which is an all time great Bond movie zinger. Q also has the most astonishing equipment he has ever given to Bond in this movie...a car. It seems that some Bond movie fans hate this movie based on that car...it crosses some sort of line for them. Since I've recently seen a documentary which makes this technology seem plausible in theory, I did not have the same issues with it as others.M - Has some lines which give insight into her position and relationship with Bond, like ""If I had my way, you'd still be in North Korea. Your freedom came at too high a price"".Moneypenny - Over the course of the franchise, her relationship with Bond has been rather vacuous. The exception to that rule was her great story in ""On her majesty's secret service"". The new actress playing the part in Brosnan's movie has been better served by the script. In some ways this is a nice bookend to ""On her majesty's secret service""...showing you how she handled the fall out from that previous movie. I'm a bit ambivalent about her final scene...it ties in with the earlier movie, but it is rather melodramatic...some fans could actively loathe it. At worst it is a misjudgement by the writers.Silly female character names - Peaceful Fountains of Desire. That's her name. Seriously. There's also a character with the nickname ""Jinx""...so, not a real name.Sexism/misogyny - Nothing in my notes on this. Feminism has caught up to Brosnan's Bond...left Connery and Moore untouched though.Wine buffery - Bond says ""'61 Bollinger"" and ""Vodka martini. Plenty of ice, if you can spare it"".End teaser - James Bond will return.Things to watch for:*MI6 having an evaluation centre in the Falklands!* Bond has cyanide from MI6...a suicide pill standard for all 00s, presumably.* The longest pause between ""Bond"" and ""James Bond"" when Bond introduces himself.

It showed Bond's mortality and was a fresh and good change, because he always managed to escape in the last moment.

149,willcundallreview,"A Bond birthday, that doesn't go so well",5,2 June 2014,"Rating-5/10 Die Another Day is a Bond I felt disappointed with, not that it is a bad movie, but it is poor. With effects that have no place in a Bond movie and a storyline that starts off well but drastically falls of a cliff as the film reaches it's climax. The characters are interesting though and with some good stunts here and there it isn't all terrible, but maybe the ridiculous content, just pushes it over the edge. I felt this film was firmly an under average film, and here below is why I felt so.The story is as I say, not too bad to begin and it has the air of one of Brosnan's last two movies where yes we expect action and stunts galore, but in this as it takes a turn to the end, it just starts getting ridiculous. I can't say much without ruining this for anyone who hasn't seen but lets just say, it would take a lot of effort, money and manpower to create what the villain in this has and what he lives in. Of course it isn't completely bad but just with it's silly overtones and a plot that could have done so much better for a 40th Bond anniversary.Pierce Brosnan ends his Bond in a poor way, now he isn't actually bad in this but he can't do much to put an end to the movie's bad parts. Halle Berry as the Bond girl Jinx is well, she doesn't seem to get into the part well and even though many compliment her for this film, I personally felt she was very unemotional throughout. Toby Stephens as the villain is well, well he is good but not great, he has the evil look and stubborn attitude a villain needs in Bond, but he just feels too humorous nearly, as if he isn't quite taking the role seriously.Lee Tamahori directs this poorly and he really doesn't seem to know how to do a Bond film, it is as if he wants all the over the top action and stunts and thinks the audience will just be blown away by poor effects. It isn't written that bad, an average script which actually at times can deliver some good lines, if you enjoy Bond's quips of course. The effects are a contributing factor to the downgrade of this film, they are just not good enough and when you see Brosnan on a green screen with really bad effects behind him, you just think ""when did the producers think that was OK"".It isn't all bad as said, contains some truly good stunts and the scene that basically opens the film is pretty good too. Brosnan also puts in a suave Bond performance and when you see him again at the beginning, I couldn't help feel he nearly was epitomising James Bond. You will see some Gadgets in this are insanely stupid, near impossible, but some are fun and well thought out with the story, Bond uses them to his advantage and that can make some scenes truly thrilling for the viewer.Bond franchise fans may be disappointed by this, it boasts nothing more than Brosnan's last two although because it is the 40th year of Bond, it has some old reminders of the past, good to see if you you're a Bond fan. Anyone watching this one off well, you might like it if you enjoy the over the top action and care very little for the content of a film, if you watch it and care for the content, I don't feel you will like this at all, again though, this film is far from being a terrible or awful film. I give this film a 5/10, it is Firmly a below par film, again not Bad but really never gets that near to even breaking average. I know some can and will enjoy this, I have heard people complimenting the movie and telling people to just give it a go, I agree give it a go but also consider what is happening in the plot. I feel a bit sorry for Brosnan to go out with such a film that nearly ended Bond, his four years were OK and he managed to do Bond well, again though, just a shame that he has to do Die Another Day.",Die Another Day
150,majikstl,"""Analyze this, Analyze this, Analyze this""",5,17 December 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how DIE ANOTHER DAY rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: DIE ANOTHER DAY: The quality of the movie aside, this is really a clever little title. 8 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Like in TOMORROW NEVER DIES, Bond is once again snooping around an arms deal, this time in North Korea where Korean weapons are being swapped for a hoard of South African conflict diamonds. The usual frenetic chase and explosions occur, though the hoovercrafts are a nice touch. 8 points.Opening Credits: The most unsexy credits of any Bond film; designer Daniel Kleinman goes beyond the gooey oil drenched women in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, to offer us images of women either gyrating while ablaze or melting into icy puddles. This alternates with images of 007 being sadistically tortured by the North Koreans. Maybe this is Kleinman's idea of Bond in hell, but it is nonetheless cruel and unpleasant as it represents the series' growing refusal to be entertaining just for the sake of being entertaining. It deserves 0 points. And incredibly enough, it is made worse by the ....Theme Song: Material Girl (and wannabe Bond Girl) Madonna tries to recharge her fading career by going techno-pop. Even at her most outrageous, she couldn't save this horrendously awful song with its mechanical beat and inane lyrics. If the Koreans really wanted to torture Bond all they would have to do is force him to listen to this song just once. 0 points.""Bond, James Bond"": Despite showing such great promise in his debut in GOLDENEYE, Pierce Brosnan grew steadily worse in the role. The puckish charm he brought to his role on TV's ""Remington Steele"" was no doubt what got him the role in the first place, but that sense of irony all but evaporated as his tenure as Bond drug on and on. Brosnan looks like he is in genuine pain every time he has to deliver one of Bond's infamous one-liners. 2 points.Bond Babes: I suppose to make it seem as though she wasn't taking a step down by going from Oscar Winner to Bond Girl, Halle Berry made the rounds bragging about how her character of Jinx would be the first woman who was James Bond's equal -- meaning she never saw the films with Diana Rigg, Barbara Bach or Michelle Yeoh. Despite the hype, she adds little to the movie. Not only does Rosamund Pike as double agent Miranda Frost outshines her, Berry's Jinx is the least interesting and least important person in the entire film. Well, almost -- the less said about Madonna's creepy little cameo the better. 7 points for the way Pike makes both faces of Miranda equally real.Bond Villain: Played by Toby Stephens with an engagingly bloated ego, Gustav Graves is one of the better Bond villains. His arrogance and swagger are so potent that it is almost easy to overlook that this Anglo-Saxon European is really a North Korean whose identity has been altered at the genetic level by gene therapy. The film wisely doesn't dwell on the idiocy of the dubious science behind this plot twist, so neither will I -- for now. 8 points.Bond Baddies: Rick Yune makes quite an impression as Zao, a traitorous North Korean, whose gimmick is that he has a batch of diamonds embedded in his face due to an explosion. An entire genetic make over they can do; but using tweezers is beyond their scope. 7 points.Sinister Plot: In Korea, the traitorous Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee) illegally sells Korean weapons to obtain African diamonds that will allow him to change his identity to Gustav Graves and become a wealthy capitalist who can build a heat emitting satellite which can be used by Korea to start a war against the West that could end in a nuclear holocaust. Why? I don't know! Third base! I think that gene therapy scrambled Moon's brains. 4 points.Production values: Other than the well staged opening chase, the rest of the film seems to feature an awful lot of second-rate matte work and unconvincing CGI. The final battle aboard the disintegrating jet looks especially fake and the supposedly solid ice walls of the Ice Hotel seem to shatter like cheap plastic. The infamous invisible Astin Martin has been singled out as Bond gimmickry at its most absurd, but the whole business about using gene therapy to alter a person's racial make up is equally ridiculous. 4 points.Bonus Points: John Cleese as the new ""Q"" and Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny are given the opportunity to inject some much needed humor in the film -- and they are rewarded by the producers by being written out of the next Bond adventure, the rebooted CASINO ROYALE. Thanks a lot. Meanwhile, having had her life saved by Bond in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, Judi Dench's ""M"" repays James by assuming without evidence that he is a traitor and strips him of his 007 status. Thanks for nothing. 5 points for ""Q"" and Moneypenny, a fat goose egg for for an ungrateful ""M."" Summary: Despite the semi-optimistic title, DIE ANOTHER DAY does represent the end of era. Bond as we know him is supposedly being terminated with extreme prejudice, with hopes of him being reborn in CASINO ROYALE with a new actor and new history. What's needed is not a new Bond, but a new attitude.Bond-o-meter Rating: 53 points out of 100.",Die Another Day
151,PyrolyticCarbon,"An excellent Bond movie, and goes on to show even more that Brosnan makes a superb Bond.",8,9 December 2002,"Hearing quite a good review on BBC's Film 2002, I agreed whole-heartedly with it, so just to recap. There's quite an element of darkness in this Bond, with a whole opening section devoted to his capture, torture and even betrayal. It's a side to the normal infallible Bond that we rarely see, and to be honest it worked quite well. Combining this with the villain that actually seems like he could really kill Bond, I mean really. Coupled with some nice surprises, and Bond showing some real unfettered hatred, it's not exactly like the other Bond filmsbut then, it is. For there are the action sequences, which are spectacular, the amazing storyline, and some stunning Bond girls. All in all, an excellent Bond, which should rank up with the top five of all time, with Brosnan showing he should be in the top two Bonds of all time.",Die Another Day
152,todd2u,Excellent Bond movie!,10,24 November 2002,"I've seen this movie and I've read a lot of reviews on this movie, and I personally think this movie was awesome. There are a lot of people saying that this is a copy of of other movies, like Goldeneye. For instance the satellite thing off of Goldeneye. I am going to support Die Another Day by saying that satellites are like a thing of the future. Just because one movie in history has it doesn't mean Die Another day is coping of of it. Another thing people is saying is that Halle's character is a copy of of the Tomorrow never dies' Bond girl. Well I honestly don't care. I loved Halle as Jinx. Yes the writers should have written her a little bit better. She really doesn't do much except kill the bad woman in the end. She could have done more. But I loved Halle in the movie. In my opinion Pierce is Bond. He did great in this movie. The bad guys were really cool, and cool to hate. The CGI effects were really cool. The Madonna song was really awesome. Her cameo was pretty good. not to much, but not to little. the action scenes were great. The plot was great. I loved everything about this movie. I think this is a great anniversary for Bond. the acting was all great. If your reading this NOTHING HAS GONE WRONG IN THE MOVIE. I recommend watching this movie for fun, like all Bond films. I've heard so many people saying every little thing that has gone wrong with this movie but don't listen to them. This was an excellent Bond flick. More special effects than ever before. I recommend this movie to any bond fan. You wont be disappointed.",Die Another Day
153,michaelarmer,Die Another Shagging Day,9,8 April 2020,"This is the last Brosnan 007, and he knew it when starting this, it must have given him the push he wanted to do a great performance because this was his best as Bond. Its very well made as well, although there are a few quiet spells it is well paced and has good action, particularly the hovercraft scenes in the intro. However many of the scenes are not in the right location or faked. The entire North Korean scenes are filmed in England and Wales, Spain doubles for Cuba, the only authentic locations are Iceland and London, although some of the Icelandic scenes are faked or in Norway & Finland. The title song by Madonna is a good one, and for a nice change it is at the end as well (not a different song as in other recent films), although a bit different, she also gets a small role in the film. The film music is good but not great, but the inclusion of London Calling by the Clash was inspirational.Apart from Brosnan, all the other actors are putting in good shifts, and the 2 lead Koreans are actually played by Koreans (although born in the USA), Will Yun Lee and Rick June, Toby Stephens is great as Gustave Graves, John Cleese pops up again as Q, General Moon is played by a Chinese actor though, Kenneth Tsang, one actor I have not mentioned in the Brosnan era is Colin Salmon (England) who played MI6 guy Charles Robinson, he was good in all.Bond Themes:- Helicopters again, ski (like) snow scenes, plenty of gadgets, the CIA are back, but with Damian Falco (Michael Madsen who had a irritating acting trait). Cars: - Aston Martin are back with the beautiful Vanquish, there is also a cracking Jaguar XKR (prototype) 2 Ferrari F355's a Lamborghini Diablo, a Porsche 911 and a couple of retro Fords which looked nice. Henchman: - Mr Kil (Lawrence Makoare-New Zealand), Zau (Rick June-USA/Korean) and Henchwoman Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike-England) who also is a baddie Bond Girl.Bond Girls:- Just 2 in this, first is Jinx (no.61) played well by Halle Berry (USA) who not only is the most beautiful and sexy, but a good actress, and multi-tasks by providing a lot of the action, she duplicates the rise out of the sea by Ursula Andress in Dr. No. but much better and Bond soon shags her, he gets her at the end as well. The other is Miranda Frost (no.62) played by Rosamund Pike in her first role, she turns out to be a baddie and gets killed at the end by Jinx.All in all, despite the faults, which the acting and action makes up for, it's a great film, it's got another great action intro and the end action on the (Model) plane is very good, for me it's the best Brosnan film, slightly better than Goldeneye, but still getting a 9, if I could give it a 9.5 I would, I can't rate it 10 because of the faked scenes.",Die Another Day
154,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,4,22 February 2005,"EASILY..BY FAR.. the WORST Bond film yet, truly awful, with almost nothing going for it. What may be Brosnan's last Bond film, this should have been much better, but right from the start we were dreading it would turn out like this.Let's see where they went wrong- Plot: Tries to be smart, ends up making little sense. A blatant attempt at pandering to today's younger audiences, and succumb to the modern definition of cool. This involves retro stuff- nods to past films, updated technology, stupid looking cars and modern music etc. This may have always been the way with the series, but here it just goes too far and ends up looking horrendous. Script- Nothing but innuendo. Nothing. No attempt at anything else, more akin to a Carry On movie than a Bond movie. Music- Madonna's 'song' is the worst Bond song ever, by a long way. Bad Guys- Some guy who fences, and some other guy with a strange face. Neither pose any threat, neither seem evil, not worthy of a spot in Eastenders. Girls-Madonna's pointless cameo further reduces her status to inglorious levels, once an interesting artist, now some woman you would avoid on the street. Halle Berry as Jinx, yes she's pretty, but an average actress, flavour of the month, and a very weak character obviously created in the hope of a spin off. She is apparently a strong female character because she knows how to kick people, use a gun and show off her body-well done. Miranda Frost- instantly forgettable character and Pike's performance is pretty bad too, hamming up the terrible dialogue. She is only there so Bond can have a 'steamy' scene. Stunts, action, gadgets- Probably the best part, there are plenty of set pieces, and the intro is pretty good. But some dodgy CG, combined with the other faults mean the experience of watching is hollow, we do not feel any excitement or tension. All that remains is a series of explosions flashing in front of our already switched off minds.So, where to now for Bond? Rumours of a younger reincarnation will surely bring in tonnes of cash, but will probably mean more teen stuff. Remember, Bond is a character of great depth and emotion, he is not just a guy who shags women and saves the world. He is a haunted, lonely figure, at odds with himself and his actions, with a tragic past, but the fact he must do his job means he will never escape. Remember Goldeneye?- Bond-'It's what keeps me alive', Natalya- 'No, it's what keeps you alone'. We see nothing of the real Bond in this attempt at a film. Only Cleese, Dench etc rescue it slightly. The film-makers should seriously rethink what they have done her, and what they are going to do to this much loved character in the future.4.5 out of 10",Die Another Day
155,waqassaleem-85201,End of Pierce Brosnan,6,6 June 2021,The film is good and a great end to pierce Brosnan as James Bond. The biggest issue is the films CGI felt like I was watching a cartoon. Worth the watch still though.,Die Another Day
156,Mort-31,My Iceland disappointment,4,28 January 2003,"`The old one's were better', was the first thing my friend said while we were leaving the cinema. Although this phrase is quite often (too often) used in connection with Bond movies, I had to agree with him under the impression of Die Another Day. The producers' pressure to present `more' than before increases from episode to episode. Therefore, the evil opponents become too evil, the tricky devices become almost supernatural, the story is utterly unbelievable, and at some points in the film one might think that one is watching a Harry Potter movie.As a Monty Python lover, of course, I liked the new Q scenes with John Cleese best (wasn't he called `R' in the previous movie?). Another reason why I wanted to see the 20th Bond as well was that part of it was filmed in Iceland. Unfortunately, all that is shown of this beautiful country is a palace built entirely out of ice. And this palace does not exist in reality. A personal disappointment.In the Trivia section I read that there are references to all previous Bond films included. This is a nice idea, and for confirmed Bond fans it is surely a lot of fun to find them. But needless to say, I didn't notice any of them. Bond is not much of a public pleasure any more  unfortunately.",Die Another Day
157,mOVIemAN56,Just Not Bond,5,13 June 2005,"Die Another Day is the twentieth Bond film spanning a period of forty years. Each film is memorable for some reason or another but Die Another Day just didn't have the same feel that the other Bond films do. Pierce Brosnan returns for the fourth time to play 007 and a bunch of strange twists and plot changes are put into place.After Bond is captured in North Korea he is held captive by the government until an exchange with the British government is made. Bond is put out-of-commission by M (Judi Dench) but Bond escapes and is now after the man who betrayed him in Korea. He'll span across the Bahamas, Iceland, England, and Korea just to find the culprit and bring him to a deserving justice. Providing help sent by M, who now believes in her best judgment that he is fit for duty, is beautiful MI6 agent Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) and CIA agent Jinx (Halle Berry). Now Bond must make a connection between North Korean terrorist Zao (Rick Yune) and diamond broker Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). Even with a star studded cast, Die Another Day fails as a Bond film. So much pointless action is put into place, including the ridiculous sword fight, and Bond is made out to be just some useless British guy out for revenge. Another problem was working big time actress Halle Berry into the script as a Bond girl. Her character is bland and useless to the whole film. The film tries to hard to work the sci-fi thing into Bond films. If only the producers could have made another memorable Bond film such as Goldfinger (1963), A View to a Kill (1985), or Goldeneye (1996). Instead they made a boring, 2 hour sci-fi Bond film with weak action and an even weaker villain. The producers should try to get back to the roots of Bond and not try to modernize him like they did in this.Die Another Day. Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, Rick Yune, Toby Stephens, and Rosamund Pike.2 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",Die Another Day
158,OttoVonB,Bond number20: Celebrating the short-comings.,6,13 December 2006,"After capture and torture at the hand of the North Koreans, Bond must hunt down yet another criminal mastermind, this time with the help of Jinx (Berrie) and MI6 fox Frost (Pike). Mad killer Zao tries to kill him along the way, and Madonna and Michael Madsen show up.One of the fundamental problems with this film is that it tried to out-Bond all previous Bonds rather than be its own animal. The symbolism of the number (20, actually 21 if you consider ""Never Say Never Again"") led the designers of this film to commit serious overkill and excessive referencing: Halle Berrie dressed just like Ursulla Andress? Check. Pop star who's popularity tops that of any previous Bond singer? Double-check: Madonna sings and contributes a cameo. Crazy gadgets? Check.In trying to outdo the franchise, ""Die Another Day"" comes across as weaker than most films in the series. An excellent prologue scene gives way to one of the worst theme songs in Bond history, followed by a murky plot laden with cameos (Madsen is obviously wasted). Halle Berrie's Ursulla Andress reference is undermined by her own perplexing blandness. Even the action is a let-down for the most part: a nasty sword fight is a delight (despite the presence of Madonna) but the car chase is risible and a scene with Bond surfing on a waive with a parachute reveals the worst CGI seen in years! ""Die Another Day"" could have been a new big-scale Bond, as all the other multiple of five Bonds were: ""You Only Live Twice"" gave us bigger, better action, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" went stellar in terms of scale and had a solid revenge story, and ""Living Daylights"" brought us Bond's most human incarnation, along with his most elaborate, realistic and smart adventure. What does Episode 20 contribute? Little other than the fact that an artistic kick up the backside is sorely needed for the franchise to survive. Bond works because of what it does best, which no longer covers parody (territory conquered a while ago by Austin Powers).One can at least be grateful that it marked the end of years of limited risk taking and gave way to the infinitely better ""Casino Royale"".",Die Another Day
159,Hunky Stud,what year is this?,7,12 April 2003,"Is this Hollywood's newest racist disguise? I find that it is irritating to watch a white man to act as an Asian man. When 007 was dealing with the Russians, they did not use Asians acting as Russians. I feel as if it is the new version of ""Good Earth.""     I can't say that it is offensive that a white man is acting as a Korean son. The actor himself is quite good at what he is doing. However, it is not justified to transfer DNA which can't be true, and to show the audiences a white man's face in order to put this movie appealing to the white audience.
    Having said that, I think that this movie is good entertainment. It can't be analyzed deeply, otherwise, it will have too many bloopers. And is it necessary to make 007 to sleep with every woman that he met?",Die Another Day
160,TheHonestCritic,"Here we have the last real Bond film, before the franchise was sadly tarnished by Daniel Craig's presence.",10,10 January 2021,"""Die Another Day"" (2002), I remember when I first saw this movie as a child. It was the first Bond film I ever saw. I was blown away and it really got me hooked to the franchise. After that, I was very eager to watch all the other movies in the series! Still to this day, ""Die Another Day"" is my second all-time favorite Bond film. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story is, during a mission in North Korea, Bond's identity gets revealed and then the mission is compromised. After he gets extracted from North Korea, Bond sets out to find the person who betrayed him while also stumbling on a world domination scheme by a billionaire named Gustav Graves. The plot keeps me invested and intrigued all the way from beginning to end every time I watch it, which is a Bond film done right. One thing I really love is seeing the callbacks to previous Bond movies. ""Die Another Day"" was released in time for the 40th anniversary of the series. It's always a lot of fun to see different things from the past films! Whenever I watch it, I always notice something new. Bottom line, the storyline is a lot of fun, action and comedy to keep you hooked all the way through. All of the acting is superb from all of the actors and actresses. The shining stars in this one, are of course: Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, Halle Berry as Jinx, Toby Stephens as Gustav Graves, John Cleese as the new Q, Judi Dench as M and Rosamund Pike as Miranda Frost. The six of them give the strongest performances, but all of the actors and actresses here do a stellar job! Pierce Brosnan is my second favorite Bond actor below Sean Connery. Had someone else play Bond in this movie, it wouldn't have had the same impact. One thing I've always heard people whine about was Madonna's cameo in the film. I honestly don't see anything wrong with her role at all, it does not hurt the movie in any sense of the word. Plus, she's only on-screen for a couple of minutes, so quit complaining! Every actor and actress in the film really bring their respectable characters to life and the chemistry is impeccable. All of the sets/locations are stunning and give the movie a beautiful atmosphere. From North Korea, to China, to Cuba, to London and more. Such a diverse layout of sets/locations that results in non-stop excitement. Sometimes, if there are too many different sets/locations, it can be jumbled. However, the utilization of the sets/locations here are done so brilliantly and it's laid out cohesively. All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by David Arnold is outstanding. The score definitely sets the tone for the movie and really brings it to life. Most of David Arnold's film scores are brilliant, and this one is is no different. ""Die Another Day"" is nothing short of phenomenal. It's my second all-time favorite Bond movie. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. Here's one final thing I want to say to all of you people in your little cult who somehow hate this movie, just grow up. I love this movie, and I will always love this movie. It's my second favorite Bond film, and there's nothing you can do about that. This is another example of my saying: ""just because someone else likes or hates something, doesn't mean I have to."" You can apply that to yourselves as well. If you all learn to accept a movie for what it is, you will enjoy them that much more. A lot of people say ""Die Another Day"" is over the top. Then again, aren't all the Bond films? That being said, ""Die Another Day"" is a perfect film by my standards, sue me. If you haven't seen ""Die Another Day"", go and see it today. Or else, Gustav Graves may destroy you with the power of Icarus!",Die Another Day
161,thebricks,"Rewatched, Will Yun Lee should have been the villain",6,7 February 2020,"Just decided to rewatch this movie because the Bond series has been released in 4k. I think much of the problem with the movie lies in the fact that the tone shifted dramatically once Colonel Moon becomes Gustav Graves. Normally, when a character is played by multiple actors, the final actor is supposed to be the best. I realized that Will Yun Lee actually should have kept playing the bad guy. Toby Stephens did such a hack job in the role, it wasn't funny. He didn't have ANY elements of the Korean character. I feel like some should have come out, considering he was a very brash, hot-headed, arrogant person. It was a big flaw in the script. I don't think the two actors ever met or studied each other. There was no reason given for the character to change himself into a white guy.Halle Berry also was the worst Bond girl ever. It really didn't help her career when she walked around bragging that EON would make a spinoff series for her awful character, only to get embarrassed when they dropped the project as soon as they didn't need to placate her anymore. It just speaks volumes as to how arrogant and stupid she was. Had she just focused on playing her character instead of hamming it up, it would have improved the movie.The problem with some of the weaker Bond movies is that with some improvement, they would be better movies. Some plot ideas get approved that had no business getting out there. It's a shame.",Die Another Day

163,mnpollio,Brosnan departs on a series high note,9,2 April 2007,"Although it has now become the ""in"" thing to deride Pierce Brosnan's swan song as James Bond as being too unbelievable and gadget-oriented, it was well-reviewed and the most successful Bond film at the time of release.Bond: Brosnan was still fully invested in the role at the time of his departure. Unlike Sean Connery, whose boredom with the role was starting to show, Brosnan went out with class. In each film, he was looser and more comfortable with the part than its predecessor.The women: Halle Berry makes a breath-takingly sexy entrance a la Ursula Andress rising from the sea. Unlike Andress, she actually has some role to play in the subsequent action. Her banter with Brosnan seems a bit forced to me and the comic timing slightly off with the double entendres. Also, for an experienced secret agent the writers make her awfully easy to capture, but even with all of that she still ranks as one of the more memorable of the Bond women. Rosamund Pike is also effective as the aptly named Miranda Frost, whose aloofness allows her to resist Bond for much of the film, while she is on her own apparent mission.The villain: I must admit that I quite enjoyed the villains in this piece. Toby Stephens, sneer almost surgically in place, is terrific as an arrogant showboater who taunts Bond at every opportunity and is one of the rare main villains to be physically young and robust enough to give Brosnan a run for his money. His back story is unlikely, but fairly interesting for a Bond villain. Rick Yune is also effective and striking as a co-hort with diamonds embedded in his face due to an accident earlier in the film.Some of the visual effects in the film are easy to tell that they are matte screens, but the film moves like lightning and manages to remain consistently inventive throughout. Additions like the invisible car and assorted gadgets seem far less improbable during the course of the film than they do in retrospect, but add to the overall sense of fun. The plot is fairly straight-forward and coherent, although the identity of a mole is obvious enough that one wonders why neither Bond or M figure it out before they do. Intense action scenes, jaw-dropping gadgets, a fine cast and exotic locales all add to the successful concoction. The only drawback: the bizarre title song by Madonna does not really fit the crummy mold of ""wailing diva"" numbers that the series had sunk to, but instead defines an entirely new level of crap.",Die Another Day

Being the 40th anniversary and all, it does pay homage to previous bond films with past gadgets make a return and references to the previous films.

One of the more positive aspects of the film, is the growing mother and son type bond between m and James. A nice little moment between James and moneypenny happens.

165,the amorphousmachine,"Not as bad as Brosnan's last outing, but it was still weak!",5,4 May 2004,"(Minor Spoilers)Either James Bond movies are wearing thin on me, or they really have gone downhill. The last really good Bond movie was 'GoldenEye' (1995), which was Pierce Brosnan's first outing. 'Tomorrow Never Dies' (1997) was just above average, and 'The World is Not Enough' (1999) is still his worst one to date, although 'Die Another Day' (2002) comes pretty close.'Die Another Day' (2002) starts off pretty well with Bond getting captured and tortured for information that you might be fooled into think this a serious tone to it, but unfortunately, that tone subsequently goes downhill especially when James Bond goes to the some sort of Ice Castle in the middle of the Artic. Halle Berry plays Jinx, an American agent whom Bond is unsure if he can trust or not. Needless to say, she doesn't add much to this movie, but Berry provides a better Bond girl than Denise Richard's god-awful Dr. Christmas. Admittedly, the villains are little more elaborate with Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) being completely unable to sleep, and some dude named Zao (Rick Yune) with diamonds shards stuck in his face, and then there is the good guy/girl who ends up being a bad guy/girl. The gadgets are back, but invisible cars are really stretching reality, but then again, Bond is pure escapism, right? Well, personally, I think they could have still made gadgets you can actually see! My eyes were rolling aplenty in this movie.The main problem is with 'Die Another Day' is that is so self-aware, and seems to be running through the motions. Jinx is a very annoying character to say least, and the action in the latter part sequences are not as impressive as the one in the promising beginning. While James Bond is still more preferable to Xander Cage, it's a bit worrying that the director of 'Die Another Day' in Lee Tamahori is slated to direct 'xXx 2'. Kind of indicates the direction of this film to begin with-- with it's absurd action sequences involving invisible cars! Then again, Tamahori hasn't really made anything better than 'Once Were Warriors' (1994). As for Pierce Brosnan; he is a good James Bond and suits the part, but lets hope he gets a better story with better characters (i.e. 'GoldenEye') for the future outings, and let's face it, his legacy can't have many films left. 'Die Another Day' is totally uninspired Bond and only slightly better than the awful 'The World Is Not Enough'! This film has a whole going through the motions feel to it rather than be an engaging film, and the series is in desperate need of something to revive it in the action/spy movie genre.**½ out of *****!",Die Another Day

167,Thrashman88,"Contrived, confused and unfocused",6,11 July 2004,"Ever get the notion that Bond films get more and more complicated in the story department? Well, this latest edition does not improve upon my premise. The movie starts with a James Bond we've rarely seen:caged and tortured, hidden away in a cell. It was a very believable scene, but from then on, the car crashes, bombs, chases and so forth take a hold of the movie.
The acting has improved somehow over the years, if you compare recent BOND films like this one to earlier ones with either Sean Connery or Roger Moore. The effects are more and more realistic and even some of the them songs that have been chosen, have that ""007 vibe"" to them (Like GARBAGE's ""The World Is Not Enough"". But, since the end of the cold war, themes for new BOND movies have been more than contrived, to say the least. It's not as easy to pick up a really ruthless villain, but perhaps the current state of terrorism the world is facing can inspire the writers to come up with more defined antagonist. But the confused writing, the over blown special effects and undefined villains makes you wonder if you are actually watching a BOND movie. Add Madonna's utterly atrocious theme song (who EVER though of this SHOULD be HANGED!)and you've got a movie that, while it is entertaining, leaves you feeling empty at the end. 6* out of 10*.",Die Another Day
168,dasa108,Brosnan's best film as Bond. Still not a big deal.,5,25 September 2021,"This film is a demonstration that evolution can be regression when it comes to film sagas. Any adjustment that has been made so far is for the worse. Watching the films in order (from the first to the last including unofficial films) I can affirm the following: Brosnan looks tired for the character but in attitude he still moves with lucidity. The need to fill the screen with female counterparts is embarrassing. Now we have Hellen Berry who proves that she can kill any movie: she did it with Catwoman, she did it with John Wick and now with Bond. In a film where the script is completely naive - it is impossible to present as much madness as if it were probable - we can recognize some merit: Brosnan's swan song as Bond, the fact that he smokes again (nod to Bond films until the eighties) and multiple references to legendary films of the saga. Of the rest, little remains to contribute. With this in mind we must prepare for the stage of Daniel Craig, without a doubt, the blackest stage in the saga and naturally the worst Bond of all.",Die Another Day
169,Cedric_Catsuits,Poor effort,3,3 June 2020,"Brosnan just isn't Bond (and let's be honest, he's not an actor either) and Berry just isn't a Bond Girl. it's by no means a bad film, just a bad Bond film. Not the worst Bond film by any means, but fundamentally lacking in credibility.",Die Another Day
170,revival05,"A flawed spectacle, but certainly not horrible",6,31 October 2009,"Die Another Day has taken huge amounts of bashing from many 007 fans, from many different corners of the fanbase. Wheter or not people agree on the Roger Moore movies being too silly, the Daltons too serious or the Brosnans too shallow, everybody seems to agree that Die Another Day was like this big meteorite that sent the franchise to extinction, ready to be rebooted with Daniel Craig. Being a Bond fan myself, I remember seeing it at the theater and being greatly amused by it. Picking it up later on DVD, my enthusiasm did falter upon second viewing. But I happened to see it again just the other day, and I realized that it really is quite an entertaining piece of electric boogaloo. After Craig's two outings in the Bond role, this sort of comic book 007 seems archaic and so does Pierce Brosnan - he can, almost, be placed beside the Spice Girls and blend in on the ""cool britannia/90's memorabilia"" shelf.That being said, he wasn't bad in the role at all. People tend to fuss and fridget about what should and shouldn't be Bond, and forget that one of the most fundamental traits of the franchise is that the movies always carefully mirror their time and evolve along with the decades. The gritty and rough, slightly depressing, world of Daniel Craig's 007 isn't strange considering that we're living in a rather disillusioned time and for some reason people have a bigger need for darkness and violence (horror has to be Saw and Hostel, Batman has to bee The Dark Knight, fantasy has to be orchs being decapitated, and a bright, dumb character like Jar-Jar Binks is not allowed today). It's no wonder that James Bond, today, is a dark and depressed hero. What hero today isn't? But do you remember the 90s? It was the decade of naive optimism, at least as far as pop culture goes, and I remember the hype surrounding the return of James Bond very well. Today we say that Bond is ""modernized"". Even back then you said it was ""a Bond for the 90s"". I don't think anybody in those days would have expected anything else than the type of comic book-adventure James Bond movie. Looking back on it, the Brosnan movies may vary in quality but as part of the franchise they make perfect sense. I think Die Another Day came along too late, proving it to be one of the very few times when a Bond movie had forgot to catch up with the times. But after 9/11, this can be said about a great many deal of films around 2001-2002.One peculiar thing about Die Another Day is that, being the 20th movie in the series, it has a meta level that gets in the way of almost everything else in the movie. It really is ""the 40th anniversary movie"" of the series, like some kind of special episode of a TV series or a weird, gimmicky kind of self-parodic unofficial movie. It's not just that it has, at least, one nod to every other movie in the series, there's this whole spectacle of celebration throughout the movie. It can't be a coincidence that one of the greatest pop stars of all time does the title song, or that this is the Bond movie where Halle Berry is the bond girl. Or that Monnypenny gets her cravings satisfied. Or that the Aston Martin is invisible! The movie is over the top from the very beginning, when 007 is captured and tortured for 14 months, to the end where.... well, there's a whole lot of things blowing up anyway. Towards the end you really feel closer to watching a Jerry Bruckheimer production than a James Bond movie.Die Another Day has many flaws, not only because it's one of those 007 movies where the plot really is a ritual (did I forget to mention the plot? No I didn't). A lot of things in it are silly, or dumb, or predictable, or ""been there done that"" and it's all baked into a frantic frenzy of a movie, making it a little too much to even bare. Be that as it may, I like the movie for what it is. As an escapist action film it's a lot better than a lot of other movies, I'm not particularly offended by anything in it, and I find there has been a lot of Bond films a lot worse - though it admittedly isn't on the top list. Also, I find all of the Brosnan movies quite diverse form each other and not at all as formulaic and clone-like as critics have made it. I must say that I prefer Die Another Day's madness over the dull Tomorrow Never Dies which in my opinion is the worst Bond movie to date. Both movies share the same trait - they come off more as fairly ill-conceived, generic action-vehicles than proper Bond movies - but at least Die Another Day is so preposterous that you really get enforced to watch it. They don't share the subtle qualities of GoldenEye and The World Is Not Enough - two very under-appreciated Bond films, that will perhaps get more respect with time - but as comic books, Tomorrow Never Dies is dull and Die Another Day... well, a lot more fun. Apart from the very odd torture intro, it is a movie that clearly isn't trying to be serious at all. It has thrown away all credibility and novelty and comes off much like Octopussy, Roger Moore's most unbelievably silly Bond film. But that's also a kind of Bond, mind you. As much as Dalton and Craig have fought bloody, Moore and John Cleese have made it all into a joke. But that's alright. No actor, or single 007 movie, has ever had monopoly on the franchise. As it has before, this kind of silly Bond will return.",Die Another Day
171,tributarystu,Bond by far,6,24 January 2003,"I asked myself after seeing this film: are all James Bond movies so similar? After viewing The World is not enough last week, I was quite eager to view the newest Bond creation. I can not say that I was disappointed, but it wasn't better than I expected either.SpoilersThe story is very, very similar to the one in The World is Not Enough...good girl/ bad girl, bad guy who has a semi-mutilated face, Bond gadgets always do the trick, and, never to be forgotten: Bond. James Bond. The actual problem is quite a cliche, with a satellite that can beam a destroying ray towards the earth and bla,bla,bla...you can guess what things happen. If you are a Bond fan, I do not see why you wouldn't like this movie...it's just the same. Never as good as the first(you see), but still enjoyable.The best thing about the Bond movies I've seen is definitely Pierce Brosnan. He is like made for this part...his charm and all fit very, very well to the character of Bond. Halle Berry isn't bad, but I did prefer Rosamund Pike. She has a kind of spark Berry doesn't...well, I guess it always comes down to each individual and their tastes. Talking of which, I was quite amazed to see no one in the cinema found this movie funny...I'm asking myself if they were really talking all seriously...for me Bond is good, exactly because it isn't a non-stop serious action movies. There are funny, ironic parts, and I especially like the game of words they use. I wonder how long this will last, if it keeps repeating itself.Back to the prior idea: is this movie really to be watched like a serious film? I really don't think I'd like it that way. The thing these Bond movies achieve is to disconnect me from the tension around me, and make me feel better. Relaxed. Cool. What else would there be to be said about this movie...I guess, just a few things: The ice palace was quite amazing, and the bed in which Bond had his ""romantic"" affair was just beautiful. Still, I always had the sensation it was so cold...surely wasn't, but that's what I actually felt. Well, might've been because there's no heating in the cinema too. I did notice that GG was actually...who he was, before he said it, and I was quite sure Miss Frost was the traitor, though I believe were relatively predictable scenes.Yet, the scene at the end, with Moneypenny, was quite surprising... What I really thought was stupid, was the equipment GG had on him. It looked so embarrassing.To end this, I have to say: Bond will always be Bond. He can be shot at with a million bullets but he'll never get hit. There will always be a way out for him, even if it's after 14 months, as it was in this case. If you see a good looking woman in the movie who actually changes more than five lines with mister Bond, then you can be quite sure he'll get her in bed one time or another. What I hope is that Bond will always be funny. 7/10",Die Another Day
172,basrutten,Plausibility? What plausibility?,3,28 January 2003,"Contains spoilersJames Bond movies have never been known for being very realistic (and perhaps that was their greatest strength), but the latest installment in the series, ""Die Another Day"" crosses every possible line with regards to logic and plausibility and ends up being a very long and loud commercial rather than a watchable movie. While watching this movie, I had to cope with things like genetically re-engineering human beings, a ""dream machine"", an invisible car with the capacities of KITT, a giant orbital flashlight that turns out to be a laser gun, a bionic man with an electrified arm, an ice palace built on top a barely-frozen lake, Hale Berry being unable to escape from a room made out of 10 cm thick ICE and much, much more. This movie is so implausible that it makes ""Mission Impossible 2"" look like serious drama, and even ""Star Wars"" is far more believable. Does plausibility really matter? In my opinion, yes. Some people will undoubtedly tell me that I should leave me brain behind and just enjoy the movie for what it is: mindless action. Well, that just doesn't work for me. If a movie want to get away with being ""mindless action"" than it shouldn't take that action so seriously , and should at least come up with an enjoyable story, instead of this incoherent and boring mess that only seems to serve to glue the action scenes together. Oh, and an interesting bad guy would help too.That being said, there are some scenes that had me laughing out loud at how bad they were. Have you noticed that Pierce Brosnan runs exactly like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump (""Run, James, Run""). Hilarious. And the special effects when Bond hits the shore after ""surfing"" on the tidal wave...ridiculous.   In the end, this movie's only merits are some good puns, and of course John Cleese, who is always worth watching. But for the rest, it's just an incoherent mess of high-tech nonsense and totally implausible action scenes. Avoid.1/2 out of **** stars",Die Another Day
173,TheHande,Brosnan's Second Best,8,13 February 2006,"I hated this film for a while...but that may had been because of the lame theme song. Once the movie got going I was actually surprised at how good it was. Though not Brosnan's best it has something that his two previous Bond films lacked...character.We see Bond finally getting the really bad end of the stick and perhaps the longest pre-credit sequence in film-history. While I admit that this movie was a bit too heavy on the special-effects, other elements in the film were done professionally and in all I thought the film was in many ways more interesting than 'Tomorrow Never Dies' or 'The World is Not Enough'.One thing which the recent Bond films have attempted but never quite succeeded in is creating similar fun gimmick henchmen like Oddjob, Nick-Nack and Jaws. Mr. Kill is another failure but at least the villain this time around has a bit more balls than in the last two, even though his 'gimmick' lacked a certain edge.If you want a Bond movie that makes you go ""whoa"", watch this film.

Die another Day is proof to show with how much great ease he plays the character and is a joy to watch. The plot this time involves North Korea and is used rather nicely with the movie and tries not to be TOO political but stays fun. Given that this is the 20th Bond movie watch carefully for several reference to Bond movies of the past which make it a blast and also fun , not to mention 007 catchy one liners which always make it a joy. I felt there was a little 007 atmosphere missing from this movie like their was in Goldeneye but then what it lacks for in atmosphere it makes up for in action , gadgets and I don't care what anyone says the Aston Martin rocks ! Brosnan gives us shades of a Bond who is willing to break the rules which kind of paves the way for Craig I guess , but then I was very impressed with Halle Berry who leaves a mark as one of best Bond Girls as well as Rosamund Pike , Tobey Stevens and Rick Yune were also very good. The locations were nice , I have always wanted to go to Cuba and it was good to have been given a taste of that. The action was brilliant!

James Bond should be clever, stealthy and cunning like all spies are - in this outing, he is really just one for mindless fighting without any signs of intelligence. There is always a gadget at hand for him - when did Bond lose his brains and cool that have kept him alive through all situations?Some of the special effects are pretty contemptible - especially the CGI when Bond was surfing over the tidal wave. And there isn't any art or beauty in it either - Casino Royale had this job done with the black-and-white opening scenes. The title song was the worst of all of all Bond songs - Bond songs are normally quite soothing and strange rather than mindless pop. And even worse - this was sung by the very-successful Madonna.What made Casino Royale better than this? The answer is - Casino Royale was gripping, far more intelligent, and also proved to us that Bond didn't need gadgets or huge explosions and fast cars to be great. This film pleads exactly the opposite case and is really just another action-packed blockbuster for teenagers and young men. Some of it is neat, though. 6/10",Die Another Day

Yeah, right. You know from the start that any semblance to reality has gone: you're watching a cartoon movie. OK, fair enough, the producers are being honest with you. Things have sure dropped down to a sad level since the first Bond flicks with their clever and nuanced plots, witty lines, entertaining action scenes (without computer-generated overkill).

Now considered to be useless to them, MI6 decide not to entrust bond anymore, but he takes it on himself against all odds to complete his unfinished business with the Koreans and to find out who deceived him in the first place.Brosnan is definitely appreciable in all his Bond films – they are all very thrilling, starting from Golden eye to Die another day. He also has an exceptional elegance – talk less, shoot more, smooth language, charming and seductive to any woman he meets, intelligent but not much of a fist fighter, as is seen in this film.

Opening to appalling reviews, this movie is a schizophrenic beast.The movie kicks off with some gruelling scenes of Bond being tortured and man-handled by some altogether unpleasant North Korean sorts (there aren't any other kind, if you are willing to believe the movies at least) this seems to lose its nerve about half way in and turns into a balls out, highly spectacular Bond romp that would have made Roger Moore blush. Just a little. After being rescued by a joint venture between British and American secret services, M sends Bond on a mission to investigate Gustav Graves, a diamond entrepreneur who also fancies himself as weapons developer extraordinaire. His invention? Icarus, a space based contraption ostensibly designed to bring light and warmth to the cooler, less hospitable parts of the globe but which is in truth an ultra powerful laser.Doh! Graves is all smarmy sophistication, a fine performance from Toby Stephen lending him the air of a man you really do want to smack in the mouth. Really hard until it really, really hurts. Much of the criticism came about due to the admittedly ludicrous inclusion of an invisible car and a gob smacking ice-ocean surfing sequence that has to be seen to be believed.Brosnan is as reliable as ever and Halle Berry makes for a pleasant enough distraction to the nonsense going on around her.Much better than its reputation would have you believe",Die Another Day
187,BigGuy,"Mostly good, some bad",7,25 November 2002,"For the most part Die Another Day was an enjoyable movie, but there were a few very annoying parts.To the good:  I loved seeing some of the old gadgets and tools of the trade that were featured in previous movies.  I spotted four or five without trying (like the knife shoe and the jetpack).  I also have to say that Pierce Brosnan is doing a great job as Bond.  The supporting cast for the most part is also very good, Judi Dench and John Cleese fill their roles particularly well.  There were also some thoroughly entertaining action scenes, especially the sword fight.  The car chase was pretty exciting as well.  Although I wish the bad guy's gadgets had gotten more of a chance at working.To the bad:  I thought the double entendre in the dialogue was much more blatant than in previous Bonds (this is especially true in the final scene). Or perhaps it is just that the delivery was terrible.  Actually overall I thought the movie was much more risque than it needed to be.  Just because Halle Berry wanted to have the first sex scene in a Bond movie, doesn't mean it belongs there.  Speaking of Halle Berry...  I didn't like her in this movie.  It was too obvious that she was ecstatic to be in a Bond movie (overplaying the entendres, hamming up the sultry looks).  I also felt Michael Madsen was not the best choice for M's American counterpart.  If the movie was trying to be so nostalgic, why not bring back one of the old Felix Lighter actors to play the part? Then there is the car.  Was it really necessary to make it invisible?  No. Especially because the science doesn't support it.  Sure the science doesn't support a lot of Bond gadgets, but this was more blatant and annoying than most.I think the Bond purists will like this movie, but will find a number of things to be annoyed about.  Adrenaline movie junkies will probably just really enjoy the movie.",Die Another Day
188,David_Frames,The Batman and Robin of the James Bond series,1,9 November 2004,"Pis*-poor, Ill-conceived, soulless, mindless, horrifying - and thats just the title track in this 40th Anniversary defunctular - proof positive that the series is in terrible terrible trouble. In fact, based on the this exercise in self-parody (even the title sounds like a parody), devoid of any new or exciting elements, it might be worth pondering whether its time for the super-spy to take a sabbatical while all concerned contemplate a wholesale reinvention of the Francaise; a full-scale rebuilding from the ground up with absolutely no return to the cut and paste methodology that rots this one from the inside out. It isn't even worth discussing the story to this anniversary entry because there isn't one but it might be worth pointing out the contrast between this and the last anniversary story The Living Daylights (1987) for therein lies the clues to what's gone wrong with 007's exploits. Whereas Dalton's film used the anniversary as a sort of reaffirmation of principles and a throw back to the series dramatic and literary roots, a new dawn if you like (and frankly even if you don't), Die Another Dies goes the other way and represents the zenith of the Pervis/Wade era of Brosnan Bonds that has seen the action and budgets scale upward while the substance has conversely dipped and with the arrival of an invisible car, evaporated. This is about a trillion miles away from the 25th anniversary Bond in which familiar elements made the odd cameo appearance - the Astin Martin for example. Here the familiar is everything - in fact its the building blocks of the story (such as it is) and the characters and, well everything really. The tone is pure fantasy - deadly lasers in space, an evil ice palace lair for the villain, Madonna etc... Characters with silly names trade puns and insipid dialogue while Brosnan goes through the motions. If it was the intention of all concerned to make a companion piece for Austin Powers then they should consider DAD a roaring success. For those of us expecting a serious Bond movie however, its a minor travesty - Bonds have been lazy before (Moonraker, naturally) but this one completes the post-Goldeneye trajectory toward total self-parody and in doing so arguably takes its place along other genre greats such as Rocky 4, Star Trek: Nemesis and Batman and Robin in the 'film that crashed the series' category. Bond films have also been looking down the business end of oblivion before but 'tis no exaggeration to say that this time the martini loving super-spy is fighting for his life. Bond is a great character but unless the powers that be start to take him seriously again and refrain from this derivative fluff, they might as well call it a day.",Die Another Day
189,iwatcheverything,Best of Brosnon,8,27 October 2003,I have seen all of the Bond films and I must say that the best Bond is still Connery.  I do think that Pierce should have been before Dalton but I know about the controversy there.  Anyway on to the movie.  This movie was actually the best Bond that Pierce has done.  It was full of action and kept me interested although most Bond movies are very predictable in a way who cares.  The only flaw was the fact that they tried to make him do stunts that are not only unbelievable but impossible.  Also the witty banter between Bond and Jinx was a little too much.Besides those things this is all you can expect in a good Bond film.  It definitely redeems the horrible acting of World is Not Enough.  Go out and see this film fans of Bond.  Go Now.,Die Another Day
190,lotus_chief,What an asinine movie!,1,13 September 2003,"This movie was horrible.  I expected it to be bad after sitting through the abominable 'Goldeneye' years ago.  Pierce Brosnan sucks as James Bond, he's not convincing, and doesn't have the flair and acting prowness of Sean Connery, who is the ONLY James Bond in my eyes.  Halle Berry is not much of an actress, one can easily come to this conclusion once they could get past thinking how beautiful she is.  She REALLY is a stunningly beautiful Black woman, and I love that...but her acting just sucks.  Total waste of a movie and degradation of the James Bond franchise.  Whoever wrote the 'script' to 'Die Another Day' needs to be dragged out into the street and SHOT!  I don't think I have EVER witnessed a screenplay as bad as this.  This trash of a big budget movie is full of cliches, and it all comes off as a total rip-off and a disgrace to the franchise.  PLEASE don't waste your time with this TRASH....you'll end up praying that you 'die the day' you see it.",Die Another Day
191,MF210,Worth Watching for Bond Fans but it isn't that good,5,15 September 2003,"My Rating: ** out of ****.Bonds fans should watch Die Another Day for two reasons: 1) It is the 20th Bond and marked the 40th Anniversary of the series, 2)To Try and figure out what the 142 million was spent on. Die Another Day was a disappointment, one of the biggest disappointments of 2002. I was expecting something good, maybe too good, for the 40th anniversary of the longest action series.
Die Another Day starts out good, it has an opening scene that immediately caught my attention. As much as some people hated Madonnas song, I liked it, its definitely not the best theme song but I was satisfied by it. The scenes in Cuba werent bad they were kind of interesting, except for Halle Berry but I'll explain that later. There is a nice action scene in Iceland, with Bond driving around in his Invisible Aston Martin (I have to admit) being chased by an evil hench man in his Jaguar.Unfortunately, the chase scene I just mentioned was about the only good scene in Iceland. The Ice Lair (Bad Guys Lair or something like that) looks extremely cheap from the outside and doesnt look much better from the inside. Also, theres a scene when Bond is parasurfing, where it shows some of the worst special effects I have ever seen. Which makes me wonder how in the hell this movie could have cost 142 million?This is where DAD really starts to disappoint. Pierce Brosnan looks like he is already getting to old to do this, hes lost some of his charisma and charm. Halle Berry looks good and is pretty leathal in a fight scene is annoying everytime she opens her mouth. She also seemed to be a rip off of Michelle Yeoh's superior Wai Lin. Rosamund Pike also looks good but isn't really effective either. Toby Stephens (I think thats his name) is one of the worst bad guys in Bond History. The only two that even have an impact is Rick Yune, who is quite effective and scary looking as the bad guys henchman, and John Cleese who has a brief but funny role as Q. Judy Dench has also lost her certain wit as M.Die Another Day ranks among the worst of Bond. It is not quite the worst but its not that far away. It is worth seeing once just because its the 20th bond, but never to be seen again.",Die Another Day
192,lia00027,THE BEST JAMES BOND 007 movie from PIERCE BROSNAN,9,27 November 2002,"Very great movie, the story is interesting about south Korean. This is the first time in James bond movie, that James being so sorry. The action in ice hotel, the hollow car, the hot CIA agent, etc is the best show from this movie. And there is Madonna who just show little. The part when James fight whit his enemy by sword is the best fighting from this movie. I very like the action even Pierce Brosnan is became old and have white hair. But his quality acted can prove in this movie. Hale Berry not showing enough her quality act, but very hot and a great partner for having sex.James enemy have a great car too, which not lose with his car. Rosammund is beautiful, and she remember me with the words ""Beauty can hide the truth"".",Die Another Day
193,mgruebel,Business as usual,5,18 February 2015,"A solid addition to the Bond series. By the time of DAD, Brosnan had gotten the role down to a middle path between Connery and Moore. Bad title song by Madonna.The story unfolds as Bond is captured during a mission gone awry in North Korea. He thinks he kills his Colonel captor during an escape attempt. After more suffering in captivity, Bond is traded as a prisoner and snubbed by his former spy colleagues. He sets out to discover on his own who betrayed him to the North Koreans, by tracking one of their agents around the world. The story takes us from Hong Kong to Cuba to London and Iceland, and finally into the North Korean demilitarized zone. The film is filled with plenty of fun locales, gadgets and sword fights.Halle Berry plays a US spy coming after the same North Korean agent, who is linked to a mysterious British diamond dealer with a plot to deploy a satellite platform that focuses the sun's light to destroy any target on Earth. Unfortunately, from her first scene on she is demoted to standard Bond girl, and she seems to hinder the mission more than she helps. Points off there.Unlike the earliest entries in the Bond saga, this one is full of annoying plot holes. All action flicks have holes, but some of some of them are just too painful. Strangely, many of them have to do with the scriptwriters 5-year-old understanding of line of sight. They seem to think that a car projecting 'what's behind it' onto its surface can be made invisible from the vantage point of two observers standing at different positions, in a minor plot hole. Then later, the evil solar satellite, which can send only one beam in one direction at a time, foils the US military because they don't seem to realize they could send two missiles from different directions at the same time to destroy it. And of course, how does our evil Brit (actually the genetically altered North Korean Colonel that Bond thought dead) get this satellite into space without the US noticing its potential for mayhem?Most of this plot-falls-apart happens in the second half of the film, before that it's pretty watchable. It's a strong 5, and OK for one viewing because of some nice gadgets, locales and action set-pieces.",Die Another Day
194,len-21,9 on a scale of 10,9,11 January 2003,"I have only given one other Bond movie a 9 and that was The Spy Who Loved Me - still the best. But, I liked a lot about Die Another Day. In fact, purely in Bond terms, there was very little to criticize. Oh, sure, there were at least a million things that were completely and utterly impossible, but then it is a comic book character. Every single action film ever made was loaded with ""impossibilities"".But, Brosnan is the best Bond in my opinion. He looks great and plays the part to perfection. There were more than the average number of sexual innuendos. The violence was greater than normal. And, the intensity was a little less fun and a little more fear. Nevertheless, I liked the changes and I am a staunch(!) conservative. I rarely like change, but this was an exception. The sets were fantastic and the stunts were better than ever.My only objection is related to what is probably a strength by most people. I HHH AAA TTT EEE DDD Halle Berry's hair. It looked like a shaggy mop to me - and worse - a short mop. Please give me a Bond woman! Any man (who isn't lying to his wife or girlfriend) will tell you he wants long (or at least more than butch) length hair on EVERY woman - and CERTAINLY on any woman who is supposed to be a fantasy figure for the male viewers. But, I quibble.The movie is long, loud and, if you are stickler for detail, laughable. But, I give it a 9 because I like Bond and this Bond delivers.",Die Another Day
195,carologletree,"Has A Few Highlights, But Some Pretty Bad Stuff, Too",5,9 January 2016,"I have to admit, I have a soft spot for this film because this is the first James Bond movie I ever saw. However, looking at it objectively, I'll have to admit that it is one of the weaker Bond films out there.Pierce Brosnan is as good as ever in his final outing. He supposedly quit after this one because he didn't want to become the next Roger Moore. Halle Berry's Jinx was attractive, but the character is badly written with a lot of her lines being genuinely cringe-worthy. Rosemund Pike's Miranda Frost isn't that great, either.Gustav Graves, played by Toby Stevens, is a pretty lame villain. He's rather uninteresting and is not at all menacing. Zao, his partner, isn't much better.People, of course, have criticized the story and action-scenes as stretching the limits of plausibility. I'm gonna have to agree with them. There is such a thing as too ridiculous even for Bond, and this movie crosses that line.The opening hovercraft chase is spectacular, but the subsequent action scenes are far too cartoonish for my taste. The CGI effects also don't hold up that well, as shown in many scenes such as the stupid surfing scene.However, I really appreciate the references to previous Bond films. They did this because it was the franchise's 40th anniversary.The film has a few good parts, but it can't make up for the extremely silly and bloated nature of the film as a whole. It's one of the franchise's worst, but I still rank it ahead of ""The Man With The Golden Gun."" Too bad they would take the fun out of the franchise in the next couple of films.RATING: C",Die Another Day
196,BrickNash,A great original start deteriorates into popcorn fluff!,7,14 January 2012,"I first viewed this film today ten years after it's release. Having been an avid Bond fan since my childhood I felt the series had lost it's way with Brosnan to over-budgeted popcorn pap, which is no reflection on Brosnan himself as I consider him a fine actor with only Goldeneye really catching my interest in his series with the later entries following a set and obvious formula.As it stands Die Another Day is a fine last breath of a film but just doesn't quite make it.The first half hour of this film in my opinion is one of the best in any Bond film EVER! This is because of the serious and sinister tone due to the situation that bond find himself in and it really does affect you as well as allowing the actors to flex their more dramatic muscles. If the film had stuck with this much darker tone and allowed Brosnan to portray a really damaged, vengeance fuelled Bond it could have been the best entry in the series period. Unfortunately it descends into old cheese territory fairly quickly and while not heaping on as much of the hollow pseudo Moore 'wit' as the previous efforts it does degrade to a few naff one liners and double entendres spread throughout the action. Bond hardly seems to remember what he went through in the beginning of the film and sinks back to his old sleazy ways.The film does boast a genuinely worthy villain to Bond rather than the rather pantomimish old men he usually gets and a few nice ideas are thrown into the story but at the end of the day it settles into it's nice niche of shallow action film and at this it does very well, but so did the last 3 entry's in the series and something a little different and darker would have been so good.Entertainment at it's finest but the film whets our appetite with a glimpse of Bond that we rarely see and then just as quickly takes it away.",Die Another Day
197,Ibuk,"You've seen the bad Bond movies, now see one of the worst",4,31 May 2009,"The awfulness of DAD is only beaten by the even more awful Diamonds are Forever. Two years ago I did a review of Die Another Day on IMDb, I decided to delete that one and post another review of it based upon my recent viewing. Well what can I say about DAD that hasn't been said before, all I say is that DAD is truly deserving of it's reputation as a Bond travesty. I have been on a Bond rewatch quest of late and decided that DAD should be next on my list. I had not seen DAD for a good number of years for one reason alone, I DESPISE IT. I have disliked it since I watched it on the cinema in 2002. I was hoping that a rewatch would change my opinion of it. Well it didn't if anything I despise it even more.What makes it DAD so frustrating is that it had such a promising opening sequence but then it goes downhill extremely fast. The second half for instance doesn't have that Bond feel to it and is just one long extended chase sequence. It simply doesn't have the ingredients that makes a classic Bond movie.Poor theme song by Madonna(and an even more despicable cameo by her) - Poorly scripted villains and even more appalling acted. - Poor Bond girl - John Cleese in a cringeworthy performance who isn't a patch on Desmond Llewyn who died during the filming of TWINE. - Poor gadgets, in particular the invisible car(I didn't know they started employing children to come up with gadgets for Bond movies).Brosnan's downfall had been a long time coming, the only Brosnan I cared for was Goldeneye(the first Bond movie I saw in the cinema). I dislike Tomorrow never dies and The World Is Not Enough even more. I knew by that logic that the next Bond movie would be even worse. But I never imagined that it would be this bad.Die Another Day makes me think that maybe the makers set out to make a truly despicable Bond movie and succeeded. If it weren't for the next Bond offering, the vastly superior Casino Royale I would have given up on the Bond franchise completely",Die Another Day
198,LuboLarsson,Good Bond film,6,1 August 2004,"I loved this in the Cinema although I think it loses a little when you watch it at home, although the DVD is one of the best I've ever seen, its packed with extras and even has an audio commentary by Brosnan, none of the other Bond actors bothered to do that, if they were asked that is? . Its a very over the top Bond film like You Only Live Twice or Moonraker so if you don't like those sort of Bond films then you probably won't like Die Another Day. I thought it was very good, Halle Berry looks fabulous and is an Oscar winning actress which no other Bond girl can claim to be. Some of the action sequences are superb especially the car chase on ice, its superb. Some dodgy CGI spoils things though, Bond films shouldn't need CGI as they have always led the way in stunts and action scenes, no other Hollywood movies come close apart from Swarzeneggers films with James Cameron at the helm. Brosnan is great in Die Another Day he just IS 007 now, sadly if rumours are to be believed this is his final 007 film, I think only GoldenEye is better than this one with Brosnan as Bond. Eric Bana or whoever takes over has a tough act to follow. One thing that does irk me a little about Die Another Day is the invisible car, I think that is very hard to swallow even for a 007 film it makes some of the gadgets in Roger Moore's films to be believable like the crocodile suits and submarines disguised as icebergs. Actually its fun to notice some old gadgets as 007 meets Q, who again is played by John Cleese. All in all a great Bond film thats not for everyone, as some of the other comments here prove! ***7/10***",Die Another Day

All of the magic of James Bond has remained steady for all of these years.  Halle Berry is rivetting. Judi Dench remains convincing and believable.  The special effects are breathtaking.

200,georgewilliamnoble,Surely The Worst Bond Film Of Them All.,3,1 October 2021,"19 years had passed since I saw Die Another Day and I remembered how disappointed I was by it. Years later a charity shop DVD find gave me a chance to re-evaluate what I regard along with A View To A Kill as the worst bond film of all. However I quickly found that time had improved nothing. The movie simply has the wrong tone, perhaps it try's to hard to impress and suffers from way to many idea's which are almost all poorly thought out and executed. Neither Roger Moore camp or Sean Connery sincere the film sinks in a deep pool of way out fantasy and the CGI looked rotten in 2002 and looks atrocious now. The CGI simply ruins the escapism it all looks so fake. To make the movie even worse is in my view is the central Bond performance of Pierce Brosnan who seems mostly embarrassed by it all. This is the movie with Halle Berry coming out of the water, OK she looks fabulous but having a equal co star just did not work for me. Finally the disappearing car was just one ridiculous concept to many but the climatic car chase summed up all that was wrong about this movie. It is dreadful and again all that CGI just ruins it but the toy gadget car 's are again just too way out and silly. This is a smug knowing film that the makers just got badly wrong, so has it any redeeming feature's, well not much but the swordfight in the historic London club was as good as it got. I found the making of video on the DVD bonus more interesting than the actual movie but you can see where they all went wrong, they simply messed it up while being convinced they were making something amazingly great! Certainly not for this Bond fan, so as I build up to the last Daniel Craig outing I wonder which way the pendulum will sway?Great, Medium, Poor Or Rotten?",Die Another Day
201,MrDeWinters,Not a Bond,1,14 October 2021,"This feels like more Die Hard than Bond. Too many cheap one liners. An invisible car? Pierce already too old. They always make the mistake to hire someone who is already too old to play Bond. Pierce's non-muscular physique isn't anyone convincing he can fight guys bigger and younger than him. Also, awful CGI.",Die Another Day
202,senortuffy,Dull addition to the series,6,21 June 2003,"Have to admit, this was a very disappointing effort.  The movie lacked any spark or originality.  It was just the same old stuff recycled from past Bond movies, right down to the space-based laser beam using diamonds (""Diamonds Are Forever""). I've enjoyed Pierce Brosnan's run as super agent 007.  He's struck the right balance of debonair Englishman and determined action hero, but the lines on his face were noticeable in this film and I wonder if he might be getting too old to do this stuff.Halle Berry does an adequate job as an American agent, but nothing memorable.  Rosamund Pike is stunningly beautiful as the double agent, but she doesn't add any zip to the film either.  Both decline to bare their breasts during the lovemaking scenes and on the whole were rather demure in their roles as Bond girls.  Maybe I'm just a male chauvenist pig, but I liked the unabashed sexuality in the original Bond films.Toby Stephens is the bad guy, a North Korean who's undergone DNA therapy that's changed his appearance to that of a westerner.  He snarls and struts his way through the paces of a typical Bond villain, but I found his performance flat and uninspiring.  Rick Yune plays another North Korean who's DNA transition is interrupted.  He looks like an evil character with his shaved head and albino pallor, but he isn't evil enough to make you care.By the way, don't ask me why it was so important for the Koreans to appear as westerners.  Or how they managed to launch a satellite weapon into space. Or where all the diamonds came from.  The plot is pretty flimsy and is just serviceable enough to hold the story together for the duration of the film.I don't know if there's any future for James Bond.  It seems like the current cast of characters has run its course.  Unless they can really come up with an interesting script, I think maybe it's time to pull the plug on this franchise.",Die Another Day
203,extravaluejotter,"""Die, Director, Die!"" - Pierce Bows Out on a Bum Note",3,23 April 2006,"It's a shame that the last Bond movie with Pierce Brosnan as 007 is the weakest. Personally, I blame the director.Lee Tamahori's pointless pop-video gimmicks highlight the surface glamour of the Bond film franchise. Unfortunately they also highlight the weaknesses of the screenplay. Criticising a Bond film for formulaic scripting is a bit like criticising an elephant for being grey, but with Tamahori's visual tics disrupting the flow of the screenplay, ""Die Another Day"" lurches drunkenly from scene to scene: it's like cinematic motion sickness. Other recent Bond directors like Martin Campbell and Michael Apted have worked with very similar scripts (as well as Pierce Brosnan as 007) and turned out much more pacey and excitingly watchable films.Pierce Brosnan and the other actors (save one) do their best with what they're given, script-wise, but Tamahori seems intent on reducing them to action figures on a cardboard set in his garage. He directs like he's just been given access to steadicams, aerial photography, CGI and a digital editing suite for the first time. It's hard to believe that he's directed a few major movies in his career, because ""Die Another Day"" looks like it was handled by a spotty geek fresh out of film school. I expect that Tamahori is a fan of John Woo, another director who likes slow-mo action, swooping camera moves and flashy cuts. Unfortunately Lee, you're no John Woo when it comes to stringing these glitzy MTV effects together. Compare ""Die Another Day"" to John Woo's equally preposterous ""Face/Off"" and I think that most people will see the similarities in direction, but agree that the Woo film is the better of the two.I also have to say that Madonna's cameo role in ""Die Another Day"" is a waste of screen time. She's a bad actor and to add insult, her attempt at a Bond theme sounds like someone with a squeaky voice shouting ""Hey, I'm doing a Bond theme! Isn't that great?"" Well, no Madge, it's not really.Another raspberry is awarded to the special effects and design crews for numerous unconvincing shots. Many of the action shots including the actors are clearly green screened, The Hong Kong harbour shot was obviously done in a studio and Bond's CGI para-surfing escape from the glacier is blatantly and badly faked. The location scout should never work again, either. I know that it's not possible to film in North Korea, much less drop luxury cars nose-first into its paddy fields, but Suffolk is Suffolk even if you have a water buffalo in the shot. Likewise, you can build the most realistic Korean fisherman's hut in the world but it still looks out of place on the north Devon coast. No-one goes to see a Bond movie expecting gritty realism and Oscar-winning performances. Ian Fleming's books established the Bond formula and the film franchise continued with it. The books and films all share the same basic structure, very similar villains and enough guns, girls and gadgetry to mis-direct our attention from the re-hashed plots......Unless, like Mr Tamahori, the director keeps speeding things up, slowing things down and chucking the camera around like it's a toy. That ham-fisted mis-direction turned ""Die Another Day"" into ""Another Summer BlockBuster"" instead of what could have been a good Bond film. He clearly didn't understand the material that he was working with, unlike Mr Brosnan or the other Bond directors.",Die Another Day

It may not be all Danial's fault, the producers took a lot of the fun out of the films which all along had been one of the series greatest strengths, maybe they thought they were catering to a younger audience or had to be more politically correct or something, but for me it just didn't work, give me the old Bond any day!",Die Another Day

But it's the manner of 007's demise that's the real tragedy  his credibility killed in a car crash of a script; his cool strangled by ham-fisted editing and utterly random direction.Fade in: unoriginal pre-credits sequence, lifted straight from GoldenEye. Fade to: Madonna's excruciating theme song'. And so it begins. Having saved the world around 20 times, Bond is now deemed useless. So why bother trading him for the world's most dangerous terrorist? He's goes to Cuba to meet a guy who owes him a favour. Who is this guy and why does he owe Bond a favour? Who cares about explanations, it just suits the already-flailing plot'. And why Cuba? Because Halle Berry looks terrific emerging from the Caribbean, that's why.Cue the first of several exchanges packed with not-even-subtle-enough-to-be-double-entendres: `Hi, I'm Jinx  I'm hot, horny, and obviously more than just a great piece of tail.

Is it also true that you are developing a very powerful and possibly planet-threatening thingy in space?'Criminal Genius: `That's right. Can't you see I'm up to no good with my perpetual sneer? Now if you'll excuse me, I have to tie a damsel to a railway track and twiddle my moustache.'Criminal Genius's Publicist: `And I'm not all I seem.'Bond meets Criminal Genius: cue gratuitous Madonna cameo and fencing scene. Criminal Genius inexplicably invites Bond to his ice palace in Iceland where he can divulge, and give Bond every chance of scuppering, his evil plan. That Jinx girl is invited too. Much 00-silliness ensues, involving an invisible car, amateurish sub-PlayStation CG effects (who actually thought anyone aged 18 months or over would buy it?) and history's most over-extended car chase. Advice to anyone thinking about calling it quits at this point: do it. Because when the long-overdue (and equally interminable) finale lumbers around, it's another entirely predictable let-down.This is an unmitigated, genre-killing disaster.

However, this time Bond is captured, taken to a prison to be tortured and after a year there is finally released for Zau, Sun's right hand man. After escaping custody he tracks down Zau to a gene therapy clinic where he is in the process of being completely physically changed, but whose paying for the treatment and why? After the two tedious Bond films that had come before it, I needed this to be a true Bond spectacular and it did not disappoint. The action set pieces are good, the fights are well choreographed, Pierce is great as Bond and suits the role so well here it is magnificent to watch him. Yes the CGI is a bit cr*p in bits, but nonetheless, this was a supreme piece of entertainment at the pictures, so why the low score? Well, that's the thing about the Bond films. There are two types; the Bond spectacular, all guns and explosions and non-stop entertainment, like ""Moonraker"", and then there's the thrillers, more grounded and slower paced that work off intrigue, great script and subterfuge, like ""Casino Royalle"" or ""For your eyes only"". Sadly the thrillers always age better than the blockbuster and even though it had been immensely popular at the pictures and I really enjoyed it, when ""Casino"" appeared it immediately spelt the end of enjoyment for ""Die another day"".Do I feel bad that this one effectively fooled me the way ""Dark Knight"" fooled so many others into thinking it was a good film ...No, I don't. Everyone has films that they see the first time and love, and then later watch with regret and remorse when they realise they were wrong.

207,TheFilmGuy1,A Bond Movie That's All Over The Place,6,19 September 2014,"This bond film starts off quite well. A cool intro that involves the North Koreans and Bond getting captured? I'm in. It has an awesome chase and some cool villains. I even like the opening song by Madonna, which i'm sure some people hate. But as the movie goes along, it starts to falter. While the Bond movies have always had cheesy and unbelievable elements to them, they generally keep one foot in reality. The issue with this movie is that it starts to become a video game. We see so many cheesy moments and characters and situations that you literally start to feel like at any moment a loading screen is going to pop up and suddenly you're going to need to grab your controller.The story could have been cool. The main idea is that the North Koreans want to invade South Korea and take it back. A lot of awesome things can be done with that, but the movie does it in such a cheesy and over the top way. Things like an experimental gene therapy that turns an Asian into a white guy in order to disguise himself just seems... weird. The Icarus satellite could have been handled realistically but isn't. A lot doesn't work. Scenes like the parachute surfing scene are downright terrible, which brings me to another massive issue, the CGI. There are moments here that you can't even believe are happening. It looks downright unfinished. But There are some fun scenes that, even if cheesy, I enjoy, like the ice car chase and the fencing scene, or even the final plane scene, which features Rosamund Pike in a really sexy outfit for no reason... but I'm certainly not complaining. This time around, we get less of those darker and dramatic moments from Brosnan's Bond, which I blame on the script. He does good with what he has. I also personally didn't like Halle Berry in this. I just don't think its a very good performance. I know they were thinking of giving her a spin off movie, and I gotta say I am glad they didn't. Who the hell thought that would work? Rick Yune gives a cool performance as a guy who has diamonds in his face. Now let's talk about Toby Stephens... his performance here is... so weird. I guess it could be because he's playing a guy who was once a crazy North Korean, but it feels so over the top and cheesy that I can't help but laugh.Overall, this movie has some scenes I really do genuinely enjoy, but sadly it's a mess in the end. It's sad to admit that because it was the first Bond movie I saw in theaters as a kid. I even saw it twice. But it doesn't hold up. I do say I liked the Moneypenny ""virtual Bond sex scene"". It gave me a good laugh. ""It's rather hard isn't it?"" ""Yes, very...""",Die Another Day
208,C22Man,In many ways it died straight away,5,24 July 2015,"Bond Review.Title: Appropriately Bond sounding.Pre-Titles: Bond infiltrates a North Korean military base ran by Colonel Moon, before being caught. He escapes via hovercraft as a chase ensures where Moon is killed and Bond is taken prisoner. This is a fast-paced and exciting opener, with some great stunt work and intense fights. It's certainly a little too CGI heavy in places, but it throws us into the main storyline straight away.Theme Song: Madonna's title track is truly dreadful. The main melody isn't bad, but the jittery electronics just sound awkward and her auto-tuned vocals are ear grating. There are also some really corny lyrics, while the song keeps the same flat tune playing over and over again.Plot: Bond is traded for a terrorist named Zao after 14 months, he then decides to track Zao down himself. Bond soon learns of Zao's connection to billionaire Gustav Graves and, with the help of American agent Jinx, sets out to uncover his satellite based scheme. The plot is pretty dull and very convoluted. The main story is set- up well enough, but it never really goes anyway interesting and Graves' plan is way too goofy. I also wished they'd have explored the effects of captivity on Bond instead of throwing it away and trying to shoehorn so many characters into proceedings.James Bond: Pierce Brosnan is on autopilot here and you can't really blame him. Of course he is still enjoyable in the role and delivers his line with credibility, but his material is pretty bad throughout and he looks bored for most of the film as a result. He's also starting to show his age at this point and doesn't look that believable in the action scenes.Bond Girls: Halle Berry is possibly the worst Bond girl of all time as Jinx. She's meant to be a tough and stylish agent, but she spends most of the film looking confused and having to be saved. To be fair her dialogue is absolutely horrid and pretty much all of it is bad one-liners, but Berry is extremely wooden and has no chemistry with Brosnan with their first scene together being comically bad. Villains: Toby Stephens tries hard but Graves is such a flat main villain. Stephens succeeds in making him slimy and obnoxious whilst looking stylish, yet his dialogue is so dull and if anything he's just an irritating presence who lacks threat. Rosamund Pike is very good as MI6 traitor Frost. She's brings an understated elegance to the role, is believable whether good or bad and manages to make some dodgy dialogue sound good. Rick Yune is good too as the diamond faced Zao. He has a unique look, a creepy presence and brings a much needed threat.Support: Judi Dench is as solid as ever, carrying on her unfazed approach and showing that the character does care about her agents. Kenneth Tsang does a decent job as Graves' conflicted father and John Cleese does an okay job as the new Q having a fun briefing with Bond scene.Action: Too much CGI hurts a lot of the action here. The attack on the Cuban genetics centre is entertaining enough but nothing special. The fencing scene is fantastic, it's a really inventive sequence for Bond and features some enjoyably vicious swordplay. The car chase across ice is also a really good piece with plenty of excitement, but the weird editing harms it. The climax on Graves' plane is terrible, the fights are slow and cumbersome as there's a lack of danger despite the setting.Score: David Arnold returns once again and offers another very good score. It has more electronic and techno influenced elements that work very well in the action scenes, whilst many of his compositions continue to sound effectively exotic or atmospheric when they are put to use.Production Values: Lee Tamahori's directing is simply okay, but not very smooth given the films more action-packed tone and a more adventurous directing style would have helped it a lot. The editing is pretty terrible. Certain shots are sped-up for no apparent reason and some parts feature slow motion that's awkward, it all looks a bit gimmicky too. The overload of CGI is another big issue. It's so clear in most of the action scenes that it harms them greatly and really takes you out of the film. The weakest point is the writing though. None of the characters are written well, with Jinx and Graves being incredibly one dimensional, and the dialogue is truly terrible with most of it being overly corny and almost none of it being memorable. The invisible car and Graves genetically altering his look are especially illogical. The locations are pretty good however with Cuba used well and many of the sets look fantastic. Conclusion: Die Another Day sees Brosnan depart the series on a low. For the most part it is an entertaining entry, but it has so many flaws that hold it back. This is very much a film of two halves. The first half is silly but good fun and the stuff in Cuba feels like classic Bond, but as soon as we enter Iceland it all goes downhill fast as things get really absurd. Brosnan looks bored, Berry is simply awful, Graves is a dull villain, the editing is weird and the writing is some of the worst of the series. The score is great, the action is exciting and Rosamund Pike is especially good, but these only help make it just about enjoyable. Things definitely got a bit too excessive here and in a way a new interpretation felt needed.",Die Another Day
209,Mikew3001,Great 40th anniversary 007 adventure,9,30 December 2002,"Expectations were high for the 20th James Bond movie in 40 years. ""Die Another Day"", directed by New Zealand's Lee Tamahori, is Pierce Brosnan's fourth mission as 007 since 1995. This time, Bond is captured during an undercover job in North Korea, kept for 14 months in prison, tortured and finally left free as a beaten up, long-haired and bearded wreck. But of course Bond takes revenge and to follow his enemies, Korean Colonel Moon and the mysterious business man Gustav Graves, through Cuba, England and Iceland back to North Korea for the final confrontation.Halle Berry, the big star of the picture next to Brosnan, plays the American agent Jinx Jordan, a kind of female Felix Leiter. He role is not reduced to the former parts of the so-called ""Bond girls"", but plays a kind of ""Bond buddy"" and lover role at the same time. John Cleese plays the ""Q"" for the first time after a short introduction as Q's assistance R. in the last movie and Desmond ""Q"" Llewelyn's death in 1999. Samantha ""Moneypenny"" Bond and Judi ""M"" Dench are also back in action again.The rest of the cast is played by rather unknown, but superb young actors: Rick Yun's Colonel Moon, with a face scratched by an impact of diamonds, plays the brutal henchman with a strong accent and with a bit more than just a supporting actor. Toby Stephen's Gustav Graves is the perfect counterpart for Bond, an arrogant and greasy high society snob like a bad mirror image of 007 itself. Newcomer Rosamund Pike complete the triangle of death as witty, sexy and ice-cold Miranda Frost, an expert in sword fighting and great pretending.The story itself is quite simple, but decorated with lots of high-tech gadgets, computer-generated special effects, action scenes, car chases and fights. The high points this time are a hoovercraft chase across a mining field, a car chase across the eternal ice in Iceland, the big final in an airplane and - my favorite scene - a brilliant and hard-fought sword duel between Bond and Graves. The low point is the focus on too many special effects and science fiction elements (like Graves secret space weapon ""Icarus"" or an invisible Aston Martin as Bond's car) that are bringing the new Bond movies from good post-cold-war-stories like ""Goldeneye"" back to the dumb high-tech-gadget-Disneyland of ""Moonraker"" with Bond in space. I hope they will concentrate on better scripts and less special effects for the next Bond movies!The trailer is great as ever with lots of action and explosion around, and for the first time the credits and title song are used as integrated part of the plot, showing scenes of Bond's imprisonment and torture next to the well-known stylish visuals and girlie silhouettes.What else can be said? The settings are great as ever, with the bleak landscapes of Iceland, the tourist attractions of Cuba, Corea, Hong Kong and London town as locations for this adventure. There are some witty and funny dialogues, but David Arnold's third Bond sound track lacks the style of his his former works as the score has some trouble to follow all the unusual hardcore action in this Bond flick. The title theme is sung by Madonna this time, a groovy electronica pop track that was rewarded by the producers with a small supporting role for the pop queen.As a funny bonus for the big bunch of Bond admirers there are many references to the long 007 movie history. Jinx Jordan's first appearance is a funny copy of Ursula Andress' beach scene in ""Dr. No"" (1962). The Aston Martin is back in action again, and during a visit to Q's laboratories, Bond faces the knife shoe of ""From Russia With Love"" and the portable rocket of ""Thunderball"". Moneypenny receives her first hot kiss from Bond in 40 years, but... well, check it out yourself! All in all, ""Die Another Day"" is a perfect anniversary for the James Bond series with great action scenes, but a little bit too much technology and science fiction all around.",Die Another Day
210,movieman-200,Improbability seems to be the order of the day in this Bond flick,6,12 June 2005,"It appears as though director Lee Tamahori's Die Another Day (2002) will be the final film in which Pierce Brosnon is known for playing British secret agent extraordinaire, James Bond. Assigned to a rendezvous with North Korea's Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee), to capture terrorist, Zhao (Rick Yune) Bond's mission is compromised and he is taken prisoner. After being severely tortured, Bond is traded to MI6 but relieved of his duties and blamed for leaking information. After M (Judi Dench) confides that she can no longer trust him, Bond escapes to Cuba, and teams up with sexy diver, Jinx (Halle Berry) a rogue agent who believes that the key to Zhao lies with mysterious British billionaire Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens).The plot digresses therein to an element of the macabre laced in fantastic plastic surgeries that have made Colonel Moon's son and Graves one in the same, thanks to a genetic conversion that, so we are told, is both painful and short lived. Borrowing heavily on the doomsday devices first introduced in Diamonds Are Forever and The Man With The Golden Gun, Graves has harnessed the power of the sun in a destructive intergalactic ray gun that can be pointed at any place in the world  hence, he intends to hold the world powers for ransom, lest they befall the awesome power of his device. Improbability seems to be the order of the day in this Bond film; in everything from having a posh palace and hotel constructed entirely out of ice, but where the guests invited to Grave's stylish party are never cold; to having the doomsday device melt a polar ice cap, but not the frozen palace  at least not the room where Jinx has been entombed, this Bond film asks that you throw caution and logic to the wind and just go along for the ride. Bond drives an invisible Astin Martin  another impossibility made possible by digital movie making. Madonna makes an unexpected, but welcome edition to the cast as Verity  the referee to a particularly nasty bit of sword play between Graves and Bond. It is the highpoint of an otherwise stagy and clichéd film.MGM/UA's 2-disc DVD delivers a visual presentation that is exceptional. Colors are stylized, rich and vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. Blacks are deep and velvety. Whites are pristine. There is no hint of either film or digital grain for an image that is smooth and wholly satisfying. The audio is 5.1 and packs a wallop in bass. Sonically, this is an enthralling movie experience. This is the only Bond film to be given a 2-disc treatment and, at least for the most part, the inclusion of another disc seems warranted. There are extensive galleries, various making of featurettes which delve thoroughly into the making of this film and a promo for the video game version of this film. There's also a theatrical trailer and television promos to investigate.",Die Another Day
211,bushtony,Die...diabolical,1,4 April 2011,"There are Bond films that are so lacking in self-consciousness they just bring a smile to your face and make you feel good. Then there are some that are so resolutely self-satisfied, egocentric and hideously sanctimonious, believing they've got it so right when they've got it so wrong, it just succeeds in hacking one off. DAD is in the latter category. It is delusional as it presents as a smart and sassy crowd pleaser, slapping itself vigorously on the back for it's ""cleverness,"" when it's actually a misfiring, poorly conceived, badly scripted, appallingly acted, ineptly directed, chunk-blowing no-brainer that succeeds in insulting the audience like few Bond films ever have before. Those in the audience who were not insulted - you failed to notice, but you were in fact slashed and burned big time. Lack of insight has protected you this time, my children. Now, back on the short bus. Still, to be fair, like all the Brosnan movies, although it's largely a brain-bending bum-steer of a Bond film, it has some plus points as well as minus points. For me this is how they stack up: The Plus:  The hyper-stylised torture motif played-out through the opening credits.  Bond in captivity.  Toby Stephen's sneering portrait of upper-middle class nouveau-riche Brit villainy.  Rosamund Pike – cool, gorgeous, willowy, Brit beauty  The sword fight – well-choreographed, good fun  Judi Dench as a particularly callous and ruthless M  The Ice Palace set design.  The scientifically feasible invisible car (yes, it has a basis in fact)  Some of the cinematography is lovely  Cuban locations  Disused part of the London underground as an MI6 enclave  The cars are fabulous  Bond sucks on a big Cuban (cigar)  Love that shirt And, one of the best, most superbly ironic and witty one-liners in any Bond movie ever: ""Ice?"" ""If you can spare it."" And, and, and, the hovercraft chase - although an unlikely choice of vehicle due to being impossible to handle at speed - was unique and a bitch to get right. We must also know that the air cushion supporting a hovercraft would set off a pressure sensitive landmine as surely as Jack Black tap dancing through the location in mining boots. Still, let that one pass. The Minus:  Brosnan's worst performance ever as Bond. Introducing Coma-boy. ""Doctor, will he ever regain consciousness?"" ""Maybe when the pay cheque arrives, Mrs Brozza.""  Appallingly bad one-liners delivered appallingly badly by a man sleepwalking towards payday with a self-satisfied smirk on his chops. Good for him, though.  Rehashed satellite weapon McGuffin (DAF, GE). OK to recycle, providing it's done well (main lesson being - TSWLM *take note).  Bond is the most well-nourished torture victim/captive ever on screen. Koreans feed their captive on Pizza Hut, Burger King and Krispy Kremes these days?  Transcendental Zen-Buddhist skills to lower heart rate. Huh?  One years worth of filthy, matted beard removed by a Philishave that would actually be hard pressed to razor the hairs from a particularly languid gooseberry.  Worst ever Bond song – no tune or melody that could be used as a signature by Arnold during the film. Techno-drone rubbish.  Diamond-faced henchman. Pair of tweezers could have removed them in 1-3 minutes flat. Was it a fashion statement?  Gene-transplant malarkey.  PowerRangers suit.  Virtual reality sex scene (Moneypenny/Bond). Crass and crude, unnecessary. Ruinous of the frisson their relationship should have thrived on.  Lousy, dopey direction by Tamahori for the most part.  CGI surfing – if CGI is to be used, at least spend some money on it. Playstation 2 games do it better and more creatively. Do it right, or don't do it  Madonna parody – sorry, cameo.  Halle Berry (""Yo Mama,"" etc). Whatever happened to her acting skills? Sorry, scratch the word skills. And acting. Might as well.  ""Put yer back inta it!"" Tick – gurn – grimace – letch!  Bond submerged in sub-zero water with nary a shiver or a quiver.  It's not suitably self-aware or bright enough to even be a parody. Suspension of disbelief is a given in the Bonds - but the sledge-hammering it gets here is a little too overpowering even for me. Oh, and swimming miles in Tokyo harbour - one of the most effluent, filthy, virulently toxic stretches of water in the world would actually put Hellboy in intensive care for a month. Please, don't get me started on the unscathed super-cars that plummet thousands of feet into a rice paddy without a scratch. Personally, the sum of the minus parts outweigh that of the plus in terms of my capacity to enjoy this movie as a Bond film or a film in general. Too many WTF moments to maintain any credibility. It may not be the least creatively successful in the series, but they must have sweated nights to try and make it so. It's a fine line to tread - establishing clear or sheer impossibility rendered in a style that successfully engenders suspension of disbelief, or a feeling in the audience that this is so good it doesn't matter if it's totally off the wall. It needs skillful handling, scripting and execution. DAD ain't got any of those. Maybe if you want to make a good Bond film, choosing a director who dresses as a woman, cruises sailors on shore leave and advocates the mind-numbingly stupid James Bond-as-codename theory to the public was not that great a place to start. Maybe his ""feel"" and understanding for the subject matter was a little off-kilter from the outset. After which, the whole shebang was duct taped to a greased day-glow toboggan speeding all the way to hell.",Die Another Day

It could have been good, but Halle Berry is terrible, the music video editing just didn't fit, and why on earth would you do digital effects when you can do real stunts??  That was always one of the great things about the bond movies, the stunts were real, and spectacular, this one didn't have and spectacular stunts.

213,vasco_cid,The best Bond Film (Goldeneye gets close),6,30 January 2003,"Fourty years have passed since the first screen adventures of the British spy sent by Her Majesty to save the world from crime. This time, the menace comes from Korea and some diamond laundry business to which James Bond is sent to solve.Die Another Day also marks the first Bond film where Bond doesn't get out of the first battle in one peace, winning; he is defeated and is kept as a recluse until MI6 decides it is time to get him back, but not to get back to work: he is permanently pushed away from service, until he digs out some valuable information on the villain.If between Pierce Brosnan's era it was difficult to distinguish the best and the worst, that problem seems to be vanished. Die Another Day not only is the best of Brosnan, but the best of the whole series. Everything is right in its place: the story, the characters, the unmissable witty sexual jokes. Also the producers knew where to aim for the Bond girls: Halle Berry excuses presentations as the best bond girl to date, and Rosamund Pike plays the perfect femme fatalle, that plays good and bad at the same time, never loosing charm and beauty. Also the producers' decision of changing directors in every movie was right: at first I seriously doubted if Lee Tamahori would be the perfect choice: he was. The action sequences were the best in the series, the characters are more intertwined between each other, and the story is never pulled aside as being secondary. The special effects were very good, as well as the sound design. However what deserves more recognition is undoubtly Bond's theme ""Die Another Day"" by Madonna, it is so good that even surpasses the fantastic Goldeneye.If only every Bond movie was like Die Another Day, there was no need for other espionage/thriller/action movies. Very good and Very much fun!Undoubtly 10 out of 10!",Die Another Day

215,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,Great film promoting peace and prosperity in North Korea.,10,17 September 2021,"I think this spy film highlights very well that although there are some bad guys in North Korea, there are also plenty of competent leaders there, who aspire peace and harmony with the International Community.One example of a diligent leader in Korea is Mr Kim Jong-un, who I'm proud to say is a very good friend of mine, since he is doing his utmost to manifest peace and prosperity between the North and South.The two Koreas - which are still technically at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended without a peace treaty - have waged a propaganda war for decades.However, I'm sure that with a positive mind-set and constructive peacebuilding that will soon be a thing of the past; and reconciliation can commence between Koreans in the North and South - the people in the two lands jointly deconstructing cultural and political barriers, so that a new Korean Union can be established; where business and commerce can take place peacefully and freely.The future between those two sister countries must undoubtedly be one of peace and harmony :)",Die Another Day
216,TheEtherWalk,Good movie nearly destroys itself,1,30 November 2002,"Die Another Day is an above-average movie that nearly sinks itself with poor cliches and painful escape scenes.First off, I'll talk about some of the negative points of the movie. The most dreadful parts of it include the parachute-surfboard scene which was incredibly hokey and nearly ruined the whole thing. The movie also includes the most painful one-line cliche ever heard in a Bond movie, ""Saved by the bell!"" You may want to plug your ears when you get to the waterfall scene, even though you won't be able to drown out the groans from the audience around you.What was up with the cloak-car, as well? Whoever came up with  such an obviously Star-Trek like gadget was out of their mind.As for Rick Yune's character, couldn't they have removed the diamonds from his face? It looked cool but didn't make a lot of sense.Now for the more redeeming qualities of the film. These include the swordfight between Bond and Graves, which was extremely well done, and most of the first half-hour of the movie is excellent. It starts to go downhill when Halle Berry enters and the cheesy innuendos start.
Some of the end-scenes are almost anime-like in the way the drama unfolds. The car chase scenes are cool and I liked the way that Graves is like Bond in so many ways. They are perfect adversaries. The theme song by Madonna was so-so, but at least there were no naked sillouhettes spinning on pistols. The fire-effect was cool.Overall, it is not the best Bond film (that would go to The Living Daylights), and could have been a lot better. 6/10",Die Another Day
217,TheEtherWalk,Ian Fleming Is Spinning In His Grave,1,3 December 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This has got to be, without a doubt, the end of the good Bond movies. This turkey ranks down there with View to a Kill but not quite as bad as Man with The Golden Gun. Probably the least Bondish (compared to just about every Moore or Connery film) entry, this has some of the worst dialogue, stunts and just plain stupidity of any.SPOILERS AHEADSomeone, please PLEASE explain the logic to me. The man falls off a waterfall, survives, and instead of rejoining his father in the military, he goes to Iceland (?), starts a diamond mine as a front, builds a doomsday satellite to help his country win the war (?) against South Korea, and in just over a year he has gotten plastic surgery so he can't be recognized (?) and is a millionaire about to be knighted by the queen (?) and is a bachelor.I don't know about you, but this makes me want to climb to the top of a building and scream WHYYYYYY???????? to whoever wrote this crap and subsequently flushed the whole Bond series down the toilet.ANOTHER SPOILERDid anyone else notice how incredibly fake the sword looked at the end, when Frost has it pressed to Jinx's neck? (Didn't want to harm the star player, now did they) They could have at least made the side facing the camera look sharp, but it looks rounded off and plasticky.YET ANOTHER SPOILERAnd why didn't BOND JUST SHOOT HIM??? Why shoot the chandelier, for god's sake? He's two feet away from you in the water! JUST SHOOT HIM! CRAP CRAP CRAP! Many thanks to Robert Wade and Neale Purvis for MANGLING everything this franchise had left into a FUBAR, tangled mess that is virtually unsalvageable.",Die Another Day
218,rjsf96,Bond Hits 40,7,30 October 2015,"It is with great hesitation that I state my almost unabashed love for Die Another Day. It was the first Bond film I ever saw and remains as magical an experience watching it at the age of nineteen as it did when I viewed it at the mere age of seven.James Bond is not the agent he used to be, age apparently has taken its toll. That and the inconvenience of being locked up in prison in North Korea for eighteen months. Bond has been betrayed by an insider; his search leads him to a wealthy international celebrity Gustav Graves to see what his Icarus space program is.Perhaps it is best to start off with Die Another Day's flaws and get them out of the way as swiftly as possible. Halle Berry never suits the role of a Bond girl well. Granted she is far more believable than Denis Richards, but that's not exactly a Grande feat anyway is it? The trouble with Jinx is the way the character is written into the story. She homages the famous shot of Honey Ryder coming out of the sea and yet does not come close to giving the great performance that Ursula Andress does in Dr No. Berry just does not say her lines right and ends up overcooking them until they lose their power much like she continues to do in the X-Men franchise.This is more of a slight niggle than anything substantial, but Die Another Day does favour CGI far more than practical stunts and effects work; prime examples of this crop into the second half of the film. The laser fight sequence and the tsunami surfing Bond take things one step too far.Alas, let me stop giving fuel to the fire and focus on everything that Die Another Day does right. Pierce Brosnan is truly phenomenal and I am running out of adjectives to describe his performances in these films. Nobody does it better than Brosnan that much will always be certain.The set pieces are endlessly inventive from the hover board sequence in North Korea to a sword fight gone wildly out of control against the irritable Gustav Graves. It must be said that the first hour of Die Another Day is more in keeping with the traditional style of the franchise. I wonder whether this was an intentional choice by Director Lee Tamahori. As the second half is Bond with the instruction manual torn to shreds. Invisible cars! Multiple lasers! Enhanced plastic surgery! For many this is where the film loses itself amid the chaos of CGI effects. For me it is where Die Another Day breaks free from tradition and has a new found spring in its step. Who cares whether the plot does not make the slightest bit of sense? This is Bond at his most thrilling, unhinged and gloriously gadget based. As Q states with Bond's new car ""Aston Martin call it the Vanquish, we call it the Vanish"". Even Bond expresses his praise ""Oh very good"". Much of the last hour takes place in Iceland with an Ice Palace being the main attraction here.Gustav Graves makes for a dazzling villain (not sparkling, that attribute belongs to the diamond studded Zao). Being as cocksure as he is, it is cathartic when Bond takes his revenge upon the villainous schemer. Miranda Frost is a tricky Bond girl to get a measure of. But she sure is one of the highlights of Die Another Day and in all honesty that means a lot.Die Another Day is not for everyone. It's ultimately too reliant on CGI work that does not mesh together well with the rest of the film. But it is packed with memorable scenes, fast and thrilling action and enough gadgets to make sure that it dodges the last few hurdles and sprints across the finish line. Even if it is an exhausting film, it sure is unconventional and discards the rule book when it comes to Bond. In the end Die Another Day is more than worth the risks it takes with the franchise.",Die Another Day
219,thomvic,Feels like Bond got lost in a science fiction flick,5,30 May 2011,"Brosnan is one of my family's favourites as Bond and I think he does a good job of it. Goldeneye in my opinion is his best one because I loved the plot, the locations, the Bond girls and it was fun and felt more rooted down to earth.Die Another Day (DAD) feels like like a cross between a Science Fiction Matrix that somehow found its way to a Bond film. Brosnan feels quite flat in his role along with a plot that seems quite far fetched with so many things happening it is a bit mind boggling. I won't get into it since everyone probably already knows what it is about but the things that happen. An invisible car, riding a tidal wave, an ice sculpted hotel/palace in Iceland (it doesn't know that much there? not to mention Halle Berry who looks fantastic but doesn't add much to the Bond Girl. I think she has too much star power to really make her a Bond Girl and hence it should have gone to a lesser known actress.And the lines feel so corny and cliché. 'I am Mr Kill' - 'There's a name to die for.' And some of the shots with slo-mo and almost Matrix like shots as well. This is James Bond not the Matrix! I think they tried to add to much in to make it seem cool and unique but it isn't necessary to have this.Then you have the whole face transformation thing. Won't mention anything else here but that was just a bit ummm.....stupid? So yes this is definitely the weakest Bond film from Brosnan. It is still watchable but so much disbelief has to be suspended in this. Yes I'm aware we are talking about Bond but when you start thinking they took something from science fiction, then no one can blame you.",Die Another Day
220,stp43,The Most Lavish And Exciting Bond,8,9 October 2004,"Warning - possible spoilers.I had declared Goldeneye to be the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films, and in terms of plot and character interplay it remains such, but Die Another Day runs a close second in terms of plot and action, and is superior in the overall SFX used.The film does suffer from the cheesy use of The Matrix-influenced computerized panning and turning as well as needless slo-mo shots (notably at the end in the confrontation between the main villain and another before Bond jumps into action). Such shots are a distraction, not an asset.It is the plot, though, that really gets the film going and leads to the lavish SFX finale. For almost the first time in the entire Bond series the villain makes sense because he is not some implausible rogue but an agent for an international predator state - in this case North Korea. The entire Bond series until now had foolishly shied away from this angle (other than SPECTRE's employer in You Only Live Twice and Yaphet Kotto's Kananga, leader of a small island state in Live And Let Die) and instead emphasized rogue business leaders, rogue generals, and the like. They could get away with it to a certain extent, especially with SPECTRE and what we now know about the extent of international terrorist networks, but by Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough the rogue angle had worn out its believability.Thus it is refreshing and adds new life to the series that the enemy is a predator state, not a rogue. Bond is betrayed and despite a spectacular chase captured and subjected to torture in North Korea, eventually freed in an exchange of prisoners. HMSS, though, has revoked Bond's license to kill because they believe he revealed the names of agents under drug-induced interrogation during his capture, but Bond knows his betrayer was a Korean terrorist named Zhao, and he escapes and ""recruits"" a Chinese Intelligence officer to help him find Zhao. But as his investigation proceeds, he must learn about a mysterious and flamboyant British billionaire, Gustav Graves, whose specialty is harvesting diamonds, and whose main project is a spaceborne mirror that can project solar light and heat anywhere in the world, and when he presents evidence of a connection between Graves and Zhao, HMSS returns his license to kill, leading to the film's best exchange, between Bond and the new head of HMSS' Quartermaster Branch within the branch's new underground base, within which it stores ""all the old relics,"" a scene that deliberately evokes memories of the entire Bond series from James' trick briefcase from From Russia With Love to his Thunderball jetpack; also particularly visible are props from Octopussy, and it all closes with John Cleese's evocation of Desmond Llywellen's most famous line from the series as he presents James' new car.Bond eventually learns the truth about Graves' spaceborne mirror when it is changed to a laser cannon capable of destroying any object - arguably this is what Goldeneye should have been. Bond also learns the truth about Graves' love interest, Miranda Frost, who lives up to her surname well, all leading to the climatic showdown as Graves' laser cannon begins carving a relentless path of destruction on Earth.Now you may have noticed I have not mentioned the film's much-hyped co-star - the reason is that Halle Berry's Jinx Johnson serves no purpose in this film. She has a completely pointless fight scene against Miranda Frost that could have been cut entirely without disrupting anything in the film, and Berry's presence ultimately slows the film down.Even so, you'll want to Die Another Day with James Bond.",Die Another Day
221,CihanVercan,"Die Another Day means Landscapes, Gadgets, non-Visual but Virtual Effects in Bond literature",7,14 August 2009,"There is one of the widest cluster of spectators ever possible for a franchised movie. There is its own fans. For almost half a century from the old generations to the youth it is always advised that the 007-Bond movies are the best action & thriller of all. Yet to watch Die Another Day there are so many other reasons! Relying on the protection of its confidence and splendour, Die Another Day sight sees some of the larger-than-life and glamorous centres of the earth. In ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" Bond has visited Hong-Kong several times; and he does once more in Die Another Day. We are going to see Cuba for the second time after ""Golden Eye"", and again for the second time we will be in Bond's top-secret MI6 office in London,U.K after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". We also have a chance to see unforgettably spectacular views from Hawaii's virgin hills and from Iceland. In fact, wherever it says it's North Korea, it's location is still Hawaii. Some of the North Korean scenes like the elaborate hovercraft chase scene were shot in U.K. as well.It is joyful to catch homage moments in respect to the previous Bond movies like the conspiracy plot at the presidential suite in the Hong Kong hotel with the Chinese masseuse beauty, and Halle Berry's first appearance moment where she wore an orange bikini with a white belt attached to an army knife. Best of all -the most alluring of all- were the gadgets and equipments used throughout the movie: * Hovercrafts** Electromagnetic ring *** Bounding mines**** Laser cutting watch ***** Giant Space Laser Mirror named ""Icarus""-a satellite weapon that directs a blazing ray of heat at its landed or aerial global targets ****** Switchblade Jet Gliders******* The Invisible Aston Martin If you liked the movie, you'd better see the Special Edition D.V.D that includes very very precious and confidential technical details: -DataStream's trivia track with video streaming, storyboard comparisons from scratch to the shot,the advisory details on how to choose the best suitable FPS adjusted camera giving samples of multi-angle camera explorations, the visual effects featurette transcribes the odds-and -ends differences between make-ups and models and non-computer based visual effects and CGI based virtual effects, and finally Madonna's original uncut edition of 007-Nightfire music video that has been banned in some countries of Europe at its time of screening. It is as good as an HD-DVD of today's.Die Another Day is Brosnan's fourth Bond movie. Director Tamahori, who has gained recognition in his film ""Once Were Warriors"", is an award-winning commercial director; and in my opinion he has been influenced by Paul Verhoeven a lot. Die Another has some snoops from Verhoeven, mostly Robocop and Total Recall.The title has taken from an A.E.Housman poem. In Housman's poem, it is the coward who runs away from battle so that he may die another day. Die Another Day is a perfect choice for a wonderful evening with family and friends,neighbours,relatives,colleagues and with all types of crowds.Film: 7/10 DVD: 10/10(one of my favourite DVDs of all-time)",Die Another Day
222,SinjinSB,A little heavy on the impossible action,7,24 November 2002,"I've been a fan of the Bond movies since I was a little kid watching them with my dad. I have to wonder if maybe they're not running out of ideas. This movie reminded me a lot of some old Connery Bond movies, primarily Diamond are Forever. And the scene of Jinx, Halle Berry, coming out of the water in Cuba couldn't help but conjure up memories of Dr. No...without the ""Mangos, Bananas, and Tangerines..."". I don't actually fault the film for the similarities to previous Bond films, but the movie has some flaws. The thing that concerns me most is the mindless action level increasing to keep up with modern additions to the action genre, like The Transporter and The Fast and the Furious. We expect a bit of unbelievablity in the action sequences, but Die Another Day went over the quota for completely implausible and physic-defying scenes for my taste. It manages to stay above the likes of XXX with the qualities we love in a Bond film...interesting characters and bits of humor. I have particularly enjoyed John Cleese taking over the role as Q and the rest of the cast plays their parts well. If they keep making them, I'll probably keep watching them...but when I'm in the mood for a Bond movie, 9 times out of 10 I'll choose one with Sean Connery.

223,simonrosenbaum,much better than enough,8,12 January 2003,"After the terrible excuse of a Bond film that was ""The World Is Not Enough"" it's good to see the series back on form. ""Die Another Day"" is just what a Bond film should be. Brosnan gets better and better at being as tough and believable as Connery while also being as charming and funny as Moore. The pacing of the film was just right balancing action scenes with plenty of humour and as little cheesy dialogue as was necessary. When I saw the film's running time I winced thinking there's no way I'm not going to be bored silly, but the film flew by in no time. The only disappointment was with David Arnold's score which just kept repeating the same bit of music with little or no variation, but the title song is the best since ""The Living Daylights"". A very entertaining film puts it up there with the best Bond films. (8/10)",Die Another Day
224,loufalce,"Bomb, James Bomb",1,22 November 2006,"This was the first movie that I walked out on in a long time, but I suffered through it when it was on cable.If you thought ""Moonraker"" and ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet.Bond is so emasculated and so far removed from his original concept that he appears to be a parody of himself. Brosnan never really had it as Bond and this film confirms it. The all too familiar plot has our hero trying to stop yet another megalomaniac from world destruction.Nothing terribly new, the plot seems recycled from other Bond movies, and owes more than a small debt to the far superior ""The Living Daylights"" and ""Air Force One"". Halle Berry is an embarrassment as Jinx and Bond fouls up so much it's a wonder that he is still alive Also, as usual, the film merely serves as a body commercial- product placement festival for expensive, high end consumer products in what has become a shameless marketing trend in contemporary movies.. The camoflauged car that literally disappears into thin air is totally ludicrious and completely ridiculous even for Bond-you have to scratch your head in disbelief and say ""what the -uck"" -it really is totally credibility stretching and the surfing scenes _obviously done with plenty of CGI effects are downright laughable, yet they are not funny. The less I have to say about the villain with his ridiculous video game-shock producing suit, the better.If this is the future of the series, it's time to retire Bond.Any relation to this and a Connery, Moore, Lazenby ,and yes a even Dalton Bond is a coincidence. Watch at your own risk!Strictly bottom of the barrel on every level, including the theme song by Madonna that -ucks big time just like she does. A big fat ZERO rating for this hunk of dog dung. Anybody who gave this lame excuse for a Bond movie a decent rating would not know a REAL Bond movie-even if it came up and bit them on their ass. An insult to any true Bond fan. You have been warned.

225,yarborough,The worst Bond movie ever made. An absolute joke.,1,12 June 2003,"Die Another Day is the worst Bond movie ever made. I have no idea what the hell the studio MGM or the writers or producers were thinking when they put together this piece of sh_t film. Watching this film you have a hard time believing that this is an actual Bond movie. Since when does Bond surf, or is tortured and held as a prisoner for a year. Not in a lifetime. He's James Bond 007, licence to kill. This stuff shouldn't happen to him. Well I guess it's kind of believable since Pierce Brosnan is playing Bond and for Bond being in his fifties now, we should expect these kind of things. It's time for Brosnan to hang it up and pass his licence to kill to a younger, cooler person. Brosnan's aging fast and he moves very slow from one action scene to another. DAD is a total waste of time and money. I can't believe this crap cost 100 million dollars. The film as a terrible cast. Halle Berry as a Bond girl doesn't fit. She's not one damn bit attractive. Bond girls are supposed to be hotties, girls that they make you fall on your knees and thank god that your a man. Not Berry. She's not one bit convincing as a Bond girl and nor does she look like one. Take a look a previous Bond girls Pussy Galore or Tiffany Case! Now those are Bond girls. The lead Bond girl should of been Rosemund Pike. Now she's got the looks and body and charisma of a Bond girl. It's too bad the crappy producers couldn't make her the lead and kill Berry's character instead. Pike role was very small and more of her would of probably been better. The lead villian of Gustav Graves was a total joke. There wasn't a enough evil in him. He spent most of the film with a stupid smirk. He wasn't as cool or classy as other Bond villians in the pervious films, such as Dr.No, Franz Sanchez, or Max Zorin. Graves would of made a perfect villian in mission: impossible. Not James Bond. Other contributions that they this film so awful was the worst theme song ever in a Bond movie. Madonna's DAD was truly bad and just awful to hear. Her worst song to date. England has hundreds of musicians who would fit nicely for a Bond theme song. I can't understand why the producers selected her over such hometown artists such as Sing, Phil Collins, George Michael or Level 42. Her cameo in the film was a waste. I can't figure out why other musicians didn't make cameos in other Bond films. Duran Duran, Tina Turner would of been nice to see in a cameo. What the hell is so special about Madonna. Her english husband must of pulled a few strings to get her one. Also the appearence of Michael Madsen in a Bond film was total garbage. What the hell was he doing on the screen. Watching him, I kept saying to myself is this really a Bond film. Madsen belongs in low budget, striaght to video films. They should of gotten Tim Roth instead. He's english and much more convincing. More reasons why this film sucked was the brainless plot and terrible action sequences and special effects. One that comes to mind was the wind surfing sequence that made me cringe just watching. What in god's name where the filmakers thinking. Who's idea was that. My god I'be seen some pretty bad action sequences in other Bond films that were the sh_t, but not this horrendous. This movie is half live action and half cartoon. Snake Plissken would of been more believable wind surfing then James Bond. Yes this film is terrible, awful and any other word. It's time to revamp Bond and as of right now. Bond films are in trouble and they are losing fans quickly, it's time to make changes and fast. Bond is no longer a suave , cool secret agent, but more like a cartoon with a licence to kill.",Die Another Day
226,gila_film,Defy the rules,6,2 January 2003,"If truth be told, I never am being a fan for the 007 films. And I never plan to be one.  It appear to me that Bond always did those typical that being a trade mark for him (against the superlative villains, get some gorgeous chick to laid, outstanding actions, cutting-edge technology etc).  It never really impressed me. It happens that I only watched ones of franchise once in the theater, `Tomorrow Never Dies', and that's because I'm the big fan of Michelle Yeoh (I generally gaze at it just on TV).The same reason happens when I decide to watched `Die Another Day'. The only thing draws me to watch the film is Hale Berry. I always admiring beautiful and talented actress, and I wonder why Hale Berry would like to be part of this. Then I watched it, and guess what? I almost stun with what Bond did this time. It looks that Bond defy his own rule. Being captured, tortured, hurting and many more and that made him completely human. Well, I think it a good progress for his character (considering the appearance of `XXX' I supposed?). Lee Tamahori does know what market that he's going to deal with.  Certainly, he doesn't just allow the typical that the way the original tend to do by veiled this one with the latest FX,  more twisted plot and modernized characters, and that makes Bond more hip and slick than ever. It's a good effort of course, considering that Bond facing of the many competitors that anxiously to beat him and the younger audiences that he must capture to make more money at the Box Office. The result is `Die Another Day' became the most successful Bond in the series. In general, `Die Another Day' is a well done action packed, but obviously we can't hope more than just a total entertaining and expect nothing else.

227,pri_e,Stirred not Shaken,6,15 December 2002,"~Spoilers Ahead~I was looking forward to the 20th Bond film, ever since they decided to make it coincide with Bond's 40th Anniversary. However after watching ""Die Another Day"", I felt the ice melt for the Bond series forever. We were given a promising start but a lacklustre finish, it didn't feel British, rather it was catered for American audiences only.Pierce Brosnan returns as James Bond/007, our spy is tortured for 14 months by a North Korean General avenging his son's death. Bond seems to be traumatised by the ordeal, however that ordeal is just lost amongst the plot. As much as it was interesting to see a realistic side to the life of a spy, it didn't really evolve his character much. If you want to see how Bond is really like (according to Ian Flemming) then watch ""License to Kill"" starring Timothy Dalton, you see Bond more ruthless and passionate as ever.Toby Stephens and Rick Yune do a fantastic job as the villains, trying to conquer the world in sinister way. I felt their characters were more developed and that they allowed the story to flow more.Halle Berry as NSA Agent Jinx, I believe is NOT the equivalent to James Bond. If you want to see a strong Bond girl, watch Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". I didn't find her lines funny either, and found the American slang used was not suitable for Bond films. Her character wasn't developed enough and rather than explain what she knows about Zao or Gustav Graves, all she comes up with as Bond questions her motives is ""same as you"".Rosamund Pike was great as MI6 Agent Miranda Frost, an obvious villain but a good Bond girl nonetheless. She doesn't get as much screen time as Halle and I found her character also underdeveloped but perhaps if she played Gala Brand as she originally was suppose to, maybe it would have been an improvement.I thought the CGI effects were terrible, here are some of the worst moments- 1. The 2nd surfing scene in which Bond is surfing the Ice ""blue screen"" berg 2. When Bond's hovercraft topples over the edge of the ice berg, it was completely obvious it was a toy! 3. Maybe not so much the effects than the idea of an invisible car?I think the next Bond should be the last, let Bond finally move on from his commitment phobia after the death of Tracey and be with Moneypenny. Let S.P.E.C.T.R.E come back for one last attempt to kill Bond and let Shirley Bassey or a previous singer come back for the next Bond song",Die Another Day
228,pri_e,Stirred not Shaken,6,13 December 2002,"I had been anticipating the 20th Bond film for ages, after the disappointment of ""The World Is Not Enough"", I hoped that the next installment could restore some of the class that it once epitomised. However that never happened, and all we have is a movie that although watchable, is just as easily forgettable.Pierce Brosnan returns as James Bond/007, but rather than the usual unrelated beginning to what the movie is actually about, we see Bond actually getting the crap beaten out of him. I was impressed by that because we needed to see some of the gritty side to being a spy. However I didn't feel that the rest of the story really showed anything that Ian Fleming created in his character of James Bond. I honestly believe that ""License to Kill"" showed the true side which is ruthless and passionate.The story revolves around the mysterious Gustav Graves, who went from rags to riches in an instant. Zao, his side kick, has nasty scars glazed with shiny diamonds, together with Graves make a perfect pair of villains out to humiliate the western world and show true domination in the worst possible way. Toby Stephens and Rick Yune do a fantastic job, showing no mercy to anyone who tries to undermine them.Then comes the Bond girls-Halle Berry plays NSA Agent Jinx who enters in a supposed homage to Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress, the original Bond chick) however ends up looking retarded as opposed to sexy. Despite awakening Bond's sex drive, she's basically off doing her own thing and when finally questioned by Bond as to what it is that she's doing, all she says is ""Same as you""...that sums up her character development. I thought her use of ""Your mama"" and ""Bitch"" was ridiculous, it made a mockery of the classy comebacks that have been in previous films, umm I don't think any of the ghetto was in the movie! I think Jinx was hyped up only because Halle Berry had won an oscar, a spin off movie just wouldn't work, Jinx is just like every other Bond girl...who disappears into nothing. That golden statue is a curse if you ask me!Rosamund Pike plays M16 agent Miranda Frost, who may I add doesn't seem interested in anyway in Bond at all. Her icy exterior makes her all the more interesting, however her obvious role as the villain Bond girl reduces any element of surprise in the character. Miranda isn't in the movie much, as the limelight primarily is on Jinx (unfortunately)also there is a lack of character development. Miranda does come up with some good lines and does get some action scenes herself. She should have been the romantic interest in the end.In the world of special effects, what the hell happened to this movie?? For starters, the first surfing scene was amazing as it was actually real but when Bond later goes for another surf, it is so damn obvious he's surfing a blue screen! When Bond's hovercraft topples over the edge of an ice cliff, we all can obviously see the toy hovercraft used to slam against the wall!Invisible cars?? Ok Bond relishes in fantasy and who doesn't love it?! But an invisible car? That's when you know Bond is starting to go in the no-go zone, and once you start asking Madonna to sing the Bond theme and making a forgettable cameo appearance that's when you the know the producers are getting desperate! Bring back Shirley Bassey or Lulu or introduce some new faces, anything but electronic-Cher sounding music.I think the next Bond movie should be the last in the series, as nobody else can take over Brosnan. The plot lines are getting more far fetched and the special effects are just getting worse (please we don't need another movie showing ""great"" explosions like ""Diamonds Are Forever"". Let Moneypenny have Bond, let S.P.E.C.T.R.E come back for one last thrill (please read this Kevin McClory), let it end in class!",Die Another Day
229,stevetseitz,"Worst Bond film since ""A View To a Kill"" <>",2,22 June 2003,"This movie was so horrifically bad that it is staggering. I had been satified (not blown away) with Mr. Brosnan's previous outings as the british agent, 007. This film started promisingly. The idea of Bond being captured by a totalitarian nation and relentlessly tortured is a switch.
A disavowed Bond is a neat concept that we have seen twice before I believe in ""License to Kill"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".
That is the limit of this film's quality. The villains are cardboard cut-outs. The acting by Halle Berry is laughably bad. She looks as if she has never held a gun in her life and yet is supposed to be a top spy? The gadgets are cute and there are some laughs in a scene with John Cleese as ""Q"". Brosnan expands the range of Bond with some actual acting, but it's poorly timed and incongruent with the rest of the film. He loses his cool in ways Bond never would. Sean Connery would have had a witty/insulting line for his attractive co-agent even if she had double-crossed him. Instead Brosnan looks actually hurt or surprised! The Austin Powers series seems like an homage to Bond films of yore compared to this craptastic film. The situations Bond finds himself are stupid, his hoky ways of escaping them even worse. In this movie he isn't a suave secret agent he is more a superhuman freak who despite his bumbling can foil the well-laid plans of his nemesis by virtue of the fact that the screenwriter can imagine a way out of each predicament. I would rather watch ""A View To a Kill"" with Roger Moore as a thick-midsectioned Bond and Chris Walken as a lame psychotic killer looking for a paycheck.",Die Another Day
230,smashattack,"Crummy one-liners, useless women, flawed action... yes, it's a Bond film.",4,21 December 2002,"First of all, let me stress one thing.  I am getting tired of these cheesy women in these Bond films that are extremely ""sexy"" (in some people's opinion) and supposedly have a lot to do with the plot.  The only reason anybody put a woman in a Bond film was so that Bond could have a little ""enjoyment"" in his travels.  The ultimate failure is when the filmmakers attempt to give these women any meaning in the plot.  We all know what they're there for (which is a pitiful excuse for putting a woman into a movie).I've never been much for Bond except for a select few movies, including Moonraker, GoldenEye, and The World is Not Enough.  It seems now that Bond movies skip over.  GoldenEye was good, Tomorrow Never Dies was awful, The World is Not Enough was unique, and now Die Another Day continues the circle by being rather lame.  This was the first Bond movie I've seen in theaters, and I doubt I'll ever go to another again.Once again, Bond is immortal and time has no meaning for him, as sixteen months pass in the very beginning.  I am beginning to wonder just how old Bond is, how many missions he's been on, and how he remains looking so young.  Let's face it--by now, Bond should be in a wheelchair, suffering from Alzheimers.Okay, I should stop pointing out the flaws and get on to the good part(s). One part I really liked in this movie was that Bond's new car was finally rivaled by one of his foes.  The tension (and humor, since Bond's car is an endless pit of weapons and devices) in this part of the movie is really great.  I could really feel that the two of them were not really battling to kill each other; they were merely challenging each other's cars.The plot could be decent, since it involves diamonds (and a humorous look at the past in a newspaper headline that states, ""Diamonds are forever""), a giant weapon much like that of the GoldenEye.  However, it tends to drag, and I felt it ended up as another of the really long movies with nothing to do.  There was so much to remember, so much going on, and none of it seemed to connect.  I don't know, it just felt as though it was a big jigsaw puzzle with several pieces left out.I won't even talk about the intro credits.  Those are the worst things to have happened to any movie.  The music isn't bad, with the thrilling James Bond theme placed where needed.  I'm not sure who did the score, but, like any other James Bond film, the music was not too important and so I didn't care to look.All in all, Die Another Day was a real disappointment, but at least we all can look forward to the next James Bond film, which should continue the cycle and be a good one.",Die Another Day

I am one of those people who thought A View to a Kill was pretty awesome.But with Casino Royale coming out in 2 months from this day (I think it is the 16th of November), I am reminded of the latest bond film...I saw Die Another Day 4 years ago in theater, and I must say I did not like it at all. Maybe it was the invisible car, or the absence of a reasonable plot that just didn't click with me. The acting wasn't bad, but that didn't save it...it just seemed...stupid. It was different in a bad way.Casino Royale looks rather good, but please do not feel like you should watch Die Another Day in order to get psyched for it. I will say right now it may very well be the worst bond film, in addition to just being a dumb movie in general.3/10 because of the Ice Hotel being pretty cool, John Cleese doing a good replacement job (RIP Desmond), Judi Dench doing wonderful as usual, and the fact that I feel sympathy for poor Pierce having had to bow out with this movie.",Die Another Day

Not excellent, not very good, but nothing less than ""good"". After the minor GOLDENEYE and the even weaker THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, this one has got the thrills to keep you tightly on the edge of your seat, the women (Berry and Pike), and lots of fun and chuckles (nearly every line in the film must be containing a sexual reference). The best thing I can say about this James Bond, is that it catches up with recent action movies. TWINE failed to do that and made the series look rusty, yes, even 'old'. But this one is tough (kinda reminded me of the last good James Bond, LICENCE TO KILL), funny (Moneypenny's big scene is a riot)and makes the world's top spy look good again...finally.I have to admit that the film can't quite sustain its terrific start til the very end, and the film goes more over-the-top with each step it takes (but hey, it's a 007 flick!), but it's got stunts and fight scenes coming at ya in lightning pace, and some nice surprises too along the way. Notice the opening credits. Notice the fear in James Bond's eyes at the start (a first for the series!). Notice the spectacular gadgets. Goodie goodie, this must be the best James Bond can ever get. Because, let's face it, when we go see a James Bond film, we're not looking for the best film of all times, we're looking for a good time. And that, ladies and gentlemen, D.A.D. offers...abundantly. 8/10P.S.: Madonna has a cameo and the following fencing scenes (Madonna not included however) may be the best of the movie. P.S.2: Lee Tamahori directs this flick. He made a quite impressive film back in New-Zealand (ONCE WERE WARRIORS), but has gotten more and more into the action genre ever since his arrival in Hollywood. THE EDGE was passable, ALONG CAME A SPIDER was pretty bad, but I noticed that, though he's doing a decent job here (the frequently used slow-motion and cuts are however a bit jarring), the special effects are not always convincing (the ice water scene with the parachute). This was the case for the opening scenes of ""SPIDER"" too. Can't this guy get the best f/x people in Hollywood? Or does he always use the same folks?",Die Another Day

It has been called the ""Batman and Robin"" of the Bond series by some, but is actually a very good, very fun, and very exhilarating piece of work.In his final stint as Agent 007, Pierce Brosnan is yet again thrust into the world of Asian super-agents, a villainous criminal who gets plastic surgery to change his appearance, damsels in distress, highly incompetent fellow agents, a crystalline satellite of death, luxury vehicle chases, and traitorous women. Does any of this sound familiar? Oh, that's right! It's all recycled plot pieces from the first 19 Bond films! Truthfully, ""Die Another Day"" does not deliver any truly fresh plot lines and is a mesh of pieces from the first 19 films. However, what it lacks in story, it makes up for in style and looks.Bond, in this film, has his moments. In this film, we get an exciting super-car battle, improbable but entertaining fencing battles, a hover-0car battle, a drag car chase involving a killer satellite, and Halle Berry. The film has its flaws and is at times completely ridiculous, but it also has cool gadgets, decent-looking Bond girls, good visuals, and compelling enough action for me to recommend it.",Die Another Day
234,filmbuff1970,The Worst of Brosnan,8,3 May 2003,"First off i will mention the best things in Die Another Day, John Cleese makes a suitable replacement as Q. And Rosamund Pike was a real pleasure to watch. Now the bad a villain thats pathetic,he does basically nothing evil in the whole film. Toby Stephens is the weakest bond villain ever,and giving him a suit that would be better use in a X-men is just silly. It's the most Expensive Bond Ever,yet it contains lousy stunts,and the worst special effects i have ever seen. my playstation games had better CGI than this. I have been a Bond fan for many years and i own them all on DVD. This movie is slow,the action is poor,the script is bad. But the acting is awful Brosnan sleepwalks in this movie. Halle Berry was a waste of money,they should of got a top villain with her fee instead of the bargain basement rubbish on display here. I would say this is the worst Bond movie since Thunderball. This is the most cheaply looking Bond Ever,With the Worst Bond Song Ever. The Theme music is useless it does nothing to help increase the excitement levels. And a rotten performance from Madonna her song is the pits and so is her acting. People slated Denise Richards but she was a lot better than Berry,how can u go from Oscar winner to give a stinker like she does here. The sets are too Batman & Robin. The Bond in this movie is not what Connery,Moore,Dalton or even Lazenby played. This is The Phantom Menace of Bond movies only without the decent special effects. I swear i was watching a very bad comic strip movie. Even Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me had great set,superb stunts and scenes that were set in the real world. This feels too studio bound and completely  lacks the style the Bond Movies need. And now it's been a huge hit,things will get only worse. Message to Bond Producers Spend Money on the Action Scenes and get a decent A list star to play The Villain. And dont pay a fortune for a Oscar Winner to play the leading lady,You do not need a Oscar to Shout Help. Brosnan is so different from the previous Bond outings,the jokes are poor.

First of all, the movie is packed with action from the moment GO and you are never once bored during the running time of over two hours, which is quite a feat. The production is (as always) lavish and there is always something to rest your eyes on. Halle Berry is one of the better Bond-girls of late, but is not given very much to work with except in her early scenes. The gadgets are also here, but I found the idea of an invisible car quite risible. And why doesn't any of the crooks bump into that vehicle and discover it? Even if it's invisible it's still there!! The effects are often very convincing, but here and there I was surprised how shoddy they suddenly became. For instance in that parachute-surfing scene. The main things that makes this an average James Bond movie instead of a great James Bond movie is the routine script, filled with silly lines that could have been written 1962, and rather weak villains. No Oddjob or Goldfinger here. But all in all, 132 painless and rather entertaining minutes.",Die Another Day
236,mrskywalker,"Best since Goldfinger, class, action, nobility",10,1 December 2002,"This bond has it all.  It is truly the most heroic Bond perhaps ever.   It has dropped the cynicism and fake realism.  Once Bond's supervisor tells him ""you see things in black and white when the world is gray.  In this film Bond has his strongest ethics ever.Every thing about the film is great.  Halle Berry is fine too.  There is nothing feminist, not a single feminist line,  nor nothing politically correct about this film.  Halle is an action figure and you just have to love her because she also has integrity and is nice.There are a few great villains and great scenes.  If you got away from Bond see this one.

237,ronfernandezsf,oh my,2,23 April 2020,"I'm a Bond fan having seen all films more than once. What happened?
This film is incredibly BAD. No redeeming blues at all. Stupid plot, stupid effects and horrid acting by all except maybe by Ms. Dench. Who thought of this abysmal plot line? While some of the other Bond films might be far fetched, this one is ten times more far fetched. Invisible car. Come on!! This is more like fantasy than any type of reality. Continuity is all wrong. There were hundreds of people at that Iceland Hotel, then the next minute theres no one!! What happened to them? That's just ONE of many oddities in this one. While MOONRAKER was no great shakes, that's a classic compared to this monstrosity. Bring back Mr. Moore.
He was thee best Bond and had the best Bond outings. Followed by Sean, then George, then Pierce then Timothy and lastly Craig who is much to serious.
Anyway, skip this one. Will not be watching this stinker again. Another thing. This has got to be the worst theme song ever in a Bond film. Terrible. What happened to the melodic music like From Russia With Love, The Spy Who Loved Me, For your Eyes only and all the earlier ones? Even the titles under the music was pretty bad.
Please bring back the old time Bond films. Luckily I have the box set and can see them over and over. All except for Die Another Day and Quantum of Solace, another disaster...",Die Another Day
238,TexasRedge,"A better Title would've been ""You Only Die Once""",7,3 December 2002,"I wasn't very impressed with the last Bond film called ""The World Is Not Enough"". Having said that, I'm pleased to say that ""Die Another Day"" is a huge improvement over the last Bond Installment,in fact I think it was the 2nd best Pierce Brosnan ere Bond film ever.... but ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" blows this film away.I did get a kick out of seeing some of the celebrties that made Cameo appearances in this film. - I'm not going to say much simply because most Bond films are very similar, however I was surprised when Bond got caught and imprisoned after the opening sequence...I was stunned and thinking to myself ""He didn't get out of it!"" I give it 7 out of 10 stars...Bond is always good. and this one is good too",Die Another Day
239,Gambitt,VROOM VROOM (loudly),6,15 December 2002,"For those of you who haven't seen the movie, overall it's okay, somewhere in the middle of the bottom of the Bond pack.So much for that...****************SPOILERS FOLLOW****************All in all, I found Die Another Day to be successful in some ways and yet an utter flop in many aspects.  As I watched the movie I was alternatively entertained and bored/disappointed.I'll dig my eager claws into the bad first.The plot is silly and predictable, and there are huge jumps between scenes that leave a lot of unexplained holes.  Now I know this has always been an issue with Bond films but for some reason I noticed it a lot more in DAD. Could it be I'm outgrowing Bond films?The opening with Bond becoming a prisoner was certainly different, but I felt it added a dark tone that was never present or necessary in any Bond movie.  Bond should generally be light and fluffy, but those torture scenes were brutally graphic and not-so-fun.  Plus I think the time lapse wasn't necessary.  Other Bond movies have been generally vague about the passage of time, but that helped since Bond goes on so many missions that we can assume each of them generally lasts maybe a few weeks at most.  But 14 months?? That is a LONG time for anyone, but think how many new adventures Bond would normally embark on in a 14-month period.  That is a huge cut of Bond's life.I didn't like how Bond's opening assignment was an assassination.  I felt this really cheapened Bond's character.  And although the sword fight started fine, with foils and finesse, it evolved into this brutal, Braveheart, slash and bash braul filled with rage and sloppy swings.  This savagery seemed blatantly out of line with Bond's usual cool demeanor.Even though I have tremendous respect for Halle Berry, it's almost as if her acting intentionally descended to cheesey, no-talent Bondgirl.  She looked great of course; it just didn't seem like she was trying at all.  And she was WAY too easy, even for a Bond girl.  Doesn't he even have to try anymore?  Also, the really corny lines with sexual innuendos used to be amusing but now fall flat with most audiences.There were a few too many big bosses towards the end.  Although I thought that Graves was a good Bond villain, the movie could have ended after Zao got iced.  Instead Graves puts on this massive ""dead-or-alive-you're-coming-with-me"" outfit that apparently is nothing more than a glorified taser; Bond kicks his butt anyway.  All in all the action of the last 20 minutes on the plane is quite silly and contributed very little to the movie.Then there's Zao...  So he needs to use million dollar gene therapy to fix his diamond-drilled face?  Really, how exactly could diamond shards become so embedded in your skin that they are fully visible yet the poor chap has no choice but to leave them be?  Couldn't he just use 50 cent tweezers from Walmart to pluck those shiny scabs out?  Still it's nice to see Rick Yune getting a role this big (albeit yet another badguy, jerk role).From a technical note, special effects have never been more technologically advanced with today's CGI, yet they've never looked as fake and cutout as I've seen in recent movies.  Of particular note, the surfing scenes, aside from being just plain CHEESEY, looked like they had been done with an Atari.As much as I am wailing on DAD, I did get a couple laughs.  I enjoyed Bond's treatment of the obnoxious tourist in Cuba.  And my friend and I both thought it amusing and convenient that a Korean military plane has a built-in verbal ""Caution"" warning in perfect English.So are there any other redeeming points?  Yes...The cars.  I know the car stunts were just as silly as the rest, but what can I say, I am a car guy.  The dogfight between the Aston Martin and the Jaguar was one of the flashiest, most entertaining, thrilling action sequences out of all Bond movies.  And to be honest, there wasn't really anything new about this car scene.  Lots of pop-out weapons.  Crazy slides. Gorgeous cars that CANNOT be scratched.  It's just a classic tried and true Bond formula, and they should stick with it.  It may be stupid but it works.On the merits of those stunning British cars (whose makers ironically are now owned by Ford), I promote the movie from a 4 to a 6: ""worth watching once but probably won't make my collection.""",Die Another Day
240,SPaS,"No, no, no! (Spoilers)",5,8 December 2002,"Boy, did I get my hopes up for this and got dropped down fast! I've seen all previous bonds (though not in chronologically) and just can't recall this big a drop in quality after the previous one! I like Moore's Bonds' the best (Connery did 6 official, but Moore did 7. Octopussy and Never Say Never Again both opened the same year and Octopussy beated NSNA hands down. Besides, I was a kid in the 80s', OK? End of discussion!) I think Dalton wasn't handsome enough to BE Bond. Brosnan, on the other hand, looks like Bond should. Now, about his bonds: Goldeneye - like Die Hard or Indiana Jones on acid. Too hyperactive for a Bond movie but for a new start, good stuff. Tomorrow never dies - a letdown. ""Boring"" and naive. The idea of the ""evil mastermind of the 21st Century"" is clever, but clumsily handled. They really shouldn't have picked an american director... The world is not enough - Brilliant. Like back in the days: plotting thing up around something old-fashioned, like oil, works. Plus I'm a sucker for skiing action. Minor complaints for Denise Richards (Sexy as hell, but too much of a ""teen"") and the feeling of an ""anticlimax"" in the end. Die another day - no. No, no, no. Starts fine, but then goes a-walk, jaywalk and off the map. After Cuba mostly pointless rushing from one place to another and EVERY, SINGLE, TURN you see it coming from a mile away: who is the double-agent (and Bond didn't see it coming), who is the bad guy, what is the joke in the end. Then again, not every turn: some are just too STUPID to pick up. Like the virtual reality training and the ice-rocket escape from Icarus... and on top of them, we've got laser beams (which we last time saw in the 70s'!) and invisible cars.

241,emfern13,Worth Seeing but the Worst of All of Brosnans Movies,7,23 November 2002,"Die Another Day is worth paying as much as 8.50 for but its the worse of all Brosnan's Bond Movies. The Beginning scene of Bond is very good despite what some critics say. I had high hopes for this Bond Movie after I saw the beginning. But after the beginning it started to decline.I dont think Halle Berry was very memorable or the girl that played Miranda Frost. The bad guy,Zao, was a memorable bad guy but Gustav Graves is a terrible bad guy. The movie also copies off of Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies, two Bond movies that are superior to this one. The satellite thing is directly pulled out of Goldeneye. Trying to make Halle Berry's Character be Bond's equal was trying to make her be like Wai Lin, who was the Bond Girl of Tomorrow Never Dies.

242,eamon-hennedy,Great Fun and Wonderfully Far Fetched,9,8 May 2003,"Sitting down to watch the latest Bond movie on DVD I was prepared for dissapointment. All of Brosnan's Bond films have been great so far, reaching a peak with The World Is Not Enough, but while the film does have flaws, it does succeed in being a fun film to watch, which is what all Bond movies succeed at. There are problems of course. The plot gets REALLY silly towards the end and some of the CGI is awful in the extreme, but when the credits roll you're left with the same feeling you had when you went on a holiday to Las Vegas, it was all great fun. Brosnan looks as if he is having a ball, as does Halle Berry who speeds up the list of Bond girls in the space of five minutes, Toby Stephens is a fantastic villain camping it up fantastically at the end while Judi Dench has to be the best M of all time. Of course the plot is far fetched to the extreme, but realism isn't what you watch a Bond movie for, go watch a Ken Loach movie if that's what you want. The CGI effects do leave a lot to be desired. Bond is supposed to be the pinacle of the action genre and effects this bad is bit embrassing and dissapointing, but the gadgets are there and at this rate Brosnan is giving Connery a run for his money as the best Bond of all time. While Die Another Day is not as good as The World Is Not Enough, as a fourth Bond movie for Brosnan it is better than fellow fourth Bond films Thunderball and Moonraker. If a good time is what you're after, you can't go wrong with Die Another Day.",Die Another Day

Halle Berry is a welcome edition, but Rosamund Pike as the other femme fatale is a real surprise and Toby Stephens and Rick Yune give you a pair of the best villains since ""Goldfinger"". It features one of the best sword fights in movie history. The stunts are excellent except for one embarassingly fake looking ice water surf sailing scene. There is a very moving scene with ""M"" (Judi Dench) and John Cleese finally finds the right tone as ""Q"". There are few surprises but for what they are they a real kick. This Bond feels energized.

244,Streetwolf,"Oh no, they had to ruin it!",7,23 December 2002,"I have seen every James Bond film 100 times, I have the entire collection and I even think Pierce Brosnan is the most perfect, elegant man alive the role of James Bond is tailor-made for Pierce, but this had to be one of the worst 007 movies I have ever seen and I can thank Halle Berry for that.Summary: Well James is on a mission in North Korea and he gets captured and taken prisoner for killing the general's son. After a period of time he is exchanged for Zao, who was a partner with the general's son and the general wants to know who was his son's friend, who he believes misguided his ""innocent"" and now presumed dead son. James gets discarded from work since he is now a liability, they believe he may have spilt his guts during torture, but James takes it upon himself to put the pieces together of the puzzle, which leads him to a secret DNA base, where he meets Jinx, who he sleeps with after knowing her for 5 minutes. James finds out Jinx is working ""undercover"" and he gets partnered up with an insider who is working for the rich Gustav Graves, who seems to have found some diamonds, but Gustav and James don't get along much after it becomes obvious that Gustav has met James before. The movie basically has it all, bad guys, gadgets, a new Q, the car, M and the women, but it is in fact the women that kill the movie. James almost appears to be a cradle robber when he sleeps with Jinx the first time, she seems so tiny and heck let's face it she only got the part for 2 reasons, one she has an award and 2 it's all about the breasts, which seem bigger in this movie than Swordfish. This role did not suit her in any way. Rosamund Pike was good, she even seemed more perfect for the role of Jinx instead and what is Madonna doing in the movie?? The ending was so terrible, Halle Berry was so fake! Look at her face when she's in the chopper!!Pierce is as always perfect and I hope he does make another 007 before before leaving it behind.

245,clivey6,For Your Kids Only,2,21 January 2003,"This awful mish-mash of Austin Powers, Casino Royale and The Avengers doesn't follow on from the last Bond film, The World Is Not Enough, or indeed fit in with the rest of the Bond series.Strangely, director Lee Tamahori talked a good game like most Bond directors but not only has he failed to deliver, but he's pulled off THE EXACT OPPOSITE of what he says he intended. He dissed the innuendo of films like Moonraker, yet there's more witless smut in Die Another Day than ever. He emphasised how he's sat down with the writers to ensure every turn of plot made sense, yet the plotholes in this film are beyond a joke.There are too many to list scene-by-scene yet overall, the SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! the fact that Colonel Moon can reinvent himself over just 13 months into a pillar of the English establishment Gustav Graves, fit for a knighthood and with an industry up-and-running is just too ludicrous for words. Better had Graves already existed and Moon had used those 13 months to have plastic surgery so he could physically resemble Graves, then had Graves secretly murdered so he could steal his identity and all his billions.That way you could have people in the press commenting on how Graves had ""come out of his shell"" and changed somewhat in the last year (not knowing it was really Moon) and his knighthood would not have seemed out of place, either.This is very much a non-stop action film. Well that's OK for a film in the Die Hard/T2/Speed template, as these films are basically an extended chase sequence. The Bond films, on the other hand, often have an unnecessarily complex plot involving many different characters, traversing three continents. Apply non-stop action to a formula like that and you wind up with an ungodly mess, which pretty much describes Die Another Day.A non-stop action Bond film really means it's lacking in tension, suspense, glamour, romantic chemistry and witty banter. It's actually selling itself short.Even should you disagree, what's the point of getting Lee Tamahori to direct a non-stop action movie - WHEN HE'S NEVER DONE AN ACTION FILM BEFORE! Am I missing something here? Then again, maybe I am, because he doesn't even direct the key action scenes in this film, it's second unit director Vic Armstrong.Explosions seem aimed at reeling in the teen audience. Fair enough, but films like Oceans 11 and The Bourne Identity do very well without having to pander to teens. They are more Bondian than Die Another Day by a long shot - same goes for Minority Report.And teens do NOT have a totally different set of values and tastes to the rest of us. UK teens like The Office, Alan Partridge, the new Girls Aloud single, Kylie. US teens like The Simpsons and Friends. Stop pandering to teens - or if you must, pander to smart teens, not dumb ones. Hey, even Two Towers and Harry Potter demands a certain intelligence and staying power. So are the producers saying that Bond fans are dumber than that?Of course, a lot of Bond films have proved disappointing in recent years. This is the first one where I felt the producers were blatantly taking the p***, as if to say, ""look, take the hint, these films aren't for you anymore."" Well, there's always next time, but with three years til the next Bond, I won't be holding my breath. Wrap it up, guys.",Die Another Day

247,McBuff,Brosnan's MOONRAKER...,5,9 February 2003,"...not quite, but almost. *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** Lee Tamahori directs the 20th (official) Bond movie with several nods and references to previous entries (check the trivia section to see if you spotted all of them), but also excessive and far-fetched, even by Bond standards. The film kicks off with an exciting hovercraft chase, followed by the colorful main title sequence, in which the plot is actually developed for the first time. Unfortunately Madonna's title song falls short of satisfaction and seems out of place in the Bond universe. Brosnan is getting better and better, but is let down by the increasingly silly and pun-heavy script and some truly ropey CGI effects. In a film of this magnitude and budget, such flaws are inexcusable. Toby Stephens makes a sneering villain, Berry a sexy companion for Bond and John Cleese has a more dignified (and funny) cameo as Q's replacement than he did in The World is Not Enough. Judi Dench as M has little to do this time and is upstaged by macho NSA leader Michael Madsen. Rick Yune is effective as diamond-pierced henchman Zao, but Rosamund Pike is near-catatonic as agent Miranda Frost. And the gadgets? An invisible car, come on... However, Bond finally gets to shag Moneypenny this time...or does he? Brosnan, Berry and some dazzling action set pieces save this from being a total Moonraker, but they should have fired the writers.Overall rating: **½ out of ****.",Die Another Day

""Die Another Day"" is not without its problems, but the plot is so complex, sending Bond from one location to another, that it's hard not to be reminded of the early Bond movies that had Connery running up the travel budget.  Some of the stunts (like the glacier surfing which, admittedly, looked too fake, making it all the more reminiscent of some of the cheesey sixties effects) had a definite throwback feel.  And it's nice to see Bond get in a duel with his car instead of just racing a pretty girl down a winding road or using it to escape from henchmen.We start in North Korea, where James is sent to assassinate a military leader who runs a lucrative black-market arms enterprise.  But Bond has been betrayed, and after a rather uninspired (and definitely unflashy) hovercraft sequence, our hero is captured and tortured--a scene that provides a palatable backdrop for the worst theme song (an insipid Madonna number) of the 20 films in the franchise.  Fourteen months later, Bond is released, only to discover that M doesn't trust him any more (a lifetime as the world's greatest spy doesn't mean as much as it used to), leaving him without a job or a country.From here things get very complicated and a little too drawn-out but never dull, as Bond's investigation leads to an egomaniacal millionaire who is being watched by an American agent (Halle Berry).  The rich, young ruler has devised a satellite that will allow the sun to shine on the Earth year-round (for the plot's sake, this is apparently a good idea), but his true intentions are far from benevolent.  This device must be stopped, and the only man for the job is a newly reinstated 007.So far, so good, and indeed, the bulk of the movie is pure Bond fun.  It's the little things that are a bit unsettling.  Quick zooms seem too MTV-ish, the score only serves to occasionally remind us of how the Bond theme goes, and CGI effects cause us to wonder if the future of Bond will contain bluescreen work instead of stunts.  Perhaps, in the attempt to draw in new fans and stay current the Bond franchise will implode, ending up a mere shell of what it once was.  For now, though, we've got a slick 007 film to cause us to question just how much better was Connery than Brosnan.",Die Another Day

Die Another Day threw all that out of the window. The action scenes are stupidly over-the-top, and at times it doesn't seem to take itself seriously. Having said that, it does keep you on the edge of your seat, and if the story is ridiculously over-the-top at least it is interesting. The problem is that the action scenes take over and everything that made Bond Bond is lost, the new Q, played by John Cleese, just doesn't feel right, M doesn't feel right. The story doesn't feel like a Bond story, the gadgets are far too over-the-top for a Bond story. It still isn't a million miles away though, fans of the Bond films will recognise similarities with the classic Diamonds Are Forever. Both have diamond smuggling as a plot line, both involve Bond going undercover to follow the pipeline, both involve the diamonds going into a satellite to produce a laser-beam, and both involve a villain from Bond's past that can change his face.

Poor quality, fake looking - especially that terrible blue screen job with 007 para-surfing the wave towards the end. What a shocker.Some of the story ideas were ok. I liked how bond was held captive and grew a beard, and the way he escaped from the hospital was great. The sword fight was nice and even - Bond actually got hurt which was good to see. I liked the villain - he was perfectly mad. The sun's energy beam idea was good too.
So what was wrong with it? Cheesy, unimaginative dialog - more so than usual. Awful editing. It was the first time an American has edited a Bond film, and I bet the last. The editor admitted he was trying to ""make it trendy"" by using MTV style cuts, and ""ramp ups"".I thought it was funny how they used the exact same sound for totally different unrelated devices. The same ""bleep"" sound was used when building doors opened, bombs armed, and buttons pushed in the cockpit of the big aircraft. Very lazy sound FX! I hated the opening title song too, good graphics, but that song was so bad. Give me Duran-Duran any day.

255,TimBoHannon,Poor direction tarnishes one of the stronger Bond films,8,29 June 2004,"""Die Another Day"" is the twentieth Bond movie released on the 40th anniversary of Bond's maiden voyage in ""Dr. No."" Its release marks two impressive milestones for what is internationally the longest running and most successful film franchise ever. In accordance, the producers attempted to create an electrifying thrill machine that would top all previous chapters of the series. On the surface, ""Die Another Day"" is indeed greater than all the other Bonds, but it is badly misdirected by Lee Tamahori and takes its premise farther than it can support.Pierce Brosnan plays Bond for the fourth time, and once again proves why he is the preeminent of Sean Connery's four successors. Brosnan radiates Bond charm and acumen, and plays his part with a greater panache and ruthlessness than he has before. For the third straight film, Brosnan gives the best lead performance in the sixteen films following ""Thunderball."" The story opens in the Korean demilitarized zone, where Bond is on a mission to sabotage an illegal diamonds for weapons exchange. He meets Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee), a particularly nasty customer who needs a new anger therapist. Bond is betrayed and taken captive by the Colonel's father (Kenneth Tsang), but not before engaging in an adrenaline-fueled hovercraft chase. This particular sequence is as challenging as it is original, hovercraft are clumsy vehicles by nature, but meets satisfaction despite that obstacle.Fourteen months pass. Bond is finally released in an exchange for Zao (Rick Yune), an old associate of Colonel Moon's. Incensed that he was set up to free Zao, Bond vows to go after both him and the one responsiblefor his capture. M, however, believes that he is damaged goods and rescinds his freedom indefinitely.Escaping his medical ship, Bond tracks Zao to Cuba where he meets Jinx (Halle Barry), who rises from the waves like a glorious nymph in an affectionate nod to the very first Bond girl. Unlike Honey Rider, Jinx is not merely in the story for her sexy looks, but is soon discovered to be nearly as lethal as Bond. The two actors share an undeniable chemistry, which maximizes the effect of their partnership.At length, he uncovers a link between Zao and an opulent diamond magnate named Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). Bond suspects Graves is laundering ""African Conflict Diamonds"" (yes, they do exist). Bond meets him and his stunning publicist Miranda Frost (the gorgeous Rosamund Pike) at a posh fencing club. Fencing is normally a gentlemen's game, but anybody who thinks it will be so when Bond and Graves spar is in for a rude and utterly delightful surprise.After ""The Great Gatsby,"" I was not optimistic to see Toby Stephens on screen in a major role, but he is in fact quite good. He flawlessly transforms Graves from a standard issue Bond villain into one who piques interest and is wholly despicable. Graves is cocky and loves to taunt his opponents, but Stephens fully exploits that without ever overacting; it is a thorny task, but his efforts create a terrific lead antagonist. The wild fencing match features a shot of Stephens face that is worth one thousand words.The other cast members also fare reasonably well. Rick Yune makes his character one of the scariest in the series. Zao, with his diamond-embedded, half mutated countenance is not a handsome dude, and his deliberate walking is as memorable as his face. Lawrence Makoare, previously seen in ""Lord of the Rings,"" plays Mr. Kil (well that's a name to die for), who is mostly memorable for his taut brawl scene in a gem refining room. Rosamund Pike is one of the most radiant women on the planet, enough said. She proves to have more acting talent than some star actresses I could name. Miranda Frost does end up having greater significance to the plot than we are originally led to believe.""Die Another Day"" could have eclipsed all the other Bond films. The plot is one of the best in the series and the acting is above standard for action movies. Plus the action, the keystone to most great Bond films, is, on paper, superior to any in the first nineteen Bonds, but paper is not reality.Director Lee Tamahori badly misdirected the film by adding an overabundance of fancy camera work. The most common offense is to interrupt an emotional moment or dynamite action piece with an elaborate, slow motion shot that often involves choppy motion with a ghost image that lingers on the screen a few frames longer than it should. He also enjoys making the camera travel close to Mach Three before suddenly slowing it down to a slug pace. One or two of these gimmicks would have been sufficient.Tamahori could be attempting to channel ""The Matrix,"" but in that film the unusual camera work gave the audience a panoramic view of the characters manipulating a virtual reality. Here it has no reason, no function. All it does is break up the tension and detract from the final product. When it is combined with an array of technology (like the ""dream machine"") more advanced than many were prepared for, it makes the film look cheesy when it should be cool. Even the fans of the movie must admit it went a little too far. The ending in particular falls apart with a pointless add on after the villains have been dispatched to the past.Despite some awful decisions from the creative team, ""Die Another Day"" is still a stalwart effort. With a better director and more disciplined writers it could have been historically great, but that potential is never reached. Its reception was warm nonetheless, and we are once again reminded that 007 will be the most reliable number in this genre for years to come.",Die Another Day
256,Space_Lord,Has to be one of the worst Bonds EVER,6,25 May 2005,"Kiwi boy Tamahori does a half decent job with the 20th installment of the JamesBond legend. Is it just me or is the Bond series just growing tired? Imagine if the movies had actual continuity and stuck to a time line. Bond would be nearly 70 or 80, for Christ's sake!! I truly believe they need to drop this franchise, the films are just getting more and more idiotic every time. In saying that I watch the damn things so who's the chump? Once again I digress. Bond hooks up with Jinx and saves the world from a mad dictator who..... aaaaaahhhh just watch it, it's typical James Bond stuff but a little watered down (because it's so old) and bordering on the unbelievable, even for Bond.",Die Another Day
257,james362001,Can MGM release the next James Bond film in 2004?,5,9 December 2002,"The title of this film became prophetic for Halle Berry when a piece of fig got caught in her throat during a love scene they were filming.  No air was passing and she could not breath.  Both naked, Pierce quickly got up and did the Heimlich maneuver on her and dislodged the fruit stuck in her throat. Pierce Brosnan saved Halle Berry's life.  I have waited three too-long years for this new James Bond 007 film.  My comments for Die Another Day are not too exciting.  The idea of a ""dead son"" changing to a DNA-transplanted restructured person played by Toby Stephens was not a good one.  The pellet scarred face of ""Zao"" played by Rick Yune would have been good enough as the sole villan in this film and more memorable. During premiere week, the gossip was that Halle Berry could appear in the next Bond film, however the plans seem to be to make a spin-off movie starring Halle Berry  as ""Jinx"". This would be a first since no Bond girl nor any character from a Bond film has ever spun-off into their own movie.  Pierce Brosnan will be back for another James Bond movie, but I dislike the fact we have to wait until 2005. Attention MGM!  Can we release a new James Bond 007 film in 2004?

258,AttyTude0,This film started yesterday ... and it never ended.,1,17 November 2019,"I HATE the new James Bond films. This is an eternal point if contention between hubby and I: he likes them, I hate them. He says the new ones are more like the books. More serious. I think that is nonsense since I doubt Ian Fleming ever intended to be John Le Carre.Be that as it may, I repeat, I hate the new James Bond films. This one in particular was IN-TER-MI-NA-BLE. Or was it just boring. Never mind. I felt like I had been watching a film that started the day before. Suffice to say, as soon as it was (finally) over, I switched to From Russia with Love (thanks, Amazon Prime) to take the bad taste from my mouth. Ahh, what a difference. Sean Connery. Nobody did it better.This is not 1963, some said. More's the pity, I say. Move with the times, they tell me. I try, I tell them. I just refuse to goose-step to them.",Die Another Day
259,Batkid1,Miscaclculation in the Ian Fleming franchise.,2,27 August 2007,"I thought ""MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN"" was one of the few bad Bond outings, but it turned out that I was wrong. The entire 007 series has had it's numerous ""ups"" and ""downs""; some have been vastly entertaining, some have been campy/corny and others have been pathetic entries in the saga. It would be pointless to say that there was only one good actor who fit in Bond's shoes, but that's a different argument. The film starts out with promise by having a big shoot-out, but you aren't able to suspend belief ( I know it's not a thing to be 100% realistic in these films, but you should have some realism to Bond) , from beginning to end, that Bond would make it through all this. Then the film slows down, after the opening sequence, to introduce us to Jame's next mission that involves this terrorist. **Before that, you are treated to a mediocre Madonna song. ** Anyway, the film is mainly a rehash of ""YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE"" and ""GOLDENEYE,"" and the ""satellite-of-power-and-destruction"" concept has already been done to death in the series. But director Lee Tamahori and the screen writing crew from THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH seem to think this is new.Moving on, this is probably the most sexist Bond movie ever made. The Bond girls have never been treated with respect and have ""ninety-five percent"" of the time settled in be with him, but they often got to be treated w/ some respect. No respect bikini-clad ""good girl"" Halle Berry or ""bad girl"" Rosamund Pike ( who was in an even crappier film known as ""DOOM"").The movie's second act consists of all the worst clichés, a sword-wielding Madonna, a lame villain, fake-looking car chases, predictable twists and an absurd ending that involves Bond and Halle escaping out of a carrier plane's hangar ( the vehicle is about to crash) in a small helicopter, with shrapnel flying everywhere around them, and the chopper they're in is only half-way started! I know it's not a real movie, but that's just lazy script-writing. This would have been an even, bigger insult to the franchise if this was the last 007 movie that they ever made!",Die Another Day
260,Colbridge,It has been knocked by critics and fans a like over the years but on the whole it is hugely entertaining,7,19 September 2021,"I saw this film on it's release in 2002 and several times since, and on a recent viewing in 2021 I was pleased to see it has aged quite well, with this being Pierce Brosnan's 4th film as Bond which he had comfortably grown into by this stage.It has been knocked by critics and fans a like over the years for some questionable CGI effects and fantastical ideas, like Bond using an invisible car for instance, but on the whole it is hugely entertaining and along with Goldeneye this is Brosnan at his best.This was the 20th Bond film released 40 years after Dr. No (1962) and the filmmakers clearly decided to pay homage to previous films with the gadgets of Connery's Bond, the playfulness of Lazenby & Moore and the grittiness of Dalton's outings. For fans there are plenty of references to previous Bond films, the most obvious being Diamonds Are Forever (1971), and New Zealand director Lee Tamahori uses some slick visuals to bring Brosnan's Bond bang up to date and throws everything in but the kitchen sink.Halle Berry is an above average Bond girl who is introduced by rising out of the water in homage to Ursula Andress in Dr. No but it's a shame Michael Madsen isn't given much to do. Judi Dench plays M with dignity once again and there's light relief with John Cleese stepping into the role as Q. Pop star Madonna makes an appearance in one scene after providing the disappointing theme tune, with an awful remix that appears over the end credits, but David Arnold's score is on par with his other Bond scores, although this lacks any thematic qualities to give Die Another Day an identity of it's own and seems to totally ignore the main song which usually gets referenced.This certainly isn't the best Bond but it is not the worst either as some would like you to believe, although the criticism the film received made the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson take notice as they let Brosnan go after only his 4th film and decided to reboot the franchise with a much harder edged Bond 4 years later with Daniel Craig.I always felt Brosnan had at least one more Bond left in him and that his tenure was prematurely cut short. For me he has the best Bond 'look' out of all the actors who has played him but didn't necessarily get the best directors or scripts he deserved to fully flesh out the role. He may have been 47 when this film was made, and fans were quick to allude the initials of the film's title spelled out DAD, meaning the character was no longer hip or relatable to a younger audience, however Daniel Craig was 52 when he filmed his last Bond so age should not have been an issue.Die Another Day deserves another look and to be re-evaluated, sure it's loud, flashy, full of explosions with some outlandish concepts that pushed fans too far but seen as a tribute to the previous 40 years of Bond it does a fitting job whilst being great entertainment.",Die Another Day
261,marcotiero,Missing the mark.,5,30 May 2020,"This movie starts off well, and seems to have a darker tone than previous Brosnan entries and feels more like a Dalton Bond.But then Bond surfaces in Hong Kong right outside a hotel he happens to be a regular at, and it starts to go downhill from here.The movie really takes a nose dive from Cuba onwards, the dialogue just all seems like pointless drivel, and whilst some of the nods to pervious movies are nice, the cgi is atrocious at times and looks like low budget 80s.Additionally, Graves is an atrocious villain. Absolute zero menace from him and just seems like an entitled rich boy you want to slap the smug out of.Halle Berry Post Oscar win is pretty terrible, too. Looks great in a bikini, but that's about it. Rosamund Pike is slightly better, but really, other than Bond and returning established characters, the rest have just been thrown in with no real thought to them.",Die Another Day
262,23skidoo-4,Best Bond in years,8,6 December 2002,"One of the things that has kept the James Bond series alive for 40 years is its ability to adapt with the times. From the British style of the 60s, to the glamor of the 70s, to the techno 80s, Bond has adjusted to be relevant to its audience. Such is the case with Die Another Day (DAD). As a longtime Bond watcher, I'll admit that some of the updating takes a little getting used to -- but with everyone asking if Bond was still relevant in the wake of XXX and other films, it was a necessity for 007 to be brought into the (pardon the pun) '00s.As the anniversary Bond, this is a trivia buffs delight -- try and catch all the references to past Bonds on the first viewing, if you can! I saw one reviewer blast the movie for making reference to past Bonds ... that person missed the point. This film was meant to show us that Bond is still the hero we grew up with -- he's just been given a new coat of paint.
Madonna's theme is terrific. I think people who don't like it don't care for it because it's Madonna. I hate Madonna's music -- but I loved this theme song. When taken in context with the violent images in the opening credits (Bond films being one of the only films to still HAVE opening credits), the lyrics to the theme song make perfect sense.Brosnan, meanwhile, makes 007 his own with a forceful performance. No one can be as good as Connery because Connery came first. But Brosnan with this film bypassed Dalton to become my 2nd favorite Bond.Halle Berry is good as Jinx, but I do feel she stole too many of the action scenes away from Bond, and Jinx is a bit too cold-blooded to be a likeable Bond girl. Rosamund Pike is stunning as the 'back-up Bond girl' Miranda Frost. I certainly look forward to seeing more of this lady in future films.I can't say much about the villain that won't give away any major plot points, but the Hugh Grant lookalike is fun to watch, and the writers have put in a twist that rivals the incredible twist in World is Not Enough.Bond's support crew are as strong as ever, though M is rather cold at the start. John Cleese's take on Q (and there's none of this R business -- he is now Q) is unique and fun to watch. Cleese's clueless persona from TWINE has been, thankfully, buried. The gadgets are cool, and with an invisible car and other high-tech toys, DAD is the most science-fictiony Bond film since Moonraker.
DAD is going to divide Bond fan opinion like no other film before it. And that's just what the franchise needs to shake it up a bit. I consider it to be the best Bond film since Spy Who Loved Me, and possibly since Thunderball.",Die Another Day
263,padiyark,This is not a real Bond Film,2,9 December 2002,"Yes, Pierce Brosnan is a good Bond, but the director and writer for this movie have annihilated Bond in this film.Let's start right from the beginning, and this is no spoiler. Bond gets captured and spends 14 months in a Korean prison. Now really...the maximum Bond ever spent in captivity was one day, and at that, he knows how to escape. And even when he was captured, he always maintained his cool and suave. Here, Bond is traumatized by the experience and wants revenge. If you want to see a good Bond in revenge mode, see ""License to Kill"".Second, what's the deal with Halle Berry? OK, she looks good, but she doesn't have half the suave of most other Bond women on film (excluding Grace Jones). With comments like ""Yo momma"", and ""I'm always a Jinx"", she does not fit the role of a Bond woman. Definitely miscast, and her character miswritten.Third, since when did bond have an Irish accent? Until he gets cleaned up, Brosnan sports an Irish accent. What's up with that?Fourth, all the Bonds, even if you didn't like them, were admittedly cool in hard circumstances. This is the first time that I've seen Bond actually struggling and uncool in key action sequences like a duel and escapes. OK, there are some cool action sequences, but overall, I would have never paid to have seen this film.",Die Another Day
264,Juan_from_Bogota,Great End of the Brosnan saga!,8,9 April 2007,"Intense, good and captivating!, good stylish action in a great film! totally recommended.In this movie, the last of Pierce Brosnan saga, we can see an very evolved James Bond, which shows an amazing self-control and experience as a ""00"" agent (this is the 20 official adventure of the agent). Brosnan, conscious of this, creates a character with a high self-confidence and style that requires a Bond of this level. This is maybe one of the Bond films where you'll see a lot of different places in the world, from the warm Cuba's beaches to the cold Iceland, stepping on South Korea, North Korea, Hong Kong and London. There is a lot of technological fiction on this movie also, really interesting, like DNA transplants, satellite mirrors that reflect and focus the sun light, cars that vanishes and some other toys. Halle Berry is beautiful and charming as Jinx, and the fight scene with swords is great too. The only thing that i didn't like of the film was some of the dialogs; is obvious that they tend to be so boring and without any sense, as the one that Bond and Jinx have in the beach.This Bond film starts in North Korea where Bond is on a mission to uncover some dark business with diamonds and weapons, under the command of Colonel Moon; Bond is betrayed and uncovered to the agent Zao, at Moon's service. Bond is got captive by North Korean communists and is tortured trough 14 months. After this he is exchanged for Zao by the M16 organization because they think that Bond has given vital information to the communists, and is relegated as agent. Bond then starts to find Zao and the clues to find who betrayed him and to obtain information about Zao's operations, in this mission, where Bond is by himself at start, he travels to Cuba following Zao's steps; he also travels to London to find some billionaire involved, Gustav Graves, important man on the diamond business and lover of extreme sports, and the mission takes Bond also to Iceland, place where some of Grave's business take place.The cinematography is incredible, and the places and scenes are amazingly obtained, showing high standard action scenes!. Rosamund Pike is also charming and beautiful. A great action film to collect as Jamos Bond XX, 40 year anniversary and the one that shows an experienced and confident 007 agent. 8/10!",Die Another Day
265,tbabe29,"Not Bad, Berry miscast....",7,27 November 2002,"I don't have much to say about this film, except I wish I had worn a jacket. Looking at all that snow and ice had me shivering in the theatre.It was cool to look at, Brosnan is fine, the stunts and special effects are fun.  However, I think Halle Berry was miscast or maybe I had the wrong idea in mind about her character.  I assumed she was supposed to have some amount of sophistication, but against Brosnan, I thought her performance was rather flat.  His voice is so commanding and yet hers is so.....unconvincing.  I don't get what happened.  She seemed so ""street"", which doesn't have to be a bad thing, but it didn't blend well in my opinion. Not alot of chemistry. Kudos for the up and coming British actress (name escapes me-but not for long, I am sure) who played alongside Brosnan as well.  She will be a major star.Flawed, but fun.  7/10",Die Another Day

It's far from great and its execution is shaky, but with the HD realism era in vogue, it gets more hate than it deserves. The first act of the movie implies a more realistic adventure with Bond coming back to MI-6 from his near-death (Skyfall, anyone?) and North Koreas as his enemy. As it goes on, it becomes more colorful and fantasy-like, but with really noticeable CGI. I think the glass-shattering ring, invisible Aston Martin, the gene-changing sci-fi elements and a palace made of ice were some creative ideas.The plot, as well as numerous scenes, are derived from older Bond films, in trying to pay homage on it's 40th anniversary.

One could've expected higher quality from the ""Once Were Warriors""-director, but NO. The ending was the worst. The climax on the plane was dragged on & on and was so far fetched, I thought I watching a ""Streetfighter"" sequel. Only few moments bring this effort above one star, but I won't take the take time to go on about them. Why bother, I bet the next on WILL be one star.

Now I know it's a Bond film and the emphasis isn't usually on plot, if at all, but this has to be one of the most poorly written movies in recent years. Sure 'some' of the stunts look cool, as do 'a few' of the action sequences, but most of the time they look very fake and quite unconvincing. Halle Berry looks good, great in fact, as a bond girl, there's no doubt about that, but the character becomes fairly annoying especially towards the end. Pierce does a good job as 007, but he may want to call it quits after the next one (yes he's signed on for at least one more) and move onto better things. The bad guys are pretty standard and pretty bad, though Ronny Yu at least has a little fun in his limited role.

There is a strong leaning towards effects in big productions, and Die Another Day has all that. So imagine 50 pages of story with lots of illustrations and you have the James Bond comic book. There are really good action segments such as the sword fight and the opening sequence, but classic Bond had more than that. Wouldn't it be great if the next Bond had some real depth? Now that would be something. This one, Die Another Day, isn't the worst Bond but far from the best. As entertainment I give it a 7 but as Bond its a 5.",Die Another Day
272,MovieJunkie1976,"Recycle your cans , not your film...",6,27 February 2015,"**Warning! Spoiler Information Inside!**After the critically unimpressive response to The World is Not Enough (1999), The Franchise enters the 21st century and it's 20th film with no clear direction and coughs out Die Another Day (2002).Bond uncovers a diamond smuggling operation on the Korean DMZ. In Undercover character he confronts it's ringleader Col. Moon (Will Yun Lee)and dispatches the operation competently , except , he is captured by the North Korean Army.Again the formula is rehashed not replayed. If the above synopsis seemed at all familiar a review of 1971's ""Diamond's are Forever"" will truly expose the recycled plot line. This in no way detracts form the fast paced smooth direction of Lee Tamahori (Next). In fact the splendor of this film is in its character actors who at least are original and refreshing as opposed to the plot.Amongst the highlights are Madonna as a fencing pro, and Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike), as perhaps an attempt at a modern feminist answer to the old guard Bond archetype. Damian Falco (Michael Madsen) is great at filling the spot usually reserved for Felix Lighter. Also and of course there can be no denying the absolute beauty of Halle Berry's Jinx.The transparently recycled theme sinks it , although much credit is to be given to this cast for trying to save a doomed vessel.Average at best.3 Stars(of 5.)",Die Another Day
273,Rooster99,A solid Bond,7,5 June 2003,"Despite the worst theme song in the history of the Bonds (I can't believe that trash was Madonna, what terrible, horrid, grating electro-pop rubbish), this Bond succeeds quite well in bringing us new and original stunts, cars and Bond girls.  Honestly, that theme song brings back memories of early 80's one-hit wonders back in the Karma Chameleon days, I had to shut the DVD off when it came on AGAIN during the end credits.The stunts are well put together, the car chase scene with the new car was very exciting, and contained the usual amount of impossible tricks and maneuvers worthy of the best of the Bonds.  The disappearing car was a bit much but fortunately, it was sparingly used as a minor gadget rather than an object central to the plot.  As usual, the plot revolves around a bent general intent on taking over the world, this time with an untouchable space-based laser (Dr. Evil would be so proud).  Ah, gotta love Bond!  Of course Bond is out to stop him, and is the only agent the British could muster despite the fact that it may mean the end of the free world as we know it!!******SPOILER ALERT!!!!**************************There were some glaring plot holes that no one seems to mind given the fact that we are watching a Bond; for instance, how is it that no one in England seems to cotton on to the fact that the spy was on the same fencing team at Harvard as the evil megalomaniac?  She supposedly won a gold medal at the Olympics!!  Her entire life from birth to victory would have been covered in one of those horrible smarmy overcoming-adversity segments the Americans insist on broadcasting as build-ups to any sporting event, purportedly to increase the drama and demonstrate how the athlete overcame hardship (""and then, she broke a nail when only 6 years old <sob, sob>, she overcame that to win gold at the Olympic games 20 years later!""  Even if ABC didn't discover that she used to fence with a North Korean General, you would think that MI6 may have discovered that fact during her vetting.  But I am getting far too picky, I have to remember this is Bond we are talking about.  The plots are meant to be ridiculously far-fetched.There was also the introduction of the rocket car, which led to the hilariously bad para-surfing scene.  Can't they come up with better effects than that?  It was reminiscent of the early Moore Bonds from the 70's, but at least they had the excuse of being filmed before computers existed!! The idea was good, but they did not pull it off.  It seemed like it belonged in a Snake Pliskin movie rather that a Bond. It didn't detract from the film however, it is a minor complaint.  It just bugs me that it so poorly done, hasn't this franchise made any money in the past 40 years?  Can't they spend a few dollars (or pounds) to at least try to make the CGI effects seem real? It really made me laugh as that has historically always been my chief complaint with the Roger Moore Bonds (remember the skiing scenes in Spy Who Loved Me?  His smiling face as he stood in front of a blue screen, fake skiing??? Ugh!!!)Finally, the Bond girls were very good.  Berry portrayed a very strong woman, an equal partner in Bond's escapades.  Although there is the necessary damsel-in-distress scene, you really did feel that Bond felt for her and wanted desperately to save her.  A very good performance by a seasoned professional, Berry seemed to be having a great time throughout. Also, the bad girl Pike handled her sword extremely well, despite not having an athlete's build, she looked very comfortable swinging away.Good old Remmington Steele does make an excellent Bond.  He has the dry wit (somewhat lacking this time as the sexual humour was bland and obvious), the look, and the sophistication to stand up to Connery's portrayals anytime. A solid Bond; lots of action, a great many explosions, a terrific car, and an enchanting Bond girl.  What more could you ask for?7/10",Die Another Day

Must be the longest running series in the history of the Cinema. The cast get replaced as they age or depart this life, the special effects get slicker thanks to Digital, and a number of fine actors have played Mr. 007. The films tend to be made on a fairly predictable formula, with the theory of the plausible impossible. Die Another Day, is no exception to this. Some of the best action occurs in the teaser sequence before the main titles, there is the usual grand set piece in this case an Ice Palace looking like a design by Jorn Utzon, and lots of fast moving chases and fight scenes. John Cleese and Judy Dench do their duty again in minor roles, while the sexy lady in this movie, Halle Berry reprises an Ursula Andress scene in the 1962 Dr. No. The baddies are the North Koreans nowadays, lead by an unlikely Toby Stephens after some exotic cosmetic surgery. Pierce Brosnam is one of the better James Bonds, cool and suave, perhaps lacking the droll humor of the first and still the best, Sean Connery, or the elegant confidence of Roger Moore.

No, it delivered a lot more than I expected - and what extra it delivered wasn't very good.The problem is that this could just as easily be titled ""James Bond Tries to Become XXX"". Everything in this movie can be divided into classic Bond and cartoon superhero Bond. The classsic Bond stuff works *really* well. The other only served to make me recall that ""XXX"" did it better.[potential spoilers ahead]The early scenes with Bond's capture and torture are reminiscent of the ""Casino Royale"" book. Such scenes could never have been shown in more innocent times. Bond's toys (the realistic ones) are great and the Aston-Martin vs. Jaguar duel (Ford must have paid through the nose for product placements with this one!) was excellent.However, the music's jarring - I doubt anyone, even the head-bangers in the target demographic, will leave this Bond film humming the tunes. Another staple of ""Extreme"" movie making, the dizzying cutting and rapid camera movements don't do anything to enhance the film, only to unsettle the audience. The film makers need to understand the difference between vertigo and suspense.Finally, two key scenes, both involving water were implemented using CGI FX. Aside from the obvious implication that, unlike previous Bond films, there is no stunt person in the world who could actually do them, there were shockingly shabby! The second of the two has more the look and feel of a home video game than any attempt at reality.All Bond films live and die on the strength of their villains, and this one was pretty forgetable. A female villain was more interesting, but her part was poorly developed. Unlike many others, I didn't find anything inherently bad about Halle Barry's performance. Perhaps if she does get own spin-off franchise, she could grow into the part.All in all, an OK show and I would see it again now that I know which parts to fast forward through.",Die Another Day

I really think he is a cool dude. But this movie just kept going and I got sick of him. Not to say Die Another Day was bad, just it was too long.

My Take: 7/10 My MPAA rating: PG-13 for substained sequences of action violence and for sexuality.",Die Another Day
277,Theflyace,"Bond Month #20: Silly and Over-the-Top, but Nostalgic for Me",6,24 October 2013,"Die Another Day was chosen to be the centerpiece of the 40th Anniversay of the James Bond films. It would encapsulate everything that was Bond and more. It was a bit disappointing in some regards because it did a lot of things wrong, but still managed to do most of it right. Is it horrible? No.The story involves Bond seeking to stop a Diamond miner named Gustav Graves who is actually a plastic surgery disguise of a North Korean Colonel who Bond thought had died on a mission a year before. Graves wishes to destroy the U.S. and South Korean minefields and defenses to create a path for North Korean conquest, using a diamond-strung satellite in space known as Icarus.As I mentioned in my review for The World is Not Enough, Pierce's last hurrah as Bond was in that performance. Here he is good, but the spark was missing. He has good humor, but he does look a slight bit older to be cavorting around with Halle Berry. It's a good swan song performance for him, even though he was in front of a green-screen a lot. The supporting cast is good, with Halle Berry as Jinx and Rosamund Pike as Miranda Frost provide memorable Bond girls. Toby Stephens is a good villain, even though at the end of the film he becomes the over-the-top megalomaniac we were afraid he was going to become. Judi Dench and John Cleese are classic M and Q respectively, so its all good.But we get to the part of the movie that really drags it down, the CG-shots and the direction. Dirctor Lee Tamahori has completely forgotten that the secret to Bond was to make it seems as plausible as possible in the stunt work. Here we instead get a lot of shaky cam and really poor computer effects. It makes things so silly, the villain turns into a RoboCop-esque suit that spews lightning bolts. So yeah all this mucks up a potentially good Bond film. Actually, the invisible Aston Martin vanquish is truly awesome.This movie is also chock-full of references to past Bond films, as this is the 40th Anniversary Bond film, but that's not why I have such a like and nostalgia for it. This was the very first Bond film I saw in theaters when I was 7 years old. So this was as cool as it could have gotten. It will always be there for me to watch.This Bond film came I think at the wrong time. 9/11 happened so the over-the-top/Roger Moore kind of Bond extravaganzas just didn't seem in good taste anymore. But with the next film solved that problem.Onto that great film and the first starring Daniel Craig, Casino Royale.",Die Another Day
278,cadfile,Fun but no Harry Potter,5,19 November 2002,"It was interesting that for the 40th birthday, the writers and producers returned Bond to the time of Connery. The women, violence, and gadgets take center stage in this thrill ride.Bond movies usually have one thing that most action flicks don't and that is intelligence. Watching a Bond flick is great for the thinking person but ""Die Another Day"" sacrifices intelligence for more eye candy and action. Thus this movie doesn't rise above the run of the mill action movie. To me it seemed to be one fight scene after another and a plot full of holes it was hard to follow.Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond since Connery but he has little to work with here. Halle Berry steals many of the scenes with Brosnan but due to the plot holes you don't know why she is there or why she is doing what she is doing. Rosamund Pike was a more interesting character as ""Miranda Frost"".Many of the fight scenes were shot with a jerky camera and after a while I got a headache. The jerkiness made it hard to follow the fights. The now famous scene where Berry came out of the water in ode to Dr. No's Ursula Andress was interesting except it is shot in slow motion and Brosnan has no reaction at all except to raise his binoculars to see her. I would think he would have smiled or even smirked but his non-response spoiled the scene for me.The scenes with John Cleese were funny, almost too funny for a Bond movie. There is even a reference to Monty Python. The other pun lines were over the top in some cases instead of the usual Bond subtlety.I didn't like the title sequence at all but it does give an added dimension to Bond. Madonna's theme song is the best since McCartney's ""Live and Let Die"" and while it was nice to see her cameo, her scene seemed pointless and pasted in at the last minute which I think it was since it was the last scene filmed.I would rate the movie a 5 out of 10.",Die Another Day
279,crazyrabbits,Absolutely horrendous...,3,28 June 2006,"I must say, after watching the 20th entry into the James Bond franchise, ""Die Another Day"", I think that it was a wise move to ""re-invent"" the Bond franchise with a new cast, because honestly, this film is complete trash. I will admit, I haven't seen every Bond film available, but I must tell you that this movie approaches B-movie levels of campiness and cheese.For those of you who haven't seen the film, I will explain the plot to you: James Bond (played by Pierce Brosnan, who, in my opinion, gives the only good performance in the film) goes to North Korea, ends up ""killing"" a Colonel in the Korean army. As a result, Bond gets captured, tortured for a while, and is then exchanged for his freedom. Unfortunately, MI6 (and M, Bond's boss) think he's compromised their security, and so Bond must work to clear his name and stop...a British guy who built a super-suit that increases his powers. No joke. Also along for the ride are Jinx (who might be a secret agent, but I honestly didn't care because she was a bland, lifeless individual), some guy named Zao who has diamonds stuck in his face (are you telling me that he can't get them pulled out?), and some other people who are just there for plot exposition.Where do I start? The ""plot"" is a complete joke. If the producers had actually focused on making a believable and coherent story instead of trying to cram references in from all the previous Bond films (as per this movie's trivia page), the end result might no have been half-bad.As it is, the story is just plain ridiculous. Bond has gone from fighting worthwhile villains (like Auric Goldfinger, Scaramanga and Alec Trevelyan) to fighting a media mogul, a man slowly being killed by a bullet in his head and a Korean-turned-British man who wears a cybernetic suit. Worse yet, it feels like the film focuses on the women, gadgets and stunts rather than the actual story, but I'll get back to that in a minute. I mean, I've seen some things in the bond films that stretch credibility, but come on, a giant laser that stalks Bond across a snowy landscape trying to fry him? A random encounter with a woman who just happens to be a spy (and Bond girl) as well? Come on.It doesn't even feel like a James Bond film anymore.Looking at all the Brosnan-helmed movies, James has gone from a British secret agent with a knack for getting himself into trouble, an inventive mind and a dry wit, to a one-liner spouting fool who relies too much on flashy gadgets and can apparently do anything or be with anyone just because his name is ""James Bond"". In addition, he is completely overshadowed in this film by other characters (most notably, Jinx, who James meets near the beginning of the film and subsequently works with her until the end of the movie).I understand that there were some ridiculous gadgets and devices in the earlier Bond films (Moonraker comes to mind), but my God, here the level of CGI'd effects and gadgetry becomes almost ridiculous. It's like something straight out of a video game. First, we have a giant laser that can shoot at any part of the Earth, can cause untold amounts of damage...and it's being used to shoot at a guy driving really fast in his car. Next, there's a giant car chase sequence in which Bond uses an ejection seat to turn his car upright after it flips over (wouldn't the ejection seat bounce around in the car and kill him?). Finally, and in what is the most ridiculous action sequence I have seen in quite some time, Bond and Jinx successfully start up a helicopter IN MID AIR after having it fall out of a giant plane that's flying. And all this showcasing the graphics of a Playstation 2. I can contend with Bond driving a tank in ""Goldeneye"" or a remote controlled car in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", but this is nuts.A lot of things didn't make sense in this film. For instance, is it really possible to turn from a hard-nosed Korean general to a sword-fighting, debonair British millionaire solely on the basis of ""DNA therapy""? And wasn't it true that the one woman who Bond meets at a party that knows about him probably will betray him at the end? And what about the American agents who just show up near the end for no reason at all than to provide plot exposition?Bottom Line: This feels like the ""Batman And Robin"" of the franchise, which is truly sad in that it could have been so much more. I give this film a 3 out of 10, if only for Pierce Brosnan's performance, which was seriously hampered by the inanity of the script. There is no reason for me to recommend this. Go see any other Bond film for greater satisfaction.",Die Another Day
280,Steven Reynolds,"Long, loud, laborious mess",2,17 December 2002,"Diamonds, DNA or doomsday? Writers, please make up your minds. This story feels like the nervous (or lazy) agglomeration of too many ideas, too many opinions, and not nearly enough good sense. Had the very surprising anti-British/American angle taken up in the opening scene been retained, this could have been a vastly more entertaining night out. But it's a Bond film, after all, so provocative subtext is quickly swept aside to make way for hot chicks, cool gadgets, and a one-dimensional megalomaniac villain with  surprise, surprise  some freakish henchmen and a doomsday device up his sleeve (this time, quite literally). But while it hits all the traditional Bond notes, it somehow just doesn't play. Halle Berry is wasted, as are Rick Yune and relative newcomer Rosamund Pike (""Grace Kelly bio-pic, here I come."") Brosnan goes through the motions capably enough (copious chest-hair notwithstanding), but Toby Stephens is simply laughable as the villainous Gustav Graves. It doesn't help that he plays him uncannily like Rik Mayall's Lord Flasheart from ""Blackadder"". Even the trademark, innuendo-laced dialogue is surprisingly flaccid  ironically, it now sounds like an ""Austin Powers"" script, but without the nerve go all the way. The digital effects are far too obvious (only the climactic sequence really impresses), but it's the ""stunts"" they're used to create that really annoy  Bond's escape from the iceberg goes too far, even for this franchise of cinematic impossibility. As in the ""Star Wars"" prequels, it isn't so much the quality of the effects which grates  it's the low quality of the writing they're trying to represent. With so many Bond parodies and knock-offs crowding the market these days  from the deliberately funny (""Austin Powers"") to the unintentionally hilarious (""xXx"")  the original franchise is going to have to do much more than just trade on its name. It can't be that hard. Just start with a decent script.",Die Another Day

282,Jack_Yan,A predictable romp in the ice,2,2 January 2003,"Not since On Her Majesty's Secret Service has a Bond film really surprised us, and Die Another Day  reviewed here from the director's home town  is no exception.While Tamahori moves things on at a good pace, one gets the feeling that this is to cover up some flaws in the movie. While Bonds are not known for character development, there was ample opportunity to make a few of the roles a little deeper. This is a ""Hollywood flick"".Since there is less depth (and no single script surprise) than the previous Michael Apted-directed outing, Die Another Day tries to impress us with pizazz, beautiful women (newcomer Rosamund Pike is believably ice-cold and stunning) and Bond one-liners, which Pierce Brosnan is now comfortable delivering. So is it a flippant Bond? No: here, too, there are missed opportunities: when Mr Kil (Lawrence Makoare), the token Maori in Die, meets his comeuppance, one could imagine Bond quipping, 'He needed that like a hole in the head.'Die is a 75 per cent Bond. For lovers of the lighter style, it delivers three out of four times. For those who want a more vengeful Fleming Bond, it delivers three out of four times (Bond is initially angry about his North Korean experience, but later only half-heartedly so). If you expected a chase sequence that knocked the Thames scene in The World Is Not Enough for six, the ones here go about three-quarters of the way. The villain is Flemingesque, but as with Renard in The World Is Not Enough, his weirdness (he doesn't sleep, for reasons explained in the film) isn't played up much. David Arnold's usually brilliant talents in scoring the movie falter toward the end-it's fine for about three-quarters of the length (and works very well with the imagery). And the beautiful Halle Berry is considerably overrated, her Ice Palace party dress looking like something out of Morgan rather than Murad.While beautifully shot  both Tamahori and director of photography David Tattersall did well on this front with both stock and format  the movie has illogical moments, particularly in this post-Austin Powers era. Scott Evil's 'Why don't you just shoot 'em?' argument arises several times, more often than in The World Is Not Enough.Die Another Day's greatest sin is its reliance on unrealistic computer-generated effects for both a wave-riding sequence in the middle of the film (though the water and ice were impressive, the fake digitalized Bond riding them was very, very poor) and the dénouement.Still, it's a worthy addition to the Bond canon. Pike, as mentioned, is one of the best, and certainly one of the most beautiful, actresses to be introduced to the world via Bond, as much as Jane Seymour and Daniela Bianchi, but with her subtle English charm. Danny Kleinman takes a leaf out of his work for Goldeneye by showing the passage of time through his opening title design (and it has golden eyes). Arnold's Jinx and action cues are memorable and fulfilling. Christian Wagner's editing brings a welcome, fresh style to 007. John Cleese has relaxed into his role of Q rapidly, comfortably filling Desmond Llewelyn's shoes. The Cuban clinic scenes at Pinewood show inspired sets by Bond veteran Peter Lamont, while the gadgets are well-designed, including those in the Aston Martin and Zao's Jaguar. And the invisible Aston Martin Vanquish  its cloaking technology isn't that far from reality, contrary to some comments  is a nice step into a possible future that may inspire engineers as much as space-programme developers at NASA were when weaned on Star Trek.Ignore all the comments about this being a more muscular Bond, or a Bond more tailored for Pierce Brosnan  none of them are true. It's not a product-placement-fest, either; Moonraker still holds the title there. It's ""just a Bond"". Everyone earned their pay on this. And that is, sadly, what Bond has become. A money-making machine, a licence to earn, and with those Boy's Own story lines, it's not even that edgy any more. Nevertheless, since most other action movies have become scriptless excuses for pyromaniacs having a field day, Bond still rises above them. Just.",Die Another Day
283,elcoat,"Worth the swordfight scene alone, which beats Flynn and Rathbone in Captain Blood.",9,4 May 2019,"Watching a captioned copy of the film, it states how the actors Pierce Brosnan and Toby Stephens were themselves into the intense (and very dangerous) swordfight scenes.From fencing foils to sabers to BROADSWORDS and not in armor, but in a staid English club, even slashing fine painting prints.And with broadswords, a miscue could have resulted in an actual decapitation! And the escalation of the anger indeed OUT OF CONTROL rage looked ... genuine ... and like it could have only one ending, until cool if not frigid Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) broke it up.The previous lesbian insinuation between Miranda and swordswoman and dominetrix Verity - unforgettably played by uncredited Madonna, who should be in the first *IMDb* credits for this film - was a nicely degenerate British wrinkle.I cannot recall a better swordfight scene in any film, including the battle of the champions in El Cid.Then there is Halle Berre emerging from the Caribbean in a bikini even beating Ursula Andress's in Dr. No. On the other hand, she plays a cold-blooded killer agent which really isn't Halle.More scenery of Iceland itself would have been appreciated, although the icebound environment was novel.The opening North Korean scene was also great, as well as the Asian actors. The various vehicle chases at the end became repetitive, although the idea of drowning in a room was the stuff of nightmares.It is a film to watch more than once, as I just have ... for the swordfight alone. :-)",Die Another Day
284,johnklem,Underrated,7,5 January 2015,"Die Another Day is vintage Bond, but with Brosnan rather than Connery. And therein lies the problem. It's a problem of perception. This is a really good Bond movie. Is Brosnan a good Bond? Yes. A great Bond? No. The lightness of touch that Connery had and even Moore had, is lacking. It wasn't always thus. Look at any episode of Remington Steele, but time and life took an unfair toll on Brosnan and the humor was lost. The other elements are there in spades though. The girls. Halle Berry is a class act and delivers real. Real smart, real sexy. The role's not that well written but in the cannon of Bond girls, she's up there. Then there's Rosamund Pike. She's not a teenage boy's fantasy, unlike most Bond girls. She's a man's fantasy and all the better for it. Smart, understated and devastating. She's more of a mold breaker than Berry. A very different Bond girl. The action is always good, sometimes sublime. There's a visceral edge to the fencing sequence that you can't fake. Toby Stephens deserves credit for this. He's a particularly good and convincing Bond villain throughout but in that scene his desperation, his need to win, is palpable. Which brings me to Madonna. WTF? Yes, the song's borderline awful but her cameo role? It's fine. Actually better than fine. I wanted more. Why the critical carping. If I have a single overarching criticism, it's in the length of the final sequence at the Ice Palace. It's as good as anything from earlier Connery movies but a few more minutes on the editing room floor might have improved the balance. Underrated.",Die Another Day
285,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Full of energy but misjudged and juvenile,3,8 June 2003,"After seeing it again, I have to say Die Another Day is neither is dull as Diamonds are Forever, or as mechanically formulaic as You Only Live Twice. It is a movie full of ideas and enthusiasm, it's just channeled in the wrong directions.The two major problems of Die Another Day are evident in the first ten seconds, in the gun barrel and the CGI bullet. Completely unnecessary CGI; and completely misjudged messing with classic the Bond elements.Director Lee Tamohori wants to misbehave and shake up all the essential Bond staples. Bond doesn't escape! Bond gets captured and tortured! Bond has long hair and a beard! And it just goes on. Bond doesn't have a cool car, he has a cadillac! Such an approach is almost like directly addressing the camera, it spoils the suspension of disbelief far more than Bond escaping MI6 by slowing down his heartbeat. You can almost hear Tamohori laughing, ""Hey viewers, we know what you think will happen, but - ha! - it's completely different for once!"" Bizarrely, Die Another Day also goes out of it's way to acknowledge every single previous movie in the series (as well as taking plot elements from the Moonraker novel), so it's also a series of homages, some subtle (Bond and Jinx's escape from the crashing plane is taken from The Living Daylights) some not so (""Well, diamonds are for everyone,""). Q's storeroom is amusing but doesn't make any sense in any context, and is again beating the audience over the head where subtlety was required.If Terrence Young directed Die Another Day, he'd celebrate the fact this is the twentieth Bond with subtle nods and cool restraint. I think this is something EON have realised, and with Casino Royale they've realised that less is more. The homage to Goldfinger in Quantum of Solace is far more tasteful than DAD's hamfisted attempts.The puns are absolutely the worst I have ever heard in any movie (""Please don't take it out yet,"" etc). It could have been written by 14-year olds. Even the few decent ones are not helped by Halle Berry's approach. Bond tells Jinx he's an ornathologist, Jinx looks down at his groin and says, ""Now there's a mouthful."" Just embarrassing, and it would be fine if the editor just cut that shot of her looking down. Do they think the audience is stupid? The overdose of CGI is self-explanatory. The obsession with, at the time, fashionable camera moves and slo-mo is awful, especially as it's used very badly anyway. The action scenes, whilst slightly better than The World is Not Enough, are still weak. Lacking geography and energy. Take Bond's scuffle with Zao in the hospital; it's just a series of shots of Brosnan and Rick Yune doing various falls and punches, badly edited together. It's just poor. Bond's fight with Graves at the climax is so bad as to be shocking. It's just a collection of close ups of each actor being punched or kicked. The actors barely sell the blows, and Tamohori even adds the slo-mo to one shot to try and improve it. This is the worst action scene I've seen so far in this Bond marathon, worse than even the too-old-Moore-inhibited antics of A View to a Kill.Die Another Day is essentially a Disney Bond movie. Bright colours, clearly drawn yet basic characters, every actor full of enthusiasm despite having very little to work with. It's a very family friendly Bond movie. It's like a cartoon. Gone is the attempts at something more realistic of Brosnan's previous films. Instead we have a Korean general turning into an upper class English toff who owns a palace built from ice. Wearing a RoboCop suit. Shooting purple electricity at people who drive invisible cars.Brosnan does solid work and clearly relishes the chance to have Bond experience betrayal and do something different. The rest of the cast are decent, I found Zao to be an effective villain. Tobey Stevens plays Graves exactly as he should be, disgustingly snobbish, but the character should be in another movie. Maybe a comedy about an English boarding school. Halle Berry gives 120% enthusiasm but is stuck with a ridiculous 'bad girl' secret agent character that has absolutely no characteristics besides what I just wrote. Thank goodness the Jinx spin-off never arrived. Michael Madsen's inclusion is completely pointless.A note of praise to Rosamund Pike as Miranda Frost, I found her one of the most effective Bond girls during Brosnan's tenure. Again, a 2D role, but she did it with grace, and as an actress she's perfect for the Bond series in the very way that Halle Berry is wrong for it.With DAD, it seemed EON had forgotten that the best Bond movies underplay everything, not overdo everything. Goldfinger does everything with such elan, such style, such a lack of fuss. DAD has no idea of the word restraint.The truly awful thing is, after the CGI bullet, DAD starts so well! The pre-credit scene is tense and murky, has a sense of realism and danger the rest of the film completely misses. And has decent action! I could well believe the pre-credit sequence was from a completely different movie. The idea to show the girls dancing in the credits as Bond's hallucinations is also effective. But from then on, it's all downhill.So afterwards I don't despise Die Another Day any longer, I just wish it had gone in another direction artistically. It's a real kitchen sink of a film, and Bond needs to be refined. One of the weakest Bond entries, but perhaps not the worst. We'll see.",Die Another Day
286,lethalweapon,I am sooo disappointed,4,26 December 2002,"I just saw ""Die Another Day"", and realized that nothing is impossible. As an irked and disgruntled dedicated Bond fan, with a solid claim of having viewed all the 20 Bond movies over the years, I was convinced that Bond movies would not succumb lower than the deplorable standards set by ""The World Is Not Enough"". Well, tonight I stand corrected. They have done it.Granted, ""The World Is Not Enough"" does not rate as low as the despicable ""Moonraker""(The absolute worst), or ""A View To A Kill"", or ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". But it took away the charm of the Bond flicks to an extend. I would have thought they'd learn their lesson, take a bow, and move on. But through skillful direction, rigid scripts, and impeccable craftsmanship, ""Die Another Day"" actually makes one appreciate the comparatively slight misgivings of ""The World Is Not Enough"". I guess I have that much to thank this movie for. I love Brosnan as Bond, and it seems so bad that his last two installments have been, mildly speaking, inadequate. Rosamund Pike strikes way off. The director probably slept through the production. Desmond Lewellyn (The Old Q) is sorely missed, although his replacement, John Cleese, is doing okay. The villain also lacks a certain panache. Other than a genuinely thrilling (though short lived)high speed hi tech chase, the movie was, by and large, an undisguised insult to the Bond genre.Bond movies used to be special.And on that note, let this critic close this review.Signing off, I remainJoy, Hamish Joy",Die Another Day
287,pete36,Best of Brosnan Bonds,7,21 February 2003,"Bond leaves  behind  a truckload of  political correctness that had taken a grip on the series (as in many recent US movies) and lets go some of the tired old clichés but  keeps the good stuff in. Finally Brosnan is at ease with the Bond role and hopefully Dench(M) and Cleese (Q) will remain on the job for a while.The new car, the fine stunts, a great partner, some bonafide villains and a solid script full of twists and loopholes all add up  making DAD into the best of the Brosnan Bonds.The return of  the Aston Martin is definitely a big improvement on the very bland BMW's we were stuck with, mostly cars driven by sales reps or CEO's of IT companies.The villain of service is a worthy opponent of Bond, very menacing  and positively scary,  an improvement on  the  effeminate Jonathan Pryce in GE and the rather bland Robert Carlyle in TND. The special effects are excellent, even as they are more relying on CGI than usual as for a Bond   stunts must to be as real' as possible. Halle Berry as `Jinx'was a pleasant surprise.  Instead of some feminist Hollywood version of Bond, she turns out to be by far the most likeable of all former Bond's recent conquests. 
Even  on current events DAD is right on the money, pointing to North Korea a possible threat to world peace (Iraq being undoubtedly a bit too close to reality).Director Tamahori makes for swift and fast-moving action and should be first in line to direct the next one. Try to catch his excellent `The Edge', a wilderness adventure movie starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin, which probably got him his DAD ticket .Conclusion : Definitely one of the  more worthier efforts in the series.  , of course not on par with `Goldfinger', `On her Majesty's Secret Service'(one of my favourites) or `the Spy who Loved me', but still great fun.",Die Another Day
288,kittiwake-1,*yawn*,1,9 September 2006,"I love Halle Berry. She's beautiful, talented, and a joy to see on the Hollywood red carpet. But as Jinx, let's just say, her performance rhymes with sux. I used to be a semi-fan of Pierce Brosnan. He's OK as an actor. I liked his old TV show, Remington Steele. I liked the premise. He was never the best part of the show. I think he got chosen for Bond because the studio liked his performance in The Thomas Crowne Affair.(It was his best movie, but still not that great.) He's got a British accent. He's tall, dark, and handsome. Whatever. I saw this movie at a dinner party with friends. Usually, I don't do my Mystery Science Theater bit around people I don't know very well, but this time I did it with perfect strangers. They even joined in, filling in lines that the characters COULD have said to at least make the movie entertaining. This Bond movie should never have been resurrected. Maybe he should have died that day. Then we wouldn't have to see Pierce get fired and some guy with blonde hair get the role. -- Since when has ""tall, BLONDE, and handsome"" been a description for Bond?? -- This movie was a real yawn-fest.

290,trouserpress,Has anyone ever stopped to notice that Pierce is a very strange name for a person?,7,9 February 2004,"Die Another Day is the twentieth official Bond movie (not included are two versions of Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again), and as such represents something of a milestone in the ageing superspy's life. The producers therefore had quite a lot of expectation to live up to, and luckily Die Another Day for the most part delivers the goods.Pierce Brosnan appears very much at ease with his Bond persona as he goes from action scene to action scene, deftly picking of villains and dropping some natty one-liners along the way.The plot hearkens back to the darker, slightly meaner Bond of Fleming's original novels as he sets off on a personal vendetta against the wishes of M (in many ways reminiscent of License to Kill), but before too long he's back to his old self again, under the caring arm of M and Q. Q's gadgets get more and more sophisticated with each film, so it will come as no suprise to learn that Bond's main asset this time is an invisible car, fitted with machine guns and missiles of course.The storyline, revolving around dealings with North Korea and double-agents, is no more challenging than any other Bond, and presents you with everything you've come to expect - exotic locales, beautiful women and physically disfigured villains with an unhealthy interest in world domination. Brosnan tackles them all with equal aplomb and emerges from each encounter more or less unruffled. My only real gripe with this film, and the movie world in general, is the increasing reliance on CGI, which in this film looks very dodgy indeed. I would rather see stunt-men risk their lives for our entertainment than see a CGI Bond that looks like something from Super Mario Brothers any day. Of course when CGI is good you can't tell the difference, but when it's rushed or done on a low budget, which appears to be the problem here, it just lets the whole movie down. Rants aside, this is an enjoyable, entertaining movie, and for Bond trivia buffs there are a cornucopia of references to previous movies to keep you glued to the screen. What more could you ask for?",Die Another Day
291,DaRick89,"Entertaining, but saddled with serious faults",6,21 November 2018,"My feelings towards Die Another Day are quite mixed. As a piece of entertainment, I rank it quite highly. As per the dictates of the 'Bond plot structure', it does sag a little bit in the middle after an explosive beginning and before a similarly dramatic ending, but there are enough action set-pieces to keep the film flowing more smoothly than any other Brosnan-era Bond film. However, technically the film has serious deficiencies which prevent me from appraising the film in an especially glowing light. In a sense this film reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Commando, insofar as the deficient technical quality and over-the-top entertainment balance each other out.One serious deficiency is the plot. There are some promising elements: the topic of choice (North Korean renegades causing mischief) is quite topical if not especially original and there are plenty of twists and turns throughout. If nothing else the plot keeps you on its toes. It is also not afraid to poke fun at itself (Bond's reaction to the invisible car) and its references to prior Bond films are actually quite subtle and clever at times.However, the plot also lacks logic and restraint. For instance, the notion of a North Korean transforming himself into your everyday Caucasian through the magic of gene therapy stretches credibility even for a Bond film. It is also not properly explained how someone can possibly change their entire appearance, create a new identity and form a successful, world-renowned diamond company within the span of just 14 months. Would such an individual's past not lead to scrutiny? Other plot devices range from flawed (Brosnan's complete and quick mental/physical recovery from being tortured, plus why wouldn't Zao have his most distinguishing feature removed first if he wanted to disguise himself?), to laughable (a character named Mr. Kil, the goofy power suit), to just plain unbecoming for a Bond film (the invisible car, with its sci-fi overtones).The dialogue similarly lacks restraint. It was as if the screenwriters recognised that Bond's penchant for double entendres and witty quips was one of the series' defining features and so decided that the audience would love it if conversations were crammed with them. However, excess soon renders such repartee tiresome. Jinx's references to her own nickname were also gratuitous while her blaxploitation one-liners don't really suit a Bond film.The direction also warrants some opprobrium. The camera angles and frequent cuts at times make it more difficult to comprehend what is happening, especially during the action scenes. The CGI shots also look surprisingly cheap and tacky at times (notably the infamous Brosnan surfing scene) given how lavish and expensive the production was. The choice of theme song was also uninspired given its autotuned mien and...unusual...lyrical matter.Additionally, the acting warrants some criticism. Brosnan himself is in fine form as always, bringing a suave, sophisticated air to the otherwise somewhat silly proceedings. However, Halle Berry is saddled with a poorly-written character and so is difficult to take seriously as Bond's equal beyond her physical appearance. Stephens tries to inject some vigour into proceedings but the premise behind his character and his power suit just make him look ridiculous instead of being a menace. Madsen is an awkward fit as Jinx's NSA boss given his past roles. Rick Yune and Will Yun Lee are pretty chilling but they are also underused, while Madonna's appearance is nothing more than stunt casting. Rosamund Pike fares better, cultivating an icy personality that is not overly weighed down by double entendres, while Judi Dench allows some sympathetic moments to creep into her otherwise stern personality. John Cleese firing barbs at Bond is also a welcome sight.In summary, Die Another Day is more entertaining than any other Brosnan-era Bond film due to its explosive action scenes and plot twists. However, the film almost collapses under the weight of its technical faults. By all means see this film, if only to understand why the franchise was rebooted, but don't expect a masterpiece.3/5 stars",Die Another Day
292,Austin_Powers-1,Vengeful Bond,6,15 April 2008,"know that many fans have been angry with Pierce Brosnans last James Bond movie, and I will also join the group who finds Die Another Day only slightly above average compared to other Bond-films.Brosnan has definitely found his role as 007 and Judi Dench plays M meaner than she ever has done before. Rosamund Pike also does a great job, but Halle Berry seems lost as Jinx; her one liners are NOT funny and seems completely misplaced. Toby Stephens makes a boring main villain and Rick Yune as the diamond faced henchman Zao is a walking parody. John Cleese is a poor replacement for Desmond Llewellyn and though he tries to play the role with clenched teeth, he is still 'John Cleese' and not 'Q'. Finally, putting in an invisible car is truly an insult and by doing it, they changed back to the Roger Moore cartoon-style.So why does this film work anyway? Brosnan makes a terrific James Bond and you truly believe in his vengeful agent, and though everything is highly overdone, it still contains the classic James Bond elements, which bring joy to all of us Bond enthusiasts.All in all; With Die Another Day they managed to pull off a James Bond film, which lost contact with reality and became a comic-style film instead. Whenever you think this is good or bad, it will still keep you entertained.",Die Another Day
293,zapdude,Unbelievable,4,12 August 2003,"Unbelievably BAD, that is.Years ago, aome friends and I sat down as a joke to design the worst possible Bond movie... all the most worn out, tired cliches, the worst one-liners, etc.This movie WAS that movie.  (Spoilers ahead)*Whack* - how's that for a punch line?*Care to wager?* - no, I don't go in for cock fights.The TRUE power of Icarus... Mr. Bond was right beside me and didn't figure out who I am... Bond, James Bond... and don't even TALK to me about that horrific and pathetic ""theme song"".This movie is NOT without it's pluses. As an example for how NOT to make a Bond film, this movie shines. As an example of how NOT to use special effects, this movie stands out. Oh my GOD... an invisible CAR?! That's just embarassing. The ever-annoying zip-around-fast-forward scene change?

294,bluzman,Dependably Bond,7,15 December 2002,"I really enjoyed this movie, as I have the entire Bond series, but I wasn't dazzled by it like some of its predecessors. I heard there were references all the previous Bond movies hidden within this movie. I didn't find them all -- I would like to see a listing -- but having found several, I believe it to be a true statement. One real disappointment in the movie was the music.  Don't take this wrong, because I actually enjoy much of Madonna's work, but this is the bar none worst theme of the entire series.  Overall, the movie had a little too much computer techno stuff and not enough of what made Bond movies Bond movies -- the music, quick wittedness and panoramic views.In as much as I expect Bond to continue, I think they need to sit down and go over the greatness/weakness factors and rediscover some of it. I wish a little peon like myself could actually have a discussion with those with the power inside the Bond organization. I just might have something useful to contribute.",Die Another Day
295,JohnLennon1985,Oh Hell Yeah!,10,7 December 2002,"This movie was the most pumped up action packed movie in the series, not top mention Pierce Brosnan's best Bond movie. From beginning to end, there was non-stop action that kept me at the edge of my seat. It wasn't a plotless movie with a bunch of explosions, but the movie did have lots of explosions and eye candy to go along with its classic Bond plot.Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry, as usual, put up a good performance. Will Yun Lee's acting was not as good as it should have been. If he's a natural born Korean, lived in Korea all his life, and speaks English as a second language, there should at least be an accent. His acting was a little on the flat side. Judi Dench, John Cleese, and Samantha Bond also gave us some good comic relief while Rosamund Pike, Rick Yune, and Toby Stevens made a good supporting cast.This movie was well worth the money I spent to go see it. Pierce Brosnan proves once again that he's almost as good a 007 as Sean Connery. I give this movie a 10, and that's shaken, not stirred.",Die Another Day
296,maros612,action but boring,3,21 August 2003,"I need to say I'm not Bond-specialist, I've seen only those movies that came out in the last two decades. I wanted to see a new one since I was curious to see what would Halle Berry be like a Bond girl. Although I knew what I can expect from this kind of movie, I have to admit I was fairly disappointed. First half of the movie is quite attractive. Good scenes, music, visual effects, quite interesting story. The other half of the movie looked to me completely different. Most of it was very predictable, and the action scenes were desperately prolonged, so two thirds of them seemed to be pretty much boring to me. And especially pathetic were the ""about-to-give-up"" scenes, because these appereared in the movie multiple times. For me, it was one of those movies where you ask yourself how long it actually is. I rated it three.",Die Another Day
297,TIALI,A Love Letter to Bond,6,23 November 2002,"I liked that Die was like a love letter to Bond films: it has silly action and a ""golden gun"" like from the Roger Moore days, solid punches, potential laser dismemberment, and an Astin Martin from Connery, many interesting elements...but ultimately not very interesting.  And why doesn't Bond remember events from past films like when he smelled Klebbs' shoe like he didn't know why it was dangerous (poison?)? It's like there's a vat of Bonds being grown somewhere and each one is given just enough info to continue as the next Bond.  Die Another Day packs much into it, but was spread a little too thin.",Die Another Day
298,nealklein,Just die already,6,25 November 2002,"We've come a long way from the masterpiece spy thrillers of the 60's. Now, our films are cynical, action-packed, dark, and the governments of the bad guys and the good are both not to be trusted. Somehow, we call this jaded attitude ""sophisticated"". And yet, this new James Bond film is the result of catering to our sophistication.""Die Another Day"" is superb eye candy. The locations are new, but not dreary as those in ""The World is Not Enough."" The women are as delicious as freshly baked cookies and ice cold milk. If Halle Berry doesn't make your mouth water, Rosamund Pike should. The villains have the aspirations all Bond villains seem to need to have: start a big war, take over the world, etc. And the gadgets are often ingenious if not very interesting.So why isn't this Bond like Daddy used to like? Because like a bad cook, the ingredients are used in the wrong amounts, and consistently bad at that.Brosnan's Bond has a great character arc, but he gets some of the most heavy handed lines to deliver. I do not care if you can do Shakespeare or a Doublemint gum commercial: nobody can take puerile, inane lines and make them work and still *not* look like Leslie Nielsen in a Naked Gun film. What we have here is a talented cast with a script that deliberately squashes their characters flat into two dimensional cardboard cutouts. Only Cleese and Berry come out relatively unscathed. Apparently, Cleese is so comfortable with his role as Q that he comes across as if he was always meant to have that job. And Berry knows how silly it all is so she plays Jinx as playful. Still, even she cannot combat some of the idiotic moments in the cartoon script.Next misused ingredient: sex. Watching James Bond having sex kills the gentleman-spy image for me. Yeah, yeah, I always knew what he was doing in his past films, but to have to see it on screen in my face for several minutes was so gratuitous that it hammered home that I was watching a product of someone trying to manipulate my emotions and not watching a story. As for the innuendo, please give me a break. The lines were so flagrant and overemphasized that I felt real pity for the actors saying the lines.The action sequences are really great in staging and progression, even if the sword fighting is handled with less aplomb. The opening sequence is dynamic, and if the advance press didn't reveal Bond's capture at the end of it, the lead into the credits would have great impact. The high speed chases were quite a hoot to watch, and they did not employ too many special effects until a certain point. The special effects were fine until someone started using CGI. The result in the surfing scenes (among many others) was so distracting that it was laughable. All I could think was that the overall result looked fake and cheap. The producers should hang their heads in shame.And don't get me started on the decrepit excuse of a theme song that Madonna performs. This song makes Lulu's ""Man With the Golden Gun"" and Gladys Knight's ""License to Kill"" sound like Shirley Bassey's ""Goldfinger,"" for pity's sake.But this is just what one can see if you can turn your brain off. May heaven help the fool who watches this movie with even the tiniest ounce of grey matter working. Then, the film moves into the realm of the idiotic.SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!1) What WAS Jinx doing trying to kill Zao? What was in it for the Americans to do that? And what about the doctor at the gene therapy clinic? Is she just a classy looking assassin and nothing more?2) When did NSA start doing things external to domestic communications and internal security? And what was Zao doing that could involve NSA's interest?3) How does Bond realistically swim in ice water without at least gloves, let alone facial protection, in water cold enough to paralyze you in a matter of minutes?4) How do you stabilize a plane that has totally lost cabin pressure, and if you do, why is there no noise as if someone fixed the destroyed glass?5) Why would MI-6 accuse the American intelligence agencies of not revealing information about Miranda Frost's background when a standard security background check should have revealed that information already?6) How did James Bond learn how to stop his heart, or is that a trick they teach you in MI-6 basic?7) Why would a MI-6 contact in Cuba not verify with MI-6 that someone coming out of nowhere using an old secret code might not, in fact, be an infiltrator or rogue agent?8) Why didn't Zao ever just have the diamonds embedded in his face surgically removed, if he was getting gene therapy to change his appearance anyway?9) What reason could Miranda have to keep Bond from getting captured? Was she trying to lead Bond away from what he was tracking? Wouldn't it make *anyone* more suspicious?10) I know what conflict diamonds are. Did the producers or the director think to explain what they were to someone who might not know?11) Why couldn't the Americans fire a missile that reaches a certain altitude out of line-of-sight of the satellite and then strike the Icarus from the side instead of straight on? Or couldn't you detonate the missle before actually hitting the satellite so the shock wave throws off the satellite's orientation?12) If you have a handheld laser that can cut through at least half a foot of ice, why use bolt cutters to tear open a chain link fence if you're in a hurry to catch the plane on the other side? Wouldn't the laser be faster and easier to carry?These were a dozen obvious gaffes I could see right from the top. The list is far longer if you actually think about what didn't make sense in the story. And I'm not even going near continuity errors and such since I will not be wasting my time viewing the movie a second time.I have just one thing to say to Wilson and Broccoli: let Bond die already. This movie will only give Mike Myers more fodder for his spoofs and reason for audiences to watch ""The Bourne Identity.""",Die Another Day
299,Workin_Man,Great Bond Flick!!,8,17 April 2006,"Personally, I don't know how anybody can't like Die Another Day. I thought it was a great Bond movie!! All the haters out there are probably people who have read the novels and now they are loyal to the books. To me, it doesn't matter if a movie is like the novel or not. All I care about is if the movie is entertaining, has good acting, has familiar actors, and good special effects. Other than that, it doesn't matter to me in the slightest. I think it would be miserable to be faithful to a book or novel because, when you're expecting something this way, and you get it another way, then literally the whole movie is ruined for you. Which would suck in my opinion.Die Another Day is a great Bond flick. It is entertaining, has a great actor for Bond, a very evil villain, and a really pretty Bond girl. Speaking of actors, all the acting in this film was superb. Pierce Brosnan gave us an excellent performance as super-spy James Bond. Toby Stephens gave us a truly haunting performance as the super-villain Gustav Graves. Last but certainly not least, Halle Berry gave us a truly memorable performance as Jinx. Like I said before, the acting in this film is superb. A job well done by Pierce, Toby, and Halle.The one thing that truly made this Bond film enjoyable was the big car chase near the end of the film. It was an amazing thing to watch. I never knew cars slipping and sliding on ice was so fun to watch!! When I was watching this movie I thought, the stunt drivers must have had the time of their lives making that movie!! I know if I was one of the stunt drivers, I would be having the time of my life!! This film was a rush from beginning to end. It was extremely entertaining and I enjoyed every single minute of it!! So please don't listen to the haters out there. You will enjoy this film no matter what. I am sure of it.",Die Another Day

301,bgood26,"Great action, but...",7,24 November 2002,"While a very good movie with spectacular action and effects, there were several things wrong with ""Die Another Day.""First, in the opening sequence, 007 is captured and tortured. Bond never gets captured, much less tortured. The torture scenes continued through the credits. Usually, the only visuals during the credits are silhouettes of nude women. The torture was intertwined with the silhouettes.Second, the James Bond theme is now computerized. Some things shouldn't be played with, and the James Bond theme is one of them. What's next? A computerized version of ""The Magnificent Seven""?Then there were the annoying camera effects. I'm sure the crew intended for them to be 21st century ""extreme"" effects, but they became dizzying after a while.But not all was bad. Pierce Brosnan has clearly established himself as the second best Bond. (No one does it better than Connery.) Halle Berry--beautiful she is--was great as the American operative Jinx. Madonna made a cute cameo as a fencing instructor. And the action was great.Worth a note: John Cleese is the new Q, replacing Desmond Llewelyn, who died three years ago.PG13 for typical Bond-esquire bloodless violence, painless death, and discreet sex scenes.",Die Another Day
302,dieseldemon85,What were they thinking!,2,20 August 2019,"I was never a Brosnan fan as 007. I can honestly say though I disliked this one even more than The world is not enough or Thunderball. This was the most outlandish of the series,it would even make the double take pigeon from Moonraker say WTF. Come on gene therapy to change your race, invisible car, ice palace, or the diamond encrusted face of a hench man. The director should have been let go early on, Halley Berry was forgettable as Jinx, Madonna's song was ok,but not typical of a Bond entry, she even had a Razzi worthy cameo. The whole film was Razzi worthy right down to the high school film Dept CGI. This Bond entry is on the same level as Clooney's Batman and could have ended the franchise, actually it did hence the reboot. This was not a good swansong for Brosnan.

The plot is simple enough with a bit of a twist, it won't tax your brain which is just as well being a Bond film.I just hope they did not spend too much on Halle Berry being the main bond girl, not worth it, utterly forgettable, and having Bond kiss Moneypenny, surely a 007 no no.There is one cringe worthy scene in this movie and I've deducted at least a full point out of my score for this. This is when Bond meets Madonna's character, where Madonna's usual awful acting aside, we go from James Bond Movie to 'Finbar Saunders and his Double Entendres' Truly awful. Really they'd of considered that bit too lame for an Austin Powers spoofing.So all in all as a lover of both the Connery and Moore films I can find a much to complain about with Die Another Day, but Brosnan really is competent as Bond and it's a fairly entertaining affair.",Die Another Day
304,drunken_critic,Bond Rules,8,21 November 2003,"007 returns, I am kind of a connoisseur of James bond.  I own the box sets with all the bond movies, so I have to compare with past bond movies. Exotic locations, great stunts, beautiful women were standards of old bond flicks with Sean connery and Roger Moore.  Now Pierce Bronson has taken the lead. Halle Berry fits into the beautiful women mold, she seems to get more movie time than any other bond girl of the past does.  Exotic locations were less than stellar.  The movie starts in North Korea (doubtful it was shot in Korea, there are no landmarks of note just a beach and a military base, next the movie moves to Havana a little more scenery not much just Caribbean type houses and classic cars, London showed Big Ben in the background, and also Ice Land but all you saw was snow, and it makes me wonder if it was just a movie set.  I think only Havana and London were filmed on location.  There were a lot of computer special effects in this movie, but that is the problem.  There is a scene where bond is riding a computer generated wave. I personally felt cheated.  I miss the days of the old organic bond with movies where real stunts, like car crashes and plane crashes occurred instead of computer generated crap.  There was however a good organic car chase scene on ice.  Movie was good.  I still prefer the old Bond style of movie, but I still found this movie very entertaining and great escapism. 75/100",Die Another Day
305,DesbUK,Over-produced but watchable,6,31 March 2008,"""The name's Bond, James Bond"" are the most exciting words in the movies, and this 20th instalment (released on the series 40th anniversary) still managed to get mileage out of the formula through a mixture of an opening twist, some barnstorming set-pieces and production design by Peter Lamont that are easily up there with Ken Adam's best.The most notable thing about the film is the pre-credits sequence - an MI6 mission behind the forgotten Iron Curtain that separates North and South Korea. 007 (Pierce Brosnan for the fourth and final time) is to assassinate a North Korean despot called Colonel Moon - which he does, then only to be captured and thrown into a North Korean gulag where he is given up for dead and tortured for 14 months. It's something grim and unexpected, and certainly the series most shocking moment since the death of Tracy in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.What follows is Bond's exchange for a known terrorist and his deactivation from MI6 by M. Bond flees, pursues the terrorist Zao to Cuba, and then returns to London to confront the mysterious diamond billionaire Gustav Graves, played by a wonderful Toby Stephens playing the part like some ex-public school cad - if they ever film the FLASHMAN novels, he'd be perfect in the title role.Bond is reinstated by M and pursues Graves to Iceland and back to North Korea. Turns out Graves is Colonel Moon all the time, his features altered via a totally invented process called gene therapy. His plot is to use a giant space laser to destroy the de-militarised zone between North and Zone Korea.The whole thing is the most preposterous Bond since MOONRAKER, but it does have it's high-points. A duel between Bond and Graves in a London club, with the size of the blades and ensuing havoc increasing throughout the fight. Or a breathtaking ice palace where Graves resides is a triumph of production design for Peter Lamont. And, as always, David Arnold's score is stirring. The supporting cast are fun: Stephens, Judi Dench as M, John Cleese as Q and Rosamund Pike, who as the treacherous MI6 double-agent Miranda Forst is quite the best-looking Bond girl ever. Even the much derided invisible Aston Martin I thought actually quite clever.On the negative side, Halle Berry is simply dreadful as the NSA agent Jinx. Her dialogue largely consists of unfunny wise-cracks and at one point she is required to escape by stripping down to her bikini. And the scriptwriters don't bother to explain what the NSA actually is anyway. The climax on-board the villain's disintegrating super-plane is noisy and destructive without ever being especially exciting, and the car chase on the ice - with Bond and Zao's cars shooting missiles at each other like an aerial dogfight - is edited too fast to be comprehensible.However, this form of science fiction excess usually leads to the series coming back to earth in the next film. So just as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE gave way to ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and MOONRAKER gave way to FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, then DIE ANOTHER DAY was followed by the back to basics of CASINO ROYALE.For real aficionados of the films, watch the DVD with it's trivia track - it highlights dozens of in-references to previous films hidden throughout the film.

The first half hour is pure trash, and only gets slightly better.My major complaints are as follows: *What's the deal with the first half hour??? *the ""blue screen"" shots were done better in the early films; they are so incredibly noticeable in this film. *Diamond-face-man... come on; poor villian and poor makeup job. *The special effects are not up to par with what could have been done. Some of the explosions are good, but other things are just too cheesy looking. *TOO unrealistic, even for a Bond film.

This sorely disappointed me.  Bond movies have always boasted some of the most amazing stunts captured on film.  Why would they want to replace it with boring (and ridiculous) CG effects?  The viewing audience knows it isn't real... it's painfully obvious... and, as a result, it greatly diminishes any impact the directors were hoping to achieve.  You might as well show a hand drawn stick figure performing the ""stunt"" -- it achieves the same level of belief at a fraction of the cost.I normally rate Bond movies a blanket 7/10, but I gave this particular installment a 6/10.",Die Another Day

310,johnnysugar,A step up for Bond,8,24 November 2002,"It was with a mix of anticipation and dread that I saw the newest James Bond movie, ""Die Another Day.""  This is the 20th Bond movie in 40 years (since nobody counts ""Casino Royale""), and it's good to know that little has changed but the scenery.  Indeed, why Bond has survived this long is a mystery to me, because as soon as we sit down to watch him, we know he'll save the world, get the girl(s), and beat the villain.  Few franchises could keep so close to the formula for so long and survive.Pierce Brosnan is back as the titular spy, still full of charm and double entendres.  This time, however, he's been kidnapped by the North Koreans for over a year until MI6 reluctantly rescues him.  Even M (Judi Dench) doubts his usefulness in the modern world.  In order to prove himself, Bond decides to track down the agent who double crossed him in North Korea.  Along the way he joins forces with an American agent named Jinx (Halle Berry), tangles with the diamond-encrusted Zao (Rick Yune) and the so-smarmy-he-must-be-evil Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens).  And don't forget another Bond girl, fencer Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike), whose name says it all.The movie is certainly a step up from the painful ""The World Is Not Enough"", but not quite as good as ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" or ""Goldeneye.""  Halle Berry, for all the hype surrounding her role, is only barely serviceable as a kick-butt secret agent.  She lacks the proper gravity for the role, but she certainly looks good in her catsuits and Dr. No-inspired bikinis.  It's a shame that she has a hard time pulling off any role that requires a body suit (i. e. ""X-Men"").  The villains are not quite as good as previous ones (who can forget Famke Janssen's Xenia Omatopp?), and the plot, as always, is unnecessarily complicated.  However, since they've actually hired a real director for this one -- Lee Tamahori of ""Once Were Warriors"" fame -- the movie looks great and the action scenes are remarkable in their absolute excess.  Brosnan's a great Bond, and the movie hews very close to the Bond formula while managing to slip in a few new tricks here and there.  There's probably more CGI imagery in this movie than in all the other Bonds combined, and the electro-stomp theme song by Madonna is a nice step away from the traditional orchestra-and-random-diva numbers we usually get.Bond is about excitement and fantasy, and that's certainly what we get.  A good movie, despite the absence of the best Bond girl in ages, Michelle Yeoh (who was rumored to originally be in the movie).  Little extras: Madonna's cameo as a fencing instructor is amusing if slightly gratuitous, and make sure you stay until the end for the best Miss Moneypenny scene in decades.8 out of 10.",Die Another Day

Bond films will indeed have to wait to 'Die Another Day'.I've always like Pierce Brosnan's Bond, who has nearly the charm, dangerousness and wit of Sean Connery's definitive version, but also has some vulnerability, which makes him a more human and sympathetic figure. It's an update to suit our age, as are the stronger roles women have had in the recent films. Kiwi director Lee Tamahori continues these trends and also updates the special effects, which are spectacular. This is one of the best Bond films I've seen - from the agents surfing in to North Korea, to the car-chase on ice, to the delightful scenes with Q and Moneypenny, 'Die Another Day' is great fun. Yes, there are too many corny puns, even by Bond standards, the action sequences get a bit much by the end of the film and Madonna's title song is awful. But Bond is still, as they so obviously wanted you to say with the ice and diamonds theme, very cool.7 1/2/10Tane",Die Another Day

I mean, aren't they the ones who ultimately control the box office? Let's make sure that we tailor these films for them because it doesn't matter how believable the action is, they're teen-agers-- what do they know? Look how ""Charlie's Angels"" did! And that was definitely for kids between 12 to 17. You know, we need more ""American Pie""s, ""Spider-Man""s, ""Jay & Silent Bob""s-- let's make sure that we get 007 in the mix now! Bond was always good fun, but this is neither good nor fun. It's time to stop at the 20th Bond because both he and Austin Powers are really starting to show their ages! I'm embarrassed that I was ever a Bond fan after seeing this dreck! They're trying to spoof themselves after what Austin Powers did a few years ago. The action is superfluously ridiculous! The creators have used every plot line, every gadget, every villain, etc. An invisible car! Machines now that can reconfigure one's face and body, surfing commandos, Halle Berry oxygen-deprived for five minutes and then of course, surviving! A weak Rick Yune attached to an IV suddenly springs to life in order to escape Bond! Madonna's title song!....PLEASE!!! And wasn't Toby Stephens a menacing bad-guy? Did Maculay Culkin grow up and take this part for free? I guess we're just that stupid now! Sure, Bond films have had a checkered past, but now they're doing anything for a buck these days. Do the filmmakers actually think that they're going to top ""The Lord of the Rings""?

In my opinion the scenes set in Cuba and North Korea in the first half are good and are some of the strongest in the film. The scenes in Iceland begin well, but the end of it is very silly with the invisible car and the melting lake and particularly the surfing. The CGI while new and inventive is not brilliant in several scenes. Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry make a great couple though and are very strong together, and make the film much stronger.",Die Another Day
314,marshall89,Totally sweet!,9,6 December 2002,"This was the first James Bond movie I've seen in the theaters, and I'm glad. Why? Because it rocks! I'll admit it felt different than all of the others, but it's a great experience. The opening sequence is one of the most exciting ones, and the plot of the movie from then on is very unique. After spending 14 months in a torture camp, Bond is finally released. However, he's lost his 00 fixture and wants to get it back and kill Zao, a traitor. The whole plot is a little hard to explain, but it still makes a unique Bond adventure. John Cleese, the new Q, fulfilled my expectations and carried the humor that Llewelyn always had. It was great how they showed all of the old inventions like the Thunderball jetpack, the Aerostar jet and crocodile mini-sub from Octopussy, and Rosa Klebb's shoe that was in From Russia With Love. Bond's Aston Martin was also very cool too. Halle Berry, who played the slick Jinx, was tight. Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) was pretty hot too, but it was disappointing when it was official that she was a villain. Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) was probably not a classic villain like Max Zorin, Fransisco Scaramanga, Oddjob, or Jaws, but was still a solid and creepy enemy. As great as this show is, it still seemed to borrow some scenes from other Bond movies such as Goldfinger and Tomorrow Never Dies. But there aren't many other flaws in general. This movie has suspense, excitement, and fantastic action. This is one of my favorites and I believe you should see it. My rating: 4 stars out of 5.",Die Another Day
315,gevalero,"Unique Bond film, but also one of the very worst.",7,27 September 2008,"If you are as big a Bond fan as I am you might have found yourself defending this picture constantly but whatever hope on it you might have had, time doesn't lie and watching this movie 6 years after its release, I can't help but cringe through very long portions of it. The opening scene isn't too bad though hardly memorable (too many gratuitous explosions) but the only merit of the Madonna song is that it has reduced every discussion present and future about what the very worst Bond song is (no contest). Much was made about Halle Berry's role in this film but personally I found her a lot worse than the much maligned Denise Richards (Does anybody really believe her as a cool efficient killer ?, Does Bond really need his girls to be ""his equal"" in every way ?), just compare her to Eva Green in Casino Royale and you will be seeing everything that can be wrong and everything that can be right about a Bond babe. DIE ANOTHER DAY also has the distinction of having some of the worst CGI effects and in film history, its director is quoted in the DVD extras how CGI will someday replace stunts in the Bond movies, thank God this was his first and last collaboration. There are so many more things one can complain here (the stupid editing, the mediocre Rosamund Pike role, the villain's Robocop suit, etc.) but a lack of effort (or money) certainly isn't one of them, I only have a couple of suggestion to the producers, a) When featuring some of the most amazing ocean waves at the beginning of your movie, don't include a CGI man made / mega-cheesy one later on it, and b)The next time you feature one of the most beautiful cars ever made in your movie, don't make it invisible !",Die Another Day

Other than the cars, which are an essential part of every Bond movie, I detected no product placement whatsoever. Which leads us to the story. Sure it's the usual megalomaniac who has delusions to control who is thwarted by Bond but it is done well. It's action-packed, has witty dialogue, the characters are all interesting with the ""goodies"" likeable and the baddies suitably villanous. The double DVD in particular is good value with the 2nd DVD consisting of the ""making of"" including interviews with all the cast and production staff.",Die Another Day
317,DashTheGreat,"This movie is so bad, even James Bond hated himself",3,9 October 2007,"That's right, this movie is so god-awful, they completely changed the elements around for Casino Royale. This is the one that put an end to the 1D Bond villains shooting lasers at Bond, while having ""cool"" injuries that gigantic scars, or diamonds in your face. I would even go as far to say that this movie is vastly overrated on IMDb. This was nowhere as good as Air Force One, which has a similar rating. The villains were horrible. Whoever thought to make the North Koreans the villains should have at least had a realistic portrayal... i.e. ditching the robots that they created. Instead, we get genetic therapy, possibly the worst idea in a bond film I have ever seen. I think that the only idea that is worse was the entire plot of ""Moon Raker."" The entire script, start to finish, was rubbish. Bond suddenly gets captured by N. Koreans, gets tortured, but this doesn't add to the story at all. No sense of revenge or anything. They could have, and should have, left that part out, because it made very little sense. Secondly, a gigantic laser that heats the earth up? It fries missiles too? Am I missing something, or when they fried the missile, why didn't the beam shoot to earth and destroy a random city or something. Would have at least been a fun scene.Halle Berry was blah. Probably one of the lesser liked Bond girls. This, ""I'm a bad bad girl"" act was pretty annoying. Not to mention that the name ""Jinx"" sounded like a comic book character. Also, you're trying to tell me that they have the technology to do gene therapy, but they can't extract diamonds from a guy's face? If I got claymored and lived, you would think that would be a #1 priority.The invisible car was stupid. You almost kind of wish that they had that when Bond went to Korea. This plot could have been wrapped up in 5 minutes. Finally, that dumb cliché where you-know-who was bad, and did the thing where they point the gun at the villain, and then switch around to point it at Bond. It's been used in pretty much every movie with guns and agents.3.5 / 10 - Cheap entertainment, but overall lame.",Die Another Day

319,sterlinrivera-2000,"A Step Down, but Underrated & Solid Nonetheless",8,5 February 2020,"Die Another Day isn't as amazingly great like the last three Brosnan films were, but it was still pretty solid and happens to be an underrated Bond film in my opinion.James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) gets captured by North Koreans and held prisioner for quite a while. He gets out of prison, and believes that someone in his own agency betrayed him. He travels to Cuba to investigate and he finds out that Zao (Rick Yune) put him behind bars. Bond then teams up with beautiful and powerful NSA agent Jinx (Halle Berry) and together must stop Zao has he has a very destructive laser that will destroy the planet and all humanity.This was bit of a step down from the last three Bond films because of 2 reasons. The first is James Bond's new gadget that he gets in this is an invisible car. It is cool, but the CGI for it is a bit choppy. Plus, there's other CGI in the film like when people get electrocuted, and it does look a bit cartoonish and silly. The second reason is the plot felt rehashed from another Bond film, where someone plans to use a weapon to destroy the planet with a huge weapon, and Bond has to stop them. I felt if they slightly changed the story around, it would of been a lot better.Other than those two flaws, I enjoyed the movie. Pierce Brosnan was really good again, and I liked seeing Halle Berry as a Bond girl. They both have fantastic chemistry, and were a pretty cool pairing for the film. Rick Yune was also really good as the villan.The action is also very solid in this one, but the action in the previous three Bond films were much better, mostly because there wasn't really any CGI. There was still great action in this one and some really unique stunt work.Many people consider this to be one of the worst, if not, THE worst Bond film in the series, but at the end of the day, while it does have some slight flaws, I think Die Another Day is an underrated and enjoyable Bond film.",Die Another Day

But what it does have is a urgent plot in which Bond is out to enact his wrath on the mole who betrayed him on a mission on North Korea and than had him imprisoned, tortured and disavowed by MI6. The film moves along at a brisk pace filled with action set pieces with the climax set on aboard a blazing plane (including a cat fight to the death between Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike) that you can not accuse the film of being sedate. In what would be his last performance as James Bond Pierce Brosnan showed he was a more than worthy actor to have played the Commander.",Die Another Day

But this film is majorly disappointing, but it's not Brosnan that's disappointing.  Brosnan does fine.  It's the addition of Halle Berry that distracts from Bond.  The Bond films started out as just that - Bond movies showing James Bond's many facets.  Now he has to compete with Halle Berry for his one-liners.I heard a rumor that Die Another Day setup Jinx Johnson as an offshoot from Bond.  That would be fine if we could just be rid of her in the Bond flims. She can go off and do her own thing or whatever she likes and leave the Bond films to Bond fans.  Jinx can set up her own following, but please leave the Bond films in the Ian Fleming tradition of showing James Bond in his own glory without competing for attention in the same film.Hopefully Halle Berry will leave the series and go off and do her own thing elsewhere.  If not, it may be the beginning of the demise of the Bond films. I suppose we'll find out in ""Bond 21"" in November 2005.",Die Another Day

324,axopnk,Deserves more credit,7,9 October 2005,"This James bond flick deserves a lot more credit then some people put up. The story line was different, having bond captured as well as getting help from other governments besides Britain. It was also cool to see classic bond devices from past james bonds. Pierce was excellent as bond as always, but the rest of the cast was OK. Halle berry as a bond chic was alright, she wasn't bad but she wasn't great either. It took them a little while to explain her origins and the connection between her and bond wasn't great (i mean he's a British spy, he should be a little more cautious of her instead of seeing her again and just acting normal). On the other hand, The MI-6 agent was pretty good, and a little bit of a change since she could fence (she looked pretty attractive also, but you could figure out that she was the one that set up bond way before it was revealed (which reminds me, how many times wil M get duped? she got duped in The World is Not Enough also). Another refreshing thing is that Bond dealt with the korean governmen instead of the typical Russian Government and others. The main bad guy was alright (both GG and diamond guy). I think it would have been better if he stayed in his korean form instead of being a English guy. The reason being is it's been done before in the past bond of having a British/ white guy as the main villain(Golden eye as well as others for example). The diamond guy was standard bond type, but he didn't have any special power or anything to keep him in the film as long as they did. Michael Madsen wasn't really needed in this film, he didn't have much purpose, and using him was just a waste of money (i like his Mr. Blonde smoke a cigarette thing at the end though). Overall though it was still a good flick, definitely deserves more credit than critics gave it. I would rank this beneath Goldeneye, but maybe with the same level or a little better than The world is not enough.",Die Another Day
325,fidelio74,'The coldest weapon of all',7,3 January 2011,"Perhaps 'Die Another Day''s biggest sin is using CGI rather than relying upon the splendid stuntwork which has always made the Bond films stand out from the rest of the action pack. That said, it is still a very entertaining experience. Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade reference every past Bond movie throughout the course of the film as a nod to the fact that 'Die' is the twentieth flick in the enduring and influential series. It is a lot of fun to sit there and see if you can spot each reference, and this clever device does not intrude upon the narrative.The writers of Bond films have a tendency to reheat plots, and the space weapon - Icarus - on display in 'Die Another Day' recalls the deadly satellite with the lethal diamond-fuelled laser in 'Diamonds are Forever'. Icarus is the brainchild of smarmy diamond tycoon Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens, the son of Maggie Smith), who is the main villain of 'Die Another Day'. Also along for the ride to give Bond a headache in the bad guy department is Zao (Rick Yune) who, thanks to Bond, has diamonds embedded in his face. Seeing Zao after some time, Bond tells him, 'I've missed your sparkling personality'.Halle Berry as Jacinta 'Jinx' Johnson - 'Born Friday the thirteenth' - makes an excellent Bond girl, and she has her share of action scenes and acquits herself very well. She proves more than a match for Bond. And Miranda Frost (English rose Rosamund Pike, excellent) is as cold as her name suggests and - seemingly - immune to Bond's overtures. And it is nice to see Michael Madsen in a minor role as Damian Falco.Certainly, some of the action scenes are ridiculous; the parasurfing-on-a-massive-wave comes to mind. But Bond is often ridiculous, and more often than not ridiculously entertaining. Sometimes it is fun just to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Probably more than any other Bond film, 'Die Another Day' really feels like a summer blockbuster. The action sequences are spectacular - especially the airborne climax - but are countered by a very witty and intelligent script which crackles along nicely.The invisible Aston Martin was hugely controversial; I know that many Bond purists hated it 'with the fire of a thousand suns'! Personally, I thought it was fun, if a little far-fetched. And the car chase on the frozen lake is a real showstopper.'Die Another Day' may lack the grittiness of 'For Your Eyes Only' and 'Licence to Kill' but it makes up for it with pure popcorn escapism. Watch out for the stunning swordfight betwixt Bond and Graves which destroys a swank London fencing club ('Place needed redecorating anyway' a dreadlocked messenger observes drily as he regards the wreckage all around him); very impressively shot. Oh, and there is an amusing and uncredited cameo from Madonna as a leather-clad fencing coach named Verity. Madonna also sings the title song.",Die Another Day

In this case it will likely be the ticket for a block buster at the box office, but for those of us that go all the way back to Gold Finger with the Bond character we always expect more.We have learned to accept ""want to be's"" as replacements for the REAL Bond, Sean Connery.  Now don't get all fired up, Pierce Bronson has done some good work as his version of Bond but he seems to be fixated on the line...""Bond,---James Bond, but again he isn't the REAL thing is he?He has all the trappings of the real thing.  He has a beautiful woman, the fabulous looking Halle Berry.  I mean she looks the part of the arch-typical Bond woman, but she was not used as she should have been in this one I feel. Of course there are villains aplenty and in time we all came to despise them and cheer their ultimate demise, but they all seemed to be psychos and lacked the cold evil of other Bond Villains. There is a beautiful counter point in Rosamund Pike as ""Miranda"", but she is under used and over clothed by Bond standards.Anyway the direction, such as it is in a smash mouth explosion movie, starts off interesting and ends up slap stick. I know very little about director Lee Tamahari beyond the fact that he won some awards for commercials in New Zealand. On Directorial merit alone I hope he still has a day job back in sheep country.But this is a formula movie for me.  I paid to see beautiful women and bombs bursting and villains doing their worst and this one does that in spades.The one real delight was ""Q"" John Cleese added just the correct touch and should be ""Q"" for the next ten Bond films. Pierce Bronson may have one or two more left in him but we need to start readying for a new leaner and less long of tooth Bond.

327,jmcd2007,An Underrated Film / Brosnan Bows Out,8,4 January 2015,"When ""Die Another Day"" hit theatres back in 2002, most of the critics loathed this film, with most of the complaints targeting everything from the ""weak"" and ""unbelievable"" story plot to the ""overuse of CGI"" and yes, even Madonna's ""unnecessary"" cameo. Bond's invisible Aston Martin was also criticized. Well, to all of the hateful critics of this film out there, I'm here to tell you that I beg to differ.This film had everything that I ever would have imagined in a Bond film. The women (a very young Rosamund Pike and, especially Halle Berry, were excellent choices), intimate scenes with said women, Q (this time, played by Monty Python's John Cleese), the gadgets, M (played by the always outstanding Judi Dench), plenty of action, exotic cars and locations, and quirky lines, which were mostly delivered from the suave and sophisticated Brosnan. This film also successfully counterbalanced serious and more comical situations perfectly. To go from a surprising waterboarding torture scene that Bond faces after his cover is blown in North Korea to Bond mimicking Gustav Graves during a sword fight later in the film is astonishing and classic Bond. Did the producers go a little overboard on the CGI? Yes, but I was able to look past that. The addition of Michael Madsen as Falco was also another unexpected, but nice touch, considering he played the role of Jinx's boss perfectly. We later find out that Jinx is working with the U.S. government, and later teams up with Bond to bring down Graves (a.k.a. Colonel Moon after his gene therapy) and his accomplices.I once heard that the producers gave Brosnan the Vanquish shortly after filming wrapped up. What a sweet ride that would be to drive around. Something tells me that he might still have that car to this day. Unlike other critics, I thought that the cloaking feature of the Vanquish tied in well with the film, as in my opinion, it showed advances in technology and brought something different to the table. This unique feature also saved Bond's behind on more than one occasion throughout the film. Besides the epic sword fights, one of my favorite scenes in the film will always be the Bond/Zao car chase on ice. It's just something about two expensive and heavily modified cars chasing each other, especially on ice, that really grabs my attention.In summary, although this was a great way for Brosnan to end his run as James Bond, it's really too bad that this was his last outing, as he would've been great in Casino Royale. Despite having some negative feelings about the franchise after being let go (who wouldn't after being put in such a situation), you can now tell that he misses the role. If you don't believe me, watch ""The November Man"" which gives off certain ""Bond-isms"" in its own way.",Die Another Day
328,kmberger,Way too much innuendo.,7,15 December 2002,"This one had a chance to vault among the top five or so of Bond films. All the key elements are there:  A defined and strong villain; a world-spanning and over-the-top plot set in motion by said villain; two lovely ladies that have something to offer besides cheesecake; and some worthy set pieces of the series.But it's not quite enough to push it past such Bond entries as 'Dr. No', 'Goldfinger', and Brosnan's best, 'GoldenEye'.  Due to a script that relies all too much on double entendres and sexual innuendo, 'Die Another Day' induces more groans than it does gasps.  Despite all his heroics, the most astounding thing about James Bond is that he can still win the girl with opening lines like, 'Magnificent view,' while ogling the bikini-clad Halle Berry. Please. Give it a rest.'Die Another Day' tries things a little differently than previous Bond films, which is the good thing.  More vulnerability is given Bond, as the film starts with him being captured by North Korean soldiers and held captive for fourteen months, during which he endures torture and interrogation.  After he's released in a trade for Korean terrorist Zao (Rick Yune), he's essentially disavowed by MI6, left to fend for himself while he goes to catch the bad guys.  Without giving too much away, this film's villain is one of the best-developed of them all.
It's a good setup, involving Korean army connections, genetic identity manipulation, diamond-smuggling, and an orbital satellite called Icarus. British playboy Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) is a match for Bond in style, panache and recklessness and is a good foil for 007.  Zao has a great look for a henchman with his diamond-studded scars.  Many of the action sequences work very well, particularly the fencing duel and the car chase through the ice palace.  And John Cleese as Q pops in for a quick scene and a few very funny one-liners.  Also thrown in for good measure are several throwbacks to classic Bond:  Berry' bikini shot (Dr. No), lasers as deadly weapons (Goldfinger), and Roger Moore's old jetpack pops up.The framework is there; but the details kill the fun.  Berry's Jinx never quite clicks with Bond as she's working (and competing) with him.  Michael Madsen is tragically miscast as an American NSA bureaucrat.  The dialogue, as mentioned, is crass and silly - always going for the punchline without fail to the point of ridiculousness.  It's a grating habit, and for a movie that seemed to want to try something a little different with the Bond franchise, disappointing.A good actioner, an excellent (though not  classic) Bond outing.

The smooth dialogue just isn't there - just quips and one-liners massively over-used. The (usually) fantastic stunt-filled opening wasn't there. The 'can imagine in real life' gadgets aren't there. Ugh..So many things are wrong with this film. From some VERY dodgy looking CGI, to the sci-fi car. I was looking forward especially to the car chase scene on the ice, and, admittedly, seeing the modified to 4-wheel drive Astin Martin was fun. However, it was all downhill from there. Gone is the smooth, sophisticated car chase. What we have here is 'who can whip out the biggest gun.' Terrible, and overlong. I think the best quote of the movie came from Miss Frost. It went something along the lines of 'I'm not staying to watch this cockfight.' That pretty much summed up this movie. Oh, and don't get me started on Halle Berry. This movie doesn't even deserve the time to write a review. Just try and resist it..I know it's Bond, but it's....not really. They even changed the opening theme music (for the worst) and added a bullet flying towards you. Oh, and then there's Madonna's Bond track. Oh dear.

The script was too concerned with being funny, so many of the jokes turn out stupid. The whole crew seemed to be more set to make the ""biggest, best bond ever"" instead of just continuing and already great series.

335,ohroonoko,Unforgivable CGI and an invisible Vanquish hurt this film,9,17 October 2021,"The first hour of the movie is fast paced and fun to watch. The hovercraft chase is one of my favorite bond openings. Bond's torture blends into the title sequence very well and I happen to like Madonna's Bond theme; it's consistent with the fast pace and fun of the opening scene. The introduction to Jinx through James' binoculars is the best since Ursula Andress in Dr No. I would have changed the music that played over it, though- it was unnecessarily melodramatic.The latter half isn't bad, but it feels like a different movie with lower production values. It's as if they ran out of money. The Iceland scenery is beautiful but obviously not as colorful and vibrant as the Cuban scenes. The CGI used for Bond's para-surfing escape scene was egregiously bad and unforgivable. In the opening we had an awesome scene of Bond and 2 others surfing to infiltrate North Korea. It was real surfing, not CGI. Of course, Bond was masked so you couldn't tell it wasn't Pierce Brosnan. Still, the director should have either interpolated long shots of real para-surfing with the CGI of Pierce Brosnan, or he should have made Bond wear a mask/helmet like he had in the opening scene, and done away with the CGI altogether. By insisting on 100% CGI, it had a multiplier effect to the over the top setups of being chased by a space laser and driving an invisible Aston Martin.",Die Another Day

The villain, Gustav Graves, is a fun evilgenius. Some great stunts and action make this a movie to see. Ihated Halle Berry as Jinx, because she was a huge cliché, and Iloathed Madonna's theme song. Other than that and some veryhokey science fiction elements, it was a good movie. RosamundPike is the anti-Jinx as a terrific Bond girl. See this! 7/10.",Die Another Day

But, this movie was so ""over-the-top"" that I found it utterly ridiculous. The movie is about a young man who somehow makes enough money to create and launch a weapon that can wreak havoc on the earth. Bond and Jinx (Halle) have to save the day, and in the process avenge Bond from an earlier setup.Look, I know when you go to movies that you have to free your mind a bit and go along for the ride. After all, it's Hollywood and it's just a movie. But, the premise of a couple of youngsters infiltrating MI6 and launching a mega-weapon into outerspace made me laugh out loud. This film lost me. I gave up on it mid-way, and just found myself saying that if James Bond films have come to this then maybe its time for Mr. Bond to retire. After all, if a group of 20-something criminals can outsmart MI6, the CIA and the legendary Bond then perhaps the sun is setting. Maybe we can have the cast from Spy Kids challenge Bond in the next film! -- DP.",Die Another Day
338,rohan_g,Best Bond Ever,8,13 December 2002,"I notice how some people have commented that D.A.D is not in the true style of James Bond, however this would have to best Bond ever. Thanks to Tamahori's vision, James Bond has been dragged into the 21st century in terms of its CGI, editing and photography. Moreover the performance from Pearce Brosnan, Halle Berry and Judi Dench was fantastic. By combining well-established actors with the latest technology, Tamahori has taken the Bond series to the next level. The previous 19 Bonds they tend to be boring after the first 20 minutes, yet D.A.D is action packed, with my eyes fixated to the screen through out the whole movie. I personally think this would have to be best Bond ever. 8 out 10",Die Another Day
339,hippiegal,This movie was an utter piece of junk-I LOVED IT!,8,28 November 2002,"Might contain SpoilersFirst off I watch( and love) Bond movies for their camp value.  They're cartoonish, illogical and just plain silly. So when watching Bond flicks they go into two categories- 1.They work 2. They don't workWhich boils down to movies that are a guilty pleasure. Or movies that just make you want to rip your eyeballs out after watching them. Die Another Day is a fun, guilty pleasure. It works.While watching this movie it feels they have taken scenes and bits from multiple Bond movies and sewn them together. I don't know if it's because of Bond 40th (movie) anniversary. Or if the screen writers just ran out of ideas. Maybe a bit of both. So all through the movie I kept on thinking,""Okay that scene from Dr.No, that scene from Living Daylights, that scene reminds me of The Spy who loved Me,"" You get the drift. The Q branch scene offers a trip down memory lane of gadgets past. There are lots of subtle jokes for Bond fans that will go over the heads of people who got dragged to the film. (Such as my husband) Die Another Day starts off with a spectacular hovercraft chase in Korea. Much like the World is Not Enough the rest of the movie can't hold up with the exciting opening. Anyway Bond gets caught and tortured. Madonna's song is annoying on the radio, but works as a background song for torture sequence. Bond is released(looking like a 70's rock star) and recovers. The first 45 minutes have a dark tone  that works very well. Once Bond heads to Cuba the movie starts it's usual comic book feel. Over the course of the film it becomes more or less straight forward camp. The bad guy headquarters that look like  Epcot center and a cross between the McDonald's arches and a spider. The whole DNA subplot with a Korean man turning himself into a weenie British guy. Bond running around Iceland in just a turtleneck. But Pierce Brosnan looks like he's having so much fun in this movie. It makes the pure silliness of the movie work better than it probably should. So overall Die Another Day won't win any Oscars, but it's a good escapist movie.  It's a good two hours to keep your mind off finals or the stress of the holidays. Hopefully here's to 40 more years of Bond flicks.",Die Another Day
340,rosian,Another great Bond movie,8,28 April 2007,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and am surprised by all the negative criticism. It's terrifically entertaining as are all the earlier Bonds. As for invisible cars, didn't I read recently that a ""cloak of invisibility"" has been demo'd at some university in the US? So perhaps the movie makers were on to something here that we have had to wait a while to hear more of? I can't believe for a moment that it won't be possible to ""conceal"" objects in the future. There are stranger things that actually happen. But, in case it never proves possible, what's wrong with a bit of fantasy and a few laughs - laughing is good for us according to the scientists (little enough of laughs in CR2006, after all, another reason I hated it).Brosnan as always gives a sterling performance. I'm a great fan of all the Bond actors except the latest, Craig, who is a humourless mediocrity pretending to be Bond and for me has (helped along by all the other incompetence in CR2006) completely wrecked Bond. I can't imagine why Brosnan was rejected in place of a musclebound unknown with no charisma whatsoever. But Brosnan like the earlier Bonds has great Star Quality and Bond is a Star character needing a Star actor.Reality isn't an absolute necessity in Bond, so long as we can connect with the things that happen and it isn't too far into fantasy. Bond tortured - this movie did it right. Compare with the laughable sequence in CR2006. Brosnan knows how to act torture. The sequences in Iceland are beautiful and in the final dramatic scene stunning. Someone complained of CGI but do we really expect the producers to have to make this particular sequence for real...it's unthinkable. So what's the alternative to CGI? I don't suggest CGI should be used to replace reality in Bond movies unless the reality is just too dangerous or too difficult. And CGI is here to stay whether you like it or not.I liked the villains - clever twists and well-acted menace. Fantastic scenes in Iceland particularly. The Threat to Mankind......? Spoiler follows...Spoiler: I heard complaints that a finely targeted laser wouldn't be very dangerous but the movie itself demonstrates otherwise, surely. There are two opposing possibilities - Icarus, or some crude weapon that couldn't be targeted so causes huge blanket damage. I think the laser would be extremely useful as it can target individual buildings for example. A Star Wars weapon, surely. This movie offered this option giving us the chance to see what such a weapon can do or not do. Other Bonds can offer other options.",Die Another Day
341,prudhoeboy,Sigh Another Day,8,26 September 2021,"This movie looked a bit over the top when it came out and many of its elements still do, as discussed in numerous reviews on this site. It's getting another look at after the disastrous re-boot, however, and at this point is downright watchable compared to the frenetic, noir plots of the Craig films. Really, all the franchise had to do is more of the same with Craig and it would have been fine, but apparently the creators felt the need to virtue signal and bow to political correctness, whatever that is in a given year. The writers threw the kitchen sink at this one and I must say, for all its preposterous elements, it had enough good ones to be quite entertaining. The key to this movie is the elements, not the overall plot. Haley Barry worked well as a Bond girl in the movie, but Brosnan looked out of shape. That doesn't say much about the management putting out a Bond that doesn't even work out. Anyway, the movie had enough action and the characters developed enough to make it entertaining and worth watching, especially since it really was the last Bond film made.",Die Another Day
342,jeev7882,...one of the biggest miscues of the entire series...,3,4 December 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Imagine taking Rich Wilkes (the writer of XXX), making him watch some old James Bond movies, and then asking him to spit out a script for the next Bond movie. I imagine something similar to that happened when Neal Purvis and Robert Wade wrote the movie. This is an edgier, cooler, and ""fresher"" twist on the most successful film franchise in history. It's also one of the biggest miscues of the entire series - not as horrible as casting Timothy Dalton as Bond - but still bad judgment. With two highly successful spoofs (Austin Powers series and the soon to be XXX franchise) pressuring this classic series to change, it did change, but it changed so much that it comes close to spoofing itself. If a Bond movie has ever been stupid, not preposterous, just stupid, this is it.My first big gripe with this movie was in the very beginning when Bond and company surfed in undetected. No matter how much you want him to, Bond does not surf. He can ski, fence, and do a host of other things, but surfing is not one of them. Why? Because it totally takes away from the suave and charismatic spy that we are used to. He's not a brand new teenage spy saving the world for the first time, he's a well conditioned 00 agent. Luckily, the opening action sequence (a hovercraft chase over a minefield) follows this and it is very well done. I don't know if using hovercraft to float over a minefield actually works, but I can suspend a great deal of judgment in a Bond movie; he does always get shot at by a flurry of bullets and escape with barely a scratch. The opening sequence is kicked off with Bond using his usual Omega watch that doubles as a bomb detonator.  This is just one of many product placements in this movie, but none of them are inappropriate or get in the way of the movie. After this, things take a quick turn for the worst.The best opening title song of the entire franchise, Madonna's ""Die Another Day,"" is wasted in the typical opening montage. As separate entities, the song is amazing and the visuals accompanying it are creative and stunning, but they don't fit together. It is eerily similar to the Pepsi Blue add that played before the movie, where classic vocals from Monks are combined with the sound of a rock band. Putting two good things together does not necessarily make a better thing. After that, Bond is tortured and kept in a prison camp for 18 months where he is eventually exchanged for another prisoner, Zao. Zao has ""an expensive case of acne,"" with diamonds embedded into his face after the explosion that triggered the initial sequence. Bond is only released because of the political implications that his capture may eventually have against the British. His freedom is taken away and he is kept under close medical observation all because M suspects that he has spilled his guts to the enemy.You know Bond is going to get out and find out who betrayed him in the beginning and get all that revenge that he desires. Shortly after he escapes from his captivity, he meets Jinx. I appreciated the homage to the original Bond girl, Ursula Andress, when Jinx emerges from the water in her orange bikini and wide belt. I appreciated it not just because Halle is one of the most beautiful women on the planet, but because of the nostalgia (you can guess which one I appreciated more). But it comes out of the blue, and the character of Jinx (""Born on Friday the 13th"") is thrown into our faces without any rhyme or reason at all. There is no mystery behind her character, I knew who she really was from movie previews and late night talk shows, and I just didn't care about what her real intentions were either. She is supposed to represent a new kind of Bond girl: one that still shacks up with the super spy, but is a perfectly capable spy on her own. She turns out to be the exact opposite with James saving her bumbling behind on more than one occasion. If you want to see a different and more compelling Bond girl character, see Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies (my personal favorite Bond movie).The casting is one of the strengths of the movie even though the characters are not. Pierce Brosnan was born to play Bond, and I hope he keeps going beyond the next one. Connery may be the original and the unanimous best, but in my book Brosnan is right up there with him. When I see Brosnan in a movie or in real life, I think, ""Look, it's Bond, James Bond."" Then there's the Oscar darling of the moment, Halle Berry. She plays Jinx as tough as she can and almost makes her a respectable character, but when the fault is in the writing, there's only so much that can be done. At least it's a lot better than having Denise Richards as a Bond girl. Toby Stephens was the typical villain with a plan that's unreasonable, but interesting nonetheless. His character of Gustav Graves was well thought out, but I can't help but compare everyone in this movie to their counterparts in Tomorrow Never Dies. Graves isn't anywhere near the villain that media mogul Elliot Carver was. Miranda Frost (played by Rosamund Pike) was a character without any driving motivation. I never got a satisfactory explanation for why she picked the side she picked. My biggest character gripes were with M and Moneypenny. Why were two classic and vital characters virtually eliminated from the entire movie? Dame Judi Dench is an incredible actress, and the dynamic between M and Bond is always fun to watch. Even more interesting is the usual exchange of sexual quips that Moneypenny and James share which are completely missing from this installment. On a lighter note, the cameo by Madonna was a nice touch, but that's coming from a big fan of her's.Also, can anyone explain to me why the car and gadgets seem to constantly change, but ultimately digress? The same with his gadgets. This is arguably the coolest part of these movies, but it gets played down more and more and it also gets less and less interesting. The invisibility aspect of the new car was a nice touch, especially since it was believable and smart (most of which this movie is not). The car had many tiny camera's on it's body which captured it's surroundings and then projected them onto a type of ""screen,"" making the car invisible. How cool! He also gets a high pitched ring which is capable of shattering any glass, but no other gadgets. A trademark of the series, almost completely ignored. This is a horrible crime in my book. The other huge difference that jumped out at me was the CG special effects. There were many moments of incredible special effects in this movie, but it got excessive because the charm of these movies lies in amazing stunt work in incredibly well thought out and well executed action sequences. The blue screen was more excessive than the other CG effects. I wanted to jump out of my seat and scream at the top of my lungs. It was like we had taken a trip back to the 80's. There were more ridiculous and not even slightly plausible events, my favorite of which was the helicopter which started flying in midair. In close second place was the explanation for genetically changing the look of a person. It involved taking out your bone marrow, replacing it with the marrow from random people (so that the DNA would be replaced), and poof! You're a new person, but only on the outside. So if you're ugly and easily duped, you may want to make a quick note to self right now. In a tie for second was the one hundred thousand volts that could barely cook an egg. As an electrical engineering major, I can tell you with full confidence that since our household sockets can provide enough current to kill you, one hundred thousand volts can probably supply enough current to do some damage too.But, there were good effects and one very impressive car chase sequence where Zao pursues Bond on a vast icy expanse and then into an ice edifice. There was also a fencing match that turns into an all out sword fight between Bond and Graves that was more than your basic entertainment. The sets were one of the few things I had no complaints about. They were gorgeous and more than suiting for Bond. The CG which often complimented the sets or the settings varied from incredible to terrible. Incredible was any time Icarus (a satellite with diamond sails that focused the sun's energy) fired a huge heat beam. Terrible was almost everything else like the plane slowly breaking apart in mid air or a jet powered ice sled flying off the cliff.If you are debating on which of the latest guaranteed blockbusters you should see, go see Harry Potter 2. As for the latest Bond installment, the girls are beautiful and the action is endless, but I recommend that you leave this one for another day.",Die Another Day

Mr. Brosnan's grey fleck of hair looked good, but he too is rapidly growing a tad old for his license to kill. He did his best though with a horrible script, so convoluted and predictable it needed endless and meaningless fight, chase and explosion scenes to attempt to mask a lack of plot or direction. And how many times must the heroes allow the bad guys to get the drop on them. Perhaps only the Lone Ranger's Tonto got hit from behind more often. And under what glacier did they find Rosamun Pike as Miranda Frost? Even Madonna out-acted this block of ice in a vaccuum.

346,tomasg-69814,Bad Goodbye. Sad Goodbye.,4,27 February 2016,"Strange Pierce Brosnan finale this was. A 140 m $ show that was meant to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the James Bond legacy, but failed in my opinion. Yes, it's a 007 movie all right, but runs with an unnecessary roaring V8 muscle engine. A solid, faithful 4-cylinder was all that was needed. Makes an attempt to run on champagne, when it could have been in a reclined way, with a nice cold beer instead. Nice opening scene and some fun flashbacks is not enough for this kind of event.The makers fools away the good 007 spirit with too much ""make-up"" and flashy, garish scenes in such speed that a good seat belt was needed when you entered the cinema chair at your local theater in 2002.The use of flashbacks to the old movies is way too obvious and silly. Diamonds and lasers was already expended stuff, and the cast of Halle Berry was strange to me even back then. A good actress that wasn't really Bond stuff to me. Acted tough and cocky in a most annoying way, just getting along to the end. (Dr. No bikini scene rip-off is spoofed many times since.) Musician lady Madonna's cameo part is just there to fill up her ego. Of course, she had to spoil the good theme song tradition too, by performing a ""modern"" hard core dance track that isn't Bond material at all. (The worst 007 track that was, since Duran Duran's 1985 ""A View To A Kill.) Why couldn't Robbie Williams been asked at the time, to do a soft tune instead?The cast is, by the way, quite good anyway. I think Rosamund Pike is one of the best villain girls in the Bond history, an elegant beauty with the ordinary lethal skills. A woman to be close to, rather than the opposite. Head villain Toby Stephens does it good too, but lacks of some aura to make a full-filled 007 evil enemy.And the running time of 133 minutes is way too much. Some action scenes could have been cut in half - instead of hitting the brakes unnecessary - for a better flow. (The Icelandic chase scene which ends up quite silly is one example.)So, do I think this 007 flick is the most bad of them all? Some days, yes....but none of the Bond movies is an absolutely disaster. Brosnan was not sacked because of this, he was just running out of James Bond fuel, and got the leave message by rumors, I've read. (Not directly from the office of Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli.)It just was time for a change in the James Bond calendar. The basic stories of one Ian Fleming was ended long time since, and the responsible crew was to think things over. What to do for pushing the 007 legacy forward, once again?Former Bond actors Sean Connery and Roger Moore was questioned about their opinion, where to go with the MI6 agent. Connery said that he cared quite deeply about the whole Bond package, and what things that would happen to a thing that he was part of creating in the beginning. Moore was more of easy going - as always - and was hankering for a villain part in a James Bond movie. (Why did they not listen to the man? Make it happen before he's gone; he deserves it better than any other former Bond actor, coming back three times when he was already condemned, because of his respected and sometimes criticized age, last appearance 57 years old.)Timothy Dalton was professionally modest, and proclaimed that the Bond machine was to run for several ages to come, surely. I think he was the most ""awake"" Bond actor of them all.One-timer George Lazenby (1969) seemed not to care that much, once spoiling his chances as an immortal Bond actor because of bad decisions, and some wrong advisers at the time. Once the Brosnan era was over, plans for a continuation began to take shape... The Bond fans of the world was held on the gridiron for four long years.",Die Another Day

But somehow i'm beginning to hope something would. After the last two efforts it's beginning to become a case of been there, seen that. If you've seen one Bond movie you've seen them all. That did not used to be the case but that's where it seems to be going and I have an inkling that barbara broccoli and her cohorts know this. 'Die another Day' after all does seem to try something new with the formula. Having Bond captured while on a mission in Korea in the pre-credits teaser and subjected to gruelling torture (over the opening creits. Another new touch) to the terrible oh so modern theme tune inflicted upon us by Madonna (Another new tweek) who incidently cameos as a fencing instructer.Brosnan i'm glad to say is not to fault here. He contains just the right amount of charisma and deadpan humour that any good Bond should have. He should be thanked for giving Bond that bit more depth. The darkness in the character that was lacking in all the previous Bonds with exception to Timothy Dalton. The script and a number of the actors are i'm afraid at fault.Rick yune as 'Zao' is woefully underwritten and weakly portrayed by an actor who formally a model lacks the talent or experince to lend any depth to his character. That said Zao is never really given any real room to breathe and what we're left with is a one dimensional character who is given a crummy exit.Tobey Stephens is fine as the sneering Gustaf Graves, the movies arch villian but at times hams it up a little too much. His sneer is a tad too sneerful if such a word exists. He lacks the subtlety that mad Sean Bean and Robert Carlysle so great. There performances mad there characters so believable even if thet were two dimensional.Rosamund Pikes additional Bond Girl Miranda Frost is completly unnescecary. The reason I think for Zao being so underwritten and given no time to develop. As attractive and good she is she also looks like Bonds daughter never mind someone he would wan't to get in the sack. Mind you this is Bond.Halle Berry's Jinx is a memorable enough character. Shame her performance isn't. It's merely so so. which is all about I would like to say about this oscar drama queen. I beteer watch what I write or it might put her in another flood of tears.On the plus side however there is the odd funny moment or line in the movie. John Cleese is a nice addition to the cast as the new 'Q'. Introduced to audiences world wide in 'The World is not Enough' His character is just nearly as good a foil to Bond as the last 'Q'.The action sequences are not bad but not of them truly quicken the pulse or stay in the mind as do some of the old favoruites.The story itself is unique in the Bond cannon and does show Bond like you have never seen him before. The bearded dishevelled Bond in rags is not what we're used to. Plus a scene which sees him so very close to death that he flatlines in medical care.I have said enough as it is. D.A.D. is not a classic in the Bond cannon. It's not a bad film but it lacks the slickness and confidence not to mention the memerobale action sequences and a truly memorable villains that made Goldeneye a true classic. This might truly be the first of at least one or two nails in Bonds coffin.Roberts Rating: * * * (Not Bad)",Die Another Day
348,ay6,The end of the line,4,15 March 2014,"It's the last in the series of traditional Bond movies, and traditional Bond goes out with a fizzle of mediocrity. Yes I know there are the Daniel Craig movies, but they're all a timeline reboot slate-wiped-clean affair; Die Another Day was the final instalment in a 20 movie run of the traditional Bond timeline. And what a disappointment it was.The whole movie seems to be a nostalgia-laden Bond ego trip, an attempted homage to its predecessors, maybe trying to grasp hold of former glories. I'm guessing it's supposed to be a fan's movie to mark the 20 movie milestone, with references which only long term fans will get. Shame the movie is so terrible. There are lots of references and nods to previous movies throughout, like the breathing apparatus from Thunderball, and also the jet-pack from Thunderball, archived in Q Branch (along with Rosa Klebb's shoe, bizarrely). The biggest nod seems to be to Licence To Kill as Bond goes rogue is this movie as he also did in that one. Strange that Licence To Kill should be one of the best Bond movies while Die Another Day is one of the worst.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, it's just a bad Bond movie, which is why I gave it a generous 4 stars even though it's tempting to give less. It starts out well enough, feeling like traditional Bond should, with the pre-title sequence boding extremely well and hooking the audience in. But then it gets silly, almost like a comic book caper. It's also sad to see so much CGI being used - Bond productions traditionally tried to keep it real, with real people doing real stunts and detailed miniatures being used; Die Another Day is more about CGI, and pretty bad CGI at that - the surfing scene is laughable, reminding me of Mike Myers in front of his green screen demonstrating Chroma key in Wayne's World (the TV series). And as for holo-deck technology and cloaking devices, they're just wrong wrong wrong for Bond. Just because it can be done doesn't mean it should be done. It might be fine in 24th century Star Trek, but has no place in Bond; it's skirting too close to Mission Impossible territory - those are fine movies in their own right, but they're not Bond.Having said all of that, the cast are pretty good and do the best they can with what they've been given to work with. I'm never a fan of Halle Berry though; I'd rather have seen Michelle Yeoh reprise her Wai Lin role from Tomorrow Never Dies. That could have gone a long way towards redeeming the movie for me.So in summary, it's bad.

I have no complaint with them, though the antagonist was not quite upto what I have come to expect from a Bond film.  As for the film itself, that left a lot to be desired.  What can I say, except that I was shocked by the opening.  I really hated it.  It wasn't that it lacked realism.  It probably was quite realistic.  But I have come to expect the usual formula for a Bond opening.  Our hero has a great action sequence and saves the world as we know it, then we fade into the opening credits.  It's a tried and true formula.  It's part of what we all go to see a Bond movie for.  But this time, instead of everyone's favorite formula, the producers monkeyed with it, and rather than a fade to the credits, we find our favorite superhero caught and spending 18 months in prison being tortured.  There was no payoff in this.  The audience was robbed, and the image of Bond is tarnished.  Is it just me, or do others feel cheated, too?And then there were those disappointing computer graphics.  That cartoon looking airplane, is but one example.  The production team would have done much better filming with models.And how about that awful song, done by that awful voice.  I wouldn't even steal this song, let alone actually pay money for it.  I've never heard anything so bad.

351,vicdragon19-1,james bond will die another day soon...,6,23 April 2007,"I'm just starting to get into James Bond, and I was very impressed with Brosnan's previous Bond films, in particular Goldeneye. This fourth installment from him is a bit far-fecthed, and is almost unbelievable in the stunts and the gadgets. I felt that this film relied more on special effects, which isn't emphasised on that much in previous Bond films. Who on earth would want a palace made out of ice in the middle of nowhere? This Bond film was way too futuristic for me, and played more like a great computer game...As for the performances, I felt Brosnan didn't have that spark that he used to, and the lines are so corny sometimes I feel like laughing. Hally Berry doesn't know when to stop starring in average films, but I did like Rosemand Pike's performance.If you wan't brainless action and just a good time, this film is for you, but don't expect any wonders.",Die Another Day
352,Jenny Ho,Delivers what you expect,7,20 January 2003,"When you go and see the latest Bond film, you know exactly what to expect. As you settle into the darkness on your cinema seat, you are already anticipating some sort of  jaw-droppingly spectacular pre-credits sequence which builds up into the theme song by Madonna.  You also have expectations of explosions, fights, pretty girls, gadgets and double entendres.
Although the usual Bond ingredients are here, there is a style which is unfamiliar.  As the scene is set in North Korea, there is a sense of a Bond who is fallible: before the opening credits roll, Bond is captured and tortured.  This unexpected turn of events and the shock of seeing Bond turn into a long haired, bearded beast of a man are very odd and seem out of place in a Bond story.The general gist of Die Another Day' is that Bond was betrayed by the MI6 which was how he ended up being captured.  Following Bond's release from imprisonment the story takes our hero to Cuba where he meets American agent Jinx (Halle Berry), and Iceland to investigate smarmy entrepreneur Gustav Graves who has created a deadly satellite.  Thrown in are the usual seductions (Pierce Brosnan, gorgeous as he is, still achieves these ridiculously quickly!) and gadgets which include an invisible car!  John Cleese is back to provide some comedy patter (I would have liked to have seen more of him).  I will remember this film for its action set-pieces which include a fencing duel between Bond and Graves that sees the two men crashing their way through a gentlemen's club (look out for Madonna in a cameo role) and a car chase across ice, and a villain with ice blue eyes and diamonds embedded in his white face.I have to admit, when it comes to the story in Bond films, I'm terrible at keeping up with how it is progressing and find myself in a muddle.  Ask me a question on the story of any Bond film and I find that I have great difficulty in matching the storyline with the title.  However, while I am watching I am thoroughly entertained; Bond never fails to deliver what you go into the cinema expecting.",Die Another Day

The invisible car etc. go too far in my opinion and the main thing in the movie is not anymore connected to the plot, but to action and as many explosions and damage done as possible. Madonna played her part well, the thing in her role as Verity was that it was too loose and the first thing that came up to my mind was that she had been given the role just to get her in the movie.

Seeing Bond under such awful conditions in the opening part of the film make for such realism, l think the story, direction, and acting are of a high standard, the only thing l did not like as with all the later Bond films is the awful theme tunes, in this one bawled out by Madonna who even has a little role, blink and you will miss her, all in all Die Another Day was a good film for Brosnan to end his Bond run and l give it 8 out of 10",Die Another Day

358,gerard-21,Dead in the Water,1,21 January 2003,"Terribly overblown action flick offering nothing in the way of plot or character development. Since when did Bond films become so mindless? Ian Fleming, Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman must be turning over in their graves. There is absolutely zero intrigue in this one. It just races from one action sequence to the next seemingly without regard to consequence. I won't even examine the performances of the actors, because nobody was given the chance to act, save for being stand-ins for the stuntmen. Even the bad Bond movies of the past (ex:Man with the Golden Gun) always had a certain style and mood to them and tried to make the plot believable. This reminds me of Mission Impossible II, where they got a director who obviously didn't do his homework on the series and/or just wanted to leave his own imprint. That said, this is not even a good spy action movie on its own, XXX was ten times better! Could this be the end of the Bond series? Doubtful, but it should be, unless the make a clean break (like they did after comedic Moonraker) and return to the elements which set Bond films apart in the first place.",Die Another Day
359,d-apergis,A dismal case of a Bond picture,5,2 January 2010,"Following an initially intriguing premise, the narrative of this Bond movie takes every ludicrous turn possible in order to force any cheap-jack interest it can get. Consequently, every time the film falls in a trap set by itself it simply resorts to inanity to get back on track, brackishly exclaiming its Bondian identity. The producers might have thought that this was a smart thing to do, but the joke is utterly played at the audience's expense: We are aware of Bond's invincibility from the outset therefore what we'd rather see is the upping of the stakes in the thrill factor than consistent provocation of smug self-reference. And since the narrative itself -the movie's spinal cord- is so hideously marred, dullness sets in within half hour into the film. There are flaws elsewhere as well. The film lacks the imaginative depth to sustain a plot device such as an 'ice-palace', the much-publicized CGI special effects are not special at all (they are often laughable), the hyped-up battle between the Aston Martin and the Jaguar is woefully inter-cut with scenes of Jinx getting drowned, director Tomahori constantly attempts to give Jinx a more prominent stage to the point of making Bond a second banana, and the climax is so laboriously shot on foot that feels as if it ends before it even starts. A dismal case of a Bond picture the kind of which hopefully we'll never have to experience again, and a major warning to the producers that Bond should be tampered by people who love the material rather than just appreciate it.",Die Another Day
360,meejoir,"No Meester Bond, I expect you to die.",6,21 November 2002,"Went to see this last night and quite enjoyed it until the last half hour.
It seems the story was puffed out with some hideous one liner pay offs. In the last 30 minutes of this film there is very little said other than the one line double entendres that I suppose we have all come to expect from Bond, but it really went into overdrive. For a film with such a massive budget I was disapointed with some of the special effects. They looked as if they had run out of money on a few of the big money shots, at times it made xXx avalance sequence look good!
On the whole, maybe I expected too much from Die Another Day, I probably have started to believe the James Bond hype machine which has been in full swing in the UK for the last month or so. It wasn't any worse than any other Bond film, it's just that I expected more. It scores 6 out of 10 on the Meej-Movie-Ometer! Look out Meester Bond, Xander Cage is gonna get ya!",Die Another Day
361,KEVMC,Desperate!,3,9 February 2003,"On a mission in North Korea, James Bond is betrayed, captured, tortured, and eventually released after several months in a prisoner exchange. M suspects that he may have talked, and suspends him from duty. Bond decides to track down the real traitor in an attempt to clear his name.Where to begin? As a longtime Bond fan and proud owner of all the previous films on DVD, I duly visited the local multiplex several weeks ago to catch the much heralded 20th instalment of the series. I did so with a little trepidation as there were already some very negative comments appearing on this site. That combined with the fact that I was less than overwhelmed by TWINE made me a little cautious. However, I entered the cinema with an open mind and hoped to be entertained. The first turn off was the truly awful title 'song'. A plink-plonk electronic mess, totally out of place in a Bond film. Nevertheless, the first hour progresses fairly evenly, culminating with a stylishly executed sword fight and a quick jaunt to Cuba, which introduces us to Halle Berry's character, Jinx. From there on, sadly, the film disintegrates completely. The script degenerates into smutty one liners that the 'Carry On's' would have been embarrassed to use. The plot resolves itself into one outlandish chase after another, to the point where I had lost all interest by the time of the 'cars on the frozen lake' sequence. The stunts are never more than adequate, and the CGI sequences (the first time they've been used in a Bond film) are jaw-dropping in their ineptitude. As for the cast, they are hamstrung by the turkey of a script. Pierce Brosnan makes a good Bond and deserves better than this, and poor Halle Berry seems all at sea in her role. Regarding the director, if he wants to play around with quirky camera tricks then he should go and work on a sequel to 'The Matrix'.I am quite willing to accept that the Bond films must change to keep up with the times, but this witless farrago goes beyond the pale. Bond films have a certain look, feel, style and glamour that set them apart. 'Die Another Day' is just another brainless Hollywood action film, and as such is easily the worst of the series. What Ian Fleming and Cubby Broccoli would have made of this is anybody's guess. If the producers and writers can't come up with something better, they might as well retire Bond for good. Needless to say, 'Die Another Day' won't be joining the other 19 films in my DVD collection.",Die Another Day

However, Madonna's song is pure torture and punishment! Just check the opening credits, and you will get the joke)) Ok, it's a good song, but you can't compare it with epic ""London calling""!
I'm writing this in 2020, and Die another Day (2002) predicted a lot.
While Moonraker predicted Coronavirus (Bio weapon lab in Italy), Die another Day predicted Elon Musk and some North Korea's Incidents.
If you a fan of retro Bond style, then this is for you. I know, there are many hi tech things going on, but DAD is a true retro Bond movie. The last Retro Bond movie in the world. Just like Batman & Robin is last Retro Batman movie - love it or hate it.
I like Daniel Craig's Bond too, but he is not an ultimate womanizer. Daniel is more a hitman/bodyguard. He can't hypnotise Any woman on the planet. Moore, Dalton, Brosnan are more than lone wolf soldiers - they are Devils.
And one more thing. Die another Day clearly shows us what is lacking in today's movies: not a single second of wasted time. Generosity in everything.

364,spinin,"Kind of fun, but going in the wrong direction",7,12 December 2002,"The 20th Bond film is nothing new, but it is still fun, which is the single most important thing. I'm not going to go into the plot because it just seems so unnecessary. I will say that this is probably neither the best nor the worst Bond film in the franchise, although I can clearly see where the disappointment might come from for those who believe that it is a new low. Personally, I believe that the last one, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, was just such a bore that it has easily become my least favorite. DIE ANOTHER DAY is kind of similar to the Roger Moore Bond movies, which were a little on the ridiculous side. I find that acceptable because I grew up with those. I decided to simply list my pros and cons of the new Bond film since that will probably be the easiest way to deal with everything I thought.Cons:1.	Madonna's opening theme song: I actually liked the song, but it has no place in a Bond movie.2.	Jinx: Just an average bond girl character. There is nothing new or amazing about her being a spy. If anyone can remember five years back to TOMORROW NEVER DIES, Michelle Yeoh did the same exact thing. In fact, there have been many spy Bond girls in the past. They have just become progressively more independent over the years. The filmmakers believe this is a perfect opportunity to create a corny competition between 007 and the women spies. And Jinx's weak comeback, `Yo Momma,' uttered by her at one point in the film is about as original as me wanting to tell her, `Go back to the early 90s,' in response.3.	The editing: What's with the slowed down and sped-up shots that randomly pop up? This is not a Guy Ritchie film. Where is the class that Bond films used to have?4.	Not enough real espionage stuff: The Pierce Brosnan James Bond couldn't go outside for two minutes to buy a newspaper without some gadget or cool car. Everything he does seems to draw attention to him, which defeats the purpose of being a spy. 5.	Action overkill: There is nothing wrong with some clever combat or creative use of gadgets, but when everything revolves around explosions layered on top of more explosions, it becomes numbing. The opening sequence is rather average. James Bond surfing on top of a melting iceberg looks laughable and the computer effects suck. The final sequence in the burning plane is also very unimaginative. It sure is loud though.6.	Music overkill: Slapping a lot of music on top of the action kills the suspense even further. It sure is loud though.7.	Not enough screen time for Pierce Brosnan, which, I think, explains a lot of the problems. If the filmmakers would concentrate on showing more Bond, maybe there would be more suspense, and more real espionage. Instead they concentrate on trying to make Jinx look like a major character. Her scenes are never as interesting as Bond's, with one exception. In the final sequence on the burning plane, the movie goes back and forth between Bond's fight and Jinx's fight. The fact that I actually found Bond's fight a lot duller is unacceptable.8.	The female M: While Judi Dench is a great actress, I still can't buy her as the head of the Secret Service. At least she doesn't get captured in this one like she did in the last movie.9.	The plot steals a little too much from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER with the stupid `laser up in space, shoots down on earth' idea.10.	The new opening gun barrel logo: For the first time ever, there is a bullet that shoots out of Bond's gun, seemingly toward the audience. Why? It's not THAT cool. It does symbolize how the franchise seems to be moving toward pointless action.Pros:1.	The Bond theme still sounds good and hasn't been changed too much like in GOLDENEYE. It sounds best when it resembles the classic origins. The music in general is good, but there is too much of it as I said before.2.	Halle Berry: Jinx is nothing original, but Halle Berry may be the best-looking Bond girl yet. That's what it's really about. Otherwise, if they wanted to be very progressive, they would make the spy Bond girls ugly. There's a great homage to Dr. No with her introduction.3.	The first half of the film is very good. There is some decent plot and character development and I like the little twist at the beginning with Bond being tortured and held prisoner. This eventually leads to some humorous little scenes where Brosnan shows off long hair and a beard.4.	Typically great gadgets: An invisible car is the main new item and it is a fun idea.5.	Typically great locations: Lots of great and exotic countries visited, including Korea, England, Cuba, and Iceland. I thought the ice palace was an unbelievable idea even if it was a little far fetched.6.	Some good action scenes: The sword fight, midway through, between Bond and the main villain Gustav Graves is terrific. It is just the type of fight sequence that makes Bond movies so great as it occurs in a strange location and cleverly utilizes different props. The car chase with Bond and Zao sliding around the ice in their cars and eventually driving into the ice palace was also excellent.7.	Pierce Brosnan is the best James Bond since Sean Connery. It's too bad that his scripts are not as good. John Cleese is, of course, the perfect replacement for Q. Desmond Llewelyn will always be the greatest though.8.	The villains are rather average, but at least Gustav Graves has a nice level of arrogance and Zao has a cool look.9.	Items from the other 19 Bond films: Since DIE ANOTHER DAY is a 40th anniversary Bond movie, the filmmakers decided to add a bunch of little items from the previous films in the franchise. I did not remember this as I watched the movie, but as soon as I started noticing familiar objects or heard familiar lines of dialogue I became aware of what was going on. It was kind of fun to spot some of these things.10.	It's Bond, James Bond.There's probably a lot more to list. The bottom line is that I enjoyed the movie and most of its ridiculous action. Unfortunately, as long as these explosion driven Bond films continue to make the big money, there will not be any change for the more subtle. I think that Michael G. Wilson, the producer, can be blamed for that. Pierce Brosnan mentioned in some interview that Wilson was not willing to take any risks. So we end up with an average Bond movie. Overall, a 7 out of 10.",Die Another Day
365,theojhyman,This isn't the Bond we know and love,6,20 November 2002,"Something's wrong with this Bond film. It's not a film anymore. It's been turned into a CGI-filled popcorn movie, claiming it is above and beyond the likes of Vin Diesel's ""XXX"", but disappointingly well below Bond fans' expectations. Starting out with a new twist, the first hour adds a darker touch than normal, delivering on all levels and doesn't disappoint. But something happens half way through and turns the movie into mush! CGI steps in and takes over, the cinematography tries to copy The Matrix, and the action scenes which used to be breathtaking and admirable for their real stuntwork is enhanced by, and even at times, completely replaced by computer-generated effects (the ice-surfing sequence in the middle should never have been allowed in the movie by the producers - the effects are terrible - we're not watching Bond. We're not even watching a stuntman. We're watching a computer-animated character surfing on a wave that's not there at all!) The style and class of the old Bond films and even the smooth flow of more recent Bond films is lost. This movie goes from A to Z delivering everything it thinks the fans want, ending up churning out your big action set-pieces, great sets, girls, gadgets and one-liners by the dozen, but in the end, after everything it's delivered, it remains a let-down, lacking any real magic. The magic's there on screen - unfortunately it's artificially created this time round by hi-tech computers! I say halve the budget for the next Bond movie, work on your script long and hard, DO NOT rely on CGI for your action sequences and put some heart and soul back into Bond. This is not what the Bond fans want. Look back to Goldeneye for some inspiration if you can't look back as far as Goldfinger.

I was excited as ever walking into that theatre. The movie was a little more than mediocre. The beginning of the movie was just AWFUL and an insult to all Bond lovers. Bond should never be caught and tortured..... ever. Judi Dench serves only as a thorn as all she does is wine and coldly shaft Bond.... another bad thing. I liked the fact that they had a reference from the previous movies but I hated the fact that they used a plot from a PREVIOUS BOND MOVIE. I see no logic except to bore us with unoriginality. The movie theme is also ridiculous and Madonna can't act that well. Halle Berry does nothing but spit out innuendos and idiotic puns..... another problem with the movie. She ALSO gets captured and your stuck with her spitting out puns on the torture table. Basically the first 40 minutes are unbearable but if you can survive that without ejecting the DVD then you can enjoy the action scenes (ignore the terrible CGI..... just have fun with it). I was glad Brosnan still had his Bond touch. He doesn't look as old as people say as I think he looked good for someone of age 49. The length of the film is not too long or too short but it is just right here. Enjoy the action packed ending and the pretty cool action sequences as well as the ever enjoyable Q. Only Bond fans with a high optimistic level will like this one but I thought without a handful of problems it was good. A nice way for Brosnan to sign off as Bond. He is the Best one since Connery and its sad to see him step down but his age would have gotten to him eventually. This movie is not a complete disappointment. 6/10,Die Another Day

In fact I still think, that this one was only done for the american market for theatre visitors under 25. The whole ""Iceland-chapter"" shows more nonsense than every other Bond I´ve seen before. But the most embarrassing scene of this film is Brosnan's (second) surf ride after he was cut off the ice wall by the satelite. I have no words for this tasteless idea. To keep it short: One good oneliner and a fine sword fighting scene doesn't provide enough material for another clever Bond movie. This is unfortunately just a waste of the realy fine actors in a plotless but - well - watchable action movie.

Why does he suck? It's because he's performing stunts and feats that are IMPOSSIBLE even for James Bond. Watch ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"", sometime. They were great intellectual spy movies that did'nt rely on gaudy special effects and were intelligent, witty, and clever. However with ""Die another day"", again the double entendre and innuendos fly again. Why were people impressed with this movie? The truth is they were'nt impressed with this movie, they were impressed with the computer generated special effects and ""stunts"" performed by stunt doubles who are far braver than Pierce and have 100 times his talent. Pierce's tone throughout all the films has been the same, he has always been this blase pile of nothingness spewing suggestive lines and quips that don't do the James Bond franchise justice.

And this is hard for me to say because Brosnan is my favorite Bond. Despite looking incredibly old in this film, his acting was pretyt poor.  As other have said, the one-liners in this movie were horrendous.  The only thing more stupifying were the ridiculous special effects. Maybe they should have saved the money they spent on Halle Berry (what was her purpose in the film?) and put it toward the effects.  I thought the scene in Goldeneye where Bond jumps into a moving plane was pretty far fetched, but I bought it because it's a Bond film.  However the part in this film where Bond escape falling off a cliff by parachuting down an avalanche and then WINDSURFING to freedom was insane!  Yes, he actually takes a car, rips off the roof, and uses it as a surfboard to windsurf over a huge tidal ave.And Madonna.  I thought her theme song was catchy, but not appropriate for a Bond movie.  Her role in this film waas pointless and the limited amount of lines she had produced a Razzie-acceptable performance.

372,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,"Okay action, but... (SPOILERS)",2,13 March 2005,"...Not enough of Bond. The 20th film in the James Bond franchise was released in 2002, the first Bond film in the new millennium. Since it fell on the 40th anniversary of ""Dr. No"" (The first Bond film), it was heavily marketed to be a big, grandiose ""celebration"" film. Unfortunately, this is true--and then some. ""Die Another Day"" is the biggest, most over-the-top, campiest, and least believable 007 film of them all, and with past outings like ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Moonraker"" part of the same canon, that's saying something.This by itself isn't bad, as other films have shown that you can hit a balance of sorts between the realistic and unbelievable aspects of a story. But DAD crosses the line far too many times, and as a result, feels shallow and soulless. The filmmakers may have tried to make all this nonsense fun, but it turns out more stupid than anything else.The films starts out well enough: Bond, played for the fourth time by Pierce Brosnan, infiltrates the North Korean HQ of Colonel Moon, who's attempting to buy North African conflict diamonds. After being exposed as a spy and causing mass chaos in a unique and exciting hovercraft chase, Moon is apparently killed and Bond is captured by General Moon.After doing a little investigating of his own (since M revoked his 00-status), Bond arrives in Cuba where he meets Jinx (Halle Berry). This is where the plot becomes increasingly absurd, and by the time we end up in Iceland (which might as well have been any other snow-capped landscape), the movie has entered a phase when it tries to top every film that has comes before it, with an overload of cheesy one-liners, action, and predictable plot twists that surprise no one but Bond himself.The big threat, which has to do with another tired ""death ray"" is duller than dull and freely copies from ""Diamonds Are Forever"" (Is it any surprise DAD turned out the way it did?) and countless other 007 adventures. ""Die Another Day"" also contains references to previous films, that serve no purpose but to remind the audience of better movies they could be watching.Then there's the alarming use of CGI, which is so obvious in some scenes it's like watching a video game. Two such cases are when Jinx ""falls"" backward into the sea and when Bond ""surfs"" on a huge tidal wave. These just show how past stunts that were done in real life are more interesting than what a computer programmer can think up of. CGI was also a factor contributing to the invisible Aston Martin. Yes, invisible. This whole concept, as close as it may be to becoming a reality, drags the car company through the mud.The acting is incredibly hit and miss. Brosnan is actually serviceable in the role but he's seems a little out of shape. Berry not only delivers a cringe-worthy performance (saying all her lines in an exaggerated way) but the character of Jinx is dull and actually pretty dumb. Never for a second did I think she was a ""Bond equal"". Rick Yune underplays the role of Zao and the character is never menacing enough for a villain while Toby Stephen's Gustav Graves doesn't come into his own, even though he has a few good scenes. Not only that, Graves' real identity (for anyone who hasn't already guessed it simply by reading this review) lacks any logic or plausibility.Musically, it doesn't fare much better. David Arnold's score, with the exception of a few cues, is bland and too techo for my taste. Not only that, it sounds similar to previous scores (maybe another reference?) and doesn't distinguish itself. But Madonna's song, a mess of lyrics and rhythm, is still the absolute worst thing in the movie. And then the producers give her a cameo in the film too? But even when the film is firmly in train wreck mode, it contains some pros. A few individual scenes work well on their own (like when Bond throws his training manual in the air and the Aston Martin's shotguns shoot it to bits), the sword fight in the middle of the movie is exciting, and Rosamund Pike's Miranda Frost beautiful and far superior to Jinx. In the end, though, not many things work, and when they do, they're either copied or ruined by very poor CGI. ""Die Another Day"" tries to link two halves of the film (the revenge plot line and space laser) into a cohesive whole, but fails. Spectacularily. It's best to switch off the film after Bond leaves Iceland. You'll be spared a terrible ending to the worst Bond film ever. 2.5/10",Die Another Day
373,asdodge,Brosnan goes out with a bing.,3,15 December 2008,"""Die Another Day"" is, quite conceivably, the worst of all Bond films. It follows the Bond Formula precisely, but pushes the formula beyond its breaking point and ends up a eye-popping effects extravaganza with a awful plot, poor acting, and the wasting of some potentially good scenes and actors. The plot centers on a suddenly famous diamond merchant, Gustav Graves (played by Toby Stephens) and the possibility that his diamonds are ""war diamonds,"" and thus illegal. The secret is much worse and Bond must prevent a major war with a super weapon in the hands of the enemy. Along the way, he runs into a CIA agent, ""Jinx""(played by Halle Berry) who is investigating a genetic research facility in Cuba. The two plots wrap into one with surprise details, if you sleep through the obvious clues. Big budget effects, lots of explosions and fights- all the crazed high tech gadgetry, the amazing vehicles, locations, weapons are all here... and all fail to save a lame plot and poor story. The movie actually gets off fantastically, with Bond getting caught in an espionage deal gone wrong in Korea. For the first time, one sees Bond really interrogated and tortured. This opening part of the movie is well-done, but quickly goes downhill...from the usual Binder silhouette montage opening titles with the awful Madonna theme song (she also makes a cameo in the film as a fencing instructor- and even that is not done well). The actual plot is extremely unbelievable, the reactions and fight scenes go into the absurd and completely unrealistic, as are the technology and stunts. Neither Brosnan nor Berry can be taken as great actors in this film (and despite the academy award, I am not impressed with Berry as an actress), and the two main heavies (Stephen's character and his female assistant- Miranda Frost {played by Rosamund Pike}) are so poorly portrayed and done over-the-top that they become comical rather than threatening. Bond movies have always been about the latest innovations and stretching the facts when it came to technology and spy gear, but 'Die Another Day"" takes the suspension of disbelief so far that it becomes silly. Plenty of fans are easily swayed by big explosions and shiny objects, but if you like your Bond movies with a level of intelligence and some basis in reality, this movie will disappoint. Sadly, Brosnan came in with one of the best Bond films, but goes out with one of the worst.",Die Another Day

After some 25 minutes of trailers the movie began. (yes!!) Well the movie started of well, and (before the Madonna opening credits)it actually preluded the ending, I found this different as I am a big bond fan. Yeah so the movie goes on, with some ""bond comedy"", A major twist (oh yea) and the impossible situations of how bond just keeps escaping.... Anyhow I did enjoy this film but I found the ending stupid (with the plane and how it just burns for ever.)

376,theonewithallthecontacts,One of the worst Bond movies ever...,5,12 November 2012,"... Need I say more? This movie is a perfect example of what Bond movies shouldn't be. An over the top, cheesy spy movie, with bad visual effects, bad plotting and a rip-off of previous Bond movies. Like Ikarus is a total copy of those other satellites in GoldenEye and Diamonds Are Forever. Or like, that Rosamund Pike's character is another copy of Elektra King in The World is not Enough. Director Lee Tamahori was a poor choice to direct a Bond movie. It felt like he was trying to make a cross between a Matrix movie and an over the top spy thriller. It just didn't work...The movie takes out with Bond's mission to kill a North Korean arms dealer. A lot of action and explosions ensues, and Madonnas theme song is heard... And it sucked. Too techno, and not a Bond song! I normally ain't one of those who complains if a Bond movie doesn't stay to the expected formula, but that was just horrible. After the horrible Bond song, the first half of the movie is pretty cool and interesting. But then the movie blows out in a proportion of over the top gadgets, lame storytelling, cheesy scenes, lame visual effects etc. as described earlier in my review. Pierce Brosnan returns for his fourth and last appearance as James Bond aka 007. I liked his performance in his final Bond entry, and he was actually required to act in a few of his scenes. Halle Berry as the Bond girl was awful. She can't act and her scenes are almost embarrassing... but hey, at least she looked good in a bikini! Toby Stephens/Will Yun Lee as Gustav Graves/Colonel Moon was a decent villain. He weren't fantastic, and he isn't one of my favorites, but he is a solid character and a solid villain. Rosamund Pike creates an interesting character in Miranda Frost and sure as hell is a better actor than Berry in this movie. Rick Yune as Zao is one of my favorite Bond henchmen of all the Bond films. If i was to create a list, he'd probably rank number 9 or 10. The memorable thing about him is that has like 20 diamonds on his right chin. The diamond thing is over the top, but he's still cool. Judi Dench returns as M as she is fantastic as well! I'm not gonna try and treats this movie like it's 100 percent crap. It's not... Some of the action sequences are intense and cool, the set-pieces is beautiful and still the first part of the movie is kinda good. However this still ranks as one of the worst Bond movies to date, and rightfully so. If you wanna watch a completely unrealistic and over the top Bond film this is the film for you. Just don't expect another Goldfinger or something like that.5/10",Die Another Day
377,lfjeff63,Bitter Disappointment,4,26 August 2005,"This film had the same target audience as Triple X or The Matrix -- white teen age American boys. Earlier Bond films have a certain charm about them, no matter how fantastic. This one is loud and bombastic. There was no wit in it, not even the banter between John Cleese as 'R' and Brosnan. Plus the film makers reprise bits from other Bond films as an homage of sorts. It just didn't work. I was sitting there thinking, ""I've seen this before -- this is ""From Russia With Love"". And Lee Tamahori stole parts from other films too -- in the car chase scene, the cars ""freeze"" and the camera swings around them, like in the Matrix. I'm a big Bond fan, and I was very disappointed with this film. I hope they go back to the roots for the next one.",Die Another Day
378,morningkeith,implausible but fun,8,30 November 2002,"After a lousy day at work inwhich an irate customer literally spat at me, seeing this movie made me feel much better. Seeing the latest James Bond is like having coffee with an old friend. You feel good even if you talk about the usual things, only hint at your struggles and never bare your soul.So I came to this movie expecting to like it, and I did. I loved the cars, the bad guys, the women (especially Rosamund Pike, who I'd gladly see again; too bad she's ....), John Cleese, the opening Hovercrafts scene, the cool gadgets, on and on. For Bond fans, the fun starts in the first minute and just keeps accelerating. This series would never have lasted so long if they didn't get the big stuff right.But yeah, I also have some beefs. While I expect - and want - the stunts and the story to stretch the limits and be Fantastic, there are scenes here that are just plain IMPLAUSIBLE. Two deathly duels, at the same time, in a doomed airplane? Surfing/parasailing a glacier? Come on guys, your four year old wouldn't believe that. To me, these scenes and some others should have been re-thought, shortened or cut.Also, while Halle Barry is supposed to be ""the female James Bond,"" to me she comes across like a high-tech bimbo, able to kill bad guys in a blink, yet still basically a sex-object and damsel in distress. I find her part, and Bond's too actually, disappointing and under-written. The dialogue overall is pretty juvenile, but coming from bright, intelligent, Oscar-winning Halle, it sounds even worse.But who cares. When the next Bond movie drops into town, I'll be there with my eight bucks all over again. You probably will be too.",Die Another Day
379,mikec32001,Brosnan's Best - A Great 007 Movie,8,23 November 2002,"This movie goes that extra mile and is right up there as a Goldfinger or Spy Who Loved Me for the XXX generation. Truly, nobody does it better. This movie deserves to be the biggest box office of all the Bonds and Pierce Brosnan is really hitting his stride. By comparison, The World Is Not Enough was a pitiful nonentity. It's been a long time since a Bond flick has delivered on this sort of scale - this just pips Goldeneye as Brosnan's best (I was beginning to think he'd never top his superb 1995 debut). Role on the DVD - Die Another Day is a new Bond classic.",Die Another Day

That was in the warm glow of post cinema viewing. Now I've got the DVD and guess what? It's a dog. In fact, so was The World Is Not Enough (only marginally less so). I felt the same way about Attack of the Clones too and now we all know that's a dog too! Die Another Day has some good scenes - the swordfight, the Q scene - and Brosnan gets better with each film, but this is really poor stuff. The introduction of Halle Berry's character Jinx features the most cardboard dialogue and painfully laboured acting I've seen since Plan 9 From Outer Space. Oh, hang on, I've just remebered the love scene between Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman in AOTC... Anyway, add to the awful direction some extremely rushed CGI (why couldn't they have fixed the ice sled scene for the DVD?), utterly convoluted script and and the painfully misguided attempts to try and out-do every previous 007 film setpiece and all you get is a big loud mess. Goldeneye is Citizen Kane in comparison. Lee Tamahori? I here he's considering helming the sequel to XXX, the lame Bond rip-off starring Vin Diesel. I doubt he's up to the task.",Die Another Day
381,danthemovieman,One of the most clever Bond films ever made!,8,29 November 2002,"Pierce Brosnan gives another excellent performance as James Bond in ""Die Another Day"". It opens up with James going to a Korean army base, disguising himself as someone else who the Koreans trust very much. He is, however, caught and is about to be killed but (of coarse) escapes. This scene begins one of the many action filled scenes that this movie holds. It has a clever plot and great performances from Brosnan and Halle Berry. This is (in my opinion) the best James Bond movie ever! The action is great, the special effects are amazing, and the plot has many twists and turns as it goes along. Only complaint: Some action scenes go on way to long and eventually get boring, but other than that, this is the greatest Bond film ever made!*** out of ****",Die Another Day
382,Adam-95,The Best of the Brosnan Bonds.,8,23 November 2002,"""Die Another Day"" is a refreshing sigh of relief from at least the 2 previous Bonds.  Sure, the familiar Bondisms and cartoonish set-ups, wit and violence are still present but there's a also a welcome momentum to the pacing and plot that I suspect is largely due to Lee Tamahori's muscular direction.  The cast is solid. Halle Berry holds her own and seems to be having a blast, John Cleese is hilariously dry as Q, and Judi Dench's M is practically Bond's adversary.  Best of all, Brosnan has never been more comfortable in the role.  Also, the action sequences are often stunning with my favorite being a witty country club sword fight and a car chase along a frozen Icelandic lake.  The credits sequence is particularly stylish and well tied to the plot and even Madonna's cameo is fine.  Cheers to Bond on his 40th anniversary!",Die Another Day
383,StuJM,Maybe another day.,6,20 November 2002,"Ok, for a film that is celebrating 40 years of Bond, possibly the best known Britain in the world, you would expect something special. Well, all the way through this film, I kept getting the feeling that this film was patched together with a few pieces of Bonds from he past (especially Golden eye, car chases, traitors, large objects falling on people from above). The film has a good opening sequence, with the explosions, action and of course witty remarks that we have come to expect, also with an original entrance - surfing (and it looks good). However what happens next is not what you'd expect. I'm not going to tell you exactly what, but it is a shock, and possibly ruins the film at an early stage. Oh course no Bond film would be complete with out the stunning Bond girls, and Halle Berry does not let us down, ok her entrance is a little to much like that of Ursula Andress in Dr. No. Her part in the film isnt as big as I had thought, but the parts she is in are pleasent as easy to watch. However, the badies are Bad. The stupidly named 'Mr Kil' a henchman of the real baddy, Gustav Graves. His part is quite big for the Bad guy, although over shadowed by his 2nd in command Zao. AHH yes the car scene, this is the high light of the film as having two cars with more gadgets that a swiss army knife fighting it out over a frozen lake. It really is something good, although the 'Invisible car' is a good idea, it really should be in a Bond 10-15 years ago. While on ideas that really belong in past movies, the wind surfing-thing is poor, even by todays special effects standards, even the whole idea of it is bad. On a plus side, the idea of a Virtual reality scene is good, and as you will see, leads to a very funny scene. John Cleese is also good, in fact better than in the previous film. Brosnan and Judy Dench give good performances, and SHOULD be welcomed back into any planned future Bond film. Also the ice palace is a good idea, and has a large part to play in the action.Altogether this isnt the best bond film, yet it isnt the worst. See it in the cinema, or wait to rent. On a plus side its entertaining, has nice action sequences, cool gadgets, Nice looking women and it also mocks our friends over the pond, when they only want to blow up the whole of N.

The bond music is strangely absent from the film and the characters are the best so far (Zao is perfect character) Halle Berry is good as Jynx but the beach scene from Dr No just didn't work at all. The film is definitely worth a watch for action fans although Bond fans will be very disappointed. Also recommended for fans of mindless destruction in movies. There are dozens of one-liners in this Bond film ( maybe a bit too many) some of them are great but others are just a bit silly. I'd give this movie a 5 out of 10.",Die Another Day

Halle Berry fills a bikini with a blank stare and looks like she'll cry if she breaks a nail in her fight scenes. How anyone thought they could spin a film for her out of this without it turning into a well deserved turkey is anybody's guess. Ludicrous direction trying to copy XXX rather than a believable bond film. Toby Stevens looks like a schoolboy next to Pierce and unbelievable as a terrifying enemy worthy of bond, he acts as if he is Rik Mayal doing Alan B'startd - and he is supposed to be a re-modelled Korean! The special effects (parachute escape from avalanche) are like a hand painted cartoon in places - people laughed in the cinema when this came up, and it was not laughing along with the film, it was laughing at the film.

386,mike683,"Cuban cigars and Mojitos, what's not to like!",7,22 April 2006,"I always judge my Bond movies by their renditions of Monte Norman's omnipresent ""James Bond"" theme. Die Another Day does an excellent job here with two interesting scenes that yield some fairly catchy versions of the most identifiable composition in the world. I simply feel the scene where Bond escapes from the shipboard hospital room, has one of the best versions of Norman's masterpiece to ever be delivered to the big screen. The Latin interpretation, when Bond arrives in Cuba, is a close second.I am going to miss Pierce Brosnan. His humanizing of Bond in this film was impressive. From the beginning torture scenes to ""M's"" questioning his resolve and loyalties Brosnan delivers a brooding side of Bond rarely scene in previous ""secret agent"" epics. Though his lines are somewhat campy, as with his dialogue with Verity/Madonna, he still manages to maintain that air of suave sophistication and polish to pull off those tongue-in-cheek witticisms. Alas, this marks the end of a Bond era for me, where I was always younger than the actors portraying the super hero. It won't seem the same.As far as the Bond girls, this picture never disappoints. From Jinx to Miranda Frost, I cannot remember two more beautiful women to grace the screen. Toss in the ""Peaceful Fountains of Desire"" girl and Miss Moneypenny's fantasy scene near the movie's end, and I would say you get your money's worth of beauty and sexual innuendos.The heavies however, in Die Another Day leave something to be desired. The combination of Colonel Moon, Zao, Gustav Graves and throw in Mr. Kil, never seems to impress me as threatening chaps. I found it strange that Graves could kill his father (nice son!) so easily yet, armed with all those modern weapons, never rids himself of Bond. The car chase scene with Bond and Zao did make up for a bit of the lackluster showing of a villainous presence. I actually feel Miranda Frost made the men folk look somewhat sheepish in comparison to her underhanded dealings. She was definitely as cold as ice with Jinx.It was not the best Bond film to date, nor the worst, which in my book was ""A View to a Kill"", where an aging Roger Moore should have never shown up for that film. Thanks to Die Another Day, I am now a big fan of Cuban cigars, Omega Seamaster watches, and Mojitos (who isn't?), and again I feel the film's music is top notch. Die Another Day is a movie I'll watch and will continue to watch often, because it still efficiently delivers the fantasy that made Bond films what they are today. Simply fantasy.",Die Another Day

388,mcfische,A diamond for the eye; an insult to the mind,6,25 October 2003,"Contains spoilersThe James Bond franchise, in the year 2003, is celebrating it's 41st anniversary. No other series in motion picture history has lasted this long, and it is likely we will be seeing the adventures of 007 for years to come. The series has survived through and beyond the Cold War and a few creative slumps. And unfortunately, Bond's 40th anniversary film, DIE ANOTHER DAY, is one of those slumps.I hadn't seen this film for several months when I watched it last night. During that gap, I had been rather leniant and positive about this film, maintaining it to be an average Bond movie. After all, it was this film, which I saw with my family in November, that initially got me interested in Bond and convinced me to watch all of the other films. As the films came and went, I still maintained a positive stand on DIE ANOTHER DAY. However, re-watching last night and viewing it after seeing all the other Bond films showed to me what a horrible piece of garbage it was and I now find it embarassing that this film got me into Bond.The plot of the film is tired and uninspired, borrowing heavily from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (which was also one of the poorest enteries in the series) and the original novel of MOONRAKER. Despite getting inspiration from one of Fleming's novels, that element is ruined by the DIAMONDS plot. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade had an intense, Fleming-esque story for THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, but in this film, they abandon that for all out action, Moore Era gags, and so much other junk that serves no point to an almost invisible story that I think that some Bond purists will find this film painful to watch.Let us start with the characters, shall we? First of all, James Bond. His capture for 14 months and being tortured was a sheer bit of brilliance that Pierce Brosnan himself suggested. The pre-credits sequence to Bond's stay in Hong Kong make up the one small part of this film worth watching. Once Bond goes to Jamacia, the movie and Bond's character fall apart. The torture sequence showed Bond's vunerability in an excellent way, but the rest of the movie fails to follow up on that as Bond becomes how he was in the worst time of the Moore Era. Bond relies soely on his gadgets and his surf on the top of the ice wave...I'll come back to that. The point is, the Bond character has not been insulted this much since A VIEW TO A KILL. Now onto Jinx. Like Dr. Christmas Jones before her, Jinx is poorly written and serves no point to the story (why was the American NSA after Zao? No reason was given at all). I'm sure most of you have heared of all those interviews where Halle Barry says that Jinx is the Bond equal. She's not. She needs to be saved too many times and panics far too easily, especially for a secret agent. Both villains, Colonel Moon/Gustav Graves and Zao are terribly written, portrayed as sterotypical, one-dimensional villains. Colonel Moon kills his own father, and takes pleasure in it. I still say that North Korea's protests against the film due to the villain were unfounded (Moon's father is somewhat of a protagonist), but these villains are horrible. M, Moneypenny (who now looks too old), and Robinson are spared the terrors this film holds, but Michael Kitchen as Bill Tanner is absent. With the death of Desmond Llewelyn (a horrible blow to the series), John Cleese is promoted from ""R"" to Q, and is the new Quartermaster of MI6. He excels in the role, keeping the essence of Q but still maintaing a difference from Desmond in that he intentionally tries to promote laughter by being extremely sarcastic instead of being serious. However, despite Cleese's performance, like Bernard Lee, nobody does it better than Desmond. The one antagonist I haven't mentioned is one of Bond's ladies, Miranda Frost. She serves a point to the plot and is interesting at the beginning, but she too is lowered to a one-dimensional flop.For the first time ever in a Bond film, I have to complain about the stunts, directing, and editing. First the stunts. This film HAS no stunts. A stunt is when a real human being does death-defying feats of nature with all possible measures of safety added in. This film felt the need to insult human abbilites and instead have all ""stunts"" in this film be CGI and bluescreen. The CGI isn't terrible; on the ice wave, I couldn't tell that it was CGI until Bond slides up the one large iceberg; but at other times, the CGI is poorly done. This kind of stuff does not belong in a Bond film at all. Bond films have a reputation for doing absolutely everything for real; why ruin a good reputation? All ""stunts"" in this film are feats absolutely impossible for humans or machines to do and real stunts would have worked just as well, and possibly save this film somewhat. Next, the editing and directing together. The combination of the two make many scenes look more like bluescreen then the real bluescreen shots. The swordfighting sequence in the film represents Bob Anderson at his best, but the effect is dulled by the bad editing and speeded directing. Finally, all the music video, MATRIX-style editing does not belong in a Bond film and I hope that the American editor of this film is fired. Thanks to the Lord that Lee Tamahori won't be directing Bond 21.This film's redemtion that saves it from being worse than A VIEW TO A KILL is that it looks spectacular, the first couple minutes are good, and this film got me interested in Bond in the first place.In summary, DIE ANOTHER DAY is the Moore film of the Brosnan Era, and a bad one at that. Let us all hope that Bond 21 will have a Fleming-type Bond, an intense story, real stunts, normal editing, and good characters. This film gets a 2 out of 10.",Die Another Day
389,Installation_At_Orsk,Drivel Another Day,1,20 September 2006,"The worst of the Bond films by far, and considering that list includes such 'classics' as Diamonds Are Forever and Moonraker, that's quite a feat! Brosnan sleepwalks through the whole film, disinterestedly delivering his 'quips' (which are about on the level of Finbarr Saunders And His Double Entendres) with an audible sigh and practically rolling his eyes after each one. Halle Berry is utterly atrocious (apparently all the credit for her Oscar should go to the director of Monster's Ball, Marc Forster) as the obnoxious smart-ass Jinx, Rosamund Pike, while strikingly beautiful as an ice queen, is little better and even the likes of Judi Dench, Michael Madsen and John Cleese just phone it in.But aside from the actors, blame must be shared between director Lee Tamahori (who seems to be treating the film as an overblown and brain-dead dress rehearsal for XXX 2), screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (for devising a witless and nonsensical script that mashes together elements from about a dozen other Bond films and throws in gadgets more suited to the Adam West Batman TV series) and the visual effects team (who seem to be under the impression that the 'C' in CGI stands for 'crappily').Bond has done science fiction-y stories before (like You Only Live Twice and Moonraker) but Die Another Day's invisible car, orbital pie-plate of death and that ridiculous power suit worn by the sneering ginger fop passing himself off as a villain take things into outright fantasy.

However, I also realize that I'm being guilty ofthe same kind of ultra-biased reviewing that ticks me off, so I bettermoderate myself. Actually, the first half of the film was prettydarned good in many ways. But in the second half or maybe third,the special effects were the star and focus of the film. I amextremely biased against special effects-starring movies, becausethey are like watching a magician that doesn't even try to hide thesecrets of his tricks. It just seems stupid and a waste of time,causing me to lose all interest. Actually, it usually even turns to afeeling of disgust.  Anyway, I should not burden those who likedthis film so much with my personal bias. So I will try to just give myless biased reasons for nixing this film. To review or gauge aJames Bond film, one has to compare to previous efforts. To me,the last long segment of this movie is the worst Bond film ever- bya longshot. The reason for this is simple- there is very little humaninteraction done in a human manner. Even 007's sexual relationship with Halle Berry's character and the other girl weremerely mechanical at best! What a waste! It is the human elementthat makes Bond films usually so much fun to watch. It's in thebanter. Some are very serious, others are lighter fare- but until thissorry excuse arrived, they all had the human element in common.It is true that some have less of this than others-maybe moreemphasis on gadgets or car chases... but I can't recall any otherswith so little good human interaction- comic, serious, or anythingresembling sympathy or empathy. So about all that is left at theend are special effects and panoramic camera shots with loudsound effects. Madonna is  a pretty good actress, but she only hada bit part. Berry can't act her way out of a paper bag, but she getssecond billing. I do like her personality and of course she looksso incredibly good. But she needs some more time to develop heracting. The good part of this was the first half - because it actuallydid have some good human interaction (but still too little. Why isnothing developed between the beautiful female officer whotortures him and Bond? Little explanation about the scorpions orany details!) But still some good stuff occurs before and after thetorturing scenes. Having Bond become a real renegade and a trulydespised outcast was a nice touch. I've liked every Bond film thathas come before, because I am a sucker for all that stuff. However,this one brings a new much lower standard. I'm sorry to see theseries die such a grotesque death, but maybe it will make acomeback in the future. 007 is sure a tough nut to kill.",Die Another Day

I know that you are all suave and handsome for the ladies, but every since you took on the role of 007, the franchise has been slowly going down the Lou. You need proof? I've got proof. They are Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is not Enough and Die Another Day. The latter film being the ultimate rock bottom. This film is complete junk. I would be here all day telling every single detail that made this film bad, so I'll just hit the biggies. The CGI is, of course, the worst thing I've seen in a movie since Spiderman 2. Of subject real quick...Hey Hollywood, they're called stunt men. We used to have them. What happened? Anyway, back to Bond. The editing was atrocious and the directing was a farce. Halle Berry was very good at playing her poorly written, under developed character. Props to her. I know that Bond girls are nothing more than eye candy, but DAD takes this to the extremes. Denise Richards had a better character in The World is Not Enough, and she can't even act. As bad as Brosnan is as 007, he couldn't seem too overthrow Roger Moore. He still hasn't, but if he sticks around much longer, he will. Roger Moore will never shake down movies like The Man with the Golden Gun, Moonraker, or A View to a Kill. These will always be terrible. But Brosnan is getting closer and closer to this level of terrible with each new Bond movie he's in. In the end, this movie had two good parts. The Aston-Martin Vanquish (when it was visible), and Halle Berry dripping wet and walking out of the ocean (should've killed her character right then and saved her the embarrassment). Get on Pierce Brosnan. Surely there's a suave and sophisticated British man to take your place. Heck, I'll settle for a Scot.

The plot's not going to be surprising, and the dialogue can be a little cheesy at times. Accepting all these as ""given,"" I really enjoyed Die Another Day. The North Korean setting is all the more chilling due to recent world events. The action scenes had some new innovations, including two energetic swordfights and a spy-car duel in Iceland. Halle Berry did a good job as Bond's American counterpart, so much so that it seems she's due for her own movies! And the other lady was really very appealing as well (forgot her name, the blonde).

I wondered what it was about this movie that I really hated ( I tried to like it ) : At first I wondered whether it was the awful plot ? The incredibly BAD CGI effects ?  The stupid amateurish and abysmally horrid  editing ? Lack of feeling for the franchise by the producers? Was there a script around anywhere someplace ? The ""let's get as much product-placement time and ram the inevitable PC game down their throats while we've got 'em trapped "" mentality ?I am certain that if Cubby Brocolli were still around he would have made damn sure that none of those who made this trash would have got within 500 miles of one of his pictures. Cubby actually had some personal interest in what he was making .... what has happened ? Remember the days when you had true film-makers ? Those folks who made a lot of money , sure..... but BOY did you get a great ride...and you wanted to go back and see the movie all over again.Then I realised that now all has been surrendered to $$$$ ... the ""keep feeding them bland and boring until they think the rubbish we serve up is actually good "" syndrome.Look at how many attempts to re-make classic 60's/70's and the occasional 80's into movies that have ended in efforts that would make a home video producer think he was Cecil B DeMille.... soul-less inane lazy film-making with total lack of respect to the poor sods who end up watching and worse paying $$ for their tripe.Star Wars for example did far better with the old blue screen , bad contrast and rubber puppets than the later slick CGI... sure you can go places with CGI that you can't with analogue.... trouble is that you KNOW it's CGI....and bad CGI is always worse than bad analogue. Star War seems more REAL due to the lack of CGI..they actually had to work HARD to deliver that classic movie. Perhaps the producers of CGI figure that they don't have to bother with set design and maybe extra $$ are saved in payment/insurance to stunt people etc. Perhaps they delude themselves that we don't notice ?? The movie industry wonders why movie patronage is falling ... well when you target ONLY the teen/ween market with rip-off product then you get what you give.Back to the subject .. Bond was always that rare thing.. a character with very wide age appeal ( albiet biased to male ).... at this rate Bond will be even a rarer thing..... still around after DAD. It is incredible to see the producers allowing the huge Bond franchise to be mauled and trashed in this way. Sadly Bond may not survive this.Producers this is your wake-up call.2 out of ten.

403,alembic,Disappointing - messing with the formula. Some spoilers.,2,28 June 2003,"A disappointing effort - like eating a big meal but being left unsatisfied at the end of it. Using the same analogy , it's like certain fast food chains trying to dish up new twists and neglecting the tried and true main menu. I think perhaps the director who best understood what the James Bond formula/franchise was all about was Guy Hamilton who's general attitude was; let's have action, let's have girls, let's have gadgets and let's have FUN. Perhaps Lee Tamahori was stuck with material over which he had no control and had to make do with what he was given , but the result for Die Another Day is an uneven and at times just plain silly movie. I love Bond movies and I tried hard to like this one but I  was left disappointed. Perhaps the problem with producing a Bond movie lies with the character himself ; Bond has to be believable but not too real ; he has to be an expert spy but not a super-hero ; he has to have girls but not be a selfish womaniser ; he has to be above all a loyal agent..it's a fine line ,not to be crossed over. Pierce Brosnan is by far the best actor around these days to play the role of Bond but I wonder if he himself will be having doubts about further outings as Bond ? Brosnan seems to be very sincere to the Bond character but given what has been presented this time he might be weighing up the risks to his career if another example such as this is offered up to long time Bond fans. I suspect that another poor example could spell the end of the Bond saga.Summary : Stunning opening scenes of surfing , beautifully filmed leads to silly Everglades type hover-craft being used as military vehicles by some cardboard cut-out Korean bad guys. Bond is captured and supposedly tortured for months by the Koreans but is then released on a prisoner exchange - strangely suffering no long term ill effects except a long beard. Then we find that Bond is now considered useless and to have cracked under torture. M  ( the incredibly under-used Judi Dench ) then coldly tells Bond that he is no longer a double 00 . Of course we are expected to appreciate that M expects Bond to go maverick and uncover what is going really going on. Trouble is that it's been done before - didn't work very well then and doesn't work very well now either. Next we are presented with some hot diamonds and an orbiting laser satellite - gosh where have I seen that before ? Q  now played by John Cleese ( again shamefully under-used in a tiny role ) presents Bond with an INVISIBLE Jaguar.... oh dear. I wonder if Jaguar are wondering if this product placement will lose sales due to the laughably clumsy handling of their product. Instead of exciting scenes with Bond in a great car we get bad CG effects and no feel of the car at all... Of course the special Bond wristwatch is presented , but in such a ho-hum way with a flippant line by Q "" bring this one back unlike the other 20 "".. problem is that in this movie it REALLY is ho-hum..... Maybe that's what the problem is .... were the makers of this movie just plain bored ? Pierce Brosnan does his best and tries to bring credibility. Halle Berry is beautiful but is given nothing to work with .. her charm and comic talent are just wasted. Judi Dench .. squandered. John Cleese may as well have stayed home.. squandered. Rosamund Pike has genuine screen presence but seems she can't be fitted in to give her a chance. Toby  Stephens has great snarling charm but his scenes are overwhelmed by the background noise.. he could have been used much more effectively. Actors need to be given room to act.. here they are steamrollered.It's like someone was let loose in the effects room but no-one was checking the product. Silly forward repetitious rushing camera shots...... Some really bad CG effects... this is a movie not a PC game. Bond comes off as a bad super-hero rather than ""our man"". The result is that the movie-goer is left detached , uninvolved. It's like a series of clips glued together but not a coherent whole. Some VERY good moments do not save the rest - my favourite is the scene with Moneypenny and her virtual James Bond realising her fantasies .. genuinely funny.

Having long run out of Ian Fleming novels to base the movies upon, original stories are now being used and on the whole, I'd have to say this is doing the series good.Although flashy, the older Bond movies were always way too drawn out in various unnecessary directions, often resulting in a hard to follow plot - the novels just didn't translate too good to the screen. Which is not to say, the new Bond movies are a stroke of genius scriptwise, far from it, but at least they now have a sense of direction and a coherent flow.Unfortunately the movies that followed Goldeneye suffered from other weaknesses (Tomorrow Never Dies from low production values, The World Is Not Enough from cardboard action), so I'm delighted to say this newest installement in the series takes all that's good in Bond movies, manages to avoid most of what's bad and emerges as one of the best Bond movies ever.Production values are high, effects are excellent, conversations are witty and even the usually horrendous one-liners are stingy this time around. The villain's are formidable enough, the women are some of the most beautiful ever seen in the series, explosions are well choreographed - all in all an excellent performance from the so far relatively obscure director Lee Tamahori.",Die Another Day

It would have saved us from the total meaningless 2 hours of nonsense that followed. If I were to produce a list of all aspects that are totally unbelievable, I'd have to zip it and recommend you don't use an analog modem to download it. My God. And the humor is as dead as 007 should have been. ""I'm Mr Kil."" Bond: ""That's a name to die for."" ""I'm Ms Frost."" Bond: ""You must be cold."" Give me a break! It's as funny as one guy saying ""My name is Brown"", and another guy replying ""Oh, so you must be an African American.""One other thing that immediately caught my attention: 007 had been in some Korean dungeon for 14 months, and guess what: he's chubby! Oh, yeah, sure, that's logical. Of course you get at least 3 hearty meals a day when you're locked up in some rat hole. I know it's virtually impossible to make him look emaciated, but the solution is so simple: don't show his torso. It's not that impressive anyway!Bond used to have a mission. That mission was serving England. Saving the world. If he had to risk his life, he would. Now all he cares about is sleeping with women. Sure, I too wouldn't mind sharing the bed with beautiful women all the time, without having to say more than ""My name is Bond"", but a special agent like 007 should have more on his mind. Bond used to go to bed with women because he suspected something or had to get something out of them (the other way around gives us a 'joke' that would fit right into 'D.A.D.'...).

411,du_man,Disappointing,6,1 June 2003,"Rating: * * (out of four)This Bond film is one of the most disappointing, I think.  It is actually a lot like a Raymond Benson Bond novel, only not as good.The action scenes in any Bond flick are crucial.  Here, some are good, some aren't.  The opening is great, the swordfight is fun, and the car chase is excellent.  On the other hand, the chase with the satalite laser is stupid, the climax is dumb, and the others only adaquate.  Overall, the action is just okay.  So, except for the car chase, the action isn't a good reason to see this.The Bond films really invented some special effects; Thunderball (1965) won an Oscar for them, and Moonraker (1979) had some cool post-Star Wars ones. But in Die Another Day, they are unconvincing CG ones.  The climax might had been better if the special effects weren't so cartoonish.  Throughout the entire film, the special effects are really, really cartoonish.Storywise, it's just more of the same.  A bad guy tries to do some major damage with a space satalite.  Yay.Pierce Brosnan is another disappointment.  He has gone downhill since he started.  In Goldeneye, he was excellent and gave one of the best performances as Bond since Sean Connery (though he still wasn't quite as good).  But after that, he went downhill.  He was fine in TND and TWINE, but here he really doesn't do that well.  It's mostly the script's problem, but still.And there isn't enough humor.  One of the best things about the previous Bonds, even the Timothy Dalton ones, but Bond's non-stop dry humor. Here, Bond says a couple of puns early on, but that's it.  There is other humor, but Bond is dull.Why should you see this film?  Well, Halle Berry is outstanding as Jinx. She really carried the film.  The car chase is one of the best in the series, and the swordfight is unexpected and interesting.  And Madonna's theme song is great.

We've already had ""License to Kill"", ""The Living Daylights"", ""You Only Live Twice"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", and ""Live and Let Die"".  We get it already, it's a James Bond film.But the sad thing is, it's not really.  It's only a Bond film in name and cliche.  Sure Pierce Brosnan fits the part well, and sure the girls swoon appropriately, the cars are fast, the music is Bondian and I'm sure the Martinis were shaken, not stirred.  But James Bond is not Xander Cage, and I don't want to see him snowboarding his way through 94 minutes of action sequences.  There used to be some plot and character building to Bond movies, sure it was tongue-in-cheek but it was there and it wasn't just plain stupid.The only thing that comes close at all in this movie is the scenes where Bond spends what seems to be a couple of years in a North Korean prison, and who wants to see that?  The Sean Connery Bond would have escaped from that prison in the first day, and if he couldn't pull that off he would have found a hot North Korean chick to let him go in exchange for some James Bond sex and an empty promise.I think this may finally spell the beginning of the end for this venerable franchise.  They have finally lost the actual Bond flavor and are stupidly attempting to replace it with ""XXX""/""Matrix""-style action.  To which I am sure audiences will eventually say ""Who cares?  I'm going to see XXX6 because my brain has been shrunk below the point required to understand something as simple as a James Bond movie.""",Die Another Day

415,Webslinger48,Bomb...James Bomb.,2,3 December 2002,"Attention all moviegoers: You may now stick a fork in James Bond...he's officially done!  ""Die Another Day"" is the final nail in the coffin ofthe once-proud franchise that produced such highly-entertaining films as ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" ""Goldfinger"" and ""For Your Eyes Only. ""Time was, this series relied on wit, spectacular stunts and entertaining storylines to propel a movie.  Now those successful traits have been replaced with clunky one-liners, cheesy special effects and ludicrous plotting...which, in case you were wondering, are not good things in a movie!  If you enjoy these qualities, go see the slightly-superior (aargh...I can't believe I'm saying this) ""XXX!""  Of course, choosing between ""XXX"" and ""Die Another Day"" is like deciding between death by lethal injection or drowning, but that's beside the point!Don't get me wrong, the classic Bond films had their fair share of outrageous stunts, but at least they were within the realm of possibility...after all, the filmmakers didn't have computer graphics to rely on, they had to have actual stuntmen perform them!  But James Bond parasurfing on a glacier?  Completely ludicrous, not to mention dumb!!I saw this film with three of my friends, and we all agreed -- ""The worst Bond film of all time!""  And that's not like saying ""The worst Indiana Jones film of all time,"" which isn't a bad thing to say because of the relative high quality of all of the films in that series.  The Bond franchise has been churning out turkeys on a regular basis for years, so saying it's the worst of them all really means something (after all, how can you make a movie worse than ""The World is Not Enough"" and ""License to Kill""?).I want to collectively grab MGM executives, shake them for an hour, then make them sit down and watch ""good"" James Bond movies (i.e. any of the films made prior to 1987) so they can see how far they're strayed from the once fool-proof formula.  It's not hard to make a good James Bond movie, but until they realize what they're doing wrong (which is everything) and fix it, I will never see a ""new"" Bond movie again!",Die Another Day
416,palaste,Certainly a different Bond film,7,8 December 2002,"I had mixed feelings when going to see ""Die Another Day"" with my sister. The press had more or less said it was the worst Bond movie in a while. Then again, they said the same thing about the Star Wars prequels - and I thought those films were awesome - and I thought ""who cares, it's a Bond film, I'll see it anyway"".The last two Bond films, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""The World Is Not Enough"" had been, in my opinion, excellent. Thus I thought ""Die Another Day"" would be excellent as well. I was in for a surprise, but not necessarily a disappointment.The whole movie strikes as different. Not excellent, not abysmal - different. This is evident straight from the intro sequence, which shows that James Bond does not escape this time, but gets caught.The intro sequence also contains the movie's theme tune. And this time I was sadly let down. Madonna's ""Die Another Day"" theme is, to put it bluntly, quite bad. It's not because it's Madonna - Tina Turner sang a very good Bond tune in ""Goldeneye"" although I don't usually like her music - it's because it's an attempt at a techno tune. And a rather shallow attempt at that. It was so bad that I was actually thinking there is something wrong with the audio track because the song seemed to be cut short in parts. Techno tunes don't suit James Bond. But if you insist on trying, at least get someone decent to do it. (How about Apollo 440?)Thankfully, the intro sequence was the worst part of the movie. It got better after it. It was rather funny seeing James Bond do his John Lennon impression - I had to actually remind myself who that long-haired beardy-weirdy was supposed to be. When M dismissed Bond of his 00 status I felt genuinely sorry for him. There was one thing I felt was unbelievable however - how did Bond manage to fake a cardiac arrest? How does anyone manage to do that? Is Bond a Jedi knight or a Zen master nowadays? Anyway, seeing an unclean-looking Bond, in wet hospital clothes, carrying no luggage whatsoever, ask for ""his usual suite"" at the Hong Kong Yacht Club was worth a laugh.(MILD SPOILER ALERT) When Bond saw the ""GG"" logo in Havana and mentioned ""Gustav Graves"", I instantly predicted Graves would be the main villain. How many times has this happened before? Any CEO of a major corporation is automatically the main villain. Elliott Carver, Hugo Drax, Max Zorin and Carl Stromberg come to mind. How about something more original for a change?(MILD SPOILER ALERT) What I did not expect, however, was the true identity of Gustav Graves. I felt both satisfied and disappointed. Satisfied because of the additional plot twist, and disappointed because now they had ""deprived"" me of a new villain character.Overall, the movie was a fairly good Bond movie. It is certainly not up to par with ""The World Is Not Enough"" (still my favourite modern Bond) or even ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". But it's not that bad either. All the usual cast is still there (although this time John Cleese is Q, and he's doing a decent job at it), so I fully expect there to be an enjoyable fifth Brosnan Bond movie.",Die Another Day
417,John von K,Dire Another Day,3,22 November 2002,"Toby Stephens the best villain since Goldfinger and Sanchez. Halle Berry sneers and smirks. It has more Naughty lines than a Carry On film only not so amusing. Fencing sequence the only tense scene. Every other action sequence has two invulnerable agents fighting it out with villains and villainess...we know who will win but why staged in such a bland, predicable way. The film is like an episode of Thunderbirds or Star Trek summed up by 2 Virtual Reality sequences (both a plot fake/cheat) and an INVISIBLE car for God's sake. Basically an ad for Aston Martin, Omega, Jaguar, Ford etc:  Oh, and Peirce Brosnan is in it now and then. This is the most dumbed down Bond film ever aimed at 12 year olds.

Shitty music has dogged the Brosnan movies (Except GoldenEye). What Madonna is doing whining through the opening song, is beyond me! Halle Berry is a great actress but she is miscast!

421,LennyRenquist,I loved it and hated it,5,23 April 2005,"The first half of this movie is fantastic. Bond is TORTURED! You'd think having to listen to Madonna for 14 months straight would crack ANYBODY! I reckon I'D be clawing my eyes out, screaming, ""Okay! I'll talk! Just make the bad lady STOP!"" Not Jimbo, though. Stiff upper lip to the last. Not only is he tortured, but he's tortured by one of the HOTTEST evil lady torturers I've ever seen (not that I meet a lot of them, granted). But that's Bond movies for ya, I suppose. Then he goes renegade, and runs off to Cuba, via Hong Kong. After causing some havoc in the Caribbean, Jimbo heads back home to London, and gets into a highly entertaining sword fight with the bad guy, before being accepted back into the fold. He's then dispatched to Iceland......and it's about here that the whole movie goes pear-shaped. The moment we reach Graves' ice palace, it turns into sub-Moore-era drivel. It becomes a boring, implausible CGI-fest which slides out of control in a worse way than Bond's Aston (great car...shame it's INVISIBLE most of the time!) on the ice.Pierce is, as usual, fine as James. Nothing much more to say about him. He's great.Halle Berry, though, is really the most watchable part of this film. She's obviously gorgeous (and has a great wardrobe...I still dream about that orange bikini), but she's also very COOL. I think Jinx is possibly the coolest Bond girl yet. She's definitely one of the best (and, at the risk of having pointy things thrown at me, she looks WAY better coming out of the water than that grossly-overrated Andress chick EVER did).Rosamund Pike is also very good as Miranda Frost. She too is absolutely gorgeous, and her ""Ice Queen"" persona contrasts well with the ""Red Hot Mama"" that is Jinx. The scene where they face off on the crashing plane at the end is VERY entertaining. Oh YEAH!It's great to see Michael Madsen as the grouchy CIA guy. ""Damian Falco"" is a great name, too. Hope he returns in future instalments. He's way cool. WAY.Kenneth Tsang! Yay! John Cleese is terrific as Q. His scene as ""R"" in TWINE was pretty ordinary, but this time he's stepped into the Quartermaster's role, and does a fantastic job. He maintains Desmond's disdain for Bond, and bolsters it with a touch of Basil Fawlty-ish snobbery. It works a treat. The scene in the old gadget storeroom is great, and the only part of the ""Bond's Greatest Hits"" thing that I liked. This one small reference to the other movies (along with the ""20th watch"" bit) is all that was really necessary to acknowledge the double-milestone (20 movies, 40 years). The rest is overkill.Toby Stephens as Gustav Graves...I CAN'T STAND the smarmy git, and every time he's on screen I want to PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE! That HAS to be the sign of a good villain!The sword fight is outstanding, even though the scene is contaminated by the presence of MADONNA, whose character unfortunately escapes decapitation during the ruckus.And what was the deal with Graves' electro-suit thing? Who the hell came up with THAT crappy idea? Ditto the rocket-car / para-sailing scene. There should not be ANY CG in a Bond movie. Especially when it's THAT BAD.The scene in the laser room: Poor.The helicopter scene at the end: Poor.The VR training simulator: up there with TWINE's x-ray glasses as one of the dodgiest gadgets yet. It WAS funny when Moneypenny got sprung abusing it, though.Rachel Grant as the masseuse. Mmmmmm...Rick Yune as Zao. Yawwwwwwn...How did they find room for ENGINES in the Aston and Jag? FAR too much emphasis on gadgets in the car chase, and not enough on DRIVING, which is usually what makes a GOOD car chase. The VANISH?! PLEASE!Some of the dialogue is pretty weak. Miranda's line, ""I enjoyed last night, but it really is death for breakfast,"" should have been something like ""Dinner was great, but now it's time for breakfast."" The joke had already been set up. It didn't need to be explained. We are not imbeciles. As it is, it just sounds DUMB.Graves' diabolical scheme is RUBBISH. It seems to have been thought up ONLY as a way of filling the movie with references to other Bond films. Maybe they should have just had Graves invent a machine that creates an originality vacuum, sucking up new ideas and leaving all the dodgy old ones. Like Wilson & Broccoli did in planning this movie.I can't see that being the WRITERS' fault. Surely writers ENJOY coming up with new things.So, while I started out loving this flick, as it went on I found myself wishing it would just FINISH. It completely falls to bits in the second half. As for the ""best of"" idea, in 20 years, who's gonna care? They'll just see it as ANOTHER bad Bond movie.That's a pity, when it could have been so good.",Die Another Day
422,namideo,The End of an Era.,6,16 October 2007,"It's the 20th Bond film and premiered on the 40th anniversary of the series, and, in many ways, it is really a tribute to the entire series itself. This film's strength and its weakness both lie in the fact that it is a blend of the classic Connery films, the outlandish Moore films, and the grittiness of the Dalton films. It's rolling the entire series into a single two hour adventure and the result is actually pretty entertaining. The first half is definitely stronger than the second; a more serious adventure with a classic feel to it, before taking a nose dive down into utter camp territory. I didn't mind the idea of making some scenes a little over-the-top, but I think they went overboard at times. Throughout the movie, the filmmakers toss in little references to previous Bond films. I suppose it's a fun idea to stop and consider how far these films have come over the last 40-something years, and a long time Bond fan can find amusement in finding these subtle, but long remembered treasures that poke their head in this film for one last time. As for the technical aspects of the film: The special effects are a little too ambitious and don't always come across convincing. The dialogue goes back and forth from excellent to atrocious. The ensemble of actors is pretty strong, except for Halle Berry, who in my opinion was completely wrong for a Bond movie. The villains are a little more dynamic. The action sequences are an improvement, in my mind. Granted, there are some instances where the filmmakers push the envelope a little too far, as mentioned above. However, they also show a certain amount of creativity that seemed to be lacking in the previous two films. Overall, this film is really a mixed bag. At moments there is potential for one of the greatest Bond adventures. At other moments you're thinking, ""What the heck am I watching."" Personally, I feel the positives balance out the negatives, but if anything, this film is a good popcorn movie. All in all, it wasn't a bad way to close out the series before rebooting it again with Casino Royale.",Die Another Day
423,Barry-44,Poor way to spend $10.50,1,25 November 2002,"I liked the opening scene, the familiar James Bond music.  I also loved the panoramic view at the very end of the music taken from a helicopter.  Both needed no special effects.  But besides that, I found the movie so boring I was thinking about the ten bucks I spent to see it.  This movie would be excellent if you had the mind of a ten-year-old kid, but personally, for me, I actually laughed at the special effects and nearly hooted at the invisible car.  Then I felt angry that this was going to be the highlight of the movie.  Halle Berry's body looked good, I must admit that.  I wanted to see the magic of Roger Moore and Sean Connery's movies -- but none did I see.  I also found it insulting how M treated James Bond.  He's a secret agent for years and years and she looks at him as if he's an idiot?  Miranda Frost reminded me of a mild mannered Anne Robinson.  John Cleese protrayal of Q was totally laughable.  Madonna's cameo was crude and unnecessary.  Since I paid my money (and movie theatres don't give refunds) I kept wondering why no one found it cold walking around the ice hotel and what kind of covered sheets would need to be used on the ice beds for sleeping.

425,Dierk,"Starting out to be great, just to fall the more",3,23 April 2003,"Yes, this could have been a great, a classic Bond. It isn't. The pre-title sequence is breathtaking but nothing we haven't seen in a Bond movie already. Not really disappointing but a bit mediocre. Until the end when Bond becomes imprisoned by a sadist. and with the actual titles this film shows what it could have been, it is simply the best credits sequence since *Goldfinger*, using background and foreground in various ways to show what happens to James during his imprisonment.And the film goes on to be a brilliant mixture of serious spy thriller for grown-ups and kiddie entertainment when Brosnan reprises his Robinson Crusoe role for some cheap and some not so cheap funny moments. After his resurfacing in Hongkong the movie takes up pace rolling further on the tracks of a serious spy thriller in the mold of *From Russia With Love* or the first two Harry Palmer movies.Everything begins to slide down, first slowly then with ever more speed, when script and director more and more rely upon typical action sequences in the Ice Palace sequence. Some of those images are quite nice but lack the nerve-racking grittiness of early Bond films and the tongue-in-cheek irony of the Moore era.From the moment Bond and Jinx leave for Asia it's down the drain, the last twenty to thirty minutes of *Die Another Day* are stupid, unbelievable, totally unrealistic and look like a badly programmed video game. These last two or three reels are so bad they work extremely against the brilliant opening and still good middle sequence. The solution to the plot may be good in a third class ""Sci-Fi"" fantasy manga, but in a Bond movie it is totally out of place. At least the viewer should have gotten a good looking sequence. But what we see is much worse than the worst action scenes in *Spider-Man*. I'd appreciate it if EON would first solve their trouble with ordinary blue-screen projections before taking on the intricacies of CGI.BTW, Madonna's title song and video are much better than many ""critics"" write; the video is even better than the second half of the film proper.

428,amanfigo,Bond lives another day.,6,31 January 2003,"After watching the British agent James Bond 's last four movies (and the four in which Pierce Brosnan appears as the British agent), I can only say that this movie is the best of all and it even overcomes to the movies with Timothy Dalton like Bond and to part of the movies that made Roger Moore.  	With a new director change, Lee Tamahori that makes it much better than the 3 previous (the only one that made it more or less well was Roger Spottiswoode [Tomorrow never dies]) and he works well a script with in that the action and the intrigue don't allow the spectator to rest. Die Another Day is a great show that discharges adrenaline for each second of footage.  	A form of giving freshness to the saga is the agent secret and new partner of action of Brosnan: the agent Jinx (Halle Berry could be included among one of the best girls Bond of the whole saga), in which Halle Berry makes an exceptional work and she connects totally with Pierce Brosnan in the movie. Neither we can forget to the other main characters like the other girl Bond, Rosamund Pike that doesn't make it anything bad (I personally miss for this paper to Denise Richards, I had liked but). brilliant Toby Stephens as the rash multimillionaire (Toby is better villainous that others as Sean Benn or Jonathan Pryce) and Rick ""Fast and Furious"" Yune. All these 5 characters form the great show of movie action with impossible scenes as that of the fencing fight, the scene of the cars in the palace of ice (the Aston Martin one of the best cars of Bond) or the impressive final fight in the airplane of Graves. 	 	Neither in the movie they can lack the numerous and already repeated secondary of Bond like M, ""Monty Phiton"" Q and Michael Madsen like agent of the C.I.A. . (although I miss a lot in this movie to Robbie Coltrane like Zukovski).   	Summary: If you want go to watch the best movie of Pierce Brosnan like Bond I tell you that as this it is the one that you should see. Brosnan together with Sean Connery they are the best James Bond of the saga, I hope Brosnan takes a lot in retiring of the British agent's character.",Die Another Day

432,DarrenHorne,Bond with a twist. Worth watching.,7,7 March 2005,"Its seems that James Bond is everywhere at the moment. As a celebration of his 40th year in cinema it seems as though we are being assaulted on every front and in every medium by Bond programmes. There have been viewers' favourite scenes, programmes on the real 007's and the obligatory making of documentary. Even without all this added advertisement you will already know exactly what to expect from this film. I am not a huge fan, and would not usually pay to see it at the cinema, or even rent it on video. However, it seemed as though Bond had scared off all opposition, leaving nothing better to watch that week. It is also a very girlfriend friendly film. (What is it about women and there desire to be riding in that Aston Martin with Pierce Brosnan? Does he know how much sex he could have?) I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The usual pre title sequence with Bond completing a mission and making a daring escape was gone. Instead we see him betrayed and are treated to a spectacular hovercraft battle as he tries to salvage some form of success. However he is still captured and tortured in a North Korean prison for 14 months. From that moment I was hooked. MI6 then set up a prisoner exchange, handing over the wonderful villain called Zao, whose mandatory disfigurement is to have diamonds embedded in his face. He must be evil then. Bond is then imprisoned by MI6, who fear that he talked, and have decided they no longer like his style and don't need an agent of his temperament running around getting into trouble. There is only one option open to our hero, to break out of prison and go after Zao, as a rogue agent. This leads to a great scene in which Bond wanders into a top hotel practically naked, soaking wet, dishevelled, disgraced and dishonoured. Anyone else would be thrown out on the street or taken out the back for a beating, but this is Bonds regular hotel and within minutes he is groomed and wearing a tailor made suit. This is why he is a secret agent, he doesn't need his tuxedos and gadgets, he knows too much and has connections everywhere. Bond then uses his connections and charm to hunt down Zao, who is undergoing genetic therapy to change his face. Not as unbelievable as it sounds as this kind of thing will apparently be a real possibility in the near future. The plot involving diamond smuggling doesn't really matter, after all this is a Bond film. The head bad guy is Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens), a North Korean who is now a white businessman thanks to the same therapy used on Zao. He is also a complete waste of space. A slimy, cocky, pale faced loser that is supposed to be a threat to James Bond. As if. Thankfully Bond gives him a good beating in what starts off as a friendly sword fight. A great scene, which also makes up for the awful Madonna cameo moments beforeaarrrgh. It was bad enough having her sing the theme song. MI6 eventually make up with Bond, primarily to annoy the CIA. This means he gets tooled up with gadgets and an invisible Aston martin!!! (Very disappointed the line ""now where did I leave my car?"" wasn't used.) He is also informed about the undercover agent Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) who is posing as Graves' PR girl. As her name suggests she is an ice-cold agent who refuses to be taken in by Bonds charm. The stunning Halle Berry plays the tough U.S agent Jinx, one of the best Bond girls for some time, who hops straight into bed with the sexually frustrated Bond. (14 months at least) The love scene is appropriately passionate. The favourites are all there too, although perhaps in smaller doses than before. M (Dench) is wonderful at putting Bond in his place, Q is also superbly played by Cleese who has really made that role his own, and there is a great scene with Money penny and a virtual reality machine near the end. The only major thing I can fault with this film is Gustav Graves, who is a terrible villain, and the sometimes over done directing. The rest is top form Bond, with impossible stunts, crazy fight sequences, cheesy one liners and gorgeous women. A nice addition to the franchise, that shows a grittier side to the character. Turn off your brain and enjoy yourself, this is a wonderful Bond extravaganza with enough of a twist to keep it fresh.",Die Another Day
433,kurtman-3,Good bond film except one scene,8,24 November 2002,"This was a good outing for James Bond. The action was quite well done except one disastrous CGI effects scene in which bond surfs with the parachute. Did the special effects supervisor go blind while doing this scene?  Every part of the scene looked incredibly bad. It could have come out of a straight to video movie for goodness sake. The rest was well done.  Halle Berry was underused but still better than most.  She could actually think and kick ass at the same time. Rosamund Pike was good as well especially during the girl on girl sword/dagger fight.  Toby Stephens is a fabulously evil villain which bond really needed after Robert Carlyles weak villain. The action/fight scenes were really done well this time.  My favorites include the hovercraft opening (I've been wanting to see hovercrafts in a bond film for a while now and was glad they were in the opening sequence), the amazing swordfight between Gustav and James, and the car battle between Zao and James. A lot better collectively then TND and a lot better then TWINE. 8 out of 10.",Die Another Day
434,Tim Gomersall,So close...,7,21 November 2002,"Huge Bond fan here. Apologise if the below gets a bit anorak-esque. But here goes... maybe some mild spoilers here. Depends on your definition. I'm beginning to suspect that MGM are deliberately feeding us all the ingredients of a classic Bond film, but breaking them up evenly over all of Brosnan's efforts rather than putting them all into one film. If we could splice the grit of Goldeneye, the gadgets of Tomorrow Never Dies, the locations of The World is Not Enough and the girls of Die Another Day then we would have a Bond to beat all on our hands. But no... Die Another Day is a good film, and not a particularly bad Bond film either, but it just doesn't fit with the canon. Even Moonraker was plausible in the face of some of the gadgets and weapons we see here; invisible cars, cyborg suits, 30 foot wide orange energy beams... they belong in the Star Wars franchise, not the Bond one. In fact they maybe even belong in the Austin Powers franchise. I can see Dr Evil now... 'all I want is a f*****n 30 foot wide orange energy beam... is that too much to ask, people?' And don't get me started on the second surfing sequence in this film. The first one in the opening credits is great, but the second... suffice to say that this film was five minutes too long, and the glacier/tsunami surfing scene is five minutes that serves no function to the plot and snaps us out of the action by offering a stunt so outrageously implausible that you laugh (for the wrong reasons) and CGI so outrageously bad that my mate Andrew could do better on his iMac. Why they left it in baffles me. Bond goes out of the enemy base, does something utterly stupid, goes back to the base. Lose the utterly stupid stuff? Nah... leave it in. Oh, quick aside on the product placement row that broke out prior to release; didn't notice a single brand name apart from the cars. Less obvious than the product placement in the previous 3 Brosnan efforts by a long shot. At no point, for example, does he drive a tank through a large truck labelled 'Perrier'... Perhaps the most frustrating thing of all is that when it ditches the high-tech sci-fi FX-laden side of things this is the best stuff they've done in ages with Bond. The opening scene and ensuing capture (the first time we've ever seen Bond certain he's a dead man) and the sword fight are excellent, as is - to be fair - some of the fancy stuff like the car-chase on ice and the laser-dodging fight. But the film is kept from greatness by its aspirations beyond its roots. I accept in today's day and age you need big bangs, a little CGI and a glimpse of Bond actually having sex for a change. I don't mind these elements being incorporated. I even liked the endless in jokes (Bond reading the actual book written by a guy James Bond from which Fleming got the name in the first place - class). But until you can make a man surfing a glorified banana-skin on a 100 foot wave with a parachute look convincing, keep it the hell out of the film.",Die Another Day
435,Jojosh the Pi,"Not good, but you'll get your laughs.",4,16 April 2004,"This movie seems to have received positive overall reviews (6.5 here; almost 60 in metacritic).  If anyone can explain this to me, please enlighten.Every other James Bond movie has got to be better than this (it's my first). Were the graphics a hangover from the early 90's?  In that surfing scene, one of the ""animators"" must made a kitchen magnet of James Bond and filmed it bobbing up and down on the water, for all its realism.  The ice cliff collapsing was absolute garbage.Towards the end of the movie, they attack the space weapon, Icarus, by sending ONE missile???  Perhaps if they'd attacked with MULTIPLE MISSILES from MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS, they could have actually incapacitated Icarus.Don't even mention the final battle sequence in the plane.

436,Vipex23,Very Good Bond,10,9 December 2002,"Die Another Day is an excellent Bond film. While it is not Brosnan's best,(Goldeneye,)it is far more original and exciting than the last one (The World Is Not Enough) Some random thoughts: A.  Brosnan has grown into a truly excellent Bond.  Anyone who still moans about Connery obviously is not a Bond fan.  Sure Sean was the best Bond. However he did quit the role on three different occasions.  He is now about 75 years old.  Get over the fact that he is not Bond anymore. 2.  This is a very different Bond film.  (Bond gets captured and tortured before and during the opening credits.)  What's wrong with a different type of Bond film during the classic series' 40th. anniversary?  Some of the best Bond films have dared to be different (OHMSS, License to Kill.) 3.  Halle Berry is quite nice to look at but I  can think of, at least, a dozen that I would have preferred to have been with (Barbara Bach, Jane Seymour, Izabella Scorupco, Daniella Bianchi, Jill St. John, etc etc.)  I much preferred Rosamund Pike's icy Miranda Frost to Halle's Jinx. 4.  Toby Stephens' villainous Gustav Graves was a rather despicable villain. The wild swordfight between Bond and Graves was terrific in its intensity. 5.  As bad as Madonna's theme song was, there have been worse (License to Kill, Goldeneye.) 6.  While this film is not in my top ten Bond films and I do prefer Brosnan's Goldeneye and, probably, Tomorrow Never Dies, it is still an exciting film with terrific sets & imaginative action sequences.  It does have a bad bit of CGI is one scene, but, what the heck, so did Spiderman. 7.  It is great that this film is doing well so that we are virtually guaranteed Brosnan in at least one, maybe more, Bond films.  See it for a night of great entertainment.",Die Another Day

It will not kill you, put you to sleep, bore you or anything of the sort.  It was very enjoyable.  I'm convinced the people who bash this movie just like to complain and look for any possible reason to put down this film.  It's a Bond movie, of course it's not going to be 100% realistic.  It's an escape from reality for 2 hours.  I'm not going to go write about the plot because you could read that anywhere.  But I am going to say that this is a great Bond movie.  I only have 1 minor complaint. 
The scene where Bond is surfing/gliding in the middle of the movie was totally ridiculous and looked fake.  It should have been on the cutting room floor and only seen as a special feature on the DVD.Go see this movie for a good time.  As mentioned before, it will not kill you, put you to sleep or bore you like a few reviewers say.9/10",Die Another Day

Then there are loads of beautiful women. I say cut down the action, let the boy do some work, real spy work, nowadays it seems he's more of a terminator/assasin than a spy.

Halle Berry is pointless, well in a narrative sense and she drifts in and out of the film without any real effect.Die Another Day is supposed to be a nod to all the films of the past but ends up feeling like a tired rip-off.Still on the plus side it was nice to see Bond in an Aston Martin and a fine one at that and John Cleese has settled into Q's lab-coat quite nicely.Now onto the films biggest mistake. A poke in the eye for whoever came up with the idea of using copious amounts of CGI, almost completely casting aside the superb stunt work that separates Bond from all the other blockbusters of today.

The movie is completely far fetched and it takes place all over the place- it is confusing and frustrating to tag along. In the beginning, Bond is captured after making us like the fact that he won- THAT NEVER HAPPENS WITH BOND. Then he is disrespected and he has to prove that he still deserves to be with MI6. There were so many awful one liners and some characters, especially Gustav Graves, were terrible actors and had some of the stupidest things to say. The first half hour is interesting, but from then on the story is very far fetched- it is like a child with no writing experience wrote the rest of the film.

There is always a good guy woman and a bad guy woman.  The story line is intriguing as well.  I definately say, see this movie.",Die Another Day

The script is well written, the actors are doing a great job, the villain is mean and the scenery is lavish. But.Bond has always been a suave, subtle secret agent. He still is in this movie: the bit in a Hong Kong hotel is a perfect illustration. Unfortunately, the producers caved in to some kind of popular pressure, and flooded the film with awful special effects. Let's face it: scenes of massive destruction are not interesting per se. Invisible cars are too far-fetched to be fun.For the next Bond flick, the producers should cut the special effects budget to a fraction of what it was for this one. They would save a few bucks, and would create something much more interesting than the garbage that Hollywood assumes the public likes.

445,Joekingfans,Breaks Free from The James Bond Formula,10,22 November 2002,"The new James Bond film, ""Die Another Day,"" finally breaks out of that cookie-cutter James Bond Formula.  ""Die Another Day"" is an excellent movie.The new twists begin with that classic Gun Barrell Effect at the very beginning.  This time, we see the bullet zap right at us.The Pre-Credits Sequence, which James Bond fans call ""The Teaser"" or ""PCS"" has often simply been a time for character exhibition, with us joining Bond at the climax of some other mission.The Pre-Credits Sequence in ""Die Another Day"" jumps right into the rising action in this adventure.Madonna's theme song impresses me as the best James Bond theme since Paul McCartney's ""Live And Let Die.""  ""Nobody Does It Better"" and ""For Your Eyes Only"" were cool in their day, but Madonna's song seems to fit what we expect for a Bond movie than those two.  Madonna's cameo seems to be a bit of distraction.  It's simply that we're watching the film, and we say to ourselves, ""Oh, there's Madonna!""  Perhaps they could have made a cameo for Madonna in the style of the ones Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow have in the latest Austin Powers.  Madonna has quite a few fans, and the cameo is kind of a let down for both Madonna's fans, as well as fans of the Bond film series.""Die Another Day"" certainly has a great deal more violence than many of its predecessors.  In the early 60s, the Sean Connery films seemed a little sadistic at the time.  I'd have no trouble letting a young child accompany me to one of the Roger Moore Bond films--but with this one, there are a few scenes a little too violent for young children.There are times when ""Die Another Day"" seems like a video game.  I feel that will really attract the young people, however.  This generation has grown up on that stuff, so I'm sure they'll love that stuff.I've read other reviews where people keep harking that Pierce Brosnan is 50, but when you think of a 50 year old Cary Grant, he was just hitting his stride.  Just as Sean Connery was still a hit at age 70, I'm sure we'll be seeing more of Pierce Brosnan over the next two decades.You'd think that after 20 films, the interplay with Miss Moneypenny, or Q's Weapons Lecture would have long ago been worn out.  However, ""Die Another Day"" reprises those scenes with refreshing new twists!  I'm sure the long-time Bond fan will truly enjoy the Miss Moneypenny scene in this film.Look for ""Die Another Day"" to also do quite well on DVD.  This one is one of those movies that people will want to add to their collection, and watch again from time to time.""Die Another Day"" is quite a refreshing surprise.  Go see it!  I'll be back to see it again tomorrow!",Die Another Day

447,Bel Ludovic,Licence to Overkill,4,24 November 2002,"The first hour or so of Die Another Day is actually great, and the opening titles are the best yet, despite the ropey Madonna song. The scenes in North Korea, Cuba and London were well on their way to signalling this as one of the better Bond films since 1977. But the moment the action moves to Iceland it all falls apart rapidly and with indignity, with some of the most preposterous and far-fetched plot twists - even by Bond standards - and some of the most amateur special effects you're ever likely to see.
There's one action scene that is so, so hopelessly bad - Bond surfing down a collapsing iceberg - that it's worth the admission price alone just to cringe. Meanwhile Brosnan and Berry have little to do as they gallop from one completely over-the-top action sequence to another. There's plenty to suggest burgeoning sci-fi ambitions, too, which is a rather worrying trend.
The last time a Bond movie was this overblown (Moonraker), the producers did a volte-face with the following film (For Your Eyes Only), making it a mor e down-to-earth, gritty thriller. One can only hope the same thing happens again. Bond films cannot keep getting bigger and louder forever. A coherent and involving story, a modicum of suspense, a witty and clever script, and a Bond that has to rely upon his wits rather than gadgetry to get out of ticky situtations - none of this is present in DAD.That's why the film, despite the highly promising start, ends up being such a crashing bore. But it will still make the cashtills ring, so the producers may see no reason to change, after all.",Die Another Day
448,Ndirsch11,Disappointing but still fun,7,25 March 2003,"Die Another Day is without a doubt the weakest of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films.  However, is it a bad film?  The answer is no, because the James Bond films are always so entertaining.  I don't think I could ever hate a bond film (even the Man With the Golden Gun, which is definitely the worst of them all).  The problems with Die Another Day is its weak script, its dependence on CGI effects, shallow characters, and because it tries too hard to impress you.  Everything in this film seems so staged to make you go ooh and ahh with the action sequences and the hot babes.  Also, I think this is the first time where the quality of a bond film was hurt by being so cliched.  If there is any one film series where it's ok to be cliched, it's the James Bond films because people want expect to see all those things we know and love about the series.  In this film, however, everything seemed too cliched.  The big action sequence on the plane at the end reminded me of the scene on the plane in the Living Daylights, the diamonds on the satellite reminded me of the one in Diamonds Are Forever, and the Bond girl Jinx reminded me too much of past Bond girls where they compete with Bond throughout the film.  Even though Halle Berry did her best with her character, I still found Jinx rather uninteresting and shallow.  Like I said before, the film seems to stage everything to impress you.  The Jinx character was made too be so tough, in your face, and sexy that none of those characteristics seemed to come through naturally.  I'd say Halle Berry was one of the more unimpressive bond girls even though she is a great actress.  Pierce Brosnan, on the other hand, I would go so far as to say is the best Bond ever.  He's so convincing in the part and well, just works. I thought John Cleese was the perfect replacement for Q (even though no one can really fill Desmond Llewelyn shoes.  Now, going back to the story, I found it a bit shabby.  The beginning part of the film before the song was frustrating because it was too long and had too much dialogue.  The beginning of every Bond film should always be sharp, quick, effective, and with a good flow that leads into the song (like in Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, Goldeneye, etc.).  Unlike many people, I liked Madonna's theme song because it was very in your face and well, different.  It's the first time techno music was used as a Bond theme.  I also liked Madonna's cameo in the film even if it was pointless, because it's nice to look at her (and her muscles) for a minute.  The whole story involving DNA resequencing, the diamond satellite, and the Koreans was all merely ok, but seemed a bit over the top in the end (even if that's expected in Bond films).  I felt they could have come up with a better story, though, in the end.  I also didn't like the dependence on CGI effects because it made certain scenes look too cartoonish.  I don't know if it's just me, but I was also not that impressed with many of the action sequences.  They just didn't impress me that much. One thing that REALLY irritated me in this film was how Bond was tortured for 14 months, because it was totally rediculous and doesn't seem like something that would happen to Bond.  I guess the film was trying to make us feel sympathy for Bond for being tortured, but come on; part of the reason everyone loves Bond is that he can always escape death and get himself out of an impossible situation.  By having him imprisoned for that long, it kind of ruins his character.  After all, 3 months would have been enough, geez! I thought the villain was ok, but pretty forgettable; his sidekick was even more forgettable.  Rosamund Pike's character was a better Bond girl than Halle Berry's because she was bad and resisted Bond at first.  I found that interesting.  One scene that I did like in this film, however, was the fencing sequence because it was very engrossing to watch and very edge of your seat.  If the film would have had more original scenes like that, it would have been better.  Also, I liked a lot of the exotic locations, such as the ice palace.  Last, but not least, I liked the film's good use of comic relief (even if some of the lines were pathetic) and how the film pays homage to some of the past Bond films.  In the end, I still enjoyed the film despite all these complaints, because James Bond films are always very entertaining.  Grade : B-",Die Another Day
449,South62,What Should Be Done?,5,1 June 2005,"It is common to say that Bond serial is in crisis. Of course it is, but it so natural and logical. On one side there are intellectual spies like George Smiley and Harry Plamer. On another side is Hollywood crap like Rambo etc. Bond is kind of middle of the road, kind of family spy. For our time standards genuine Fleming's spy-character is boring. I can understand producers intentions (obvious already in 1960s) to upgrade that genuine boredom with something ""bigger than life"". That was the essential crossroad. Where to go? More Bond films tried to be bigger than life - more they became ridiculous. High budget for cheap entertainment. I can understand efforts - typical for Roger Moore Era - going towards self-parody. But that was the way producers should not go. How could they dare to make self-parody with stuff that was the legend in the same time? It was the best way for suicide of the whole project. (Anyway I liked Moore's self-irony). Smells like an end. If you want to be serious you would be funny. If you want to be turbo-entertaining you would be stupid. What to do?

Plus, you cannot disregard the amazing action scenes that dot the film at various intervals. Of course, one cannot forget the Bond babes. Halle Berry is terrific as Jinx, and has one of the most intrical roles of any Bond girl in history. Not to be outdone, Rosamund Pike makes her film debut as Miranda Frost, and MI-6 agent who refuses to fall under Bond's evident charm.

For a ""Bond"" this is a very good movie.I liked script, good - and bad 'guys', the acting, and the futuristic aspects (Icarus, etc.).

Jaws traded in for Hale Berry, I'm not gonna complain! :-)",Die Another Day
455,UnlovedSeason,A game of two halves,4,20 November 2002,"Die Another Day purports to offer something for everyone. The first half is far more like a Fleming novel that we are used to; gritty in the extreme and departing radically from the Bond film formula. Even the traditional opening titles are effectively sacrificed to this startling new direction. But as the plot progresses, the familiar movie-series elements begin to take over. When I say take over, I mean overwhelm - by the halfway point, Fleming is spinning in his grave and purists will be howling in protest. In the early sections of the film, we see Bond as we have never seen him before: fallible; even - gasp - a victim. He loses his cool, he loses his looks and, well, for the first time he really loses. This makes his reasserting himself and regaining control all the more enjoyable. Soon enough, we get Bond the ruthless professional, Bond the truly resourceful lone wolf and Bond the believable spy. Around about the first appearance of Halle Berry's Jinx, though, believability packs its bags and leaves the film. From here on in, the science and technology, the plot and even the action sequences become, frankly, ludicrous. To my mind, Die Another Day takes a step too far for the Bond films - despite many redeeming features. The characters are uniformly great and there are - of course - many brilliant moments, clever twists and bits and pieces of script. The fight at Blades club and the car chase are terrific. Zao, once you accept him at face value (ahem) is a marvellous creation. Don't believe all the hype about Jinx, though - we've had tough Bond girls for decades and this one's required to be the maiden in distress just like all the rest! In the end, though, this game of two halves is less than the sum of its parts. Tamahori's direction, with its undercranking judders and flashes, is just too pop-video. Bond aside, there's little or no character depth or development. The celebrated Bond cinematography isn't given a chance. The keenest loss, though, is the stunt tradition. Essentially, Bond films always 'did it for real'. Here, stuntwork is all too often eschewed in favour of special effects. And, in an era where CGI is still not ever totally convincing, some of this work falls well short even of the lowest modern standards. And when a film makes use of CGI for a jump off a cliff, you know you're in trouble. Bond films have been fantastical in the past; this is one of those films. Although it offers nods to all the previous entries in the series, in many ways Die Another Day is a remake of Diamonds Are Forever (1971) - and, in the end, quite as silly. It doesn't even take its science as seriously as did Moonraker (1979). After the excesses of that film, the series was reined in - to great effect. I hope that can happen again. I'm not sure, though, as Moonraker (a smash hit with audiences) was greeted with derision by the critics - who seem to be loving this. Finally, I'll say that purists will be especially shocked by one particular, very late gag - though it will bring the house down every time. It is hilarious - but utterly sacrilegious! All in all, I'm left wondering where on Earth (or more likely off it) the producers will take the series after this. A final going over of the script by someone new to it (call me!) - to insert more funnies as well as to restore credulity - and a less indulgent director, and this could have been a far better film.",Die Another Day
456,Sowerplave,A worst of compilation that looks even worse - 4/10,4,16 February 2021,"This movie tried to take many things that makes the franchise and turn it to 11. This movie instead became everything that the franchise isn't.On the paper, it takes all the tropes and clichés from all the Bond movies and combines everything to create the ultimate James Bond movie. In reality, it's a Bond movie that takes all the worst tropes and clichés from every movie before it and combining them into a bad movie that looks even worse.There is a bunch of stuff that I love with this franchise. I love how convincing and grand the environments can look. I love how they try to have outlandish stories with eccentric villains, yet also try to keep things firmly grounded. I love how the tech combines low-key looks with ridiculous purposes.This movie could well have been a poor Bond movie knock-off. The digital effects made some environments and the movie as a whole look atrocious. The binds that ties the characters and their motives together were looser than the teeth of an eight year old kid. The tech just looked as an attempt to pull off bad sci-fi instead of exaggerated modern tech.This movie is basically a ""The Worst of James Bond"" collection and it looks even worse than it is.4/10",Die Another Day
457,jacobhenrytucker-1,Fantastic!,10,9 March 2007,"This film is just amazing, one of the best action films of all time. I have seen Pierce Brosman as James Bond in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""The World is Not Enough"", they are both very good movies but this movie is absolutely world-class. I saw Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise and it is no match for this.The film is humorous like any James Bond movie. They say that once you win an Academy Award, you can never be sexy but boy did Halle Berry prove them wrong. Halle who won her Oscar for Best Actress in the drama ""Monster's Ball"" was absolutely sexy! She was funny, cute, sweet, tough-no one else could do it (not even Pamela Anderson).Of course there is the regular James Bond performance by Dame Judi Dench (Academy Award* Winner- Best Supporting Actress, Shakespeare in Love) who does a great performance as M.The only negative thing I have to say was Madonna. Her acting was terrible-she was supposed to be a British woman but her American accent was completely obvious. However her song ""Die Another Day"" was amazing.A great watch!",Die Another Day
458,wolfdog,This Movie Died Today,5,25 November 2002,"I am and always have been a huge Bond fan (my weight does not count) and this latest attempt was barely OK. Too many scenes were over the top and simply unbelievable even for Bond. Speaking of Bond, this movie seem to make him the co-star to Jinx (Halle Berry) which he should not have been. Miranda Frost Rules! I am not a big Halle fan and she added nothing to the James Bond genre. She is simply not believable as a spy or a fighter for that matter. I saw this movie with some friends and they only cared about her looks which she does look great, but she did nothing else for the movie. Maybe bring her back as a minor character but no more. The theme song by Madonna is absolutely horrible!!!!!!!!! How did this song make it past the cutting room floor? How did Madonna's cameo make it past the cutting room floor? She also added nothing.Judi Dench as usual was superb! Back to the movie - most will find it entertaining but I left feeling cheated out of a true bond movie. I wish they would leave the political correctness at home and if Halle Berry wants to be a spy in the movies then let Hollywood start up a new spy gal genre. Hopefully it will work and she will stay out of the Bond scripts. I give it a 5.",Die Another Day
459,solebanana,Promising opening slides into usual fantasies (mild spoilers),5,14 December 2002,"This starts promisingly enough, with Bond for once not coming out on top, and the secret service glamour fading off to leave the grim reality of Korea. The manner of his leaving it was also fair enough, but after that the plot and the technology got more and more far fetched. I'm afraid at the point where the invisible car was introduced it all got too much. This is escapist nonsense, a rainy-day sort of film. Sadly it was nowhere near as good as the previous Bond outing, and suggests the sad descent of the series into meaninglessness was only temporarily halted. I wish there was a way back for Bond, but I fear he has been pushed so far into fantasy land he is now marooned there.",Die Another Day
460,steel_arkangel,"For me, one of the best Bond's ever.",9,6 November 2008,"The one thing i've noticed from the other reviews is that everyone seems to have a different opinion of Bond, so I guess the first thing I would say is you really need to see them all to make up your own mind.I like this one because it feels like a half way house between the old and new Bonds, taking the best bits from both. There's more of a sense of grittiness about the action, - no where near the harshness of Casino R of course, but the opening sequence really highlights the shift in the way Bond is shown. It does however keep the things that make a Bond movie a Bond movie, and what in my view is sadly lacking in the new ones - namely;Gadgets, Q, wisecracks, and the tough henchman.I wouldn't say I love Toby Stevens, a little bit ott for me, but Brosnan is just so cool, is just so Bond!I think overall that each actor has brought something to the Bond character, and to say any of them were better or worse than the other is perhaps a little unkind. I mean there is no way that when Connery played 007 in Dr No, that the audience would have liked seeing him play Bond in the same way Daniel Craig did - the times they have a changed, and so have moviegoers.In summary I think this is a great addition to the Bond franchise, and for me I enjoy watching it the most out of any of them.",Die Another Day
461,jrichards2-1,Poor,5,30 October 2004,"Up til now, I thought that Pierce Brosnan was one of the best Bonds ever, after the excellent Roger Moore, of course. He really brought it into the 90s with Goldeneye (although Sean Bean is better looking, even when playing a horrible baddie). The subsequent Tomorrow Never Days is possibly the best Bond film ever, with a rivoting plot and great supporting cast. The World Is Not Enough looked a little bloated - Robert C doesn't make that convincing a terrorist - but still excellent.Now enter Die Another Day. Well, there was a change of director, so things were bound to be looking a bit different. But I thought the film was far too long. There were too many flashy special effects, and not enough good old Bond charm, in my opinion; somehow things didn't fit together. I hated the beginning bit because it dragged on for ages and I didn't think Bond looked particularly rough after all those months of torture. There was some unconvincing dialogue in there, too.I know it can't be easy to follow the excellent Q from the previous films, but John C is really getting me down. I thought he was the weak point in Shrek 2, as well - he's always playing Basil F, and the joke's been done to death by now. The only film in which I've ever seen him with a difference is A Fish Called Wanda, but that has so many strong characters that it's hard to tell whether he should take the credit for it or not.Well, 5 out of 10. Yes, maybe that sounds harsh, but I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT. Ko, Izzy.",Die Another Day
462,GanzEhrlich,"A pathetic, even if entertaining Bond movie",5,4 August 2014,"Violence aside, I seriously enjoyed Die Another Day when I first watched this as a boy. But now I am double that age and just hours before writing this review I saw it again and this time, after merely half an hour I was starting to get a little bemused by it. This Bond film, celebrated upon its release as the 20th Bond film, the 40th anniversary film, was acting like a tribute to the greatest spy film saga in history. But it was unsuccessful and despite smashing James Bond records in the box-office the film itself was the opposite of smashing in terms of quality.First, the plot. A mission James (Pierce Brosnan) is on in N. Korea, to intercept a key military figure backfires and leads to him being held prisoner after the colonel is seemingly killed. When he is released, MI6 (temporarily) declare that Bond is 'no more use to us'. Bond, recruited by the Chinese, tracks down Zao, a terrorist who was sent to Korea in exchange for his release and ultimately encounters Gustav Graves, a posh, talented and wealthy Englishman played by Toby Stephens. Graves invites Bond to Iceland, where he demonstrates his latest piece of kit, which turns out to be a powerful instrument of destruction.Die Another Day, instead of commemorating the Bond franchise, seems to rip-off other famous moments, such as the laser torture scene from Goldfinger, the mirror-filled room from the Man with the Golden Gun, the space laser from Diamonds are Forever and of course the bikini-clad woman rising from the ocean, in Dr. No. The film even included a discount Oddjob!The technology and gadgets in D.A.D. is spectacular but just too unreal, such that it belongs in a sci-fi movie. If this film were set something like 25-30 years in the future, it wouldn't have felt like it was too far ahead of its time. The trademark Aston Martin can become invisible, although the chase scene involving it and a gorgeous Jag is appropriately good. The main baddie who is presumed dead at the beginning of the film has his DNA changed, so that he is painfully transformed into a man who appears to be of a European/Causasian background. I don't remember that kind of science being around in 2014, let alone in 2002! And when Q shattered glass with a ring that produced a high-pitch frequency to do it (""Voila!"", he uttered as the pane he destroyed collapsed), I started laughing in disbelief. The space laser super-weapon, as stupid as it seems, does fit in though, a Bond movie always needs some kind of WMD in it.The story seems plausible enough, but there are simply too many action sequences that come too quickly, even though they make up virtually all the goods in D.A.D, despite the occasionally woeful CGI. The puns come even even faster and many are miserable.The cast is mostly respectable, Brosnan is brilliant in his final appearance as 007, Halle Berry, shortly after her Oscar-winning role in Monster's Ball, does a nice job as sexy NSA agent Jinx and Oxford- educated Rosamund Pike is equally stunning playing Miranda Frost, Bond's other love interest in the film. Other cast-members drop like a lead balloon; why the producers considered Madonna for the dreadful title song and a poor cameo appearance is beyond me. No surprise John Cleese, after portraying Q, didn't appear in James Bond again after such a terrible performance as the in-house gadget man, Desmond Llewelen having passed away in a car accident shortly after the release of The World is Not Enough.If some Bond movies are criticised for having too little action in them, D.A.D had too much. One scene that summed Die Another Day up for me was the brutal, insane sword fight between Bond and Graves, which made me think ""This is not James Bond"". It didn't feel right at all. I want to watch Skyfall or Goldfinger again to get the feeling of a much more original, complete James Bond film.5/10 for the visual spectacle, 0 for the impurity.",Die Another Day

464,jamesbloke,What a load of rubbish!,1,29 December 2002,"This is the second worst Bond film ever (top honour (!) goes to Moonraker).The plot is rubbish.  For instance, the idea of sending loads of diamonds into space to make a big laser - I'm sure I've seen that before somewhere... I'm sure the writers call it paying homage to previous Bond films - I call it stealing other peoples ideas because you don't have any of your own!  And using someone else's DNA to change identity?????????????????  Oh yeah, for the record: ALL diamonds are chemically the same - they are pure 100% carbon.The gadgets are just nonsense.  The gadgets have always been almost believable, but an invisible car???  Saints preserve us!The acting is terrible.  Halle Berry is awful (wooden), Rosamund Pike is even more awful (more wood than Epping Forest!), so is just about everybody else (yes, even Dame Judi Dench and the gorgeous Samantha Bond).It was good to introduce Cleese as ""Q"" alongside the dearly departed Desmond Llewelyn in the marginally better ""The World is Not Enough"", but even though he acts well (that is to say, he is the best in this film) he has turned out to be humourless and emotionless.Brosnan started out great as Bond, even though the film (Goldeneye) was utter pants.  He has now been told he is the best Bond since Connery, so has decided to start acting less.  He breezes through this film as Pierce Brosnan, not as James Bond.The special effects are strange, too.  Mostly we have loads of special effects just for the sake of it.  Sometimes we have special effects in order to depict stunts which are just not possible otherwise (the helicopter crash).  In one instance, however, (the surfing scene), the effects are just not up to the job, and it just looks like bad animation.",Die Another Day

466,morlock9,"Movie-by-committee with cheesy CGI. Thumbs down on Dench, Berry.",5,25 December 2008,"There is never a truly bad Bond movie. Even the worst of them have a certain style and panache, and the requisite ""three good scenes"" that define half of a good movie (the other half being ""and no bad ones"") were there. The problem is that the Bond movies of late don't stick with a single story line. Easy to see at a script conference someone jumping in ""Hey, what about this?"" or ""Wow, I saw the greatest gizmo, and we could us it like this"", or ""Let's throw in a McGuffin here and pull it out here"". So that's a problem of success. Let's stick with a single vision, Producers. OK? PB, of course, is no SC. Peirce just doesn't have the eyes- too slitty and baggy. Connery had eyes that were large, wise, soulful, and somehow otherworldly- he was the dark Angel of Death (and with a sense of humor, at that!). So that's what made the Connery movies click- the women here helpless in the face of this power, the villains, ultimately, had no where to run. Bond knew he was an Angel and couldn't really lose, and therein sprung his confidence. So with a lack of an actor of Connery's caliber, the producers have to work on gags, production stunts, and CGI nonsense. In trying to make up for the lack of power in their lead, they make the supporting actors stronger- most notably, the women. This has had disastrous results. What the deal is with Judi Dench, I don't know. As a stubby ""M"", she is horrific. Plus, a whole metaphorical dimension is lost without a crusty, older, once-powerful M in control- an Arch-Angel guiding a dark one. Making the women stronger, in fact, only makes Bond look less so. Berry is the worst of them. Stubby, like Dench, with fake tits and a big butt. Puhleeze.... Her chipper repartees were totally out of place. And, like I said, cut out half the actions scenes (plenty there for another movie) and Die would have been better.",Die Another Day
467,booksmooviesnwhisky,Dissappointing : a bad mishmash of previous movies,5,16 June 2003,"I am out and out fan of anything related to James Bond (movies, novels), and I was thoroughly dissappointed with the latest bond movie.First of all, it is just a cocktail made from old movies. The basic story line is of diamnods are for ever (ofcourse with better graphics).Then, it looks more like a Rambo/John Woo action movie then a bond film. The action sometimes goes overboard even for a bond movie.Halle Berry looks HOT, but with all due respect doesnt suit in a bond movie. She looks very tough to be a bond girl. I may sound a male chauvinist here but I would really expect a bond girl persona more like Rosamund Pike then Halle Berry. And no, she doesnt look as hot as ursula andrews, in Dr. No.Good parts in the movie are *SOME* good one liners, especially from the bad guys, a good start of movie, and pierce brosnan.

468,co010c6650,"If Octopussy was an ' All Time High ', this is an ' All Time Low '.",1,16 September 2006,"An outing which represents a first for the Bond franchise i.e. one that fails abjectly in virtually every discernible area. The most prominent one being that of a cut'n'paste, dog's dinner of a screenplay that looks as though it was cobbled together by the screenwriters during their dinner break. Previous entries such as 'OHMSS' and 'From Russia With Love' managed to treat their audiences with more than a modicum of intelligence. This is in stark contrast to D.A.D. which seemed to be aiming for an audience predominately populated by XXX-loving, popcorn-munching, baseball capped cretins who will demand the right to see as many things blown up as possible with at least as many people being either shot or wasted whilst being assured that such minor trivialities as 'plot' or 'characterization' are not allowed to spoil their enjoyment of proceedings.The standard of acting varies from merely perfunctory to downright dreadful. Brosnan simply goes through the motions whilst Halle Berry tries desperately hard to pass what turned out to be an audition for her own character's franchise but ends up being the most irritating leading lady since Tanya Roberts. In her Ursula Andress homage (on second thoughts, make that 'rip-off'), you can almost sense Tamahori saying 'That's right, Halle, swivel your hips. A bit more. A bit more. Keep going and cut !!!' Any chemistry with 007 is all but non-existent with their 'banter' being invariably puerile and tedious.We have a nemesis who is totally lacking in anything remotely resembling charisma, threat or menace. Indeed Gustav Graves' only real 'gimmick' appears to be a total lack of need for sleep ( watching this drivel would soon change that ). The obligatory henchman, Zao, had mild potential but was under-used.Much has been said about the risible CGI sequence involving the ice wave ( and deservedly so ) but, for me, the sequence which preceded it was even more ludicrous. Our hero is doing about 300mph in a rocket car and heading for a plunge to his certain death. Don't fret, however, as a trailing anchor digs a few inches into the ice and, over the space of a few yards, brings the car to a complete halt, causing it to flip over the edge and smash into the side of the precipice without so much as a scratch on the vehicle and 007 left not the least bit shaken nor stirred. It was a scene which was more akin to 'The Wacky Races' with Dastardly & Muttley once again receiving their come-uppance.On the subject of growlers, the living legend (in her own mind) that is Madonna ensured that the title 'song' would, by several light years, be the worst ever. However, Madge's monstrous ego ensured that her contribution to proceedings wouldn't end there and so the unsuspecting viewing audience would then be treated to an equally awful cameo. Did Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones or Carly Simon receive cameos ? Of course not. Many would correctly say that none of them can act. However, based on the evidence of D.A.D. and a clutch of other big-screen stinkers, neither can Madonna.Pierce Brosnan's outrageous salary demand ( £24 million ) for the next epic appeared to give the producers little option but to announce that it was 'taxi for Brosnan'. Granted, this sage and onion-stuffed extravaganza managed to trouser over 400 mill at the box office so many might say that it's only fair that he's entitled to be angling for a bigger slice of the pie. Never-the-less it sure as hell wouldn't have just been Brosnan's name that sold tickets for a film which I'm sure would still have made a mint even if Graham Norton had been donning the tuxedo. OK, perhaps a slight exaggeration but clearly no individual is bigger than the licenced to kill ( and make money ) Bond franchise.All-in-all, a charmless, hideous mess that tries, like 'Octopussy', to cram too much in. The introduction of Daniel Craig (and hopefully a decent script) can perhaps inject the series with fresh impetus to help prevent the 007 money-making juggernaut from going the same way as the one from 'Duel'.",Die Another Day

470,AVass0812,"Should've been called ""Try Another Way""",5,28 November 2002,"SPOILERS I've just come back from seeing the latest installment of the James Bond Series. I believe the title of the film should've been called ""Try Another Way"". In this installment, Bond is behind enemy lines in North Korea, stopping a corrupted North Korean Colonel who has successfully built a small elite and troublesome arms dealer or terroist (not sure, the story was weak through there?). Bond is successful at stopping the bad guy (we think) and is taken into custody and interrogated for over a year by the North Koreans, amazing after being starved, burnt, shocked, whipped, stung by scorpians (yep, by scorpians) and given numerous ""swirlies"", he comes out in amazing physical and mental shape. Ready to take on the world he is. He manages within a couple of days of being rescued to be back to his old self. Oh a plot point that was stolen from another Bond film (I believe the Living Daylights), Bond is suspended from his duties by ""M"" (Judi Dench's character) and order for evaluation, to which Bond has the ability to stage his own death, injure his own people and escape to seek vendetta on the bad guy. He is quickly funded by the Hong Kong Secret Service and is put on a flight to Cuba where he is instantly provided contact leads and support by a pathetic mob-type Cuban person with really bad teeth and a cheap suit. Sort of reminded me of a bum who stopped off at a Salvation Army thrift shop. Anyway, he's given the information he's looking for and then proceeds to find this bad guy, who is getting a DNA makeover, oh yes, a DNA make over. I thought that they had abandoned these unrealistic story lines after Roger Moore played 007, I guess desperate times call for desperate measures (sounds like a good name for the next film). Oh did I forget to mention Halle Berry's character ""Jinx"". No that was intentional because she was an overlooked character. She didn't fit the script and seem to be a plotline that was ""forced"" into the story to add ""spice and sex appeal"" for the aging Bronson.  Any way, back to the boredom, er' Bond film. They start working together, fight the bad guys in an ice palace (yep, an ice palace). Now this is where I'm lost. This bad guy, who's had a DNA makeover has managed in 14 months to do what most multi-billionaires take their entire lives to do, which is establish a fortune, build giant ice castles, launch huge satellites into space (under the nose of all governments) and learn how to fence with swords (right, yep...sure I believe it). Now granted I love Bond films and I wasn't expecting a Oscar performance, but this one really was off track and lost me almost half way through. They should have stayed with the formula that made Goldeneye a huge hit. It was believable and Bronson played Bond excellent. Of course he played Bond in this film well also. I just wished that the author's of the script would have kept a sense of reality while developing the story and the characters. I could except that Bond would be tortured for a year after doing an assignment. I could understand that his government would not go after him (makes sense in the spy world) and I could even except the gadets. But everything else was weak, undeveloped and just plain stupid. For those who read these articles before going to see this film, please read mine. Save your eight dollars and go see something better. Just wait 6 months and this will be out on the rental shelves. Its not the worst of the Bond films, nor the best. I would put it in the lower middle. One bright note. They manage to minimize Madonna's acting (a good thing) and barely utilized that over hashed crappy title song that was awful. Now Bond battling Madonna and Guy Ritchie, that would've been cool. Our secret agent taking on a Washed Up Diva and her wimpy British husband. Brilliant.",Die Another Day

Pierce Brosnan was excellent and I hope he does the next film as well. John Cleese has been promoted to ""Q"" and brought out the comedy of the film as well as some top noch gadgets. They also brought the Austin Martin back for a traditional edge.But the film wasn't all a bowl of cherries.

473,SILV3R,"A potential classic, time will tell.",9,22 November 2002,"Die Another Day was shaping up to be the best Bond film ever.  My favourite Bond by a mile was back.  There was a director that you believed wanted to make a modern Bond, better than all its predecessors.  You knew they had the locations.  You had seen the bad guy with the diamonds in his face, and he looked too cool to be a disappointment - he was Bond's Darth Maul.  The Bond girls looked better than ever.  The title was crap, but you learn you live with it (Beyond the Ice always sounded better to me).  The theme tune had caused controversy, only serving to increase the anticipation.  Arriving at the cinema (where the queue was actually out of the building), it was almost impossible to not feel like a five year old on Christmas morning.The opening is spectacular, just as you would expect.  Not only that, but Bond seems somehow more human in it.  There are the usual politically `safe' villain nation - North Korea chosen this time, probably on the grounds that they aren't likely to see the movie.  The stunts have continued to grow exponentially, getting bigger and better than the last movie.  The excitement levels have been suitably encouraged by the time the opening credits kick in.  And blow me, Madonna's theme actually works.  I'm not really sure why, but it does.  The credits themselves have also grown up. Its not just naked women performing random acts of gymnastics in silhouette, although they are there.  The credits themselves actually serve as part of the narrative, which is a blessing as far as I'm concerned.  I have never enjoyed the opening credits of a Bond film until now.  I was seriously optimistic about this movie.Pierce Brosnan has finally grown into a rounded Bond.  He has developed from the simple suave manner he had already perfected in Remmington Steel into a character with underlying insecurities about the people he works for and a contradicting loyalty to the country he would die for.  For the first time since Brosnan took the baton you really want him to win, and to beat the bad guys in a way no bad guy has been beaten before.  You also find yourself actually wanting him to get the girl, but not for one night as he inevitably will, but for good.  As for the girls, Jinx (Berry) is essentially the American PC version of Bond.  She, is black, is independent, is successful, sleeps with anyone she wants - Oprah would be so proud.  She is also the first person to have reasonable graphic sex with Bond, although this is still a Bond film so its not that graphic.  The main problem I had with Berry's character was her slightly boyish form (save for the two obvious differences): short hair, slim and muscular.  This problem comes to light most during the aforementioned sex scene.  The scene is all done in silhouette and, did we not know better, we could be convinced that it was a gay sex scene.  The Bond girl crown is stolen in Die Another Day by Miranda Frost (Pike).  She is far more feminine, sexier and an all round more convincing character.The two/three main bad guys are also way above average.  Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee) is convincingly hard.  We meet him as he practices his martial arts on a punch bag with human stuffing, and we are very glad we aren't in his bad books.  His henchman, Zao (Rick Yune) is a modern Jaws.  The pair of them are clearly psychotic, and completely perfect for Bond villains. Although the pair of them are outdone by the malevolent Gustav Graves (Stevens) and his Teflon diamond-fortune-funded lifestyle.  He is the anti-Bond.  He is English (although he admits it is an adopted nationality), suave, likes the finer things and is determined to win at all costs.  He also looks like he might be the one guy who could beat James Bond, you believe he stands a chance of winning this fight.  The rest of the cast, Judi Dench (as she is credited), John Cleese, Michael Madsen and the usual background characters, they hold their own.  Dench is her usual brilliant self, possibly giving her most convincing M performance yet, and Cleese has taken on the role of Q (he received a promotion from R) and appears to have set himself up for as long a stint as Desmond Llewellyn's before him. Samantha Bond on the other hand serves as nothing more than a cheap joke at the end, a shame as I rather liked her interpretation of Miss Moneypenny.The film itself looks somehow different from the traditional Bond visuals. There is a far more modern feel to the images.  It is grainier and harsher and nowhere near as shiny as previous pieces in the oeuvre.  There are also original (to Bond films) stylistic traits brought in by Lee Tamahori (Once Were Warriors) which will make this Bond film either unique amongst Bond films, or will make it age badly.  Within the piece though they keep the pace fast and edgy.  Tamahori also looks like he should actually be a Bond villain, a fact that we can assume has not escaped him, so has paid a lot of attention to the styling of his bad guys.  He has also managed to use a script which could have been tacky in its nods to the past and made it sexy and amusing.  It appears that as the twentieth in a series everyone involved has taken the best bits of the past and pulled them all together.Die Another Day will be many peoples favourite James Bond movie, and certainly most peoples' favourite Brosnan Bond movie.  Personally it comes in my top five, but I cant help feeling that there couple of minutes that the movie would have benefited from losing.  Stood against any other pretenders to the crown (xXx, The Bourne Identity) this effort is head shoulders and bow tie above the rest.  A modern movie, with more than a dash of Moore era narrative and plenty of jokes in there for the aficionado, Tamahori has directed a Bond movie that will be remembered as one of the better ones.  And if the Broccoli family have any brains in their head they will get Brosnan and Tamahori back for another one, next time with them learning from their mistakes.  As for the suggestion of a Jinx spin off series, it may have the face and the breasts, but I just can't see it having the legs.",Die Another Day
474,kraley,Bond. Lame Bond.,5,19 November 2002,"First off, let me say that I think Pierce Brosnan makes a great Bond. Judi Dench does a great role as M and John Cleese is actually much better this time around, sans the comic relief elements of the previous film, as the new Q. I am also a fan (not of the rabid variety) of the Bond movies in general. This entry marks the 20th Bond film and marks a few anniversaries for the franchise. As films go, this one was not much to my liking. Halle Berry, while pretty and talented, just didn't fit in the customary 'Bond girl' role. It's painfully obvious that the producers are trying to create another franchise with Berry's 'Jinx' character. Unfortunately, I didn't find the character even remotely interesting. Jinx is simply a female soldier and definately lacks the 'special' part of being a special agent. I'll bet ya that you see a 00Jinx movie by 2005. The rest of the supporting cast is quite good, but much like Jinx, they are underused or misused. The most unique villain in the cast, Zao, is supposed to be a world-class bad guy, but we never see him do anything. At all. I think he throws a sucker punch at Bond in the beginning of the film and shoots at Bond from a car near the end but that's it. The film never establishes the reason that the main characters are supposed to harbor such animosity towards Zao. No Oddjob is he. He's just a cool-looking toadie (by Bond standards; and pun intended) with a lot of screen time and next to no impact on the plot. I actually felt that he was being picked on unfairly. As any afficianado knows, a hero is only as good as his villains and sadly the villains in Die Another Day are not that villainous. It might be an effort to not antagonize the general public due to the recent overreaction to terrorism and world events that make the villains so 'huggable' (I hope that's all it is). I wish the 'powers that be' would stop telling filmmakers what we moviegoers are ""able to take"" and just make some quality movies with some quality villains. Political correctness is ruining the film industry just as surely as it's destroying everything else. Speaking of plot, there isn't much. What plot there is is predictable and REMARKABLY similar to Goldeneye. You'll likely know the conclusion (and the 'big surprise') at about the 45 minute mark of this 2-hour film. Not that that's all bad, but you'd think they'd throw in a twist or two after 20 films. The action is outstanding. The stunts are neat. The CGI is silly (especially the parasurfing scene). There is a remarkably high level of annoying slow-motion and Matrix-style rotoscope scenes that are highly unnecessary. They don't show anything the viewer would miss at normal film speed or from the traditional framing angle. They are simply inserted into the film to meet Hollywood's bullet-time quota. It's annoying and distracting and adds nothing to the scenes involved. I look forward to Hollywood ending it's recent obsession with this camera technique. I'd say 8 out of 10 action scenes in Die Another Day have some unnecessary ""Hey!Look what we can do with special effects technology!"" moment. The gadgets in this film are fairly lame as well. The recently overused invisible vehicle is there along with the ""what did that do again?"" OO7 watch and an ultrasonic ring (the sole original gadget) that shatters bulletproof glass. Even the villains have little to work with. The big villain gadget is an electrical Nintendo controller glove the main bad guy uses to control the 'ultimate weapon' he has created. It also acts as a stun gun. Whee. I'm scared. Also of note is the soundtrack. The techno-pop chosen for this film is just ""off"". I think Madonna is responsible for the Cyndi Lauperish techno-trash that covers the opening an closing credits. It's not ""timely"" nor is it a tribute to current musical tastes. It's just ""off"". You'll no doubt know what I mean immediately when (and if) you see this film. The rest of the soundtrack is not much better. Different is not always an improvement. Give me more 'recycled' Bond music any day. Madonna's role in the film is brief and uneventful. I had heard there were some rumors her scenes would ruin the film. I don't think she even registered as being more significant than the bit part they gave her. Unless you're a Madonna fan, you might not even notice her. On the plus side, the set designers did an outstanding job with the Ice Palace where the end of the film takes place. It is really well-crafted and is the first Bond Set I would really like to have seen first hand (if such a thing ever existed outside of a matte-painter's imagination). I did bust out in inappropriate laughter when the thought ""Sydney on Ice"" popped into my head due to the Palace's resemblance to a rather famous building in Australia. All in all, this is a generic Bond film with few memorable moments or players. Consider it a placeholder in the Bond mythos if you will. There's enough here to entertain casual Bond fans and action film fans but overall, this movie just isn't scripted or directed well enough to entertain as previous Bond films have. You've likely already made up your mind whether you will see it or not, but if you are on the fence, you might do better to rent one of the older (better) bond films and save Die Another Day for when it comes out for rental or goes into the inevitable heavy cable rotation.",Die Another Day
475,DamRho,The best of Brosnan,7,20 January 2003,"We have to admit that the actors that have portrayed James Bond in 40 years have been both great actors and bad actors. Pierce Brosnan fits in the first category. Brosnan is probably the second best Bond after Roger Moore - Sean Connery was great but being the first didn't give him too much visibility, George Lazenby was a very sad choice, and Timothy Dalton was unlucky enough to have 3 not-so-good movies although I really appreciate him as an actor. What was lacking in Pierce Brosnan's 007 career was a really good Bond movie. Die Another Day is that movie. Of course I've realized that the plot is senseless and silly... so what? All James Bond movies are about great action sequences, car chases, women and, naturally, Bond getting out of the most wicked situations in the most unpredictable way. In Die Another Day, 007 achieves it all. He surfs, he runs, he jumps, he drinks, he drives and he fights, all the time with flawless hairstyle & tux. This is, after all, James Bond's finest trademark. Two notes go to Toby Stephens (Gustav Graves), the first since Christopher Lee (Francisco Scaramanga) in The Man With The Golden Gun to level up with Bond and face him eye-in-the-eye, and the great Monty Python John Cleese (Q) whose performance is equal to the late Desmond Llewelyn (and who will always be Q in the hearts of James Bond fans) if not even superior. Die Another Day is probably the best bond movie since A View To A Kill because it is the first of these to have all the classic James Bond elements. All 007 fans should definitely watch this movie but viewers that are not into the genre should not get high expectations about Die Another Day. It is a movie for the fans, and what a great James Bond this is!",Die Another Day
476,MasterDebator5,Takes its place as one of the worst Bond films ever made,6,4 January 2009,"Die Another Day Directed by Lee Tamahori.Starring Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry and Judi Dench.Pierce Brosnan's fourth effort as James Bond turns out to be by far his worst, resulting in the overly cheesy and disappointing ""Die Another Day."" Marking a double anniversary for the series (twenty films in forty years), the movie celebrates the tried-and-true Bond formula by tossing in at least one reference to each previous installment. While it may be fun to play 'Guess That Bond Movie' for a bit, there is generally not much enjoyment to be had in this uninspired entry.The pre-title sequence kicks things off in typical Bond fashion. 007 invades a North Korean military base and, after an exciting hovercraft chase, is captured and imprisoned for over a year. As the credits roll -- to the sub par theme sung by Madonna -- the audience sees Bond beaten and tortured. MI6 only comes to his aid because they believe that he has cracked under pressure, and don't want the North Koreans siphoning important information. The once-heroic secret agent returns to his homeland a disgrace. The intro sets a serious tone for the film, duping its audience into suspecting that a similarly themed story will follow. That's what would have made sense, but it certainly isn't what occurs.""Die Another Day"" is split into two very different films. In the first half, it's a revenge story played relatively straight with interesting plot turns and developments. Bond, without the backing of his agency, seeks revenge for his betrayal in North Korea, following a trail (with stops at Hong Kong, Havana and Iceland) that eventually leads to diamond tycoon Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). Graves is a pretty standard villain at first glance: rich, eccentric and power hungry. In fact, the entire first hour is business as usual for the series; nothing new but enjoyable nonetheless.The story takes a turn for the outrageous in its second half, starting with Bond's initial encounter with Graves. The two quickly clash egos at a prestigious London fencing club. Their friendly match soon becomes an over-the-top sword fight that toes the line between exhilaration and camp. In the very next scene, Bond is reinstated at MI6 and ""Die Another Day"" simultaneously ditches the revenge theme. Apparently, Tamahori was no longer concerned with that aspect of the story, instead preferring to prop up his movie with ridiculous gadgets and unconvincing action sequences. The series typically employs stunt men to realize its fantastic feats, but this outing amps up the CGI to a disappointing degree. Seeing a computer-generated Pierce Brosnan riding a tidal wave and dodging icebergs on a makeshift surfboard is just too much. Remember, just because you can doesn't mean you should.Brosnan's effort in ""Die Another Day"" recalls that of Sean Connery in his last 007 feature, ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Much like Connery at the time, Brosnan has simply lost interest and sleepwalks from scene to scene. His heart clearly isn't in it, whether it be due to the corniness of the film or boredom with the role in general. He stars opposite Halle Berry, whose Jinx character is set up as Bond's female equivalent. She's an American agent working for the NSA, with an appetite for sex and excitement. Despite the good intentions, Jinx is just a poorly disguised effort to appease feminist sensibilities (not to mention, she's just plain annoying). The producers make sure that she kicks butt, yet she is still the helpless damsel in distress when the time comes.This twentieth installment means well, and in the hands of a more competent director it could have been much better, but ""Die Another Day"" ultimately fails because of its indecisiveness. The film sacrifices story to make way for mindless action, but in order for the audience to care about the action there needs to be a compelling story driving it along (I guess those responsible for the movie never heard about the chicken and the egg). It attempts to pay tribute to the past, but instead combines the worst bits of the old movies. As a result, ""Die Another Day"" takes its place alongside ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""Moonraker"" and ""A View to a Kill"" as one of the worst Bond films ever made.Final Grade: D",Die Another Day
477,isbabo,Worst of Brosnan's Bond films,2,31 March 2005,"Silly film, Brosnan returns for what we now know will be his last Bond film. Too bad, because he was second only to Connery as being Bond and his first three films were pretty good. This one ranks with ""Moonraker"" in terms of being a ridiculous Bond film. The action sequences are good but not great. Halle Berry is also INCREDIBLY overrated as a Bond girl (Even Denise Richards was better). I remember hearing rumours of talks of having a spin off film with her character and I hope that they were just rumours, because the character was boring and she was two dimensional. The villain, a North Korean spy is also a two dimensional, yet boring and unremarkable villain. The ending will have you shaking your head (and give you awful ""Moonraker"" flashbacks). The one saving grace (and thus why it got a two and not a one) was how they, at the beginning of the film, made sure James Bond would not go down the same road as 24 and simply become an anti-terrorist or worse, anti-Muslim warrior (24 is, don't deny it). This movie proves that a post-Soviet Bond couldn't work forever. I hope they do better with the next Bond film (If indeed there is one....... anyone know who's playing 007 next?)",Die Another Day
478,Joro-3,Coolest Bond in a decade,8,22 November 2002,"Great stunts, great style, great looking Halle Berry, average-level Brosnan. Perfect direction from Tamahori. Fine dialog, screenplay - at least acceptable. One f the best one-liners in recent movie history. The final 30 minutes became some kind of boring, claustrophobic and tedious. Could be better, but at the same time could be much worse. The whole Iceland scenery was, errr, fantastic. It will be very difficult for the next Bond director to deliver at the same level or better.

480,tehfro,Best Bond of the Brosnan Era,5,1 December 2002,"After hearing some mixed reviews, I saw the new Bond flick and I have to say that this series will ""Die Another Day"".  Finally Bond is back and after watching some of the ""classics"" on TNN I think this one is deserving of being among the top Bond films.Brosnan FINALLY nails the role this time around... it doesn't hurt that he actually gets to show some dramatic range this time around and basically incorporate all the good traits of the other Bond actors into this performance.  There's a nice balance with some cool gadgets but Bond on his own for a lot on the film.  One of the best Bond actors for sure.  Hale Berry is basically playing the same character she always does but is pretty darn serviceable as Jinx.  The villains are definately some of the more memorable ones.  The action is great, as usual for a Bond film, although I can understand why some purists would think it's too much.  Overall I think it's deserving in its current IMDB rating in comparision with the other Bond movies.",Die Another Day
481,smoothgroove16,"Sooo frustrating, least enjoyable Bond by far",3,22 November 2002,"Never in any of the previous 19 movies have I felt dissapointed, or bored by the end of the film. Ok some storylines flop, the baddies can at times be pathetic, and sometimes the humour is more cheesy than a lump of cheddar, however I've always got to the end credits with a feeling of satisfaction and eager-ness to the next Bond. But this film just collapsed on all levels that make Bond films so watchable over and over again.Plot- James Bond's are not renowned for their terrific stories but this one has just been used so many times, mad man, has dream to take over the world, uses diamonds...fails after close encounter. Realistic plots is all we want, like Goldfinger (to x10 his personal wealth with ludicrous plot), The Living Daylights (playing countries agasint each other), and License to kill (simply to sell drugs)...but a second sun which turns into a giant laser...exactly the same as Diamonds are forever and the more recent Goldeneye!! The betrayed Bond aspect was a change and I enjoyed this, seeing him in prison after 14 months gave a realistic approach that James Bond is only human. But after the trade he seems to become indestuctible.
Action- Of course the action is going to be terrific, but terrific action doesn't equal enjoyable action. It was just so boring to watch, stupid dumb explosions, alot of gunfire and stupid stunts! I mean the surfing thing was ridiculous, but the fencing fight was just utterly stupid. Are we meant to believe they were actually going to kill each other, and remember this guy is Korean!...where on earth did he learn to fence fight in Korea.
Gadgets- The one delight to this film was John Cleese playing Q. I thought he was dreadful in the previous film but this one made him look a lot more clever and realistic. However the same cannot be said about the gadgets, they were simply awful! An invisible car?? Need I say more.Humour- I think this was the main downfall of this film. Nearly every line was trying to be funny or have sexual references. The dreadful lines in Jason X were more humourous than this because it wasn't taking itself seriously. There are so many corny one liners you kinda half lose interest in the dialogue altogether!Girls- Don't beleive the hype, this film just has your average dumb girl- Jinx Halle Berry), who really is awful in this film and has no charm or charisma about her. Frost was very sexy but of course doesnt turn out to be all she seems.Bond- Pierce Brosnan does a great job with what he is given, and he's terrific in the previous three but here he doesn't seem like Bond at all. Just a cocky, sly, and rather predictable imitation of the James Bond we all love. He really does just seem like a bit of an idiot in this one and almost like he's lost his touch.Overall the constant references to previous Bonds to mark the 40th anninversary ruined this film for me, so many moments had been repeated (laser scene- Goldfinger, Halle Berry linked to Ursula Andress- Dr No, going down plane - The Living Daylights, these really are just a few to name. The resulting Bond in this movie is obvious, they've simply tried to make him cooler, more hip and more modern but in my view fail dreadfully. Bring the back the day when James Bond was charming, humourous, realistic and began to act like a true 00 agent like in the early installments.",Die Another Day
482,MrP823,Standard Bond Formula,5,24 December 2002,"Pretty weak entry into the longest lasting film franchise of all time (oh wait I think Godzilla may have had more films). The biggest problem with this movie is that there is nothing remotely original in it (with one exception). Yes the action sequences in Bond films are always interesting and different (although I have to tell you the entire scene of Bond in his new car on the ice and in the palace is a real bore), but the last three Pierce Brosnan adventures have suffered horribly from the standard Bond formula. It has become just a little too much. What I really would like to see is the makers take a chance and try something different. From Russia With Love didn't really follow the Bond formula that we have become too familiar with at all. It was an exciting adventure that focused on suspense and thrilling the audience with a story that one could get into.  This may sound sacrilegious, but I honestly think a renovation of the series would make for better future films.On a positive note, I did enjoy the opening teaser with its over the top action, as well as Bond's imprisonment (an awkward and very welcome change in direction). The fencing match between Bond and the film's villain was also well written and choreographed. Making it the best non-lethal interplay between the hero and bad guy since Goldfinger's golf match. It was a perfect way for the two to size each other up in the early parts of the film. Now if only the rest of the movie had been this exciting. 6/10",Die Another Day

484,karlito5,This film is just so bad,1,12 January 2007,"Up until I saw this film I really liked Pierce Brosnan as 007 in Die Another Die it all goes wrong for him although it's not entirely his fault.Firstly the plot harks back to the worst days of Roger Moore, Bond films have always been implausible - and you expect that - Die Another Die though is just downright ridiculous. Whilst the insistence on incorporating homages to previous films in the series gives this film a feeling of greatest hits collection. This leaves the film feeling disjointed but not only that at least with a normal greatest hits you get the best bits of what has transpired previously here classic moments are poorly recreated and give the film a very tacky film. The use of plot devices from previous films further erodes any remaining quality by making Die Another Die exceptionally predictable.Then we have Brosnan's bloated Bond, let's face it he no longer looks up to the job. Halle Berry ain't too bad - until she opens her mouth. The villains are about as memorable as Al Gore as Vice President. M and R though offer a bit of class despite the fact their characters are totally flat. Rosamund Pike is quite good as the double agent and is really the only major character who has any sort of depth.Meanwhile Die Another Day is full of gimmicks such as the invisible car that are too far fetched to be memorable in, say, the manner of the bungee jump in Goldeneye. That's another point too, what happened to using stunt-men? The surfing sequence features shockingly poor CGI and further reinforces the overriding sense of tackiness that engulfs this film.The production team though have at least seen the errors in their ways and have throughly reinvented Bond for Casino Royale - which is a film in a different class to Die Another Day.Die Another Day is easily one of the worst films that I have ever seen and I have to say I feel very sorry for those of you who saw this film at the cinema.",Die Another Day

I would have choose somebody with stronger presence for that role. I really like the little role assigned to Madonna. She did little but did it right. Of course her song fits good, it sounds perfect for the movie. I gave a good score to the movie because it really is entertaining, it is got good humor and action.

The music from Madonna is good enough, certainly not the best, but good enough. You get swept away by the intro animations. It's a work of art.Well and after the first 15 minutes there starts this nagging feeling in the back of your mind: why doesn't the intro stop?!Well I got the impression that the makers of Bond wanted to do as much action as possible but they completely forgot about the most thrilling part: they didn't include an exiting story! Bond stumbles from location to location. The first 15 minutes are great and you expect a little character development of James Bond (yes, it would be possible!) but nothing progresses.The action scenes are done nicely and are breathtakingly. Unbelievable? YES but it's a LOT OF FUN! The car chase is just a piece of beauty. John Cleese as Q has the funniest scene. Sorry to note: it's the only fun scene in the whole movie. The whole atmosphere of the set, backgrounds, shots and locations is great. The producers did everything to please the audience. They did a good job.My main critic is that the director and script people complete forgot about the story and character development. They talked so much about Bond doing a great transition from the hard agent to the something else. Yet they just made an action movie like out of the 1980s.Most bothering to me was that you always get the impression: WOW, I would love to play this movie AS A VIDEO GAME. But that's not enough for two hours in the cinema.And look at all the product placement! You almost think that it's a longer commercial. They forgot about most things that make an authentic Bond movie. There is no slowdown for story elements.

Afterwards, I felt like I had watched a low-budget Sci Fi film - despite the huge money that must have been spent on it.So much is implausible. A clinic that can change a Korean into a ginger-haired Caucasian (with an Oxford accent) by a bone-marrow transplant; CGI fights that transcend the laws of physics by ridiculous margins; a fight between cars with rocket launchers etc at nearly point-blank range, but neither gets a dentZao gets a face studded with diamonds after an explosion and stays like it the rest of the film - couldn't the bone-marrow clinic find a pair of tweezers?The invisible car - 'R' (John Cleese) explains that cameras looking out the far side create an image then shown on the near side body panels with LEDs. Sorry, parallax would sink that idea. You would need to be looking at the exact same angle as the cameras were, even to be momentarily fooled from a distance, otherwise it is just going to look like a car with pictures on it. The car fight scene (again) is just confusing - lots of shots of Bond or Zao struggling with the wheel, or opening shutters concealing yet more ineffectual weapons, with the film switching between them every split-second. ""Goldfinger"" did car gadgets much more effectively - spectacular (""Ejector seat? You're joking!""

Die Another Day is not like the other ones.James Bond films don't involve unbelievably impossible equipment. For nerds out there, I hate to say it, but an invisible car is not thinking literal. When barely touching the car, the ""micro cams"" would smash easily.Also 007 films don't involve ""new faces."" That was the dumbest idea from any movie.I really like the other Bond films, especially the Connery ones, and Goldeneye was good. But Die Another Day just took it way to far!",Die Another Day
494,FilmFanAndReviewer003,Not The Best 007 Film But A Good Film Nonetheless,6,15 April 2006,"""Die Another Day"" is a good film, pure and simple. It is by no means the best Bond film, or, for that matter, anywhere near the top tier of Bond films, but I feel that the film has been unfairly criticized for portraying Bond as a more pathetic and vulnerably spy than he has been in other films. I felt that ""Die Another Day"" helped to show a different side to Bond that we had not seen before, and it was quite well done. The film also has many well-done and fun action sequences to watch, and Halle Berry makes for a very amusing ally/Bond girl.For those unfamiliar with the film's plot: James Bond a.k.a. MI6 Agent 007 is in North Korea to bring a renegade North Korean General, General Tan-Sun Moon, to justice for trading illegal armaments in the De-Militarized Zone. However, Bond's identity is compromised by one of Moon's allies, and, after Moon is killed, Bond is captured and tortured for 14 months before being traded back to MI6 for Zao, a North Korean terrorist who was in league with Moon. Stripped of his ""00-license,"" he flees to find out who betrayed him, which takes him globe-trotting from Hong Kong to Havana to London to Iceland.Rating-***",Die Another Day

496,stephengward,Far from a classic,1,20 May 2003,"Well as a Bond fan, all I can say that this is a very poor addition to the series. We're heading back to the bad old days of Moonraker' where the character of 007 was engulfed in a mass of nonsense laughingly called a script. The movie moves just too quick at times, not enough is developed, the action scenes in particular demonstrate this. The most outstanding and memorable scene is the fencing duel  perhaps the only human' element the movie has. David Arnold's score is lacking originality and after an acceptable pre title sequence, Madonna's truly awful title track provides the audience with a flat feeling of anti climax  as a dance track this song is fine, for 007 it's simply painful. The acting is questionable to say the least; Michael Madsen has not exactly enhanced his reputation by playing American agent Damian Falco'  - his scenes are totally wooden and embarrassing to watch. Already the special effects look dated and cheap, Bond films usually stand the test of time fairly well, this one has already fallen at the first hurdle. The ending is poor and bores the audience,  we know Bond escapes, theres no tension or suspense in watching how he does it, especially when the aforementioned special effects are going haywire around the proceedings. All in all, too much is crammed into this film, the producers are loosing the plot yet again, time to drag Bond's feet back firmly onto the ground.",Die Another Day
497,Various_Things,"One of my favourites, but not exactly perfect",5,22 November 2002,"My two favourite Bond films are From Russia With Love and GoldenEye. Why do I like them? The former has a great story with lots of clever spying and espionage, as  well as a nemesis who is easily 007's equal; while the latter has all that but with even more action. I was pleased to see that Die Another Day takes the best elements from these two films (and every other Bond film for that matter), and merges them to produce a great addition to the 007 canon - and a fantastic movie in its own right.However, my least favourite Bond movie is Moonraker, the main criticism of that film being that there were too many unconvincing special effects. Unfortunately, despite the fact that effects have improved no end since that film was made, even now some of the over-the-top sequences come across only *slightly* more convincingly than the laser blasters in Moonraker! Computer generated effects may be suited to some films (like The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings), but only when done right. For Bond, I much prefer real stuntmen over digital trickery - who can forget the bungee jump off the dam in GoldenEye, or the Union Flag parachute in The Spy who Loved Me, or the car barrel-roll (with accompanying cheesey sound effect) in The Man With The Golden Gun? But fortunately in this film there's no shortage of daring feats by the stunt team, like an exciting swordfight and a cool car chase across a frozen lake.These action sequences are very exciting, and I had great fun trying to spot all of the references to previous Bond films - I think it will take another viewing or two before I spot every one, though! Overall it's a great blend of formulaic 007 stuff, and ideas new to the series.",Die Another Day
498,manzp,What a disappointment!,4,15 December 2002,"I was so looking forward to this movie. The last few nights I'd watched various Bond films, both on TNN and on my own recordings. I thought this would be a great Bond film. Well, Here is my summary: Sean had Never Say Never Again Moore had A View to a Kill and now Brosnan has Die Another Day We now have the three ""worst"" Bond films. I used to include Moonraker, but being dated actually helped it. The Madonna theme was awful. The ""sped-up"" film looked like a cheap USA network series (that's fine when its on USA, but NOT a Bond film). The acting was bad. Most of the David Arnold score was good, except for the ""techno"" stuff.  (I guess I'm just too old) This was a sad release, especially following the previous three Brosnan films, all of which were excellent.",Die Another Day
499,markbond,An insult to any true Bond fan...,1,23 November 2002,"(Spoilers below)The first hour of this movie is perhaps the best hour filmed by Brosnan as James Bond.  The opening chase, the great twist before the credits, and Bond being ripped of his license to kill...but then the writers & director manage to kill whatever dignity was left in the character of 007an invisible car?? Bond willing his heart to stop??? A fight amongst laser beams?? A 'death star' with heat beam?? DNA-altering identity changes???Who writes this crap!!  This is an insult to the audience, especially if you're a James Bond fan.  This is an insult to everything that Connery, Moore, & even Dalton put into the character.  Bond is a man - albeit an extraordinary man - but he's human.  Ian Fleming (God rest his soul) said ""Bond can go wildy beyond the improbable, but never beyond the impossible"". Fleming himself would not watch this crap.  Albert R. Broccoli - producer for 35 years would never have filmed this monstrosity.  It breaks my heart, but i want this movie to fail at the boxoffice.  Maybe then the producers will come to their senses, that they have nothing to fear in competition with ""XXX"" and ""mission: impossible"".  This movie series has always had an audience.  Why try to become a clone of ""XXX""...which in itself is a clone of Bond?!  Dismal.",Die Another Day
500,rsaavedra,Disappointing,5,23 November 2002,"Pluses:1) Madona's song at the beginning.2) Halle Berry after coming out of the water, once she is walking on the sand, there she looks her best in the movie.3) Ms. Frost, she looks so gorgeous near the end in the sword scene on the plane.4) The Aston Martin.
Minuses:1) Halle Berry before coming out of the water, when Bond spots her with the binocular she is jumping in the water in a rather goofy way, not so sexy. That scene gave me an impression as if the movie was a comedy.2) Too long sword scene between the guys, and come on, this is not Crouching Tiger we are talking about, these guys are not that good with the swords to bore the audience for that long with it.3) Too long car chase on the ice, also rather childish car weaponry duels.4) Austin Powers made a good spoof of this, regardless it keeps happening: childish, and ridiculously, unnecessarily long and ineffective killing attempts by the bad guys, like the laser against Jinx.5) A few not too good special effects: bond surfing with the yellow parachute near the end clearly looks like the video of him cut & pasted on the video of the giant wave.  Also the red and yellow sports cars right when coming out from the back of the blazing big plane, they look quite badly edited.  After the cars had fallen (this is more of a blunder), the red Ferrari ended up just neatly nailed in a swampy area, with no shape alteration of the middle and back of the car structure, even though it had just fallen from miles high.6) Too long movie overall.",Die Another Day

With this movie series is going to more (stupid) style of last Charlie's Angels, Mission Impossible 2, etc. than previous movies. Bond has its style of ""fantasy"" with ironic look, but it's not stupid and such abstractic. ""Bad"" characters are bad and that's really bad. Although I love Hale Berry it don't act good in this movie, Rosamund Spike does her job well. In overall - it's sad that this anniversary movie lacks so many Bond's things. :(",Die Another Day
503,John Doe 316,Best Bond Ever? Maybe. Most Enjoyable? YES!,6,3 December 2002,"Today, I went to see the latest Bond film, Die Another Day. I have to say that I went in with very high expectations. While I'm not sure if these expectations were entirely met, I nevertheless was very impressed.The movie begins with what has to be the best opening in a Bond movie yet. Yes, even better than the boat chase through the Thames in The World Is Not Enough. It involves surfing, an explosive diamond trade and a thrilling hovercraft chase. This teaser does not end in the way you would expect. I had my reservations about the Madonna theme song upon originally hearing it, but it fits into the disturbingly different James Bond opening so well that all sins were immediately forgiven. Even Madonna's cameo in the film is only mildly painful to watch.Pierce Brosnan has completely settled into the role of James Bond. Now, since there is no longer the stigma of supporting ""the new guy"", I can comfortably say that Brosnan is the best Bond ever. He took Bond in new directions over the last movie, showing how he deals with betrayal, ghosts of the past and doomed love. In this movie, we find out how Bond deals with trauma. I can't give away how, sorry. You'll have to see for yourselves. Everyone is saying that, at 49, Pierce Brosnan is getting to old for Bond, and should pass the torch on to someone else. Well, after seeing him as good as ever in this movie, I think its safe to say he has another couple of films left in him.There was a lot of fuss about Halle Berry's appearance in Die Another Day. In a way, I think that all the hype is damaging. Sure, she gets to kick some ass, and is essentially the female Bond. However, I think she is merely the second best Bond girl, after Michelle Yeoh's Wai-Lin from Tomorrow Never Dies, of course discounting femme fatales such as Xenia Onatopp and Elektra King. She has to deal with some of the film's corniest lines, and her entrance from the sea is more The Spy Who Shagged Me than Dr. No, but Berry does a good job as Jinx, proving to be more than a match for Bond.As well as having great girls, another advantage the Brosnan films have had great villains. Sure, Elliot Carver was a bit too campy for some, but Trevelyen from Goldeneye and Renard from The World Is Not Enough were both great. As diamond-mining entrepenour Gustav Graves, Toby Stephens keeps up the top standard, while harking back to old-fashioned Bond villain values. Enough of the friends and lovers turning bad, this is your old-school megalomaniac with a big base ready to blow up. While the previously mentioned villains are great because they are really cool, Graves is great because he is an arrogant b*st*rd, and you want to see him burn. He is involved in a swordfight with Bond that will go down in history as one of the best battles of the series.Rosamund Pike, the other Bond girl, doesn't feature as heavily as Jinx. However, as undercover MI6 operative Miranda Frost, she is every bit as effective as Halle Berry is. Unfortunately, she doesn't really come into her own until well over halfway through the film, so it is possible that many audience members will overlook her performance in favour of Jinx.Die Another Day also delivers the goods when it comes to evil henchmen. Until now, the best Brosnan henchman had been a woman, who essentially killed her victims by shagging them to death (stand up please, Miss Onatopp). However, Rick Yune portrays Zao in this movie. The Korean soldier who is left with a diamond encrusted face because of Bond is easily on a par with the likes of Jaws and Oddjob. In fact, I think he could have been plausible as the film's main villain. Sadly, he's a bit underused in this movie. He is part of an awesome car-chase on ice, though.That's the principal cast, but what about the supporting players? Judi Dench continues to impress as M, displaying a cold, ruthless side this time round. John Cleese manages to exceed expectations as Q, giving Bond some witty put-downs. Moneypenny actually has a really funny scene in this movie, but I won't spoil it. Crime film favourite Michael Madsen even makes an appearance as Falco, head of the NSA. They may not play big roles in the movies, but Bond wouldn't be the same without them.The plot s always moving at a brisk pace, and doesn't let up until the end credits roll. The plot and gadgets are outlandish, even for a Bond film, but I suppose that's part of the fun, isn't it? Of course, it has its weak points. While a lot of the special effects are fantastic, some of them look blatantly fake, and you really wish they had been left out, because they detract from the film. I talked about how the opening hovercraft chase, the swordfight and the car chase, and how they are all fantastic. Well, this actually acts as a disadvantage. They are all so great that the climactic battle is unable to top them, and this make the perfectly necessary ending seem a bit of a waste. Maybe they could have found a way to end with the car chase.Some changes to the tried and tested formula mean that some Bond purists may be a bit disappointed. However, whether its the quintessential Bond movie or not, its certainly a great stand-alone action movie. It may not be the Best Bond movie of all time, but its certainly the most enjoyable.FINAL VERDICTAs a Bond fan, I highly enjoyed this movie. I also think that, while there are many in-jokes to please long-time fans, this is the perfect movie for people who aren't really into Bond, and want to see what all the fuss is about. Roll on Bond 21: here's to another 40 years!9/10",Die Another Day
504,contact_paul,Listen Carefully Bond,1,9 January 2003,"Lets get straight to the point.  This is by far the worst 'Bond' filmever made.  For those who are aware of the past 19 films, thereshould be no debate on this matter.From the opening titles (and the quite dreadful Madonna themetune, which has about as much to do with Bond as monogamy), Iknew that nothing could save this movie.  With a plot, more or lessstolen from 'The Man with the golden Gun' (a villain who imaginedhimself to be the opposite equal of Bond), with his plans to savethe world from an energy crisis by concentrating the sun's energy. A machine, which also has a useful by-product, of a high poweredlazer.With a maximum of 1000 words, it would be difficult to point out allthat is wrong with this film as a 'Bond' film.  Bond is not a superhero (he never has been), Villains are usually charismaticintellectuals, not just sadistic thrill seekers.  Bond girls do notusually (knowingly) help bond.  We know bond is technically anassassin, but this is a fact that has never been pointed out, exceptpainfully in  this film.  Also (perhaps no coincidence given wherethe money comes from) the painful 'pro American' theme runningthrough the film is totally out of character.It could be, or should be, that Bond has reached the end of theline.  One of the elements which makes a Bond film special is theinnocence of the time (60's to early 70's).  The lack of specialeffects, which made the stunt scenes and action scene real, andtherefore believable.All of this is without mentioning the lackluster sexual innuendo andsuggestion that Bond sleeps with every female he meets, is thescript writer pre-school one has to wonder.  Previously Bond'sinnuendo's were smart and witty, while his sexual practises wheresubtle in the execution.  We (meaning people with more than amodicum of intelligence) do not need to be shown people havingsex, to know that is what is happening.In a time where the psychological drama is a popular genre ismore popular than ever, why do the producers have to make a'Pop' action film, where effects drive the plot, while the plot is ainvisible as an invisible Aston Martin.Only one for those who don't know what Bond, means.

By spectacular, I mean non-stop spectacular - this film does not slow down!The plot is good, Gustav Graves makes a cool bad guy, Jinx = a tasty Bond girl and generally this is definately the best Brosnan Bond at least.It was good to see a bit of the if-you're-not-going-to-help-then-get-out-of-my-way Bond that turned up in Licsence to Kill near the start. Interesting to see Bond doing deals with Chinese intelligence of all people to help get at Zao.Someone was talking about there being a vat of Bonds. That's something I've been trying to work out myself. I'll take Connery-Bond dyeing his hair to becoming Moore-Bond in the early 70s.But to go from Moore to Dalton? That doesn't just require hair dye, that requires MI6 owning a fountain of youth - either that or the Bond who was arund till 1985 is NOT the same guy as the one who turned up afterwards.I'd love to get an official line on that!But anyway, I have seen IMDB reviews for 'The Bourne Identity'. I have seen IMDB reviews for XXX. Elements of both seem to say one thing 'Bond should retire' or something along those lines.I have seen the Bourne Identity.

507,filmbuff-63,Red wine with fish. That should have told me something.,3,23 November 2002,"Let me say, right off the bat, I am a James Bond fan. Have been since I saw Diamonds Are Forever the first time it was shown on network. I've read all the books (Fleming, Amis, Gardner, Benson) and own all the special edition DVD's. I've watched every bonus feature on all of them. I love the series and think that Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson are doing a fabulous job continuing what Cubby (and Harry Saltzman) started.That said, I have to admit I was devastated by DIE ANOTHER DAY.  There were moments that were among the best moments of the series, but when I start thinking, ""You know, Moonraker was really plausible compared to this..."" I know I'm headed for a railway wreck.What I liked: Pierce Brosnan. Always liked him. Always will. The highlight of the movie, as he should be.The way the formula was shaken, but not stirred. Okay that sounded stupid but it's true. The first 45 minutes are not the typical Bond formula. In fact, the pre-title sequence may have been the most action packed ever!The music was great. I really like David Arnold's Bond scores. Almost makes me forget John Barry. Almost.Rosamund Pike. Fresh and beautiful. Truly talented.Judy Dench and Samantha Bond are wonderful as always.The action sequences were very nicely done. Vic Armstrong proves again that he is the best Second Unit Director in the business.Halle Berry. 'Nuff said.What I didn't like: Almost everything else.The parasurfing scene looked ludicrous.The script was adolescent. If I hadn't seen photos of Neil Purvis and Robert Wade I'd swear they were high school dorks who wrote this script while they indulged in PORKY'S marathons.  Remember that horrid line about Christmas coming only once a year in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH? Imagine that times 50! I could hear the ten year olds snickering throughout the entire film!Is this the worst Bond film ever? No. THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and A VIEW TO A KILL still tie for that honor. Will I see it again in the theater? Tough to say. I'll buy the DVD for the extras if nothing else. Maybe Michael Wilson will do an audio commentary where he explains the decisions they made.I must say: Purvis and Wade also cowrote THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, which I believe is superior to DIE ANOTHER DAY in every way (except Denise Richards). I've read their first draft screenplay, before Bruce Feirstein rewrote it AND LIKED IT! They're not hacks. I have no idea what happened here.Richard Maibaum was the writer for most of the first 16 bond films. He seems to have imbued Bond with a sense of class (the films, not the character) that is missing from the latest films. Feirstein seemed to add some of that in his scripts, but not to the same degree.Michael Wilson cowrote 5 films with Maibaum, and 4 of the 5 were wonderful. Mister Wilson, I know you're a busy man, but some of us would like you to get back to the typewriter.I know this is the 21 century now, and a 60's era Bond film is not what we should expect, but I think we sometimes need to ask ourselves a question: ""What would Sean do?""  We now have the man who could be the best Bond ever, but the scripts that won't allow him to get there.  Imagine Brosnan in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. It's easy. He'd be great!Mister Brosnan says he'll do another Bond film, which is great!  This time around lets give him a script worthy of his abilities and the Bond tradition. As for DIE ANOTHER DAY?

However, those moments only made me think of better days.When Bond goes to Cuba I thought, ""That's something Connery could have done back in the day."" It would have been brilliant and timely to have had Connery go to Cuba (even though none of his films have taken place there.) I thought the sword fight was a classic duel way past its due in the series. We've seen Bond fight with all manner of gadgets, guns and fisticuffs but a fencing match is really perfect for the character. Brosnan pulls it off with his physicality but it could have used a little more grace. Another ""Connery moment"" that could have been.The total outrageousness of the plot, of course, reminded me of the worst of the Bond films, particularly ""Moonraker"", and perhaps that was the point of reference for this anniversary film. I guess it should be of little surprise that both this film and ""Moonraker"" represent the highest financial achievements in the series while simultaneously representing the lowest artistic achievements.The CG effects were terrible. The charm of the Bond films is the believability of the props and action. Using models and practical effects make Bond appear to be at least somewhat human and provide tension that a CG effect simply can't generate. The worst offense was the para-sail, followed by the plane demise at the end. They both looked like straight-to-video knock-offs.Brosnan is a good Bond but he needs better material. And for better material the series needs better writers. I don't know what happened to Michael G. Wilson. Maybe his co-writing credits on FYEO, OP, AVAK, LD and LTK weren't as deserved as they appear since the new films have none of the wit of Richard Maibaum's sure hand.

510,deepcheck,much better than I had hoped,7,3 December 2002,"I must confess that I don't understand the pure hatred for this film that seems to be out there.  It's as if that people are either convinced that anything older than they are is automatically High Culture, and everything else is nothing but cheap knockoffs.  Mystery of the universe...In any case, I quite enjoyed this latest installment of the Bond movies.  I thought this film began brilliantly with Bond's unexpected capture and disgrace.  From there, the little surprises kept on returning, from the villain himself to Zao's car.  The dialogue was delightfully tongue-in-cheek, something that TWINE's dialogue was not, and the plot was no less ridiculous than any other Bond movie I have seen, though it did not remotely compare to the brilliance of TND or the unfortunately mispresented ingenuity of TWINE. I grant that there was much corniness to behold, such as this year's gimmick for the Bond car, but for His sake people, it's a Bond movie!  If you all can accept Bond having sex in fifty feet of water in Octopussy (which I should point out is physically impossible since you cannot remain buoyant if you don't breathe, and your lungs, brain, and eardrums would either bleed or explode depending on which way you were headed) then you should be able to accept Bond simulating a cardiac arrest, which is at least possible.All in all, this was an enjoyable entertaining movie, which is all it was meant to be.  If someone wants to see a deep, intelligent spy story, they should read Susan Isaac's ""Shining Through"", though the Michael Douglas movie was only so-so.

Pierce Brosnan has come as close to getting Bond back to the level of Sean Connery as anyone could and I hope we can look forward to him as Bond until he gets tired of this role.  The movie as a whole was entertaining and I do tend to prefer the Bond films with more action but this one goes a little over the top. And although I love Halle Berry, and not just because she is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses working today, but she just wasn't believable as a tough government agent. I have no problem with her being there as a glamorous beautiful woman Bond hooks up with but watching her run with a a gun was pretty amusing.

513,NS_writings,The first post-9/11 Bond,9,27 May 2021,"People trashing this movie are really missing the point. In many ways, it's a product of its generation: most movies released between 2000 and 2003 had exaggerated stunts and abused of CGI, speed ramps and other modern technologies, most of them with a lot of success: 'Mission: Impossible 2', 'The Fast And The Furious', 'Charlie's Angels'. No wonder why 'Die Another Day' tried to adopt this style, much like other Bond films tried to capture the zeitgeist of the time. Also, take into consideration how this is one of the few occasions 007 is treated as a government asset more than a hero, stripped from his 00 status when suspected of spilling information under duress. Ian Fleming himself touted espionage as ""a dirty business"" and we do really see that here. And the villain, Colonel Moon, is one of the few really political leaders the cinematic 007 has faced. What he does to infiltrate enemy territory is compared to what the perpetrators of 9/11 did. ""The West will shake with fear"", is exactly what we heard back in 2001 and Moon here is saying it. We also have the first proper active mole at MI6 Headquarters in a Bond film, too. Someone no-one suspects from. And Pierce Brosnan simply gives his more demanding performance as James Bond.

This particular outing shows us that he does have limits though and doesn't always come out on top of certain situations.  He's actually ""human.""  Pierce was born to play Bond, just as Sean was!

515,Alexeb110,I'm disappointed again...(SPOILERS),4,2 January 2003,"Well, I knew just from the trailers that this Bond wouldn't be too great, but I was surprised. It was terrible. It was dragged down but too much campy action, a supergeneric villain and bad bad bad sexual innuendo. For example- Halle Berry comes out of the water, walks up the beach and after a bit of talking asks James what he does for a living. He says ""I'm an Ornothologist."" and she glances below his waist and says: ""That's a mouthful."" ...GROAN. It was worse than I could have possibly imagined. Bond hits on women, and they hit on him, and innuendo will naturally result. But that was like taking the great bat of innuendo and hitting everyone in the audience with it, while yelling: ""LOOK! HERE'S A SEX JOKE!"" and it stunk. So, you put that with an absurd plot which contains a sort of giant sun-ray-of-death, a car with an invisibility device (Yes, the Aston Martin can make itself invisible) and you get ""Die Another Day""- a campy ""superbond"" with all the Bond dials turned up to 11 on a scale of ten. Just too much, and it was plain stupid.5/10",Die Another Day
516,agent_squirrel,"The name's fetched, far-fetched.",6,1 December 2002,"In the tradition of most Bond films, this movie has plenty of what we're expecting from a Bond film. The storyline is a bit out there in terms of technology, even more so than most Bondians are used to (That is if you forget about Moonraker). While the beginning of the movie was gritty and realistic during the torture scene, I found the rest of the movie to be far-fetched. That's not to say it isn't good. But they could've toned it down a bit. I think they fooled most of the viewers and made it convincing by saying words like ""polymer"", ""DNA reconstruction technology"" and ""television"".

It has now come to special effects, cool cars, crazy gizmos and chicks that Bond has become synonomis with.  With this installment of Bond, it draws uncomfortably close to the spin off Austin Power and Our Man Flint films.  I mean, they go as far as to put a giant ""Lazer"" into space which has been dubbed ""Icarus"" which will harness the suns power to shoot a superheated beam at the surface of the earth, unless, the earth pays us, a heft ransom.  hmmmmm, let's see, didn't Dr. Evil already teach us that space lazers don't work??  If not, then how about Blofeld in Diamonds are Forever, or Alec Trevelyan in GoldenEye?? AHHHH, havn't we have enough space lazers yet?? Diamond-faced Zao isn't scoring any point with me either.  These villians seem to grow in  idiocy along with their inventions. I long for the good old days when Bond was about being a spy, not a one-man army.  We've reached the point where I no longer eagerly await the next Bond film, for I know there is no way that it will in this day in age live up to the Sean Connery Bond.  Not a prayer. As the plots grow more far out and idiotic, the explosions get bigger, his dodads become more unbelievable, and the overall depth of the character and plot grow thin. Sad.

519,lewboskian,You gotta be kidding me,2,28 July 2005,"My mother insisted that I watch this movie for about two years, but after seeing the previews, I never really felt impressed by what I saw. Finally I caved in and watched it when I was visiting her. She told me it was her all-time favorite James Bond movie. My parents raised me on James Bond, so naturally I took her word for it. The opening sequence was just embarrassing. The surfing scene seemed to be 1 or 2 shots looped over and over again ala Sir Lancelot attacking Swamp Castle in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.The chase sequence on the hover craft was the only reason I gave this film 2 starts instead of one. However, I did not find it at all interesting to see James Bond captured after the beginning of the movie. When the heck has that ever happened? And what kind of a spy would endure 14 months of torture without opting to kill himself first? You'd also think that after years of great service to the British Government, M wouldn't be such a b*&^h to him and that they would make every effort to get his release. The rest of the film is ludicrous. I think the one liners in this film were a result of the screenplay writer sitting in on junior high slumber parties and conversations at high school cafeterias.Granted, there are always gimmicks and gadgets used in these films that haven't been invented, and near impossible escapes are common, but in the previous films they seemed plausible. Not so in this film. Invisible cars? Luring an arms dealer's helicopter to land on the coast of Korea rather than the army base it was looking for thanks to James Bond's make-shift satellite dish/homing beacon? His pilots must have been drunk or couldn't distinguish an army compound from a forest. Bond having a heart attack in the American Army's hospital ward, being dead for two minutes, then getting revived and knowing exactly what fight moves to use to subdue the hospital staff, escaping the prison in pajamas with no weapons, then swimming from a a large shipping vessel to Tokyo? How much can the human heart take? And let us not forget the sword fighting scene in a British fencing club. You really think members that pay thousands of dollars a year would just stand by idly while two men destroy the club with sabers without asking them to stop or contacting the police? What, were they enthralled and thinking, ""Oh look, its James Bond! Good show old man! Good form! Dash his brains out!"" Hale Berry was one of the most dull and unsophisticated of all the Bond women ever to grace the screen. Madonna's cameo was pathetic. Her dialogue was so incredibly bland that I think she used Guy Richie's influence to make the director give Madonna permission to write her own lines. After meeting with Q and getting stocked up on supplies, I had seen enough and fell asleep. Pop this in for a good nap or a good laugh.",Die Another Day
520,Jogilius,Typical Bond elements - and a slight promise for something more.,5,12 September 2008,"What are (many) Bond movies made of? My experience from Bond movies is lacking in terms of most of the older Bonds but some rules seem to apply to most Brosnan movies: - Visits to exotic places that have been artificially crafted to the plot. - Action that makes you yawn. - Bad guys that just don't seem to be able to aim with their sustained fire. - Some kind of over the top megalomaniac plan from a bad guy. - An evil yet beautiful woman, whose motives make absolutely no sense. - Bond doing ""the bond girl"" twice and some other girl once.All in all, the entire thing is usually somewhat entertaining, but still disappointing in many ways. That results in a contradictory feeling towards the whole movie. Die Another day may show a little bit more promising in the beginning, but it transforms into typical bondish action syrup towards the end.Very mediocre. Overall rating something between 5 and 6.",Die Another Day
521,frimp13,wretched nonsense,2,19 November 2002,"Fortunately, I won free tickets for a sneak preview of Die Another Day, and didn't have to pay any money to waste 2 hours of my life.It was awful - the worst movie I've seen all year.  The opening credits sequence is the worst I've ever seen - largely because the Madonna song is not only awful, but also the most incongruous Bond song ever, and they play the entire thing while this silly thermal imaging (or somesuch FX) music video about Bond being tortured plays in the background.  The movie's plot doesn't even make an effort to be marginally plausible or original - and that's even within the unrealistic, paint-by-numbers world of Bond films.
Brosnan seems to just be going through the motions at this point.  He delivers his lines in a serious tone, but without conviction.  You can tell he's getting tired of saying the obligatory ""Bond, James Bond"" over and over again.The fight scenes are as unrealistic as they've been since Goldeneye.  I realize that Bond movies aren't intended to be hyper-realistic, but reality can only be toyed with so much before it seems pointless to even bother with pretending to follow the laws of physics.  Something blows up every few seconds (probably to distract the audience from the fact that the fight makes no sense and the outcome doesn't matter) and apparently dozens of people with automatic weapons are GUARANTEED TO MISS if their target is running or otherwise moving.  The bad guy naturally has a sports car sitting around with as many gadgets and weapons as Bond's car - including a pintle-mounted gatling gun that fires just inches over his head, but somehow manages not to burn or deafen him.  And of course Bond is as good at fencing (!?!) and other forms of sword-fighting as a professional fencing champion.The dialogue is awful and sorely lacking in cleverness.  The puns are cheap, contrived, and sadly predictable.  And the blunt attempts at double entendres are clearly designed to be so blatantly obvious that even your average West Virginian would realize that they have a sexual subtext. Actually, it's the real dialogue that becomes the subtext - some of the exchanges would make no sense if taken at face value, which undermines the whole point of double entendre humor.The Bond girls try so hard to be sexual that it's embarassing.  Halle Berry is a sexy actress, but the movie hits you over the head with her sexuality so much (her slow-mo emergence from the waves in a bikini is laughably unsubtle) that she actually seems less attractive by the end of the film. You know it's gone over the top when, in the final fight, one girl (for no apparent reason) shows up in a one-strap sports bra-type thing, and the other one starts stripping *while* she's fighting.It was a painful self-parody of a self-parodying movie series. 2/10.",Die Another Day

523,alexthegreat87,Balloon gets big put pops,6,23 November 2002,"Die Another Day is a very complex film. Just as the character James Bond, the movie changes from time to time- rather drastically. In the beginning to the middle, the movie was a true gem. I thought that the movie was indeed a great homage to the old Bond films of the past and deserved the ""Bond 20"" label or anniversary. The fencing sword battle was a classic action sequence that no doubtedly cannot be topped in any Bond film in a one on one confrontation. The only one on one battle that comes to mind was the 006-007 fight in ""Goldeneye"" but the sword battle was more bloodier and shockingly realistic. Then after that, the movie switched to Iceland and from there it went downhill and off into some fantasy world that no one can really describe. The Ice Palace which Gustav Graves owned was filmed beautifully and brings back memories of the lavish sets of classic villians but it was far too unrealistic. Invisible cars, laser beams, and DNA face-morphers were just far too much to swallow in a mere short period of time. Plus, dreadfully to say; many people think Bond movies are too slow-paced, but this movie was too fast-paced following the trip to Iceland. The camera working and so forth was a ""XXX"" kind of feeling which quite honestly, true Bond fans would not want to see. DAD became literally a teenager's delight and rather insulted the older Bond fans with its direction at the youth. Sure it was entertaining but definitely did not pack the same whallop as it did in the first hour. Taking a look at the technology it seems like old Bond movies. It is which those who forecast the future for technology up ahead. The virtual system is believable but the invisible car... I don't think so. The gadgets are good, as always, and the new Q couldn't of made a better entrance. In the movie, Bond didn't really have to use that much gadgetery, rather rely on himself which was good to see. As for the villains, Yao and Gustav Graves, including Colonel Moon all made wonderful bad guys. Probably the best ensemble. Gustav had the cockiness and suavity that can be matched by no other. He made a striking resemblence to the physical aspects of 006 and matched equally in Bond's skill, as you can tell in the sword sequence. Yao also had a good physical appearance and delivered some of the best memories of his looks and coldness. Another bad guy who I will not name was really good also who broke James' heart. Don't worry she will get the equal in return.Overall, a decent Bond movie. Not the best of Brosnan's quadruple- it kind of pops and goes into a tailspin at the end. But the first half is worth your money.6/10",Die Another Day
524,molefsky,"A good, not great Bond adventure.",8,1 December 2002,"This is the first Brosnan as Bond film I've seen. He is probably the best Bond since Roger Moore. The opening sequence is terrific. All the special effects are very good. Halle Berry as Jinx, the capable NSA(?) agent, and John Cleese as Q, are excellent. Judy Dench is not right as M, and I didn't care for Smantha Bond as Moneypenny.It's a typical Bond plot with the usual bad puns and double entendres. The plot takes Bond from North Korea, to Hong Kong, to Cuba, to London, to Iceland. This time the evil genius is a nefarious North Korean colonel.Four things I did not like. First, it was very dark. We actually see Bond being tortured. Also, we see blood. I can't recall another Bond film with blood being shown. Usually there is a suggestion of blood and torture off screen. Second, the theme song by Madonna. It was just awful. More like screeching than singing. Third, with all the references to previous Bond films, I think the producers, writers, etc. are taking themselves way too seriously. Fourth, it was about 10 minutes too long.I thought the episodes in Hong Kong and Cuba were the film's best. Also, the sword fight was very enjoyable.In the pantheon of Bond films I'd rate it about average. Not as good as ""From Russia With Love"" or ""Goldfinger"" better than ""Octopussy"" or ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" It is worth seeing.",Die Another Day
525,Equalizer90-1,Should have made this film... another day.,2,3 November 2005,"Die Another Day is absolute garbage. I really feel sorry for Pierce Brosnan because I believe he wasn't far off being the greatest Bond but unfortunately he came around a period where the scripts were plain awful. I don't include Goldeneye in that of course.I don't even know where to begin criticising this film. It was obviously part of the big 40th Anniversary of Bond at the time of release and I think it was common knowledge that bits and bobs of the last 19 films were to be included. Those parts were the only thing that kept me interested in this movie and even at that I had a yawn every so often. It's all very well saying that Bond works well because of the mixture of gadgets and girls etc but it was clear to me they needed a proper storyline and a proper villain. Toby Stephens was just lost throughout the whole film. It was difficult to remember he was Bonds adversary. If they were thinking about recreating the Zorrin character in some form Toby Stephens fell way below par. As far as the storyline goes, even the back of the DVD doesn't explain it. All I can realistically remember about the film is that Bond gets set up and works outside the confines of MI6 because they don't believe him. What happened for the next two hours apart from the rip offs of previous Bond films is a mystery to me. Apparently New Zealand Director Tamahori was confident in taking Bond into the new millennium. In that case he must be trying to kill off Bond soon because this was a major step in the execution of the slick stylish Secret Agent. Final note, Producer Michael G Wilson stated that there were two elements to a Bond film, namely character and a story. No character struck me and I think someone lost the story in that expensive Ice Palace. It was disappointing to hear Pierce Brosnan had been dropped for the role of Bond but in any case here's hoping any future Bond film puts this monstrosity to rest.",Die Another Day

REVIEW: Let me put your fears at rest: this Bond rocks! From opening to close, you will be on the edge of your seat. As a Bond fanatic, I especially loved the clever references to all the classic Bond films. While I won't spoil them for you, I'll just say that every Bond movie is at least referred to once (some more then that, although I'm sure I missed something.) Everybody does fantastic in their roles, and I'd be more then happy if Halle Berry did get her own movie as ""Jinx."" Toby Stephens and Rick Yune do a good job of portraying the newest Bond villians, and John Cleese has assumed the role of Q nicely. While we will always miss Desmond, Cleese was the perfect choice to take over the role as his exchanges with Brosnan provide some of the best comic relief in the film. The action sequences are spectacular, especially the sword fight between Bond and Gustav Graves (Stephens.) The sound for this movie rocks (I was in a THX-equipped theater, so it sounded even better.) Try to see this at a higher-scale movie theater with excellent sound systems, so you can feel the explosions. My biggest complaint was that the movie went too quick. The story could've slowed down a little so you could learn more about the characters (especially Michael Madsen as Falco.) As with a fine wine (and all other Bond flicks), this will get better with age. What makes Bond so great is you can watch most of his films (sans ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""A View To A Kill"") and still like it just as much the first time you watched it. While it is too early to determine if this is THE best Bond film (I still really loved ""GoldenEye,"" as 006 was the perfect villian,) I can assure you it will place very highly on your lists as it did mine. Overall, stop reading this review and go to the theater, NOW!!! Bond and action-adventure fans alike, this movie will not dissapoint. I just hope it can get the attention it deserves, having to contend with a certain boy wizard (the overrated Harry Potter.)FINAL SCORE: 9 out of 10 (Awesome Bond flick! One of the best in the entire series! 007 has no equal...take that Triple X!)",Die Another Day
527,westernbuff,The worst in the Bond series,2,12 June 2008,"I will never give any Bond film a one but this comes close. I understand it basically borrowed scenes from every movie to celebrate and honor 40 years of James Bond, but this really does nothing. Icarus? They use the plot from a bad Bond movie (Diamonds Are Forever). Why reuse something that didn't work the first time? They go to Cuba (already done before). John Cleese is horrible as the new Q (I'm glad they didn't have him in Casino Royale; it made the movie so much better!). The whole rouge agent deal (this time its Miranda Frost) does not work at all. Its been done too many times. The CGI effects really ruin this movie. We are not expecting The Matrix (which was a lousy movie IMO) so why do we get it here? Halle Berry is good if you don't pay attention to anything she says in the film. The car chase scenes....cars chasing each other on a ice rink? Thats totally unrealistic in my book. I don't expect much realism in a Bond film but this leaves us with nothing at all. Judi Dench does this movie no credit either. She is ruining the series. Please bring a man in to play M., like it was in the (good) older films. The only one that was good since Dench picked up this role was Goldeneye, and that was because of Brosnan and Sean Bean (excellent villain). Fleming has to be rolling over in his grave.The part that gets me is the actors that play the bad guys. The Colonels' father and Zao especially. Very well cast, very believable. What a shame that they go to waste to the rest of the film. The CIA director guy is well cast too. He makes you dislike him more than M.! Ironically, one of the best parts is the sword fight between Graves and Bond (ironic because it was a tribute to the fight between Bond and Cha in Moonraker, which is considered by many to be the weakest Bond film). Very good scene also where Bond comes off the waves after Graves tries to Kill him with Icarus. 100 foot wall crashing down and him swooping up with that look on his face. Just awesome!

530,jatinder377,A fantastic Bond Movie,9,1 April 2009,"After wathcing Die Another Day I felt this was Brosnans best bond movie so far. The director changed the rules for bond within reason but without detracting from the normal formula. I really loved the opening sequence and in particular the bit where Brosnan is being tortured it was different but also intriguing at the same time as it added something new to the film. There were some over the top scenes e.g the scene surfing in water but don't let that ruin a really great bond film. I can't say what it was but something in this film really made be root for Brosnan as a bond, maybe it was the way he was betrayed or disowned by his own government it again added something more into the film. Brosnan does an excellent job as Bond and as much as people have hyped up Daniel Craig Brosnan is a overall better bond (even better then Connery) and here are the reasons why:1) He pulls of the action sequences well as James Bond 2) He can pull of the James Bond part as well i.e Looking good in a suit (which is something that Daniel Craig can't do) 3) He portrays a much more realistic bond but without being to heartless while Daniel Craig is simply heartlessThe other thing I must mention is that for his age Brosnan still looks in fantastic shape and pulls of the film really well. Overall a great addition to the bond movies",Die Another Day
531,sohmflooring,So good!,10,26 July 2005,"And it is that...and more! It is very good movie making on almost all counts. Except for one scene between Brosnan and Berry, the continuity and editing is near perfect. There is a sword fighting scene that is the best I've seen. The continuity and editing put you in the middle of the action and there are no noticeable editing goofs to pull you out of it. Actors, extras, swords, props, sounds; positioning of all of these elements is so carefully executed that it appears as if the entire thing was filmed on the spot and was done in live action real time. The same thing can be said about other scenes and action sequences in this film, but the sword fight is the best. It is great to see a film that takes editing and continuity seriously. It proves that the filmmakers were doing their best to make a good product.This film has everything a Bond film should have; sex, violence, action, humor and passion. It is the culmination of twenty previous Bond films. And that is a problem. How will Eon Productions top this? Brosnan was fantastic as Bond in this film. This is his best portrayal of James Bond. His fantastic good looks have matured and his performance has a confident air about it that will be hard for any new James Bond to match. There are no misfits in casting. Halle Berry, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Rick Yune, John Cleese, Judy Dench, Will Yun Lee, Kenneth Tsang, Emilio Echevarria, Mikhail Gorevoy, Lawrence Makoare, Colin Salmon, Samantha Bond and the supporting cast...they all do a good job.This film is the gold standard of Bond films. Expect it to be considered a classic, very much in the same way Goldfinger is. But this film is much better than Goldfinger. In fact, it is much better than all the other Bond films.It is that good!",Die Another Day
532,levendis,"Strong Action, Weak Plot",6,2 December 2002,"I had been saying that it was time the Bond franchise was put out to pasture. The stereotypical rich playboy ladies man that was James Bond really no longer has a place in our new century. And on one hand, I'm completely right. On the other, however, I'm completely wrong.What this Bond film lacks is a cohesive storyline. All starts out well, but the plot quickly becomes muddled with too much science fiction and wispy plot threads that do more to distract than entertain. Halle Berry as Jinx plays more as a Robin to Brosnan's Batman, and serves as a reminder that Bond has never needed a sidekick, no matter how attractive.To make matters worse, the villain in this story reaches to cartoonish heights more suited to Dr. Evil than a mainstream Bond nemesis. The story twists are telegraphed and unconvincing. There is no character development to be had, and anyone outside the Bond regulars is nothing more than a cardboard stand-in.That being said, there are some saving graces to the film. The opening action scene is superb. Berry, in addition to being feverishly attractive, sets the screen on fire with Brosnan as they speak in sexual subtext outside an open-air bar in Havanna. The interplay between Bond and Dame Judi Dench as M is and always has been one of the better parts of the series. And, of course, the stunts and special effects are superb, with the exception of one scene which will stretch even the most elastic of disbeliefs.This brings us, finally, to Bond. Pierce Brosnan fits the role better than any since Connery: he has the panache, the swagger, the devil-may-care, the charm, the attitude, and the looks. Most importantly he is convincing in the role, and he gives life to the character. The most telling scenes are his interaction with M and, of course, the scene at the Hong Kong Yacht Club -- a beautiful sequence that only a true Bond could pull off convincingly.While this film was not entirely as good as I had hoped it would be, it was certainly not as bad as it could have been. Still, it would be nice to have this mix of action and hi-tech gadgets inside of an intelligent, brilliantly written story. Perhaps putting Bond out to stud was a bit premature -- he still seems to be getting his share of the action.Seven secret decoder rings out of ten.",Die Another Day

Many here have commented on the lackluster CGI (Jinx's dive, hanging rocket sled, kite surfing, etc.) but it's easy to forgive those things BECAUSE it's a Bond film.  The rest of it makes up for those shortcomings.I liked the references to the earlier films - Q's old gadgets, Union Jack parachute, Halle Berry's exit from the water, laser beams used on strapped-down people, and countless others.  I also liked the ornithologist reference...  I think only a few other people in the theatre caught that one.  Our resident Bond ""expert"" here at work actually missed that one!Of course nearly every scene in the film was packed with unreal, unbelievable action, but that's what these films are all about.  Of course, you're thinking, ""Yeah, right....  like that could really happen!""  but you're thinking that with a smile on your face, right? :-)For me, watching these films is about escapism.

534,Big Bo,So-So outing for Bond,5,23 November 2002,"*#*Minor Possible Spoilers*#*
     I can suspend disbelief for any number of ridiculous gadgets in a Bond film but some stuff in this film look more like technical gaffes than anything else.  Don't get me wrong, I dig the invisible car and all but can I believe that a clinic capable of completely altering a person's DNA to change their identity can't figure out how to remove high price shrapnel from Zao's face? That an agency still stinging about Philby and the Cambridge group would do such a superficial background check that they'd miss an agent's connection to the son of a Politburo member?  Did anybody ever hear of autorotation? It's an amazing safety feature on choppers.  I know evil henchmen are supposed to be stupid but no idiot is going to stand around on the step while An ice palace on a frozen lake gets deliberately melted.  They weren't even relevant to the scene (I think the union set up the gig).    On the other hand, Brosnan once again delivers a solid performance and Cleese seems to be the perfect replacement for Q.  Rosamund Pike is an excellent ice queen and Halle's Jinx is adequate.

I've been a fan of the series since I was 15 & I think Pierce Brosnan has done very well up to now (he's the suavest Bond since Connery & he's also a good actor!) but this one is weak. Seems the emphasis is mostly on producing costly FX that don't really look that good to begin with. This is also at the expense of a stronger, more original story. Ok, I admit that the series has been eye-candy for 40 years but most of the other stories (Dr No, Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, TWINE, etc.) had WEIGHT to them. Some of the action sequences are fun & a visit to Q's lab is always a joy but this time the improbable romance (Bond & Jinx) is underdeveloped & comes off as implausible, the villains aren't very menacing, & the jet that serves as the Graves' base of operations LOOKS like a CGI fake. I know that they can do much better than this.",Die Another Day
536,mwories,Very very Bond...,8,13 December 2002,"This movie is one of the better Bond movies I have seen. I started watching Bond movies since the late seventies and eighties and this one really brings the atmosphere back that I have missed in the 90's Bond. Lot's of death defying Bond action, a very good depiction of the bad mastermind with his ruthless and scary helper, mixed with beautiful women (Frost is hot!), glamour, international spy games and lots of technology, and last but not least, lots of good old British humor.Don't go there for believable action or possible technology. This is entertainment; let it suck you in; free your mind. This is Bond's world. Everything is possible. Good entertainment. Well done!",Die Another Day
537,arno.f@hetnet.nl,Brosnan's got Bond in his fingers now!,8,10 April 2003,"First thing that came to mind thinking about this film is that Brosnan really has made the character of Bond his own with this picture.For the real James Bond fan this movie is full of subtle directions to former Bond movies. Halle Berry rising out of the sea like Ursula Andress did in ""Dr. No"" for example, Berry being the most beautiful Bond girl by the way probably since Andress.When watching a Bond movie there is one thing very important, don't try to look for a realistic, very dramatic story. Bond=Bond, which means loads of action, stunts, one-liners, overall just simple, but excellent entertainment, and Die Another Day is again a perfect example of that.",Die Another Day

Brosnan is awesome as 007 in this movie, and both of the female leads are stunning (and the lucky git beds them both ;P) I'm not gonna go into any of the movie as it would take far too long.  This film is very sexually charged, with lots of great one-liners and plenty of flirting.Overall a fantastic movie and one of the best Bond films about. See it now!!!",Die Another Day
541,pretzel man,Was that a Bond film?,6,3 December 2002,"Although definitely not amongst the worst of the Bond franchise, Die Another Day (hereafter known as DAD) was certainly mediocre. Everything about it just seemed a tad off, from the over-criticised theme song to Halle Berry's part in the film. And the technology/extreme sports. Ugh. DAD appeared to be desperately fending off xXx as the supremo in the 'secret agent' world, although frankly the less they imitated from that calamity the better. Bond surfing. Twice. With cheesy CGI. The villain's 'supersuit' which had NO relevance WHATSOEVER with the plot apart from (spoiler) his demise. Cheesy laser CGI. The whole DNA thing. Cheesy CGI. You get the point. Nevertheless, DAD did have its good points. The opening scene in North Korea, the concept of Bond being captured was intriguing (despite groans from the die-hard fans); and the Zao  guy with diamonds in his face was far more threatening than the foppish Gustav Graves. The car chase on ice, the sword-fight in the club and Miranda Frost, all good. One gets the feeling that DAD didn't know where it wanted to go. The aforementioned struggle to impersonate Vin Diesel; the overkill of homage to previous Bond films; trying to be a cutting-edge real-life political thriller; giving Bond human qualities through failure; elevating a female character, Jinx to the same level as Bond (though arguably already established in TND with Michelle Yeoh). Still, you have to give DAD its due. The acting was solid, apart from *cough*Madonna*cough the crappy little cameo that was there for...pleasing Mr Ritchie? No idea. The action scenes, though rare, equalled those in Goldeneye and the opening scene in TND. The women, excellent. A pity that the Frost character wasn't fleshed out more, could have had a more interesting clash between her and Jinx. Gadgets, overkill as said before. All in all your average slapdash Bond movie, on par with TND, not as bad as TWINE but yet to surpass Goldeneye, which, let's face it, was and IS going to be the last excellent Bond film. Die Another Day gets six, six and a half out of ten.",Die Another Day

After that, the film is great again. The final battle is very good but could do with a little less Halle Berry. But, to be fair to her, she was a lot less anoying than I feared she would be.Another thing I was a little weary of was the invisible car but, again, I didn't find it that bad. I respect Lee Tamahori's style of direction and his slightly different approach to a Bond film but towards the end of the movie, he gets a little carried away with the ""bullet-time/Matrix style"" movements. In the big picture, it's still a Bond movie and doesn't, by any means, ruin the series. James Bond WILL Return!!!",Die Another Day

And, Halle Berry's acting prowess were non-existent in this flick.",Die Another Day
546,niemi86,"Not bad, but... (with many many spoilers)",6,26 November 2002,"spoilersI enjoyed this film, it being the first Bond I've seen in a theater (having just fallen in love with the series this summer), but I found a couple issues with it.  First, the opening title was awful.  I saw this with my mother, and she had to ask me (twice) if the music was supposed to skip like it does.  Next, this is almost definitely going to be Brosnan's last Bond. Much as I love him, you can tell that he's not as young as he used to be (look at some of the close-ups of his face).For all the hype given to Halle Barry for being as tough as Bond, she has very few lines and nothing that would count as a conversation.  Rosamund Pike, as Miranda Frost, almost had more lines than Halle.  She certainly was on screen longer, and did a better job acting.  And all the advertisement as Halle keeping up just as well as Bond, more so than any previous Bond girls? That was a laugh.  Michelle Yeoh, from `Tomorrow Never Dies' in my opinion, was much tougher than Halle, and the fact that she could type on a keyboard in Chinese made her seem so much more intelligent.The sword fight between Bond and Gustav was excellent, though I'm not sure what provoked them to become so violent.  I also liked the scene where Bond walked into the Chinese hotel and the manager (?) greeted him and asked if he would like his usual suite.  Brosnan looked very ragged, a huge contrast the suave-ness that Bond usually has, with his hair uncut and a beard and mustache.The ice palace was an amazing idea, and the frost floating around inside was gorgeous.The scene with Halle's character, Jinx, being tied down and almost being killed by the laser was taken from `Goldfinger'.  I thought Halle's answers to the questions were stupid, and her acting (in that and in the other scenes where she actually spoke) seemed forced and almost way too familiar. Some of what she said did not fit the grain of a Bond movie.  I groaned after Jinx killed Miranda and called her a b*tch, and when she answered ""Your momma"" in response to a question asked during the laser scene.I did not like the car chase across the ice, it reminded me too much of the awful car movies that have come out in the past couple years that were made for teenagers (think `The Fast and the Furious' or `Gone in 60 Seconds') with scenes of two awesome and expensive looking cars sliding around on the ice.  Other special effects (for instance when Bond was `surfing' with the parachute after narrowly escaping the laser beam) were extremely bad, and I did not like the slow motion after Gustav killed Colonial Moon.Also, it seemed that Bond had an attachment to Jinx that I didn't understand; he only talked to her twice on screen, and not even after their sex scene.  And did he know Miranda Frost from before his adventure in North Korea?The very last scene of the movie had very cheesy dialogue.  This being only a PG-13 movie, the lines `Leave it in a little longer. it's such a perfect fit' could not be in reference to the *other* connotations people might have.  Even before they were said, I knew that the only other thing it could be would be a diamond in Halle's bellybutton.Finally, I can't believe that anybody who is familiar with Bond's relation to Moneypenny would think that, in the last five minutes of the film, start a relationship with her.  This would happen in the second quarter of the last Bond movie, should that time ever come.This movie was better than many that have come out recently, but compared to other Bond films -- indeed, just compared to Brosnan's other Bond films -- it is not as well made as it could have been, feeling over-worked with bad results.",Die Another Day
547,robertlloyd777,Awesome!!,7,4 June 2003,"DAD is in my opinion, Brosnan's best. It was a spectacle that every bond fan should see. This Film is I think the first to show not just a megalomaniac, but also a dangerous country. I was also surprised at the twists and turns that the characters make. As always, the stunts are incredible, and the special effects are superb. Gustav Graves is probably one of the most intriguing Bond villains to date(you must watch and see why!!) and Zao, the diamond covered terrorist is the most menacing Bond villain since Dario in License To Kill. After such lackluster villains in TND and WNE it is refreshing to see that the Bond franchise has improved their villains. One complaint though is the use of slow motion in the movie, I think that this has no place in a bond movie. One good change though is the title credits, which are more story inclusive, where instead of scantily clad babes dance around, we see glimpses of bond's torture in the prison. I highly suggest this movie.",Die Another Day
548,alisenay,Big American Help!,7,28 January 2003,"As a big Bond and Brosnan fan, it is always enjoying for me to watch a bond movie. A cool character, played by a cool actor. Just like the previous bond movies, you can find exaggerated scenes which bond gets rid near death situations. If you accepted bond as it is, so it shouldn't be a big surprise for you. On the other hand, we see lots of changes in this latest bond movie. Especially, the camera movements as in Matrix and also lots of others that you will notice while watching. What has made a big disappointment in me was the American aid to Mr. Bond. The jinx character played by Halle Berry, is just like a partner to Bond and helps him. We used to see Bond girls that are beautiful but not that much active on the killing of bad guys. At most, they were just pushing a button and were never send to mission with Bond. They were there because they were with Bond. This time, Bond sent to a mission with a NSA agent and got American help.
After all, Bond is changing in this first millennium episode, but it is not acceptable for me to see Bond getting help from Americans. Come on, there are lots of American agents saving the world, just leave Bond alone. As a result, Brosnan's not best Bond movie and because of changes and especially the American help my vote is 7/10.",Die Another Day

Alas, none of that...quite the opposite.Then like a bad case of diarrhoea, it's all over the shop. Just as in TWINE, Brosnan tries so hard...but very unevenly so. He isn't helpt by the inept direction, inept script, inept chipboard acting, inept cgi...CGI?! It adds a silly plastic cartoonish element - quite obvious in the more outlandish stuntwork. So many nails in the coffin being self-hammered. Plot less, clueless, no real villainy, No searing intrigue, no characterisation, no STORY... Yet more badly sewn patchwork quiltiness. High on astro-boyish gadgetry...the odd line sparkles amongst the thickly wooden acting. Cleese should not be in Bond film. Samantha Bond....is she Munnypenny owing to her name? I can't think of any other reason. Rosamund Pike ought to have cast is the bond girl... Halle Berry - is good t look at all right (ante/post cosmetic surgery) but her acting, well, welcome the woods. I see Tomahori directed 'once we were worriors' he's made this 'once this was James Bond'. Daniel Craig has not helpt - he simply cannot act. He thinks 'one' rhymes with 'gone' - not 'fun'.

553,Ben-62,"Bond is Bad, But It's Not His Fault(Spoilers)",6,23 November 2002,"This 20th installment of Bond is the most lopsided movie I've ever seen. There are parts that are SO good, then there's parts that make me want to CRINGE. The first 20-25 minutes of this film are just awesome. In the general formula of Bond Films, the first 10 minutes we catch Bond on a mission in which he gets caught only to make this astounding get away. In a new twist, he infact ""completes"" his mission only to get captured. Enter the opening credits in which we still get the norm, naked women etc, but at the same time we learn that Bond is being tortured. Very Unique, Just Cool! The credits end and we learn that Bond has been held for 14 months. He now has long hair and a beard! Up to this point it's a really good movie! Within another 10 minutes this movie starts to get really bad. Not to completely ruin the movie, let me get to the very bad of this movie. Generally speaking, in any Bond film, he and the main villain are the ONLY people who are allowed to have an unlimited amount of puns, not in this installment of the film. It seemed to me that everyone in the movie, including the extras, were using puns like they were going out of style. GAG ME! Puns are an excellent form of humor, but when characters go back and forth multiple times using puns in the same scene, it gets really dumb. Also, the dialog between Brosnan and Berry is for the most part HORRIBLE. It just did not flow, nor was it believable. In a fight scene that borders on the ridiculous, Bond and the main villain have this sword fight which starts off inside a fencing club, goes around the entire club and winds up outside. Just stupid! While only being in the film for a total of 6 minutes, Michael Madsen is terrible. For one of the only times in his career, his acting was SO weak and poorly delivered. Madsen had no reason to be in this film. Anyone could have played his character. And for the good, there are tens of references to the other Bond films, some which are very subtly stated. Very Cool! Also, the style that this movie was shot was neat as far as at times it pulled away from the general formula that these movies are done. Change is Nice! Toby Stephens plays one wicked villain! He is VERY good, one of the five best ever! And as already stated up top, the beginning of this film is JUST AWESOME! Very Unique and Just Cool! While not the worst, that distinction belongs to Moonraker, this Bond film is disappointing.",Die Another Day
554,dpierce5,They Broke the Rules...,2,8 December 2002,"""Improbable but not impossible."", has always been the rule-of-thumb for the Bond franchise. Die Another Day not only promotes the impossible but simply throws out the law of physics! Invisible car?? Sonic Ring?? World Record High Dive?? Fortress of Solitude?? Wind Surfing on a Glacial Tidalwave?? Seems our ""hero"" and ""a man that everyman wanted to be and every woman wanted"", has been reduced to a not-so-clever, but extremely lucky, comic book character. What is instore for the dumb-wited masses in the next segment of the franchise? Magic ruby slippers or will bond simply catch bullets with his teeth? The dialogue seems to be written by Bevis and Butthead (""hehe hehe... she said COCKFIGHT! hehe hehe""). The classic and best Bonds rely more heavily upon outwitting the bad guys in a chessgame played upon the audience who were more interested in the next move than in a flashy show of special effects without thought. Die Another Day is definatley a new low, and sadly mimics a spoof. It is no longer the standard of spy thrillers. Cubby Broccoli's legacy has been betrayed.",Die Another Day

557,misterkraig,"Oh my god, what have they done?",2,26 November 2002,"I had high hopes for this latest Bond flick.  The World is not Enough had its moments, but overall was average at best.  This one had a great cast and a director skilled at action and drama.  Boy, was I wrong!!   The movie starts with the familar gun sight and suddenly the bullet from Bond's gun shoots toward you - good start.  The pre credits sequence was pretty good but no way as good as Brosnan's previous three.  Then the credits sequence starts - Oh my god what have they done, the story continues during Danny Kleinmann's fantastic visuals.  Would Maurice Binder let them do this?  I don't think so!!  To be fair, the more I think about it, the more I think it is cleverly done (considering how it helps the plot) but please EON don't do it again!!At this point I was not impressed.  Please god, I said to myself let it improve.  It did, on occasions but more on that later.Firstly, let's talk about the performances.  Brosnan, I feel is now comfortable in his role and looks the parts extremly well.  He feels out a tux brillaintly and generally looks dangerous.  My gripe is I feel he doesn't stamp HIS version of Bond enough.  Connery and Moore did it, Dalton and Lazenby didn't get the chance.  It seems to me apart from occasion such as the 'M' scenes in particular Brosnan is doing a 'greatest hits' performance not making the role totally his own.  You may think I am criticising Brosnan the actor.  I think he is a superb actor with great presence, but I feel his best performance is in The Thomas Crown Affair. Hally Berry, a beautiful and talented actress, we know this. Her role in Die Another Day is pointless and pure eye candy.  Sure, she looks good carrying a gun and I hope someone picks her up for her own action role, but her role is so woefully written.  Toby Stephens on the other hand I think is the best villain since michael Lonsdale's Drax in Moonraker.  This guy is cool, sinister and more then a match for Mr Bond, both mentally and physically. The supporting cast are generally very good with some good performances from Rosamund Pike and Rick Yune.  Judi Dench is great and this time John Cleese is not Basil Fawlty as I feel he was in The World is Not Enough.  I hope he will provide a geat replacement as the new Q.  At the moment it seems he will do just great.Lets briefly move on the action sequences, as always totally brilliant. Vic Armstrong is a genius at his job and EON must never let him not do a Bond film.  His stunt sequences were brillaint if occasionally ruined by bad CGI. Part of the fun of previous Bond films was the sometimes poor back projection work.  I would rather see Roger hang out a helicopter in For Your Eyes Only then the awful CGI work on Brosnan going down the ice with the parachute. David Arnold's music is Very John Barry again, which is no bad thing.  We know from his other scores Mr Arnold is a superb composer.  he knows however what you want in a Bond score and he produces the goods every time.  Madonna's theme song is different and originally I didn't like it but it has grown on me.You may be reading this and thinking hang on a moment, all I have read is praise.  Let me go on to what I didn't like and believe me there is a lot.Firstly, no matter what you say about the '21st Century' and new eras, etc. Bond does not need help saving the world. He does it on his own, period. Sure, he has had help in the past but mainly it is him and him alone who does the business.  Nobody does it better said Carly Simon and MGM myust remind themselves Bond has no equal.  Man or woman can help Bond, but in the end HE saves the day on his own.  Not together or jointly - ON HIS OWN!!
Secondly, the dreadful editing.  I though i was watching The Fast and the Furious or MTV.  This style of editing works in certain films. In Bond youdon't mess with a traditional formula for making this kind of film.  Sure tweak it here and there, but don't make crass pop video images.
Finally on the negative side.  It didnt seem like a Bond.  Tomorrow Never Dies was bad enough but this seemed to lose all it's 'Bond-ness' and the unique feel a Bond film has.  Now I am a big fan fan of all movies from all countries.  I am sorry to say Bond has gone American and apart from the Bond-esque touches such as Q, M, some great double entendres and the wonderful in-jokes to previous films I thought I was watching a buddy thriller.  And what on earth was somebody thinking with the fantasy Moneypenny/Bond sequence, I was offended.  It was pointless, crude and an insult to fans of the series.I hope Mr Brosnan stays on for one more and next time gets it right (in my opinion).  I hope they keep Lee Tamomori as director because I feel he has a great eye.  However if the editing ideas was his, say goodbye and get Martin Campbell back, Goldeneye was amazing and Brosnan's best.  I also rate the writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade.  They seem to know where they are going but seem a little misguided especially with the creation of the pointless Jinx character.  I would like to see a bit more of Cleese's Q next time around as well.You may think to yourself, my god he really does hate the movie.  I don't hate it.  I could never hate Bond, but it was such an opportunity that badly misfired.  All I hope is Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli sit back and really think the next one through.   Get back to basics, make another Goldeneye.  Or if you want Bond at his best, From Russia With Love.  Go back and consult previous Bonds, talk to fans and most importantly don't sell out to the Hollywood action movie.  If thats the case with the next one, Bond is gone forver as far as I am concerned and for someone who has been a fan since he was eight, that's a real shame.This is just my opinion, I may watch the movie again and like it.  I hope I do.  At the moment however, things don't look good.",Die Another Day

In fact, this film is so farcical that I'd be surprised if Rog would even think about appearing in this.The premise is good, North Korea is an 'axis of evil' country so having a villain from there keeps Bond in with the times. And the idea of taking a different approach in a Bond film by not letting us in on the villain right away is one that could be repeated in the future. Berry and Pike are also pretty sexy whilst Brosnan does his usual turn.However, everything else is terrible. Bond's adventures were always meant to be improbable but not impossible. Somehow I think this was lost on the producers. Invisible cars? Iccarus? Why not go whole-hog and have Bond fight cyborgs as this seems to be where they want to take the film.Madonna makes an absolute idiot out of herself, both in song and in performance. Surely getting Shirley Bassey in would have been a more appropriate way to celebrate the 40th anniversary.CGI this bad is frankly embarrassing; whatever happened to stunts? And this I will never forgive: the film contains parts that are practically adverts for Ford, Sony Ericcson, Omega, etc. I appreciate this is how you pay for films but guys, please do it subtly.All in all pretty awful.

And it was probably one of the better parts of the film.Every movie in the series has had an outrageous plot, but this one is just too unbelievable to be watchable. The bond gadgets, which are (again) always far out were just ridiculous in this film.And...James Bond didn't ACT LIKE JAMES BOND. Since when does he drink mojitos instead of martinis? And he doesn't seem to be able to do anything right. He gets captured, he gets duped, he does everything wrong. It's as if the writers had never seen a james bond film before.",Die Another Day
565,SharpShooter5,Brosnan's Second best outing,10,12 December 2003,"Die another day was pretty much bashed by most critics, and several movie goers claimed it to be one of the worst bonds, but thats because since the series took its 6 year break after licence to kill it has become cool to hate the new Bond films (don't ask me why?), for example look at how Goldenye was received when it first came out, people hated it, but 8 years after its release, it is considered by many fans as one of the top 5 BondsDie another day is the same way, in 8-10 years it will be looked back upon as one great Bond film.  Yes its a little over the top, but not more then Moonraker or You Only Live Twice was, and what really makes this a good film is Pierce Brosnan, he seems tailor made for Bond, and as with the previous actors he is finding his Groove near the end of his 007 career (this is his fourth film, and probably second last outing).  As I said, Brosnan, makes this movie for me, his performance makes you overlook the sub par performance of Halle Berry (the films only real weakness)So if your looking for a real good action adventure film then buy or rent Die Another Day, its not the best Bond film ever, but on an enjoyment level it ranks only behind Goldeneye, as Brosnan's Best.",Die Another Day
566,Darkimus_Prime,An honest review.....honestly!!,6,22 October 2008,"Die another day gets bad press. Invisible car. Bad theme song. ""Implausble"" storyline.The thing we have to ask ourselves is,is the invisible car any worse or less believable than the underwater lotusor the remote control BMW? is the storyline any less plausible than Moonaker? Die another Day brings Bond to great form,the story is great. The fencing scene with Graves reminds me of golf with Goldfinger, the hovercraft scenes are great, as are the ice chase scenes. Halle Berry is an excellent bond girl reminisicant of the Connery era.References and homages to the past twenty films are plenty "" here's your new watch,your twentieth i think"". Visual references to old gadgets,the jet-pack, the knife shoe etc (although it has to be said,as big a John Cleese fan as i am, his lines as 'R' were very wooden, not his fault but thats beside the point)Overall I really enjoyed the film, but i got sucked into not liking it.....I'd put it up as one of Brosnan's best, an excellent send off for his Bond - and despite my praise it does appear this film was the last of the "" classic"" style series.

The sword fight between Bond and Graves is very exciting, and Rosamund Pike plays a brilliant role. However there also are some downers, just to name a few:The ice castle of Graves looks more like some sort of fantasy land instead of the real world and this film has one of the most weird villain deaths. Not to mention the Nort Korean colleague of Graves who doesn't perform that well in the film. The only fun moment where he appears is the car chase on the ice.Also the focus in this film is too much on being spectacular which takes you away from the story. The producers tried to cover up the weak storyline with a car chase, a big ice palace and the weirdest weapon ever used by a Bond villain. This all doesn't quite contribute to the film in a good way.However, the bikini scene with Jinx Johnson (Halle Berry) made some fans feel better...",Die Another Day
568,Scott-12,"Good FX, but mostly a big YAWN.",4,30 November 2002,"This movie had plenty of good effects, but the producers forgot the most important rule. Story, story, story. The movie can not be about the special effects. Example, Lord of the Rings: major special effects, but they are secondary to the story. The story is what makes it a great movie. If you go back through movie history, the movies that last are the ones with a good story. This movie has the FX, but no story. Second: Dialogue. It was terrible. You have always expected Bond to throw out suggestive comments in every movie, but in this one they forgot to look up the meaning of ""subtle."" Sean Connery was the master of the double entendre. It helped that his writers gave him good ones to use. In this movie it is obvious they are catering to the MTV, Beavis and Butthead crowd that probably never finished high school. Here's a tip. Use some of that $142 million budget and hire some decent writers. Acting: Mostly bad. I happen to be a big fan of Brosnan. I think he is the second best Bond next to Connery. But it was a struggle in this between his acting and the bad writing. I liked Rosamund Pike. They would have done well to cast her as the good one, but I guess they are following the footsteps of the last movie where Sophie Marceau stole the show from the awful Denise Richards. As for Halle Berry, I could write a book about how bad she was. It amazes me that she actually believes she was hired to be a new sort of Bond girl, i.e. smart, tough, and able to kick butt just like Bond. The problem is that she IS a new sort of Bond girl. Most of the previous ones were smart and tough and able to take care of themselves. Witness Ursula Andress, Maude Adams, etc. With Halle Berry and Denise Richards, they have basically made it obvious they are just hiring according to bra size. Halle was nothing more than a bimbo with a big chest. She couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Okay, off the soapbox. One last thing, the music. The Madonna theme was absolutely the worst Bond theme ever. Even in the bad days of the Timothy Dalton films, they at least had good music. Someone should tell Madonna that her career actually died quite some time ago, and would she please accept that and stop torturing us. Cheers.",Die Another Day

So it saddens me to say this Bond movie may just be the absolute worst in the history of the series. Without giving much of the movie away, their were some good points, so I'll start with those.  The opening pre-title sequence was good, as was the acting of Bond himself.  M and Q were very believable.  As was Samantha Bond as the infamous Monneypenny.  Roseamund Pike as Frost was delightful. Now for the bad. The ""bullet-time"" effect (the same slow motion used in The Matrix) is a nice technique, but it was WAY over used.  So overused I got a headache from it!  The film had NO plot.  None at all.  It reminded me as if someone took part of other bond movies (Diamonds are Forever, The Man with the Golden Gun, etc...) tossed them together and said, ""Hey, we can make a movie here!"" In short, it was bad.Halle Berry's character of Jinx was unbelievable.  I actually found myself hoping her character would die.  The film had almost no slow points..it moved from one action scene to another without room for a breath.  It seemed as if someone at the MGM Q-branch decided to use every single technical idea that they could figure out.  Plus, the ending was so lack luster I was disappointed.  Save your money, rent it on video, and in the meantime, go check out Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, or The World is Not Enough. Out of 5*:  **1/2 Out of a 10 Point Scale: 3",Die Another Day
571,dianeadrienne,Even BETTER than the Perfect Storm!,2,4 December 2002,"I suppose I should have known what I was in for, considering the last fifty films from this series that never dies.  It's the series that never dies, except for the Bond woman in every movie, and Mr. Bond himself every ten years or so. So, considering it IS a *Bond* movie, and there *are* certain suspensions of disbelief required in order for it so be a *Bond* movie...
I suppose that this film is alright.  There are fights, there is sex (although, as our society requires immediate satisfaction, Halle Berry and Pierce Brosnan are all over each other approximately three minutes into her onscreen arrival), and oh yes, there are more excuses to use the most fabulous special effects never to look like waves [see also, THE PERFECT STROM]!  It satisfies every post-modern baby's dream come true! 
My favorite part is how the scriptwriter (or the director, or maybe the actress herself) creates such wonderful taglines for Ms. Berry as ""Yo mama, and I bet she's disappointed witch you!""  Need we be reminded that she is black?  YES!  because ordinarily, upstanding Scotsmen (or Brits) don't consort with that type, but since it's post-Women's lib, and post-Civil rights movement now, I suppose it's allowable to let a black actress bed our right-hand man.  But, she's got to be aggressive, and snappy, and not really a fully-developed character.  No, let's leave the fleshing-out to the white woman.But, aside from all of these things, I thought this was a fabulous film! You had Madonna in a shirt not intended to remind us that she is 45 and buffer than James, you had a bad white guy who was really a bad Asian guy who was really trying to take over the world, and you had America and the United Kingdom coming to the rescue (along with the help of a few fine specimens of vehicular artistry)!

A good actor, but no Bond. He has no 'flamboyance'. No charisma. Unlike Sean Connery, not a very good actor, but a perfect Bond. Pierce doesn't have 'it' to make him a Bond, although he has it a little more than Mr Dalton, who, in my opinion, was the worst Bond ever. I even stopped watching them after his first attempt.Then take the tension. There is none. Little jokes while the plane is crashing 'I broke her heart' with a smile on her face doesnt help me make believe that they're in a  burning plane on the way to the ground.Then the villains. They used to be very powerful rich man with a great story. Nowadays they're sad little figures. The last great was Christopher Walken.And then 'M'. Please get rid of Judi Dench. The woman can't act. At least not as 'M'.Of course there are also some compliments to be given.Kenneth Tsang played really well, he was convincing as General.I also liked the obvious false background while Bond was fighting on some kind of military hoovercraft. At least it looked we were back in the '60's.

573,hifarers,Brosnan's Moonraker,3,18 December 2002,"I don't like the direction that the Bond movies are headed towards since TWINE supposedly to modernize the series. I am not against modernizing the series but I believe that the series should look back to the past for inspiration. Real stunts have given way to CGI effects, which on some scenes are poorly done; scenes that are quite ludicrous. I know Bond should do incredible things, but let's ground him a bit in ""reality"".... I want Bond, not Spiderman. I want to see more of Bond's brains not brawn (or more to the point ""sporting prowess""). At least there were glimpses of this in some scenes; the hospital ship and the oxygen tank trick; but there were too few and overwhelmed by the fluff.The battle between the Jaguar and the Aston Martin on ice never really exhilirates especially when compared to the car chase scenes from TND, Ronin and The Bourne Identity.All Bond movies are predictable: the baddie loses and he gets the girl, we all know that... but I would like that journey to be more intriguing with some twists and turns. Unfortunately this movie is a slow wide bend with billboards (read endorsements) left, right and centre. Brosnan's in danger of being redundant in a movie of special effects and stunts... i.e. no acting required, no story required, just be there... where the stars of the movie are the cars, the vodka, the watch, the suit.... The ""Oscar-winner"" Halle Berry does no better than Denise Richards. I was expecting her to take her cue from Michelle Yeoh's character.This is what I expect from Bond in the future: 1. he obviously has emotions as seen in TWINE, more of it please 2. he's a super agent, so allow him to be ruthless (almost cold blooded) once in a while 3. make him work harder when investigating plots, not everything should fall on his lap 4. he does have friends in his colleagues, doesn't he? Remember Licence to Kill with Tim Dalton. 5. No super incredible feats of daring that owes more to CGI than real stunts.In a Hollywood that has created Spy Games, The Bourne Identity and The Sum of All Fears in 2002, I would have thought that would have been motivation for the producers to create a more mature and intelligent movie. But I was mistaken. I was looking forward to DND but unfortunately the movie did not live up to the hype.

As an exploitative money grabbing sequel it tops even Batman & Robin. I can usually forgive even TMWTGG or AVTAK but this film has left me so disappointed I hope they never make another Bond film again unless they do a complete u-turn.I find very little to recommend in this film. The 'Q' scene is great, as is Moneypenny's scene at the end and the title sequence looks very good.After half an hour or so the plot descends into cliche and farce. There is no characterisation whatsoever. None of the characters seem to have any motive and about 90% of the dialogue consists of excrutiating one-liners.The action sequences seem tired and poorly directed. The so-called 'matrix style' cool editing tricks are completely out of place and effects are abysmal in places.I felt as if MGM were cashing in by trying to give us  a Best of Bond compilation, but even in this they fail spectacularly. It feels re-hashed, and the 'Icarus' satellite is a direct steal from Diamonds Are Forever.The acting by the leads (barring Brosnan who delivers his usual Milk Tray Man/Bobby from Dallas style Bond) is disappointing. Halle Berry is surprisingly wooden. As an actress she is capable of much more. Toby Stephens delivers every line with the most ridiculous sneer I have every witnessed. Judi Dench, Samantha Bond and John Cleese however do manage to rescue the scenes they are in.The product placement - although not as bad as TND or Moonraker - is pretty awful, and the homages to the older Bond films seems to have backfired. Halle Berry's rise from the ocean is well documented but lines such as ""Diamonds Are For Ever..ybody"" make me scream for mercy.",Die Another Day

In fact, this whole thing is a Roger Moore film in 2002. Which is the real issue, right? Whereas spider man was a welcome getaway from the new world we were thrust into on 9 11, a New York based superhero we could all identify with, and rally behind. Bond at this time, came off as silly, and someone we couldn't identify with at that moment.Taken as part of the series as a whole, forgetting its time of release, Die Another Day is an entertaining Bond film, not the worst, not the best, but very watchable.",Die Another Day
577,gordon_mcvey,The first action hero rides again,7,24 December 2002,"Times have changed a lot since Dr. No.  Movies contain a lot more sex, violence and explosions.  Yet somehow, the old Sean Connery Bond movies still keep you coming back with their wit, charm and the fact that they never take themselves too seriously.But with the fiercest competition ever seen in it's 40 year run it was inevitable that Bond had to change somewhat to keep being a box-office draw. When it's up against The Matrix, the new Star Wars movies and other effects-heavy films it was obvious right from the get go that this Bond film needed as much eye candy crammed in there as possible.Of course, we all want the good old stuff that Bond has always delivered. Guns, fast cars, fast women, big explosions, gadgets and those dreadful, awful, mind-wrenchingly bad puns that we've all come to know and love.There is a lotto recommend Die Another Day.  We get a rare glimpse under the surface of Bond's character, (SPOILER) we get to see he isn't invincible afterall when he is captured and spends 14 months in a Korean prison, his only escape coming when he is traded for a particularally nasty Korean agent in a hostage exchange.  (SPOILER) We get to see an unexpected change in the relationship between Bond and M after his release, when you can feel some real contempt from Bond for M's and his government's actions surrounding his capture and eventual release.  These are interesting new directions for the Bond franchise.  Another unexpected new direction for a Bond film is a villan you can almost find yourself rooting for and that you really believe might be in with half a chance against Bond afterall.  He's charismatic, fearless and like Bond will do whatever it takes to win.  They even played around a little with the titles, making them part of the narrative, something we've not seen in a Bond film before.All the old favorites are there too.  The silly overambitious plot for world domination involving a space laser (though in this case the actual particulars of said plan are rather too close to Diamonds Are Forever for my taste, I'm sure they could have found an original twist to the story here), the banter between Bond and the new Q, played by John Cleese.  He actually makes a very good Q, though Desmond Llewelyn will always be remembered for making that particular role his own and will be sadly missed.  The unfeasable car chase with rockets and guns and, thank God, an Aston Martin. Bond in a German car?  PAH!  He shouldn't drive anything that's not made in England.All in all, a very entertaining film with a new harder edge to it, and something of a return to form for the series after the very average The World Is Not Enough.However, there are bad points.  As mentioned before, the space laser is way too close to the weapon from Diamonds Are Forever for my liking.  And I really feel that time compression, while it can be a powerful tool if used judiciously and sparingly, looks like just an overused gimmock if it is not, and this film suffered quite badly from Matrixitus in places, especially during the otherwise very grand carchase.  I give it 7 out of 10, would have been 8.5 but I needed to knock some off for the needless and overused time compression tricks.",Die Another Day

581,vlad_davidov,The First Original Bond Movie in Ages,10,22 November 2002,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADLately, it seems that all of the Brosnan-Era films, and even some of the Dalton-era Bond films were stealing ideas and components from the 007 movies of the past. Die Another Day not only succeeds as one of the Best Bond movies of all time, but one of the best movies of the year.Most elements in Bond movies are somewhat predictable ( The sidekick of Bond that helps the most turns out to be a dirty rotten traitor, the big guy's device turns into some kind of weapon, etc.), but aside from those two, this movie throws all kinds of surprises at everyone.Bond sits in his office at MI6, when he faintly hears the sound of a silenced gunshot. He stops cleaning his Walther P99, and slowly creeps out of his office, taking out two armed men before meeting up with Robertson, one of the other MI6 personnel. People lay dead everywhere, and as he steps into M's office - Moneypenny's been shot, between the eyes! Then he busts into M's actual office, shoots one terrorist, then aims at one holding M hostage ( Sort of like the TWINE 64 game ), then fires a few times. Then out of nowhere, R ( Or the new Q ) appears, like some kind of hologram. Then Bond takes off his VR goggles. R claims Bond fouled up the training mission by also killing M, his response? ""Check the replay - He's dead, and M only has a flesh wound.""James Bond gadgets have finally emerged to the point where they definitely surpass technology again. It's like we went back to the sixties, with Thunderball and the Jet Pack (Which won an Oscar for special effects). The Aston Martin V12 Vanquish ( Or as R put it, 'Vanish') can disappear by using a series of cameras to project what would be on the other side. Looks like Captain Picard and Kirk are getting their devices stolen.But a welcome aspect from previous Bond movies - Mostly of the Moore era - have returned. The humour. Not enough to classify the movie as a comedy, but certainly numerous opportunities to burst out laughing.And in the introduction, where Bond is captured and held prisoner for 14 months before MI6 and the NSA step in to get him back (Making the NSA's debut in the Bond series). THAT was original. Despite dodging bullets for 40 years, he's still human - I guess he's entitled to one screwup every half-century.If there's anything I can complain about, it's Madonna. Her cameo didn't seem all that obvious. I could have sworn that it was Glenn Close, and not her. At least her song can be overlooked, as what's happening while the song plays is important to see.Five stars, two thumbs up, whatever you use to rate it, it gets all.

Well, it's still a good action movie...but not a good bond film.I found it to be too......techno-y and unclassy.Sure its the 20th and this was meant to be a great bond film to kick off the 20th century, but they kicked it a bit too hard.But still, if you're into bizare action movies then I guess you might like it.",Die Another Day

That's what 007 movies are about, watching James beat up the bad guys and womanize beautiful girls. His flicks had lots of both. The lowest point of this film is Madonna's song. Not suited for James Bond at all, its techno! That aside the villain is quite sinister, Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike are both hot and very deadly. They're Bond girls who earn their pay.

584,haggicide,"Not a great Bond film, but it has its moments",5,7 June 2003,"As a longtime Bondphile, I eagerly await any new Bond film.  I can't deny that this one was quite a disappointment for me.  It had enough gadgets, good effects, action, and of course, an Aston Martin to keep me happy, but there were enough negatives for me to rate this movie alongside Roger Moore's.  I do appreciate the tongue-in-cheek references to past Bond films, but this effect was greatly overused.  In other words, it is almost like they merely mashed all the old films into one new one.
I will admit that Bond movies run the risk of looking like Juicy Fruit commercials with their exploitation of the latest extreme sports fads, like the parasurfing on the (unconvicingly CGI) tidal wave in this movie. Also, the opening credits featuring Bond being tortured is totally inappropriate for this kind of film.  Not the content, but he premise.  It is tantamount to MacGyver being given a paperclip and not having a clue what to do withit.  Bond is not supposed to have the capacity to be captured and detained, much less for 14 months.  He is clever enough to get out of the ice racer, so why didn't he just jump over the waterfall like his superhuman female partner Jinx did later in the movie?  Hmmm?  Which brings me to my next point.Another problem I have with the new Bond films is the whole concept of Bond girls being ""empowered"".  The studio abandoned the concept of ""this could really happen"" around the time of ""Moonraker/The Spy Who Loved Me"", so why must the whole franchise represent a microcosm of current events and beliefs?  Bond girls are SUPPOSED to look good and be helpless!!  That is their requirement, and their purpose.  Can anyone really imagine the great Sean requiring a female partner (or any for that matter, save Leiter) to complete his mission?  Seems like Pierce has lost his edge.  This is not ""Get Smart"".  This concludes that rant, and now I will conclude with some positives.I just bought the DVD, and it is packed with good stuff.  The Bond Special Edition DVDs are packed with a multitude of good behind-the-scenes featurettes, and they enhance the experience of watching the films.  This one is no exception.John Cleese also brings his incomparable presence to the role of Q, succeeding the late Desmond Llewelyn.  His comic genius and timing will be welcomed in films to come.  The use of Madonna as an actress (sic) and programmer of the title (ahem) music was an obvious last gasp attempt at revitalizing her career, and lets us know what kicking a dead horse sounds like.I'm almost done.

This is my third favorite Bond movie ever. First is Goldeneye, and my second is Goldfinger. This movie is the most entertaining film released all year.SOME SPOILERS********** This film has the one of the best opening scenes in all of the Bond films. They changed the opening gun scene, and they added a bullet which makes the gun barrel scene even better. The fight scene at the beginning on the hovercrafts is one of the best scenes in Bond history. Explosions are everywhere and the hovercraft going off the cliff is very cool.Brosnan and Berry make a great team throughout the whole film. She helps make this film great through her own acting ability. I do think she deserves her own movie for her character Jinx. Brosnan seems to be even more confortable in the role and he pulls off an excellent performance.The fight scenes are also great. The opening fight scene with the koreans is action packed. The fencing is really awesome as the two men rip apart the whole entire fencing building. The fight scene with the lasers is my third favorite. The car scene in the ice palace is another reason why this movie rules. There are cars crashing through walls, missiles exploding as the whole entire castle is crumbling down around them. Very cool.The gadgets are also very interesting in the movie. Some of the gadgets are tributes to other Bond films. The poison tip shoe is from FRWL, and the jetpack from Thunderball. I do get the idea of the invisible car. I could see a car the shows what the car is looking at from the left side and putting that image on the right side of the car to make it look like that the car is not really there. People who say it is so far-fetched are wrong.The villains are cool, the satellite-laser gun is even cooler. Go see this film. This is one of the best bond films ever. Most people set the bar way too high when they are watching this film and they dislike a really great film. Everyone expects another Goldeneye or Goldfinger, and when they get one that is slightly below Goldfinger, the flip and say that this movie is bad. Do not listen to those Bond finatics.

The villains are nasty, the gadgets are very cool, the ladies are (finally) smart and funny, and lets face it girls...Pierce without his shirt for the first 20 minutes or so is a nice change from the mostly naked women in the rest of the Bond movies!  The North Korea element added a bit of realism, and the numerous references to previous Bond films was just perfect.  Without giving anything away...go see it just for the scene with Moneypenny at the end...that alone was worth the price of my ticket!!!   All in all, a very enjoyable couple of hours, and DEFINITELY a DVD purchase!!!",Die Another Day
587,surfmantis33,Bond movie falls to its death,1,24 November 2002,"This film held the high expectations of, not only being the 20th official Bond film to date, but also the last of Brosnan's career. I am sad to say that an extremely implausible plot (even in Bond terms) and bad acting contribute to the film's utter demise. This film was both intriguing and exhilarating for the first 10 minutes of a North Korean sting operation, but every moment after that led to worse and worse things. To start with, major deviations have been made to Bond's character. Bond is captured by North Koreans and held in a prison there for what seems to be a very long period of time, which is typically not very Bond-like for a movie. After he is released into British custody from the prison, you start to expect a new plot twist in the genre - such as Bond becoming the movie's new terrorist - at least that's what I expected after noting Bond's new Ted Kaczynski hairstyle. He is brought to a high-security hospital, where, in another VERY un-Bondlike show of deep thought and profound philosophical views, Bond decides to voice his opinions on just about every controversial issue under the sun. What happened to the old silent protagonistic Bond who never explained his intentions or voiced his disapproval, just took action upon instinct? Obviously he is just as dead as this movie was.The plot suffered in other spots as well. There has never before been a Bond Girl character that so seems to have been written for a specific actress. However, the Halle Berry individual in this movie parallels no other Bond girl in history. On top of basically sharing the screentime half and half with Bond, in the time she was on camera  she wouldn't shut her mouth enough to breathe until she after she had already drowned. Not only that, her ""insightful and humorous"" quips sound like they were ripped straight from either a Martin Lawrence movie or a Sinbad comedy routine. Berry is physically built like a 12 year old male adolescent that has just reached puberty. And the love scenes that have always enhanced Bond movies to the extreme ended up looking like nothing more than Pierce Brosnan laying on a bed while a small savage creature pounces up and down on him, trying to eat his skull. To my extreme vexation, there is somehow talk about her being the first Bond girl to spin off her character into its own movie. I don't know if that makes me want to laugh or cry. Don't get me wrong, I think Berry is a great, beautiful actress, however she has neither the looks nor the grace to compare to her predecessors. Let me see, I guess that brings us to Madonna's cameo apparance, which was nothing short of absolute disgrace for the series. Madonna has not aged well, and in the five minutes that she spent onscreen I can see that her acting skills have not improved either. This made a bad movie worse. Another scene, taking place in the depths of the Antarctic, contained an ice palace that closely resembled the combinaton of a Star Wars backdrop and that big golf ball shaped thing at Disney's EPCOT.In any event, Pierce Brosnan's performance as Bond, albeit a bad script, was sill extraordinary and was, along with John Cleese as the new Q, the movie's saving grace. Another technologically astounding movie falls short because of plot holes, script errors, and miscasting. I'm starting to agree with Sean Connery's statement that Quentin Tarantino should take over new direction of the Bond films. Bond films have traditionally been about consistency, charm, and courage. This film had everything but.",Die Another Day
588,tubasunshine,Darker but just as good!,9,22 November 2002,"This is the darkest Bond movie we've seen yet.  The opening sequence set the tone and the characters up very well. The villains backgrounds were explained better than I've seen in a while, as were all the special toys and circumstances.  I love Pierce Brosnan as Bond (the best as far as I'm concerned, and Hally Berry is one of the best Bond girls I've ever seen. Great chemistry between the characters.The hover craft chase ranks right up there with the tank chase from GOLDENEYE.  I love the creativity that goes into 007 movies.

589,darcyj,A clipshow,6,19 December 2002,"Die Another Day consists of a reworking of plot elements and ideas from most, if not all, of the previous 19 Bond films. Where something appears which is new to Bond, it is certainly not new to the action genre of the last 10 years. In short, the producers and writers were out of ideas and the best they could do is string together a number of climaxes with a Bond-shaped piece of string.It is also a movie of two halves, and halftime is the point where Bond returns to England. Up until that point, the narrative and the action are reasonable enough (for a join-the-dots adventure story). Then we move into the theatre of the absurd, commencing with the parachute arrival of our main villain. It is a measure of how convincing this character was that I was instantly calling him ""Lord Flashheart"" when he appeared. Most of the story is downhill from there, from the ""invisible"" car to the absurd way Miranda Frost jumps into bed with Pierce Brosnan to protect their cover to the shenanigans aboard the plane at the movie's (eventual) climax of climaxes.I give it 6 out of 10 because of the first half. The back half is worth 3 or 4 only.",Die Another Day
590,ive_been_expecting_you,"This is good, very good",10,24 November 2002,"Brosnan and the Bond team have it made. The 1990's films alone have raked in 1.2 billion $ US. I've been a devout Bond fanatic for years, and I'm pleased to say Die Another Day is right up there as one of the best Bond entries in the last twenty years. Brosnan has appeared as Bond in 1995's GoldenEye, 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, and most recently, 1999's The World Is Not Enough. Die Another Day blasts the Bond formula into the 21st century. Despite some God awful CGI in some sections, particulary in reference to Bond's escape from Icarus in the Jet Dragster, its a racy, exciting and energetic story, masterfully created by all involved. Casting here was inspired. Piece now looks the right age for Bond, he combines the stark violence of Dalton, the wit of Moore, and the powerful presence of Connery and Lazenby. Halle Berry gives a very rounded and enjoyable turn as tough NSA agent Jinx Jordan. Special mentions must go to Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Rick Yune and Will Yun Lee as the villains, an expertly talented group who really give Bond a run for his money. The production, is as ever on Bond, immense and spectacular, and with $142 million to play around with, they kept up the Cubby Broccoli tradition of making every penny apparent on screen. Peter Lamont is well deserving of a second Oscar for his beautiful production design. David Arnold brings the Bond sound into the 21st century, with a techno/orchestra driven score that punches up the action a treat, and the first use of a choir in the score since 1979's Moonraker is truly inspired. I have to admit I came out of seeing Die Another Day the first time incredibly shocked, unsure of what I thought. I'd loved The World Is Not Enough, particulary as many of it's elements harkened back to the 1960's Bond's, look at the similarities between Elektra King's ski suit, and the one worn by Diana Rigg in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service. I saw Die Another Day again and it firmly established itself to me as a corking film with brilliant performances, action and locales. It has been very much worth the two and a half year wait! 10 / 10 without a doubt!  Roll on Bond 21!",Die Another Day
591,robertpanek2001,"Witless, plotless, emotionless and politically correct to the extreme.",1,21 December 2002,"If you're ten years old or younger, or a very stupid adult who smokes a lot of weed then you might find this special effects documentary interesting. That must be what it is, an FX documentary because there is nothing at all connecting these characters, and often you will not have any idea who the characters are, or how they are there at that moment when they should be somewhere on the other side of the world.Cars and other objects will appear from nowhere without explanation as to how they got there, or why they would be there.Where does the second half of the movie take place? I think I recall a reference to Iceland, but why and how would all of *that* be in Iceland? Where did the North Koreans get a Stars Wars missile defense, space based laser system that even the U.S. isn't within twenty years of developing? We're talking about something that Darth Vader would have.
The political correctness? Well, Pierce Brosnan gets very, very angry about ""conflict diamonds"" and very, very hot for Halle Berry, who looks uglier in this film than anything she has ever appeared in. In addition Berry comes off as very stupid, like an illiterate southern black woman from rural Alabama among elite Europeans, yet James Bond can't get enough of her and will destroy the world to get her.Go figure, but hold onto your money.",Die Another Day

594,MrKnowItAll,I blame the writers.,3,23 November 2002,"I loved <i>Goldeneye</i>, and I loved <i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i>.  Both excellent films, not just for Bond movies, but enjoyable, well made movies in general.  <i>The World Is Not Enough</i> left me cold, but I thought it was just a fluke and expected <i>Die Another Day</i> to be much better.  It was in fact much, much worse.Don't get me wrong.  The fight scenes are well choreographed, and the special effects where largely top notch.  (However, the CGI looked like CGI, and that is definitely a bad thing.  I've seen home video games with more realistic graphics.)What got me was that we had got down to the big climatic fight scene at the end, and it occurred to me that I didn't give a rat's ear who won.  It could've been Bond.  It could've been the bad guy.  I was completely apathetic.  You see, in a good story, the audience is led into developing an emotional attachment to the protagonist.  When it's done right, it is a subtle thing that lends depth to the character.  When it's not done wrong, it's a maudlin cartoonish mess.  The characters in <i>DAD</i> where 2 dimensional caricatures, and despite all the action and violence in the final fight scene, I was yawning and looking at my watch.This is two poorly told (and therefore poorly written) Bond movies in a row, and checking the IMDB, I see that both of those were written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade.  This is a team with very little experience, and apparently very little ability.  If those two are involved in the next Bond film, I'll pass, thank you.",Die Another Day

The chemistry between her and Pierce is so forced and obviously fake you'll wish you hadn't seen it. I fell asleep during one of the car chases, I believe it was the half-hour one. Have I made my point? The script is stupid, the direction sucks, the girls don't have enough sex-power to play in a Bond movie, and the music is as bad as they can make it.

What was up with that stupid surfing scene. I could only shake my head in complete and utter disappointment. I grew up a Bond fan since my dad was such a fan when he was younger.  I watch what they have done to Bond and I think thet Ian Fleming is probably rolling over in his grave.   Why do they have to put in stunts that the average person obviously knows is humanly impossible.James Bond is THE man.  Part of that is the allure that you or I could be him but when he does crap like ride a parachute on a canopy from that ice rider thing on a computer generated wave that looked about as bad as the special effects from ""Escape from Los Angeles,"" I had to throw in the towel.

How will Bond save the world, foil the bad guy, and wind up in bed with the girl? In this film, the bad guy isn't that bad, the world is not worried about a minefield, and the girl is a better action figure than sex object.

600,CryOfTheCelt,One of the Best Movies of the Year,8,23 November 2002,"Die Another Day is the best James Bond film since the critically acclaimed hit GoldenEye, Pierce Brosnan's first Bond movie.  Now, in his fourth Bond film, Brosnan makes his most stunning appearance as Bond.
It all begins when James Bond surfs into North Korea and conveniently kills a general's son, leading to torture and imprisonment in a concentration camp.  After 14 months of betrayal by the British, Bond escapes and goes back to work as 007, in route of the evil diamond guru who seeks to control the world - Gustav Graves.  But that's not all.  Bond teams up with American agent Jinx, played beautifully by Oscar-winner Halle Berry.  They begin to mix business with pleasure while in pursuit of Graves.  Meanwhile, Jinx and Bond are also seeking to destroy the wounded North Korean terrorist Zao.In celebration of Die Another Day being the 20th film in the Bond franchise, it is full of references to previous Bond films.  However, I will leave the recognition of those special references up to you, as not to spoil the movie.Also, this film is brimming with dozens of sexual pun-lines that are sure to keep you laughing every few minutes!Overall, Die Another Day is an excellent movie - one of the best I've seen all year.  It's packed with clever gadgets, cool cars, steamy love scenes and adrenaline-pumping action sequences.  Die Another Day also reveals a side of Bond that is rarely shown - Bond has both physical AND emotional scars as the result of his lock-up and betrayal.  It reveals the human side of Bond, his hurt and his triumph in the end.  This one is sure to go down in history as one of the best Bond movies ever made.  GO SEE IT!!!",Die Another Day

I'm talking about the uninspired sword fight, the new Bond Girl, Madonna (anyone remember Shanghai Surprise?  No?

The final showdown is truely great and so stupid at the same time. But, with a Bond picture, you are supposed to suspend belief.Also, Brosnan plays two Bonds. The first is the usual one, all hero, but take a look in his eyes as he is being released after 14 months in a Korean jail and it you can see fear in his eyes. I don't think that Connery or Moore could of played Bond like this. Funniest moment has got to be the moment that a bedraggled Bond walks into the Hong Kong hotel and asks for a room. That was the moment that it changed from being serious and back to the world that we expect from 007.",Die Another Day
605,Ian Fleming,James Bonds True Idenity,10,17 April 2003,"Die Another Day continues the view of the world that we have watched change for 40 years. It while creating itself in 1962, finds itself in important transition 40 years later. It faces the challenge of transporting James Bond into the twenty-first century, yet never loosing sight of what made that world so enjoyable and appealing when the lights were dimmed in our local cinema, and that world came alive. And what was it that made that world so appealing? What do we constantly crave? What renews that rush of adrenaline that the James Bond theme always brings? Well, 40 years, 20 films, and constant roadblocks, and detours have changed and altered our hero's world. They all have had their influence; they all stand out to at least one person proud enough to call themselves a Bond fan. And now, the creative minds that make the world come alive made a groundbreaking decision, put all those changes of path, yet similarity of direction into one epic film that would be the Bond to end all Bonds. After all, if we cant tolerate that James Bond is one of many parts, as is the fan base, than how can we ever truly appreciate his whole world? Die Another Day is the first Bond film not only to ask that question, but also raise an answer. Taking cues from both the books and the movies, it mixes the best of the lower key and over-the-top elements into a  entertaining blend.As tense and gripping as the story can be, it's also a fun ride. That's always a cool thing for 007. I have always believed that probing 007's character was ideal, and DAD does this very well. DAD is packed, and that's something that people don't seem to like, yet those are the same people that wish when they see a smaller scale adventure there was more too it. DAD's sole flaw is having too much, but I rather have too much that too little.
Pierce Brosnan IS Ian Fleming's James Bond in this film. Elements of the author's creation run through Brosnan's characterization just as much as the elements of past successful 007 interpretations.  Bond cleans his Walther P99 and places it under his pillow before sex, yet all done with having the more `popular' Bond being noticed. `I must admit I admire your restraint, you were here a full two hours before anything blew up yet.' Bond enjoys a smoke, while sharing many Roger Moore like double entredres. Brosnan's Bond a work of constant tuning and polishing. Here, like in TWINE he undisputedly gets it right. He is allowed drama, humanity, depth, stealthy charm and style all in one film. It also features some of the most memorable action sequences in a while. The hovercraft chase during the movie's pre-credit sequence is up with The Spy Who Loved Me and GoldenEye, as the best yet. It keeps things grounded and exciting, making it the most suspenseful PCS since The Living Daylights. Bond's fight with Zao in the gene therapy recalls the hard hitting, tensely edited fights from From Russia With Love where punches thrown look like they could hurt, and their car chase in Grave's melting ice palace gives a true sense of claustrophobia, yet a complete embracing of all the `wow' parts of James Bond.Halle Berry's Jinx is the first effective female equivalent to 007 in the entire series, employing ruthlessness, gadgets and chic cheek. She really is going to set the tone for Bond women (that's right) for the next 40 years, just wait and see. And who can leave out Ms. Miranda Frost?Director Lee Tamahori's approach suits the film and character well. He incporates many different styles to a film that tries bring all the Bond styles together. He manages to retain some of the series' tradition of shooting in lush and exotic locations. Tamahori should also be given credit for maintaining the more serious tone of the film. Even when the film can get slightly outlandish, he always keeps the edge and tense feel that started as soon as the curtain went up. The plot is indeed over-the-top, but one would never know it from observing the characters executing it. That is a key ingredient to any Bond plot, while the villains goal must be OTT, its approach must be down to earth, and passionate. Ian Fleming's novel ""Moonraker"" serves as a stomping ground in many ways for this film, and an it is portrayed with a powerful flair.
Brosnan and the series give us the most personal mission Bond has ever faced. And why? Is it because of how is character is probed? No. Is it because he was betrayed, captured, and abandoned? No. But because for 40 years, James Bond has put different aspects of himself and his world upon the screen. They are all in an effort to `find' James Bond. But the secret was all along, James Bond IS all of those things, and he represents all those aspects of smooth utter coolness, and brooding venerability. And while some of these elements you personally enjoy, and some you don't, they are all apart of Bond. Because, when the curtain comes back down after the credits for Die Another Day rolled, they are finally all embraced, in this, James Bonds true identity.Rating: 10/10 Position on The Bond list : Second",Die Another Day
606,Libs,Close but no cigar,6,22 November 2002,"You've got to admit that this time, they tried very hard. The director tried to give a new feel to the franchise, without sacrificing ALL of what we love from the previous JB movies. To be honest, D.A.D. even picks up the steam that Goldeneye gave the series and that the two latest movies nearly destroyed. It feels fresh and new. And in some interesting ways, D.A.D. might be the most innovative JB movie yet. the opening scene and specially the credits are very well done. Cinematography is more vivid, closer to creating tension.  But all this gets wiped clean by a very, very bad script which displays blatantly its own gaping holes and weaknesses in the last 45 minutes of the flick.As a JB fan, I can accept zealous vilains bound on destroying the planet, impossibly ludicrous stunts and mythical gadgets straight from sci-fi. The first 19 JB were based on those elements. But for D.A.D, everything just got blown all out of proportions. The fine balance between the real world and over-the-top fantasy was shredded to tears and it left us with a movie too big on explosions, stunts and FX. And when you will see that some FX and stunts are sometimes so unbearably fake, you will wonder why anybody in his right mind would insist so much on putting so many of them in his movie. I am sorry but I've NEVER seen anything so bad in a JB movie as the tsunami/glacier scene. It's not even worth of a '70 movie..Yes, the acting was a lot better this time around. Even Halle Berry remembered not to outshine Brosnan with her newly-acquired Oscar. And at least, she got all the more ""physical"" scenes right. In fact, she was even believable in an assassin role. While the vilain was more or less a standard JB vilain, he wasnt out of tone. And Brosnan IS Bond (or is it the other way around?)And for the gadgets..well, let's say that the car was a bit TOO much...So all in all, Die Another Day is quite of a letdown. All the ingredients are there, all that you need to make a good James Bond movie is present.

He is no longer the smooth, wisecracking secret agent that we all have grown to love over the past 40 years. Die Another Day lacks the crucial x-factor that all good Bond films have. Yes, it still has girls, guns, explosions and gadgets. But it is missing something that you cannot really put your finger on! You just know that something is not quite right.The special effects are rubbish, I could have done better with a flick book and a pencil! The story line is poor, even by Bond standards, and things don't seem to have much continuity. Everything seems to happen completely randomly! And Halle Berry is not particularly good in her role. The gadgets are just too far fetched - an invisible car, do me a favour! What is the point in having an invisible Aston Martin, when the engine makes more noise than a Slipknot concert!Basically, this is more of a Hollywood action film (and a bad one at that) that just happens to have a guy called James Bond in it.

Might I add, that Zao belongs with the all time memorable henchman list. He belongs all the way up there with Jaws and Oddjob. The car chase was perhaps ONE OF THE BEST car chases EVER filmed. The idea of the car (which is the Aston Martin Vanquish) turning invisible (which is explained by Q) was a bit far fetched but Bond all the way.
I would also like to say that the is very fast paced. Before I knew it the movie was over. But nevertheless the movie kept my attention and on the edge of my seat. Since I am a die-hard Bond fan, I think DAD is different than past Bond films. It is hard to explain, but when you see it you'll know what I'm talking about. Verdict: 9.0/10 GO SEE THIS MOVIE Rated Brosnan Bond Films: 1. Goldeneye 2. Die Another Day 3. The World is Not Enough 4. Tomorrow Never Dies

The set pieces are there, the gadgets are very impressive as are the cars and girls. Brosnan has succeeded in making this role his own. He gives the role depth that even Connery could not achieve.

To sum it up. Brosnan is no Sean Connery. Juli Dench is no Bernard Lee. Madonna is no Shirley Bassey. Toby Stephens is no Gert Frobe. Neal Purvis is no Richard Maibaum.

Icarus is probably the best bad guy's weapon of world domination since, say Moonraker.  The V12 'Vanish' is an awesome car (the Aston Martin Vanquish is a real car).  The 'adaptive camaflage' feature is one of the coolest, yet (with current developing technologies) most plausible sci-fi ideas of recent films.Downside?

We're talking Bond material here, not Johnny Knoxville.Some seem to want a  documentary on the world of high espionage. What we get instead is much better. The Bond Franchise is about the apotheosis of a ""larger than life"", straight out of a novel fantasy  action hero dealing with super villains, in all it's incredible and improbable glory. It is, by definition, out of this world, over the top and as eccentric as it wants it to be. Go with the flow and enjoy it.You'll get extravagant, wild typical Bond sets mixed with a high level of good action. When was the last time you saw someone cut steel cables with his teeth? Moonraker. Or someone harnessing the power of the sun? Golden Gun. Was that realistic? This Bond is business as usual, a bit far fetched but not by much really.Die Another Day delivers the ingredients of a successful Bond franchise, with flying colors, backed by a strong techno track. The movie communicates with the audience visually more than anything else, like 2001 did. Dialogue aren't memorable, but the action is completely enjoyable. It also has a strong, high tech edge to it which sets it apart in many ways and makes it unique.The ""Die Another Day"" soundtrack is quite good, a pity to those who dislike Electronica. Madonna's Song is fantastic. The Bond opening sequence is simply stunning, possibly the best I've seen ever, bringing fire and ice beautifully mixed together, an excellent ode and premise to the movie.This movie is worth seeing, at least on DVD. It delivers the good all around. Forget about those bitter naysayers who seem to need something to wine about, play this one loudly and enjoy it!

Overall the film isn't a masterpiece but definitely a decent bond film.The film is incredibly entertaining, the special effects and over use of CGI make the film flawed but besides that the film is great. probably the second best of the Brosnan bonds behind Golden eye in my opinion.Overall if you like bond and want an entertaining film this is one of the best bonds of recent times",Die Another Day

When Pierce Brosnan turned up in the mid-nineties I was delighted. Here was someone who looked and acted like some strange hybrid of Connery, Dalton and Moore yet still managed to add something of his own to it. His charm was undeniable and the films that followed perfectly Bond.Except this.Die Another Day fails at every hurdle. The title song is rubbish, the plot appalling (Bond captured and tortured for a year - never!) and the characters weak. Pierce doesn't seem to want to be there, looking both tired and slightly embarrassed, while Halle Berry's character doesn't seem to make sense - one moment super strong and Bond's equal, the next a damsel in distress.Also the film drags, the effects are too many, the humour stupid and the gadgets unbelievable (Stupid bloody invisible car).Time to kill off Bond I'm afraid.",Die Another Day

After 14 months he gets released back to the MI6 where he is sent to spy on another rouge diamond trader Gustave Graves who turns out to be Moon who as gone under genetic science to change his identity. Bond carrys on his mission to kill Moon and to find his betrayer...Main Review: As this is Pierce's last outing of Bond I was rather upset as he is my favourite Bond. The movie truly showed all the actors skills and is the 20th bond in the long going franchise created by Flemming and turned into motion pictures by Cubby Broccoli. This is truly one of the best Bonds and is the first to involve CGI (computer generated images) in the movie. The producers brought back the Aston Martin which is famous in the original movies. Directed by Lee Tamahori I felt he perfected his job. I wish they made more Bonds like this.In memory of: Syd Cain (production designer and story board artist of James Bond from Dr.No to Goldeneye)",Die Another Day
621,oriaphyn,Terrible B Movie,3,13 December 2006,"Die Another Day is possibly the worst James Bond movie ever made.With that out of the way lets examine why. Pierce Brosnan seems to be going through a downhill slope of Bond scripts ever since his phenomenal Goldeneye. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Brosnan himself. Halle Berry looks slightly out of place as a Bond girl due to the lack of sophistication.The first half of the movie starts off pretty well with a nice chase in Korea and a trip to Cuba as well as a great fencing sequence. However the second half of the movie all goes downhill to hell. The so called ""Dream maker"" machine looks like something you would see from a toy store. The introduction of an invisible car causes some serious cringes. By now you'd think they'd stop with this poor storytelling but the last quarter of the movie takes place in a fortress made of ice! If this movie were entitled: Action Man - The Movie, then I could probably look past these bizarre out of place elements. But as a James Bond movie these things cannot be excused.By the end of the movie and by the time you're past caring about the plot anymore, there's a big scene involving a mechanical suit that is used to control a satellite in outer space that uses diamonds to create a powerful laser that melts the ice in Antarctica in an attempt to kill James Bond who wind surfs off a giant wave caused by the ice that's melted by the laser. No further comment.",Die Another Day
622,jmauro98,One of the better bonds,7,18 April 2006,"I haven't seen a lot of bond movies, but this was my first one i saw in the theaters. it was one of the best bonds i have seen. i actually like all bond films, so i guess it helped a lot. it also helped out that since it had really cool graphics and big explosions, seeing it on a really big screen w/ surround sound made it great. Hallie berry was great in all of her costumes. which was totally fine with me. pierce Brosdon is my second favorite person to play bond. after Sean Connery. i liked the fact the car would go invisible, but if i had it, i wouldn't keep it invisible. i would show it off to everybody and tell them why i was better then them. this is a definite yes to this movie.",Die Another Day
623,DaveBond007,........so you live to Die Another Day.......,10,22 May 2006,"What do you get when you interlace all the previous bond films and actors, high-octane action, return to the ""OTT"" bond premise, on the 20th film of a 40 year old franchise? A great capping off of the series such as Die Another Day! The adventure starts off with Pierce' betrayal and imprisonment for 14 months, as we see him abused and tortured during the ""bond"" opening sequence credits under the much hated(I personally love this song) Die Another Day by Madonna. From this point, we are sent to follow James across the globe, with his licence to kill revoked, hes a rogue agent in search for his betrayer to seek vengeance upon. We are treated to the usual cast, as well as Halle Berry as Bonds counterpart, (mmmmmmmm daddy likes) and Rosemund pike as the COLD Ms. Frost. Toby Stevens does a great job as the villain ""Gustov Graves"" and ""Zao"" is fantastic! Overall, without giving too much away, this movie is truly the mark of what has worked in bond before, but as you can see by other reviewers, what no longer works.After watching the movie over this past weekend, I realized it was made to end the Bond we all know. Every ""James Bond"" movie after Die Another Day will be a new James we haven't seen before. Every movie from Dr. No to die Another Day will no longer mean anything and ""James bond"" will be earning his 00 status in the new film ""casino royale"" Die Another day has everything we all loved about James Bond movies so why does it get such a bad wrap? Lets see. Attractive bond girls? check. ""Villian to take over the world? check. Tons of OTT action? check. New Gadgets to get the job done? check. So whats the problem?OK now we come to the bad parts of the film. (which are totally overlook able) We will start with the only gripe i have. The direction. If this movie did not have the Matrix-Style cut scenes, it would have been THE bond movie of all time. (IMO) the effects. Yes some of these (maybe only the surfing ice scene) had bad cgi effects. How many bond movies of the past had bad ""bluescreen"" effects? I lost count(though none made the movies less enjoyable) so in my own words, who cares! The only other problem i read about is how the story is recycled. For those who didn't know, this movie serves more as a shrine to previous bond films, and references many old scenes(some ppl like this some ppl don't. I love it!) I could see when Pierce read this that he didn't like the script. I can only assume this one, but in my opinion, he was reading the script and saw the end of his run as 007. And what a run at that!So don't listen to all the bad hype surrounding this movie and watch it with a new perspective. The last ""true"" bond film! All bond movies have maybe one or two things we don't like, but the rest is awesome. This movie fits the bill in every way. More along the lines of a ""moore"" bond film, but maybe thats why I loved it so much! Rated 9 out of 10. By the way, to those who talk about the invisible car ""takin it too far"" gimme a break!!! So James can have a car that turns into a sub, (in one of the most beloved bonds TSWLM) but not invisible(which is a reality, just not to the extent they show in the film) And you call yourselves TRUE James bond fans? I think not!",Die Another Day
624,janman_35,A rubbish Bond movie.,5,20 December 2006,"Apart from The Man With The Golden Gun and Moonraker, this is one of the worst Bond films. Almost all aspects of Die Another Day were rubbish. The usually brilliant Pierce Brosnan seemed uncomfortable in the film and I found Halle Berry irritating. The story was crap, and it became too clever for its own good. Some Bond films have had strange gadgets before, but the invisible Aston Martin seemed to be some kind of joke and the ring that broke glass was also just silly. The action sequences weren't very exciting; the hovercraft one was dull, the fencing scene went on for too long and not much seemed to happen in the rocket car chase. The special effects were dire, the tsunami Bond rode over was shocking and you just couldn't believe he was surfing over it. An awful film.",Die Another Day
625,dawdobb,Bond film? I don't think so.,2,10 May 2006,"It is generally accepted among bond fans (and by that I mean people who have seen all or most of the films) that 'The man with the golden gun' is the weakest of the series to date. Here, however, we have an incredibly hot contender.'Die another day' is the most unrealistic, far fetched and utterly ridiculous film I have ever seen. The characters, despite the film having a star studded cast, are too unbelievable and we are supposed to accept that villains and allies alike have survived terrible deaths and have returned with a new face and body. I mean come on. A satellite that can burn holes in the earth. I wonder how they got that up there unnoticed.Bond films do, stereotypically, have a few @as if they could do that' moments. But this isn't the only fault of this film. Piece Brosnan gives a weak and down - trodden performance, while the two leading ladies are so sexed up and gagging for it that it's hard to believe that they are anything other than shallow and one dimensional characters. Even performances from Dench, Cleese and Samantha Bond are kept to a minimum and seem rather stressed out, grumpy, and very difficult to get along with.The film does afford some excellent shots of tropical beaches, Artic ice-fields and grotty North Korea, which all add different moods to the film, providing it with variety and spice. This, however, is undermined by the ridiculous stunts and gadgets which are basically this film's main downfall.For me, the bond series ended with 'The world is not enough'.

""Die another day"" continues the line that started in ""The world is not enough"". He is not a perfect gentleman anymore, he is more a mixture between SpiderMan, Annakin Skywalker and John McClane (""Die Hard""). Sometimes I felt they have based the story on the computer game ""Unreal Tournament"".The plot was quite predictable. The stunts were extraordinary, but there are only a few directors/writers that understand that sequence of good action scenes do not make a good movie and do not save a bad plot.I think, this is one of the weakest Bond movies ever made. It's still good entertainment but for a Bond movie, I had expected more. The producers have taken a step back from the good movie ""The world is not enough"" towards the weaker Pierce-Brosnan-films such as ""Golden Eye"".

628,Amanset,"The worst Bond since ""Moonraker""",3,1 December 2002,"As a friend of mine said as we left the cinema, ""Hollywood has stolen Bond"". Of course Bond has always been part of Hollywood, but the franchise has always managed to retain some of its individuality. It never went completely over the top, apart from the ""Star Wars"" cash-in ""Moonraker"". That is until now.Much has been made of how this film has broken all the records for product placement and how this has signified Bond ""selling out"". To be honest, apart from a few Sony Ericsson placements it mostly feels quite natural. Where Bond has really sold out is that all the subtlety has been removed and replaced by bang after explosion after stunt. The previous occasional quick humourous quips have been replaced by entire conversations where people try to outdo each other by the way of the tongue. The element of ""possible reality"", where everything has been far-fetched but not so far-fetched that there isn't the glimmer of possibility, has been thrown right out of the window just like it was with ""Moonraker"". I mean, a car with a Star Trek-style cloaking device?Another element which brings the film down is the frankly appalling computer graphics. At times (for example, when Bond is surfing whilst escaping from the Icarus beam) the graphics are so poor they don't look much better than a videogame. Give me real stunts and a larger element of reality over this any day.This Bond has just taken it too far. In trying to out-do every Bond for the anniversary it has successfully managed to avoid everything that made Bond great. Bond has been through revelations before, for example Timothy Dalton's reinvention of Bond as a tough guy after Roger Moore had pulled it down to the level of a poor comedy. Bond needs it again now, as the franchise has been dragged too far from its roots. It is no longer separate from the pretenders to the crown. It is trying to play the same game as the others - and if this film is anything to go by then it is losing.",Die Another Day

After the waning that was ""The World is Not Enough"", my hopes were high that Pierce Brosnan and the Bond film team could make a comeback and deliver the same sort of great movies we saw in Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies.Alas, I was destined to be disappointed.Die Another Day is filled to the gills with classic Bond-isms like vehicle-wrecking chase scenes, over the top villains, troublesome and willful femme fatales, space based superweapons, and not-so-secret bases. Unfortunately, the over the top villains lack the rub of the real of villains from many earlier Bond flick (following the tradition of tepid villains from the last film), the guest characters (and their relationship to Bond) are shallow and unconvincing, and the plot is not only unsurprising and simplistic, it resorts too readily to handwaving to conjure it's space based weapon.In short, this movie has all the elements of classic Connery and Moore-era bond flicks, but is much less convincing.The modern movie-making elements aren't that compelling, either. Action and chase scenes are okay but not exciting or tense, and special effects range for tepid to bad. The image of bond surfing on an iceberg-induced wave looked rather fake.Cap that off with a plastic theme song and cameo appearance by Madonna and you have the makings of a movie that is better than The World is Not Enough, but only marginally.",Die Another Day
631,UntitledTxt,"Succeeds on every level, a classic 007 film",10,24 November 2002,"This latest addition to the most time-tested film series of all delivers the very difficult balance of successfully transitioning itself into the 21st century and appropriately paying homage to four decades of the the world's most popular movie franchise. This film is a glorious success on many levels...the team of veterans involved in this twentieth project of the series that has the most loyal fan base in entertainment history have, in the face of many challenges, produced what ranks with ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""From Russia with Love"" as one of the greatest James Bond films ever made.Much has been said about the spared-no-expense budget and numerous product placements for this film in the hype preceding its release, not to mention the endless buzz from critics suggesting that the series is aging, that the series lacks the young audience that have made ""Austin Powers"" one of the most bankable movie characters today. In the words of Mel Brooks, ""Critics can't even make music by rubbing their back legs together.""
This film succeeds on several levels. All of the elements that make this franchise so phenomenally successful work as well as 007's astonishing high-performance Aston Martin Vanquish. The casting of Halle Berry was a stroke of perfection; she as every bit as delightful to watch as Ursula Andress was forty years ago, and that could not have been said about any other actress in a Bond film in the four decades between them. When John Cleese(Q), who makes a smooth transition onto the screen from his greatly-missed predecessor, and presents the best car ever in a Bond film, the Aston Martin draws as many oohs and ahs as Halle Berry. The action sequences and sets are breathtaking and endlessly elaborate. Although Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) seems more like a elitist spoiled brat than a menacing villain, General Zao(Rick Yune) is chillingly evil and a good match for 007.As for Brosnan, who has shown since his debut in the role seven years ago that he is born for the part, he is pushing his limits physically. He seems out of breath for half of the film, and it seems as though he should let the stuntman have more to do now that he is pushing fifty. To his credit, he has not made the mistake of his predecessors Connery and Moore by getting to comfortable in the part. He seems to be pushing the role as far as he can, and he gives the most physical performance of his career in ""Die Another Day,"" one of the best action movies ever made which will most definitely rank as one of the classics in the series.-JB",Die Another Day

We've seen giant lasers, and space battles enough, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, and Goldeneye all had something to do with space, but were all unique. World War III, Ransom, a New Human Race, and crash the stock market! All original, and very cool. But this one, Halle was not at all the best Bond Girl. Shes hot an all, but she competes too much with the Star, Pierce. Another boring aspect, we've seen a giant space laser before, and it was cooler when it wasn't all in fakey CGI. Most of the action here was in CGI, which is very distinct. Like when Bond is surfing the title wave in Iceland using a Parachute. The sword fight in the London fencing house was the best part of the movie. AWESOME PART! It is the best BOND-LIKE aspect in this movie.

637,shakezuulla,Worst of the Worst,1,20 November 2006,"OK, so most of us know that the Bond franchise is plagued with bad movies after the first five with Sean Connery, but DIE ANOTHER DAY is the worst of the worst.Pierce is getting up there by the time this movie comes out, and it seems that his role as Bond has run its course. Still, there's a little life left in him and it's kind of nice to see him once again reprising the role. If anything, the Brosnan years have brought about action packed Bond films for a very mid-90's feel to them. Than there is DIE ANOTHER DAY. It has action, it has Bond, but it is thrown together in the biggest train wreck of a movie. The CGI is totally over the top, the stunts are so outrageous that you start to feel that Bond has become a living, BAD video game. There was too much to pay attention to, and the plot was so over the top unbelievable, it makes it seem like ever other James Bond movie was a true story. (Yes it's that bad.)There is one more thing to comment on before I close this review, the Bond Girl. During the time this, Halle Berry was flavor of the month when it came to movies. (Pretty much all of Pierce's Bond girls were.) There is absolutely no appeal when it comes to her being a Bond girl. She was the worst of them all, mainly because she tried to add ""wit"" to her character. She has said that her character was an equal to James Bond...far from it. If anything, her trying to be an equal made her far more inferior. Also, if she was so hot, why did they make her wear a bathing suit almost the same as Ursula Andreas? There was no originality to her Bond girl, nothing that makes her stand, other than her name. Stunning? no. memorable? no. She really compares in comparison.DIE ANOTHER DAY is not worthy of being a Bond movie.

638,Movie_Finder,Exceeded my expectations,7,14 December 2002,"The first thing I heard about this movie from my friends was that it was not that good and a bit too long - no match for Goldeneye. So going into the movie, I was not expecting such big things as the friends who told me this are regarded as 'talented movie critics' by myself. The opening scene was very captivating and exciting; the sounds and incredible effects were astonishing. This was consistent throughout the movie and, of course, you were introduced to a few new innovative gadgets. The story line was good and I thought the acting was relatively good and everybody played their characters as well as they should have. The only negative comment for the movie is that some scenes were grossly unrealistic and - although this is common in some Bond films - really hard to believe. Overall I thought this was a very good James Bond movie; it had all the attributes to be a great film: action, explosions, special effects, romance, gadgets and amazing cars! I rate this film 8/10 and although I don't think it is quite as good as Goldeneye (which will be VERY difficult to top in the Brosnan Era) I recommend you go see it.",Die Another Day
639,doyler,Good as always...,8,25 November 2002,"OK, P. Brosnan is good as Bond.  The movie was good but the bad guys are all cut out of the same mold.  We need one without a scared face or real weird stuff, just a plain bad guy with Bond-likeness.  H. Berry was great of course but I would have liked to seen the other Bond-girl R. Pike a lot more.FX were pretty good except for the surfing the ice waves at the end...it was very poor CG and look cartoonish.But still Bond rules!",Die Another Day
640,vicster_,"A fun, action packed thrill ride.",10,23 November 2002,"Having seen the trailer for this movie and anticipating a roller-coaster ride with Britain's top secret agent, I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out even better then I expected. Visually the movie is stunning - the locations are beautiful, ranging from North Korean forests to the beaches of Havana. The camera work is amazing, zooming in and out of the shot and providing the perfect point of view to fully enjoy and appreciate the action. The storyline is a definite improvement on the earlier Brosnan installments, providing its share of twists and turns. For the first time ever in the Bond series we see the vulnerable side of Bond, and stop thinking of him as an indestructible superhuman who can get out of any situation with minimal effort. The enemy in this installment is a worthy adversary and the Bond girl, apart from being visually attractive also has style and a personality of her own, and is not overshadowed by Bond. Overall the movie was a fun, action packed thrill ride. We have to stop comparing every new Bond movie to the Connery classics, complaining that ""back in the day it would have been a lot better"" Well, we live now, and we have to learn to enjoy and appreciate what we have at the moment. And what we do have is a worthy installment of the most popular franchise in the movie industry.",Die Another Day
641,louise_is_goldilockz,not particularly good,7,7 December 2002,"the plot is quite complex, no one is sure of the bad guys plan until he does it. so ti is impossible to understand the film until the very end. the design of the car is very silly and unrealistic.

642,DirkPitt007,The best Bond in years...,10,30 November 2002,"James Bond is back, and proves that not only was he the ultimate screen hero for the 20th century, but will also remain king of action cinema in the 21st as well.The film features Pierce Brosnan as Agent 007 in his fourth turn in the role, and it seems that he just gets better and better in each film.  In GoldenEye, Brosnan turned out a strong first effort, proving that he could carry the character.  In Tomorrow Never Dies, he seemed even more the part. But in The World Is Not Enough, Pierce proved that he IS James Bond.  And in Die Another Day, Pierce gave the best Bond performance in the series, showing both the very human and very flawed character, while also giving us the indestructable, unstoppable superhuman secret agent that emerged during the mid-60s and 70s.As for the other actors, only one thing can be said - TOP NOTCH.  The usual MI6 staff returns to give fantastic performances (Dame Judi Dench is once again incredible as Bond's superior, as is Colin Salmon as Robinson, her chief of staff, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, and a brilliant John Cleese as the new Q, who makes you think that he's always been a member of the series ever since Dr. No - look to see if you can catch the obscure Monty Python reference...).  Although, most notable is Toby Stephens, who plays the millionaire industrialist Gustav Graves.  There was talk around the release of GoldenEye that EON could not use the same kind of villains that Bond fought in the 60s.  Graves, however, is that type of villain, and suceeds brilliantly.  Stephens adds depth to the role and is fantastically sinister, providing some of the series' greatest lines (""You see, Mr. Bond...You can't kill my dreams.  But my dreams can kill you."").  At his side is the sinister Zao, played effectively by Rick Yune.  Zao is the most memorable henchman in years - with diamonds imbedded in his face, which is now absolutely white, and with blue eyes.  As for Halle Berry (Jinx) and Rosamund Pike (Miranda Frost), they are both very strong characters, and make memorable additions to the Bond Girl Hall of Fame.The action sequences in this are very well done.  The sword fight between Graves and Bond that occurs in a club when they first meet is remarkable, with fantastic choreographing.  The car chase in this film (as Zao chases Bond, in his gadget-laden Aston Martin V12 Vanquish, in his own gadget-laden Jaguar XKR) is perhaps the best in the series.For any Bond fan, or even someone looking for a great action movie, Die Another Day is the answer...",Die Another Day

The opening wasn't up to high standards that I have come to expect from the Bond series, and 3/4's of the way through the film, we were treated to the single cheesiest piece of CGI that I have seen in a major budget film in a long time. Ignoring that, Halle Berri, was a spectacular ""Bond Girl"", and Toby Stephens, and Rick Yune were creditable villains.

Bond to my mind should at least look vaguely plausible with his stunts and gadgets even if he may be a fictional character, Ian Fleming would probably be turning in his grave if he saw how this latest outing for his hero turned out. I found it hard to rate any of this film except for the two chase sequences (Hover-craft and the ice chase in the Aston). An invisible car? what were the writers thinking with that one! I was cringing from the moment that Madonna opened the film with what has to be the worst Bond theme ever, it has none of the flair of the other films and believe it or not it didn't get any better. My advice to people is to give this film a wide berth and if you have to, wait for the DVD next year if only to complete your Bond collection, at least you only have to watch the two half decent chapters in it!",Die Another Day

Halle Berry and Rosumand Pike are both sexy bond girls (as is Samantha Bond in her own right) and Toby Stephens and Rick Yune are decent baddies. Not to mention the fact you've got Judi Dench and the good fun John Cleese in this film and they've know got a more post-modern edge on these films. However, the one thing that lets this film down are the special effects. The special effects on the invisible Aston Martin are something that could have been seen better in a computer game or an 80's film and there look like a bit of stop motion in the where that solar car flies or the of the mountain. Come on, with all the money that gets spent on Bond films you can afford decent special effects, surely. Must try better for next movie, which isn't called Everything or Nothing.",Die Another Day
646,pottugrapher,best bond yet,10,1 December 2002,"Bond is back and better than ever before. Pierce Brosnan returns as the superspy for his 4th and the best Bond film, and it turns out that he hasn't lost it, if not picked it up. Die Another Day goes deeper into the character of 007, this time Bond is acting out of revenger for a villian that betrayed him, subjecting him to 14 months of torture. The baddies are great this time; much more believable and vicious as compared to TWINE, when we had a guy who couldn't feel pain and a double-crossing vixen. Rick Yune and Toby Stephens, who play Zao and Gustav Graves respectively, are magnificent. Bond is, as usual classy and cool, while Halle Berry's experience as a Bond girl is captivating [especially her entrance =)] Not to forget John Cleese who succeeds Desmond Llewylyn as Q, stages, together with Brosnan, the funniest gadget presenting scene yet. Seems like Cleese is filling Llewylyn's huge shoes to perfection. Judi Dench as M and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny are perfect as well.The action comes thick and fast, from the tank chase in Korea to the final showdown in the airplane. However, the best scene to me was the car chase in the ice palace. The gadgets, explosions and driving are all choreographed to impeccable precision. Speaking of cars, the one thing wrong with this film is an invisible car. I mean, how believable is that? Maybe the producers decided to include the car for a punchline in the abandoned train station. 2 full hours of Bond plus a little more, definitely worth the time. It WILL leave you breathless with explosive action and special effects coupled with witty one liners and of course... the ladies. Truly is sex for dinner and death for breakfast.",Die Another Day

This marks a change from regular Bond, but not so much the fans disliked it (like Licence to Kill) but more like revamped so that it was acceptable to people of the new era (like Goldeneye).This is probably why people don't like as other Brosnan efforts, because so much has changed, but in a genre that contains The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings, they must change it to keep it fresh.The actors and actresses are used to the full of their abilities (except for Berry, who is an Oscar winner).

I am prepared to give a lot of leeway when it comes to Bond films, but even this one did step over the mark.  It ranks with Moonraker for me as one of the worst Bond films.It is not an inherently bad film, but it could have been so much better. Lee Tamahori is a good director who should have put more of his own stamp on it.  I do not think he has done anything as good as Once Were Warriors.Some of the special effects are amateur and many of the sets look like a 60's film set.  It lacks heart, feeling and you certainly do not empathise with either side.The most amazing shots are at the start (big waves) and even that is all too brief and has no really ending to the sequence.I am very down about this and would suggest that even big Bond fans pride themselves by saying they have not seen it!  We deserve more, we have been brought up with these films since the mid 60's.  We are not stupid, next time make a real Bond film.",Die Another Day
649,cookscourt,James Bond?,1,16 December 2002,"For those who haven't seen it yet, ***SPOILERS*** follow.For me, and for many others, James Bond is a unique character who was established for decades by Sean Connery and Roger Moore. The producers quickly learned with the first few movies starring Sean Connery that the hard core Bond of the Flemming novels needed some adaptation to survive and they did a superlative job of doing so for quite some time.As such, there is, (or I should say, WAS), a certain surrealistic magic about the James Bond character which allowed us movie goers to transcend reality and truly escape the headlines we all read daily regarding the heroes who die too young. During this period, if you wanted all out action and violence in a movie, you went to a Schwartznegger, Stalone, etc flick.Certain rules, which have applied to James Bond for a long time, have been stripped away by most of the so called ""Bond"" films since Roger Moore's era and were ably and completely done away with in this film, such as:1) Bond NEVER gets caught. Well, OK. He can get caught by the bad guy, threatened, bragged at by the Bad guy, then escape in just the nick of time and foil his plan. Truth be known, he could have escaped whenever he wanted to, but allowed himself to be held for a day or two just to learn more from the ""inside.""2) Bond NEVER gets tortured endlessly. Maybe roughed up, but not tortured for over a year. His quick wit and matchless skills simply won't allow it.3) Bond is NEVER in a situation from which his unmatched genius, talent, and cool can't save him.4) Bond NEVER gets abandoned by his country or told by his superior that if it were up to her, he would still be rotting in prison. He might get a disapproving sneer from a stuffed shirt government rep, but deep down he's appreciated and respected for his talents and bravery.Yet in ""Die Another Day"", we are presented with a James Bond who gets captured for 14 months, ruthlessly tortured by near drowning and scorpion stings, with anti venom used to bring him back from the brink of death time and time again. There was no doubt that he was captured, was to remain so, was completely at his captors mercy, and there was no way he could figure a way to escape.At the end of the 14 months, when Bond thought he was going to be executed, he started walking that ""last mile"" out of the prison camp clearly in a hopeless situation in which he was going to be unceremoniously shot in the back with no way out. You could even see the look of broken despair and hopelessness on Brosnan's face as he walked bravely forward. One is reminded of Roger Moore in ""Live and Let Die"", when he is being quite literally walked out to a back alley by multiple thugs, spots an opportunity and takes out the gun men handily. A good job of acting out the role of helplessness, exhaustion, and nearly mental collapse by Brosnan, but simply not a fit for James Bond.Last, but not least, when he realizes he is being traded and gets met by the ""good guys"", he is injected with a sedative and wakes up in a high tech ""prison"" of sorts where M tells him that if it were up to her, he would still be rotting in prison, that his freedom was bought at too high a price, that they suspect he was broken and gave away priceless secrets, and that he was to remain in their custody until she deemed it fit to release him.I could go on, but the movie does so, (unfortunately), illustrating my point, so why bother?In the real world, an agent with a license to kill and put on assignments like James Bond would probably not last very long. There are undoubtedly such heroes giving their lives daily in the protection of freedom and human rights which we will never hear about, as well as others who we do hear about. But the true Bond character is not real world. Rather, he stands unique. He allows us to escaped the carnage of real life and believe for a few fleeting moments, that the good guy really can survive AND save the day, and do it with suave and cool. What a shame they have ruined the franchise that was so ably established for decades.Perhaps M's words to Bond summarized things best: Bond is not England's celebrated, priceless treasure anymore, not the man who stands head and shoulders above the rest. He does not walk coolly and calmly down the path to certain death, only to cheat death yet again simply because he is, well, ""BOND, JAMES BOND!"" In fact, at this point, he can be captured without displaying the wits necessary to escape, tortured endlessly, and taken out to the back ally and shot, in just the same manner as with any other John Doe in the real world. In fact, he is not even to be trusted and has been locked away indefinitely.For my part, I've given the industry moguls many years to clean up the mess they've made of this franchise, and they will not get another dime of mine to see this (not even) poor excuse for James Bond they have been portraying recently in any future movies.",Die Another Day

651,jamie-wire,Shaken and Stirred with anger,5,22 November 2002,"I decided very early on in the making of Bond 20 that I would avoid almost all spoilers, and watch this film totally fresh. I tried a similar approach with the last Bond film (The World Is Not Enough) after spoiling myself for Tomorrow Never Dies, and really enjoyed it. And I think I did pretty well. No reviews, no interviews, few rumours, little gossip, nothing much beyond the initial launch push when filming commenced. I even managed to avoid the theme tune.My fears first grew regarding the direction that Lee Tahamori was taking Mr Bond when I saw the trailer for the film earlier in the year. It was all-action, no dialogue, little substance. I also recall being less than taken with the film's title when it was announced. In a way the title, so reminiscent of that many other titles in the series, reflects the film's intrinsic weaknesses. It lacks originality. It is nothing new. It's self-referencing. It is harking back to something from the past. But is it past it?There is no reason for Die Another Day to be the worst Bond film ever, but I believe that it is. Even the weakest entries in the series previous to this one could be looked at in the context of film in that time. Personally, I don't like Thunderball, nor it's awful remake, and I really hope that plans for a third incarnation are firmly on the backburner for eternity, but it was a Fleming story, and was released in the 1960s. For Your Eyes Only, A View To A Kill and Licence To Kill have all come under attack from fans over the years, but I challenge anyone to rate them below Die Another Day.The critics are polarised on Die Another Day, but it seems to me that the more mainstream popcorn munching hacks loved this film, just as they'll love the next Arnie film, or the next instalment of XXX. The same critics who probably loved Armageddon, which I truly believe to be the worst film ever released to an unsuspecting public. And here is where I think I can put my finger on what is so bad about Die Another Day, the reason why I feel so upset at the direction James Bond has taken.James Bond, the suave and sophisticated British spy, was once Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred. Not anymore, my friends. Now James Bond is cheap lager and ready salted crisps, with a kebab wolfed down for afters. Made for the masses, and not particularly well at that. All surface, no substance. And the taste will unfortunately linger on for a while after.
SPOILERSI don't believe any film can exist on special effects alone, and Die Another Day highlights that more spectacularly than any of its ridiculous set-pieces. Someone asked me why I didn't like the film, and I replied 'Cheesy and OTT'.  Yet such a criticism can be levelled at almost any entry in the series, but I don't believe that it would be the case on such a scale.But maybe it's the world we live in. Maybe because of the perceived threat to global peace, the studio, writers and director elected to push the fantasy level higher than before. Maybe that's why Die Another Day echoes Bond of the 1960s, with grand plans to dominate the world, daft super-weapons and caricature villains. The only progression seems to be giving the girl a brain, even if the raunchiness factor has been upped considerably.Seeing as Bond 20 is the 40th anniversary of the series, the decision was taken to load the film with homages to the past. The scene of Halle Berry emerging from the ocean in Cuba was of course a nod to Dr No, and I really hope that the AWFUL computer-generated section of Bond surfing/paragliding in Iceland was a knowing wink to the terrible actor/car-superimposed-over-backscreen scenarios that epitomised early cinema. However, at least then it was a down to technology allowing little else, but in 2002 there can be no excuse for such an appalling effect.I won't waste any time dwelling on the characters or plot of Die Another Day, as that's exactly the same attitude that the makers of this rancid turkey seem to have adopted rather early in production. I would advise any diehard fan of the series to think twice about seeing this film as their attitude towards Bond may change forever as a result.One last thing: in the showing that I attended, a day prior to general release, there were probably 15 people in the cinema. There was one less though as soon as Madge's song piped up. Kind of appropriate I guess, but Madge's song is the worst bond them bar none, and it goes well alongside the worst Bond film bar none. Its sound is far too 2002, just as Bond 20 is far too 2002. Bring back tradition, and lose the cameos! Madonna and that show-jumper Oliver Skeete don't belong in Bond films.I dread 2004 and the release of James Bond 21: Flogging A Dead HorseJames Bond Will Return - although for the first time ever, I wish he wouldn't.",Die Another Day
652,J-M-Arrowsmith,Why has Bond changed all of a sudden?,5,23 November 2002,"*May contain spoilers*From the opening gun barrel sequence, with the additional bullet flying towards the camera, I knew something was wrong with the 20th Bond outing. I thought it was strange that, to celebrate the 20th film and 40th year, the makers of Die Another Day created a film as far removed from the 19 predecessors as they could get.From the very start, the difference is noticeable. As Bond starts his mission by surfing into a Korean military base, the poor continuity of the waves is something that would never be seen in any other Bond film. Director Lee Tamahori made his name with ""Once Were Warriors"", but ""assured"" us that he could handle action with the mediocre ""The Edge"". He can't, or at least not the kind of action we are used to in a Bond film. Much of the time it is hard to understand exactly what is happening in the action scenes. This is mainly down to the super-modern Matrix style camera work, or the often erratic editing, but you also get the feeling that Tamohori didn't really film enough footage - with events not really having any noticeable cause. The pre-credits sequence is an example of this, where so much is happening at the same time, it is disorientating for the audience. Many of the people in my cinema spent the entire film muttering with confusion.
The overall tone of the film is strikingly different too. I don't want to go into the story too much, but certain scenes, such as the one where Bond induces cardiac arrest on himself is just....out of place. The whole film seems as though it has been made by a new set of producers who want to make something drastically different to something which was perfectly fine (and successful) as it was. The shots of the heart monitor imposed over Bond's face seem more at home in an episode of Casualty or ER when the director has tried to be a bit too artistic.The biggest surprise came from the title credits. Most people criticise Madonna's theme song, but i thought it fit in well with the rest of the film. Nothing really seemed out of place in this film - it was all a bit bizarre - just the film seemed out of place with the franchise. Anyway, the idea of having the actual story of Bond's torture unfold over the credits was a bit strange and didn't really work. Fair enough for trying to be different, it just looked a bit tacky. Some of the images were abit lame too - dancing scorpions? The funny thing is, my favourite Bond films are Roger Moore's - those with the over the top camp humour. The fact that this film contained such scenes, and didn't really acknowledge that it was a bit crappy, i think was it's downfall.Now the script. Recently they have all been a little uninspired - I suppose there are only so many double entendres in the world that the script writers are finding it hard to find those which haven't been used - but this did seem like it had been written by a 14 year old and in a rush at that - strange since this film took longer in production that usual (3 years instead of 2). The scene when Bond first meets Jinx, and all they do is look awkward and mutter ""innuendos"" at one another is embarrassing. Throughout the whole film, the jokes were extremly obvious and disappointing - sometimes not even innuendos at all but just smutty remarks. At the final scene where bond and Jinx are in bed together and we hear her asking him not to ""take it out"", by this time I actually expected it to be referring to his penis.The sad thing is, the film was crammed with imaginative ideas and concepts, with most of the characters providing an interesting premise, had they been further developed. Halle Berry as Jinx, I feel was over-rated and proves no more an equal to Bond as Anya Amasova or Holly Goodhead. Yes she is as witty as him (not hard in this film) and can hold a gun, but he still has to be rescued by Bond on a number of occasions and the whole female James Bond/rival spy thing is getting a bit boring. Miranda Frost was a nice idea for a character, but unfortunately Rosamund pike seemed to lack the experience - this being her first feature film - to pull it off, mistaking talking in a overly posh, private school accent for being icy and cool. Her fencing skills were never really demonstrated, except in a rushed and confusing fight at the end. Zao was a truely unique character, but the film had angered me so much by the time he was properly introduced, I hated the fact that a DNA expert could change his face but not remove a few diamonds. In any Bond film a certain amount of disbelief suspension is vital, however this film required so much mine was ready to break. Again, Gustav Graves was an interesting character and rather well played by Toby Stevens, however when his motives (which never become entirely clear) and identity are revealed, you'll feel cheated and disappointed.The special effects. Before I saw the film, I was extremely disappointed to hear that many of the set pieces would involve CGI - as opposed to the Bond tradition of having actually carried out the stunts. The result was that many of the set pieces, which would have been perfectly enjoyable had they used stuntmen, models etc. looked overly fake and so lost all excitement. I know that James Bond isn't real, but to reinforce that by creating him digitally takes way any belief that what is happening is at all dangerous. Scenes which in any other film, such as the technically superb car chase between Bond and Zao, lost any element of suspense because they looked so unrealistic, and by this time, I had seen so much over-the-top computer work, it was hard to be bowled over. The worst ever scene from any Bond film was the one where Bond uses a makeshift surfboard to escape a tidal wave. Pierce Brosnan's stupid gurning face (which come to think of it is present in all his films) made me want to look away. He used the exact same expression whilst in bed with Jinx, and whilst being strangled on the chair in TWINE, and whilst being squeezed by Xenia in Goldeneye. I never thought that the actor playing Bond could be criticised, but in this film, Brosnan just seemed cocky and irritating. I did actually hope that he and Jinx WOULD go down together.There were some truely entertaining scenes, especially the sword fight between Gustav and Bond, also John Cleese's Q was genuinely funny. Apart from that the film had a nasty sense of trying to appeal to too many people. I know Bond films are there to make money - of course, they always have been, it's just that apart from teenage fans of xXx, I can't really see who else it would appeal too. Certainly not traditional enough to please the die hard fans, yet too self referential to appeal to a non Bond familiar audience, let's hope Barbara, Michael et al soon get over this horrible adolescent phase they're going through and provide us with more of the Bond that we know and love.PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM A HUGE BOND FAN AND THIS IS THE FIRST THAT I HAVE DISLIKED IN ANY WAY.",Die Another Day

Bond has a what i call ""proper bond objective"". Bond has been restricted recently by trying to be too realistic, realism is welcome but in moderation, this is back in the old spirit of exotic locations, cool gadgets and great bond girls, a bit surreal at times but thats what bond is about, its about lapsing into a different world being taken off and enjoying your time as you see the plot unravel before your eyes.

In Bonds case it isn't ever about story anymore. There is no development of character as in the books ( though the beginning comes closer that the character has in years), but it becomes a story, not of a man who succeeds through ruthlessness and native intelligence combined with training and nerve, but by more and more unbelievable stunts.Go back and watch the from Russia with Love.

657,Joseph_Mastro,"After a promising start, little to recommend; way too long.",5,27 June 2003,"**Mild Spoiler Warning **The opening sequences of Die Another Day were well worthy of the 007 legacy, and with an interesting twist. After being captured and tortured by an enemy, Bond is disowned and works his way back into his job.  Brosnan's acting during these sequences was credible and played well to an adult audience.   But ever so gradually, the movie devolves into an uninteresting adolescent cartoon.  The reasons for this creep of boredom are numerous: a miscast Halle Berry, gadgets that are second-rate, a story line that emerges as a retread from a prior Bond film, and bad guys that just don't feel sufficiently significant. And to make matters worse, the movie refuses to end, with at least 20 minutes of footage that are unnecessary.  The end product is a weak version of a Roger Moore Bond film, with slightly better special effects.  I rate this a 5/10.",Die Another Day
658,bmldb5,A Sad Farewell,3,28 November 2015,"Die Another Day was produced in a year that coincided with an anniversary for the franchise, the 40th year of 007 being on the big screen. In Bonds case Rubies do not shine as brightly as Gold. The pre & post opening title sequences are the best part of this film with a fantastic surfing opener leading to a great hovercraft chase sequence. It is at this point we are introduced to a side of 007 that we have never seen before, a helpless, desolate individual, which was unique to the series at the time. Unfortunately the rest of this entry looses its way with to much embarrassing, cringe worthy innuendoes, a criminal use of CGI and to much emphasis on a nostalgia trip. You can forgive the production team for wanting to provide some nods, due to the 40 year milestone, but the ""Vanish"" was a step to far! Providing a Aston Martin V12 Vanquish with a cloaking devise, just so the script can re-create the classic DB5 introduction scene in Goldfinger, is to much. 40th anniversary or not, this is a Bond film, not StarTrek! CGI is a big feature in this edition, the most you will see in the franchise. Like Indiana Jones, Bond films are well known for their live stunts and I believe if you can't create a scene in a Bond film without using CGI, then you should go back to the drawing boards. The windsurfing scene in DAD is were I rest my case!!! When Cubby handed the rains over to Michael and Barbara, his advise was if they ever got stuck for ideas, always return to the original format. This advise was not taken for DAD, a sad ending to Brosnan's tenure as 007.",Die Another Day

His handling of the role is confident and perfectly judged. You almost get the impression he could play the part in his sleep.Everything from the chase scenes in the introductory section to the closing scenes, is done with a solid dose of humour. Brosnan as ably supported by Halle Berry, Rosamund Pike and Toby Stephens plus the regulars of Judi Dench and Samantha Bond, both as superb as ever in their roles. A revelation is John Cleese's 'Q', who demonstrates he's perfect for the role of supplying Bond with the most outrageous set of gadgets yet.

Yes it will make a fortune but at the cost of losing die hard bond fans like myself.My List Of Bad Points.1.Gunbarrel Music plus that Bullet. 2.Pre-title sequence was messy. 3.Titles starting at a strange point, plus seeing clips of the film i the title. 4.Bond being abandoned by M.

Bond is supposed the only have these. 12.Falco 13.Gustavs Graves Weapon. Too much OTT for my liking. 14.The final scene on the Anatov.

His role was brilliant. 2.The nod and winks to the previous 19 films. 3.Bond smoking again!! 4.Colin Salmon as Charles Robinson.

664,xanadu007,"Brosnan's Best, but not best in the series",8,23 November 2002,"I was as skeptical as every long time fan going into this one. Although Brosnan himself has played a great Bond, his movies with the possible exception of Goldeneye have been subpar at best (think The World is not Enough).The prologue is one of the best in the series. Although it is a bit long, the rest of the movie is set up around it. Also seeing Bond shoot land mines with his machine gun made all fans of the GoldenEye game smile as old memories were recalled.This movie was especially a reward for fans who have stayed loyal to the series after all these years. A huge amount of hidden references to the older films. Ex. ""Diamond's are Foreveryone"" and the Q-Lab archive (you may have noticed the briefcase and spike shoe from FRWL or the Thunderball Jetpack). Also the true fan's jaw dropped during the end sequence involving Moneypenny.In the end this movie is a back to the basics of the series with a new edge for the 21st century. Although Desmond's Q is absent John Cleese takes over the role with a definate new wit. Judi Dench is edgy as M as usual, and who will forget Miranda and Jinx's climatic ending which easily overshadows Bond and Graves.Pierce Brosnan is James Bond. He proves it here.

The invisible car, the robocop style suit   that the villain wears and over the top set pieces (yes over the top even for a bond film) all seem to be thrown into the film for little reason and serve little functon. bond himself is given little to do but to become ""more emotional"" which is destroying the much loved character.  he is becoming more of a wet blanket , then a super spy with a lience to kill.

668,Great Cthulhu,Inferior Bond-age,3,10 December 2002,"SPOILER WARNINGI gather that this film was intended as a tribute to the Bond series, taking advantage of the date (40 years after Dr. No) and the film's position in the series (number 20).  This is used an an excuse to recycle plots, scenes and stunts from previous films.  Halle Berry emerges from the waves in a reprise of Ursula Andress' famous entry and Bond meets John Cleese's Q in a storeroom filled with old Bond gadgets; Rosa Klebb's shoe, the jet pack from Thunderball, the alligator disguise from Octopussy.  Even the plot was recycled from Diamonds are Forever; a former enemy of Bond returns from the dead with a new face, running a diamond scam to build his orbital death ray.I would be the last person to insist that Bond should be, or ever has been, original.  What I object to is that smug self-referencing seems to have been the primary concern when making the film.  The intent was obviously to celebrate all things Bond, but the result just seems rather empty compared to previous films.  Perhaps it is down to the reliance on CGI stunts; Bond escaping a crashing Hercules in a jeep (Living Daylights) is still impressive.  In this film, they try to repeat the stunt, but making it ""bigger and better,"" using a larger plane (a Galaxy?) with Bond escaping in a helicopter, but the reaction is more of a non-committal shrug.  The first version looked impressive because you know they did actually throw a jeep out of a plane.  The updated stunt is obviously done with CGI, so it doesn't engage you as much. The sequence in which Bond ""parasurfs"" is particularly poorly done. The director also has an obsession with using ""bullet-time"" slow motion sequences in the oddest places.  Whereas The Matrix used this technique for reality-warping stunts, we see them almost every five minutes here. When the villains leave the ice-palace, when Bond lifts Jinx from the car, when we move from a wide establishing shot to medium shot... It all seems rather pointless.  Yes, it can look cool, but you don't have to keep using it when a simple Steadicam shot would work just as well.There seem to be continued attempts to top the previous films; you can almost imagine the conversations behind each scene.  ""Let's see; in Goldfinger the villain is sucked out of the window of a plane. OK, let's have FIVE bad guys sucked out of the plane window, and the villain can get sucked out of the window and into the jet engine!  Now, the laser torture sequence from Goldfinger; how do re-do that?  I know, we have a moving platform, and LOTS of lasers!""  Madonna didn't even try with the theme.  I almost walked out to wait for the credits to finish.The film isn't all bad.  The car chase over ice was a great piece of work.  The arsenal in each machine was perhaps a little over the top, but full marks to whoever was doing the driving.  It's also nice to see Bond back in a Ford, er Aston Martin.  I wasn't sure about John Cleese taking over as Q; he's no Desmond Llewellyn, but he doesn't try to be, which is good.  It would have been unforgivable if he had instructed 007 to pay attention.  It seems a shame, though, that Brosnan will be bowing out after this film rather than the far superior World is Not Enough.Three out of ten.",Die Another Day

670,sarahrachel_1956,"Sad, sad spy!",4,16 December 2006,"I've always been a big fan of Bond and I grew up watching Pierce Brosnan strut his stuff. But, this movie broke my heart. It made me feel so old! I can understand Hollywood wanting to include older men as sexy men, even though they don't seem to do the same with women...But, still discretion is needed. In the scenes in this movie where they show Brosnan's chest, it really looks like he is working to get his tummy up into his chest to look muscular. Sadly, it makes him look like an old guy trying to impress a young woman. A little camouflage with a nice suit and voilà! There's the sexy guy I drooled over for the past 35 years.As far as the plot, I think it was a good one. The only problem with it was I felt kind of like it may have been written by the Creel Commission, meant to get the audience on Board with the Bush Administration's attitude toward North Korea. But, then, what are stories for if not to move one's mind? The dialogue, on the other hand, was a bit camp. Inuendo is meant to be subtle, not so obvious. It actually had me and my husband giggling in several places.One part I really did like is the scene with M where Bond handles several items used in previous movies. Nice walk down memory lane! But, I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote her review before I wrote mine. James was not up to his usual level of expertise. At one point, I commented to my husband that Jinx seemed to be much more of a super spy than Bond in this movie. James Bond is supposed to be larger than life! I got the feeling that the director was trying to make him seem more realistic. But, come on! He's James Bond. If the spy had been this weak and inept the entire time, the series wouldn't have lasted this long. Americans still like superheros. We still like flights of fantasy. I've been out of the movie-watching loop for a while and have several James Bond movies I'm planning to catch up on.

For example the starting scene, were Bond escapes alone from dozens of heavily armed men, unhurt and still with a perfect hair. Or why didn't he die of hypothermia in the water? There are countless other examples as well...Haile Berry is the worst bond girl ever, trashy and non-classy. This film also had none of the nice, british, bond-esque atmosphere than the older ones, portraying a British gentleman, who is capable of handling every situation perfectly well and is known in the high society, surrounded by beautiful, _classy_ women and other fine things of life.This movie is rather a B-class action movie with too much budget.",Die Another Day

676,Obi-Wan Wilson,Bond at his Best,10,25 November 2002,"James Bond is back in the 20th installment of the James Bond series, and Pierce Brosnan, in his fourth Bond movie, does not disappoint.  The movie kicks off when Bond, while in the de-militarised zone between North and South Korea posing as a Mr. Van Beerk and trying to stop a plan involving deadly hovercrafts, is set up by an unknown enemy.  The man spearheading the hovercraft production, Colonel Moon(Will Yun Lee), finds out who Bond really is and what ensues is a high speed hovercraft chase trough a minefield. Bond comes out alive, but a Korean General captures Bond and keeps him in Korea for 14 months, trying to get him to give up Moon's western ally(the same person who set Bond up).  He does not give them a name, but MI6 gets Bond out of Korea by trading him for a Korean fugitive by the name of Zao(Rick Yune), who was there on the day that Bond was set up.  What we see next is Bond being disavowed and imprisoned by MI6.  But he doesn't stay that way for long, with a stylish escape he's back out doing his job again, only this time without orders from M, but for his own personal revenge. MI6 soon asks for his help again, and before you know it, Bond is back in a cool new car chasing crazy villains and encountering Bond girls.  Jinx(Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost(Rosamund Pike) are the 2 Bond girls in this one. Awesome action sequences and GREAT special effects make this a Bond classic and one of my favorite Bond movies.

However, I recognize that this is a terrible movie that I enjoyed more for its flaws than for its successes, wallowing in its crapulence.  Die Another Day came across more as Austin powers 4 than James Bond 21 in that it seemed to me more of a parody of the phenomenon than a true extension of it.James Bond movies have always possessed aspects that are cheesy, irritating and predictable (Mike Myers wouldn't have been able to make three hit movies otherwise) but these over-the-top aspects could be accepted for what they were. Die Another Day however simply had way too many corny one liners and clumsy double entendres to be taken seriously. It has a plot more predictable than any other 007 I've seen - anyone surprised by the fact that Miranda Frost was a crook needs to have their head checked. It also displayed some of the lamest bad guys ever committed to celluloid, what were the filmmakers  thinking when they thought an electrical armor suit would be cool - it looks like a leftover costume-piece from Robocop. The special effects used in Die Another Day are some of the worst yet: alternating between obviously blue/green screen shots, terrible CG and poor use of models - there was a roar of laughter in the cinema when the rocket sled thing went over the cliff it looked so bad.The number of references to earlier Bond movies was bizarre because it's something that hasn't really been done before and didn't seem to fit. While they might have fitted into to a film touted as being the last in the Bond saga and thus a homage to what has gone before there has been no indication that Die Another Day is the final expedition for 007 and considering the continued commercial success of the franchise, I can't see any studio wanting to terminate the series.My final criticism lies with those responsible for allowing Madonna to become even remotely involved with this movie - the theme is terrible and is beautifully crowned by her cringe worthy cameo.",Die Another Day

And most of all because I went with no expectations beside watching an action film, regardless of the fuzz turned into it.If you don´t mind too much about ""tradition"" in the Bond sense of the word, you will find that 2.20 hs passes in .30 minutes, you have action from beginning to end, surfing, sword fights, an explosive-on-ice-car-chase-ballad something like a jedi fight, and lots more. Then you have the fun, you will laught at least once every 4 minutes. The Aston Martin or Halle Berry, both excellent excuses to enjoy the movie ... also Pierce Brosnan for the girls. Music also, perhaps 2 hip sometimes, but still ok.If you mind about ""tradition"" then beware, your thoughts of what a James Bond movie should be, can block what is good in this one, mostly because they changed or did everything that have never been done in the saga, and the only good thing that you will find are some tag lines by John Cleese.For me, I only hope that next time they create a good script without obvious mistakes.MGM, you can keep the sex sequences, you can make Bond smoke again, you can use all the time for action/fight/chase sequences, you can use a girl to do the cold-minded kills, but please, create some decent villains, and most of all, a good plot.",Die Another Day

The only sequence I had a little trouble accepting was Bond riding the wave generated when that huge section of ice broke off. The invisible car was cool, as was Bond's glass shattering ring.The reference to other Bond films, through the old props in Q's equipment room, was a nice touch.  I particularly liked when Bond picked up his binoculars and bird watching book, a clever homage to the origins of the character's name.Bottom line: You'll get what you've come to expect from a Bond movie.

686,rinsche77,Very 2002...!!,9,28 December 2002,"You watch the new Bond and somehow you realize - times have changed. The British agent does no longer approach his new mission with the nonchalance of a man who  wants to save the world, yet, whose interest is much more focused on the shaken martini afterwards. Times have become tougher. Not the villains. They still get tangled up in trying to reach world domination. Not the antagonists are more demanding - times are. And so, ""Die Another Day"" is snappier, more stylish than all its predecessors and it stretches the Bond formula with strength but goes back before breaking in two. It experiments with (badly made) digital effects that pale into insignificance besides the real stunts and especially the wonderful fencing match, as if the movie itself wants to show that - actually - Bond could do without the annoying modern action overflow, the zeitgeist, however, seems to force it.It is not true that each new 007-flick is a quest for a younger Connery clone, but each episode tries to capture a touch of the age into which it was born. That seemed to be the concept of Fleming's creation and Brosnan has come closest to it - he is sardonic, tough and fearful in equal measure. ""Die Another Day"" is very 2002; pragmatic and functional and you cannot reproach it for that. The audience, and even Bond himself, have always longed back for the old days, yet,  against the background of modernism. That is part of the formula. Like all the other movies before Bond 20 sells entertainment to a crowd that knows exactly what it is going to get, but who want its expectations to be surpassed. An impossible mission. Yet - somehow - it works.  What producers should never forget, though - the only thing that all the other agent-action-pics lack and will never have...is James Bond. Maybe he should be given more responsibility next time.",Die Another Day

The acting is decent and the characterization is excellent. The movie moves at a good pace and it puts bond right back in his original stead of being a spy. This is a guilty pleasure for the discernible viewer because eventhough formulaic it is great entertainment. For the first time in years, it's good to see Bond getting down to his 'real' business, spying that is. Brosnan undoubtedly is the best since Connery. His Bond is darker, edgier, sharper, rasher and at the same time niftier and more suave. The movie has an awesome car chase scene, I mean how often do you get to see a HOT FULLY LOADED V8 ASTON MARTIN FOLLOWED BY A JAGUAR . The hovercraft chase and the gadgets are also cool. The only place where the movies falls of are the pathetic FX, like in the climatic airplane sequence as well as the surfing one. Overall it's a good way to kill 2 hours.

His co-star is Halle Berry, a beautiful Bond girl named Jinx and a beautiful but very bad girl Miranda (played by Rosamund Pike.

Brosnan,never more than a competent actor,is onhe of the highlights of the movie.Which says more about the other actors than it does about him. From the opening gunbarrel which now has a CGI bullet in it to Madonna's hideous title song by way of a poorly staged surfing scene and a hovercraft chase that would disgrace the A Team its Bond by numbers. Things improve briefly in Hong Kong and Cuba until the arrival of Halle Berry.Every line her character utters is an excruciating double entendre and she shows her disappointmant but voicing them in a ludicrous little girl lost voice.This is an Oscar winner???

End of story.Pierce Brosnan is a fine actor, and his first three Bond outings were solid, if not spectacular. But Die Another Day overwhelms you with mindless CGI and action sequences, overwhelming the characters. Please do yourself a favor, folks. Go to your local video store and rent Goldfinger, the 1964 classic that is without question the BEST Bond outing in the series. Goldfinger has far less action, but is ten times more entertaining.Why? Because Goldfinger has virtues like PLOT, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and TOP-NOTCH DIALOGUE.By comparison, Die Another Day is a cinematic video game. I like Toby Stephens as the arrogant Brit-brat, but Brosnan seems subdued and, well, old. Halle Berry is a vastly overrated actress, and Rick Yune is a baddie straight from central casting.

Invisible cars, very extreme makeovers (a plot line stolen from Alias), ice floes and eeeevil lasers. If Pierce Brosnan had dodgy teeth you'd assume this was an Austin powers flick. I didn't mind the whole Bond gets caught thing since it should have made his attempts to get Xao or Zao more personal but it didn't. Almost every line of dialogue was a quip or exposition.What really dices my carrots is the continued objectification of women and the damsel in distress syndrome. It is 2006 people so maybe we can have a capable woman who saves Bond for once or who at least doesn't need to be rescued before she is inevitably bedded by Bond who frankly should have died of an STD by now. Frankly I wish Miss Frost had survived and not Berry's character (if you can go so far as to call her generic sex spy that).",Die Another Day
697,scottmedley-74625,A failed film that really could've been so much better than it was.,3,11 November 2017,"About two months ago I proceeded on a quest to watch all of the Bond films in order to determine which Bond movie was truly the best. Needless to say this one definitely wasn't it. In fact this probably will rank as the worst Bond film for quite awhile until they make the Bond movie where aliens invade from another time and another planet.What really boggles my mind re-watching this one all the way through was the amount of missed opportunities the screenwriters had with this one. The first 30 minutes or so of this movie wasn't bad. That isn't a mistype. While not exactly groundbreaking drama the beginning scene of Bond being captured and tortured behind enemy lines and then released back to MI6 in disgrace could've been potentially great storytelling (while not exactly the same sort of plot License to Kill accomplished the ""rogue agent"" plot very well).Unfortunately, the only thing the makers of this Bond film did with that part of the story was to base a Madonna music video off of it and serve as a plot point for Bond to end up in Cuba. Up to that point the film was okay. That is until Halle Berry showed up.For the record Halle Berry has had some good performances (namely Monster's Ball). She has it within her to occasionally give out a good performance. This wasn't one of those occasions. Her presence in this movie was more or less a lazy attempt to replicate the Action Bond Girl formula that was so successfully done in Tomorrow Never Dies by Michelle Yeoh. By contrast the Berry's Jinx seems to exist in this movie to be a love interest of Bonds. That is basically what she is, plus or minus a few scenes where she kills people.This is kind of the failing of the later Pierce Brosnan Bond films: they often ended up relying too heavily on imitating aspects of Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies rather than trying to create their own identities. While the World is Not Enough focused too much on copying the dramatic elements of Goldeneye Die Another Day focused too much on copying the straight up shoot'em up action flick nature of Tomorrow Never Dies. While it is clear that the film was shot to be a more ""fun"" Bond the inability to really set apart a different image for Bond in this movie really doomed it.A lot of other reviewers complained about the obvious CGI in the movie. In my opinion while it was pretty obnoxious that is just a small factor in what made this a failed Bond movie. What makes this a failed Bond movie is that it was a Bond Movie that was shot with what appears to be little direction, little development, and little care about what James Bond is supposed to be. For instance, throughout the movie various characters just have to make almost in your face references to this being the 20th (Eon produced) Bond film and that it's been 40 years since Dr. No (the scene with ""R"" in the MI6 hideout was particularly notable in this atrocity). Further, while a lot of this could be blamed on dating, much of this film comes across more like XXX with a British accent (especially during the car battle sequence, yuck).So while laser cranes, ridiculous heat satellite cannons, and Ice Mansions do stick out like a sore thumb it's important to note the mentality prevalent throughout the movie that led to those sequences. And that mentality was to release a Bond movie to sell toys and video games and a few cheap laughs.Wow, this review was brutal. I only gave this 3 stars because again the movie had some potential even if it screwed it all up for 3/4ths of the movie (at least).",Die Another Day

699,eon014,Easily the worst Bond film ever,4,24 September 2006,"There have been some pretty lame Bond films in the past (Moonraker, Golden Gun etc etc), but Die Another Day surpasses them in every way possible, and is, in my opinion, the worst Bond film ever. Yes, even worse than Never Say Never Again. How could the production team get it so wrong?For starters the plot is just downright absurd. Giant lasers in outer space, DNA replacement therapy, invisible cars, robotic suits... Fleming would be spinning in his grave.Die Another Day just tries hard to be too many things it once. It has joke-laden set pieces (such as the end scene with Moneypenny) and yet also tries to be 'serious' by jamming in themes such as betrayal and father-son relationships; and including excruciating torture sequences. The central problem is a bad script. And it is bad. Just one cheesy line after another: ""Yeah, I think I got the thrust of it"", ""I see you handle your weapon well"", ""It's a minefield out there"", ""How's that for a punchline?"", ""I don't like cock fights"", ""Yo mama!"". The introduction scene with Jinx and Bond is cringe-worthy, I almost expected Brosnan to look at the camera and say ""Yeah baby!""Gustav Graves is a weak and unmemorable villain. This is not entirely his fault, but the fault of the producers for overloading him with gadgets and stupid gimmicks (the robotic suit for one). Jinx is very high on my list of worst Bond girls (next to Christmas Jones and Mary Goodnight) for just being plain annoying. And Rosamund Pyke couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.It is not all bad, however. The first 20 minutes or so are actually pretty good (Madonna's horrendous theme song aside). The hovercraft chase is very well executed and the idea of Bond being captured and imprisoned is intriguing. As for the action sequences they are mostly impressive, especially the car chase on the ice which is very well shot, and the sword fight with Bond and Graves. Though Die Another Day has been heavily criticised about it's over-reliance on CGI, and not exactly top-notch CGI either. Some of the scenes (particularly the tidal wave/parachute thing and Jinx's dive off the cliff) look incredibly fake, especially for Bond. Bond films are usually noted for their daring stunts, but it seems Tamahori was a little lazy in that department.Die Another Day is essentially a 'best of Bond' package, and contains elements from all 19 previous films. But watching it just makes you yearn for the days when being a Bond fan was something to be proud of. Watching Die Another Day makes me feel ashamed that a series I love has sunk so low. Thankfully, the series redeemed itself with the superb Casino Royale, but it doesn't disguise the fact that Die Another Day is a pathetic excuse for a Bond film. Utterly dire.",Die Another Day

In You Only Live Twice they made a giant set and it looked realistic and believable. Almost forty years later the computer graphics of Die Another Day look cheap, are cheap and are by cheap people. The Bond girl looks like a man (I am a girl myself) and Bond himself... I'll be honest here. I have come to dislike him since he began (attempting to) singing in Mama Mia.

701,Aug1,Why does it seem like Bond is trying to be XXX?,3,24 November 2002,"Die Another Day is definitely not in the tradition of the Bond greats, films like Thunderball, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, or even Live and Let Die.  I went into this movie with great hopes - I find Brosnan to be the best Bond since Sean Connery; I was very disappointed.
Unlike a lot of the other comments here, I don't have a problem with Halle Berry's character - it's good to see a stronger Bond girl.  In fact, on the level of character development, I think this film succeeded.  We got to see a darker side of Bond: glimpses of Bond as a hurt man, a man betrayed.Where this movie failed utterly was in the lack of plot and overabundance special effects.  What's with the recent Bond fascination with satellites, anyway?  There was nothing terribly original in this film; there was, however, a lot of reliance on special effects... and as many others have pointed out, on bad CGI.  The parasailing/windsurfing bit was especially bad. (Could someone please explain to me how a frozen lake with liquid water below suddenly turned into a glacier with a cliff edge?) I guess the producers and director felt that noone could appreciate an old-style Bond movie where the action and effects were secondary to this strange thing called A PLOT!  The night after watching this, I watched Goldeneye again, and even this was a much better movie.  In comparison, Die Another Day seems like it was targeted at an audience of ADD kids.One last thing - I know that you have to suspend your disbelief in a Bond movie, but aren't they taking it a little far in this one?

Another shot of her breasts and another arrogant and tiring performance by Ms. Berry. Egad! Let's face it the Bond films have always had the essential elements of James Bond:  devices that stagger the imagination, M, Q, some plot, BOND and the girls he beds and saves. They should have killed off Haley and created some sympathy for her role. She was actually unimportant to the story except for the cheese-cake poses. My hat is off to Mr. Bronson as it is extremely obvious that there is absolutely no chemistry between he and M.

703,Projectionist,"Oh Dear, 007!",3,17 November 2002,"If I had to use just one word for this review it would be this - AVOID!!!!Anyway, I don't have to do that so here's a bit more about what I don't like about this film.All of the usual 007 elements are back. You know girls, cars, gadgets, action ... you know what to expect, right? Well in DAD they are all present but in either too little or too much. DAD lacks a singular villain, instead the ""bad guy"" role is spread out too thinly over 3 or 4 different characters. Gadgets don't play their usual big part too, as there are only 1 or 2 that I can remember. And the puns! Oh, well of course they are still here but WAY, WAY over the top. Every other line is pun or double meaning. You expect the 007 films to have a balance between all the things I have mentioned, but not in DAD. Basically, the usual things have been doubled or even tripled and it's all ended up as just a great big mess. And what is with the title sequence? What happened to the traditional ""big song and eye candy""? Well I think this had to be ditched because Madonna's ""theme"" is too electronic/techno to go with what we are used to. And don't get me started on her ""acting"", however brief in the film. Ha!In short, see it if you must. But don't expect too much.

704,ScottRVP,"Ok movie, ....bad Bond movie",5,22 November 2002,"Although Die Another Day is not a bad movie, it certainly risks disappointing Bond fans. As another person writes, ""worst Bond movie ever"". In some aspects this is probably very true.  Simply put the writing was horrible.  The plot had no intrigue, very little development, no direction, and many elements were just too far over-the-top.  A result of writers trying too hard to out do what had been previously done.
Bond has always been known for his high tech gadgets, women, and incredible stunts.  There is always a line that determines to what degree one suspends their disbelief.  This line is defined by the universe created out of the the plot and setting of the film.  For Bond movies, this universe has largely been defined by the previous films.  Die Another Day pushes this line more than another other bond movie.  This changes the feeling of the movie.   Something Bond fans may not like.Regardless, the plot is this film's biggest downfall.  Like so many movies today, what plot there was seemed to be more of an excuse, a necessary evil, to get from one action scene to another.  This is truly a tragedy for Brosnan and Berry whose talent was largely wasted by the script.
So what saves this movie?Obviously some great actors/actresses.  Pierce Brosnan is incredible as Bond. When the script lets him, he shines magnificently!  Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike are also fantastic although Berry gets little chance to prove herself. Pike's Miranda Frost on the other hand is somewhat of an exception to this.  Frost proves to be an interesting character. I would have liked to have seen this role expanded.Although short lived, there are some great Bond scenes.  Taken by themselves, these scenes are certainly some of the all time best.In summary this movie was more Mission Impossible than James Bond. I believe it would have done much better under its own identity than as part of the Bond collection.  In my mind I may try to make it so...I officially rated this movie a 5.  As a stand alone movie, its probably a 6.  As a Bond movie, its more like a 3 or 4.  You be the judge...",Die Another Day

James Bond is the mythic figure of a man, who attacks a situation in his own uncompromising way.Here, we see him again doing the fantastic that one would expect only Bond to do. To some this spectacle may seem old, but to most there is sharp edginess to the film that remembers the best of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and the original books.For Bond fans, there are so many references to the old films, that brings much of the best of the old to the present day.  For the new fan, Brosnan takes a fresh approach to the man, who we all love to watch and to overwhelmed by in his actions and his personality.Look for the cameo appearance of Madonna, who surprises me in how well she slips in and out of a single scene.

What happened to the wit and charm that was evident in the best of the series, films like 'Goldfinger"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me""?There is nothing in this film that feels original or fresh.  And the John Woo influenced cinematics have no place in a Bond film.  And what's with the use of CGI in place of real stuntmen doing the impossible, as they did in every other film?  Sure, it may look ""super cool"" in concept, but in fact it looks fake and out of place.  They didn't use CGI to make trucks act like race cars in ""License To Kill"".I'm afraid that on his 40th anniversary, the cinematic James Bond is looking every bit his age, dressed up like a 70 year old hustler trying to pick up teenagers.

710,pfbyers,Cool video game!,4,29 November 2002,"Interesting first 15 minutes. I actually really liked it before they started to use awful CGI instead of, *gasp*, actual people and stunts. That is what made Bond different from ""Terminator 2"" and ""XXX""! Anyways, the ""special effects"" were dreadful. This movie cost $140 million? The new gadgets are interesting but are absolutely ridculous. They also contribute to many of the script's mistakes. Case in point: Bond gets a nice invisible car. It doesn't really serve its purpose though if you can still see an outline of its skeleton! Speaking of mistakes, the plot is full of them. Since all of them have been already discussed, I won't waste your time. Finally, Michael Madsen was pretty funny. The only thing is he wasn't supposed to be (I guess......).The thing I hated most about this movie is the editing. Too many movies use this clever advertising gimmick: Editor's speed the film up then suddenly slow down to slow-motion to grab the viewer's attention. Bleh! The script was sub-par but they didn't need to resort to this cheap MTV-style gimmick to keep us interested. Also (and this is just in my taste), they should have inserted the Moneypenny-VR scene at the very end. This would have ended movie on a great note and made more sense in the movie's order of events.With that said, I kind of enjoyed the comic-book/video-game style that the producers decided on. While the director wanted to maintain an action-oriented movie and skip over anything Mike Myers might use in the next dozen ""Austin Powers"" films, there are an endless amounts of silly sexual ""suggestions"" that clearly wear out it's welcome. Zow (spelling?) was a creepy villian, not because the bald head or the scars, but those irregularities with the cold, light-blue eyes. Eeew! I didn't like the main villian, as his true self  echoed the illogical MI2 ""faux identity"" twist (it did make a a decent twist, though) and I wasn't into his character due to his snobbish look. Overall, a neat angle, but please NEVER do it again! Get a script like Goldeneye and you won't have to worry about matching up to the competition! While I was sitting in my seat, I was looking forward to the DVD and, of course, the obligatory video game.My grade: A generous B- (4 on IMDB scale)",Die Another Day
711,thomasfh,The worst ever,1,2 July 2003,"This is the best evidence of the death of the James Bond movies. D.A.D is nothing more than a over-hyped showoff of stupid effects, hopeless dialogue and a story without substance whatsoever. Over the last years, the Bond team have tried to make increasingly ""modern"" movies, using more and more advanced effects etc, in order to match 007 with today's world society. Certainly not a bad idea itself. Unfortunately, Brosnan's Bond has, with the exception of Goldeneye, suffered dramatically. Compared to the earlier movies, James Bond is now nothing but action, computer-generated effects, and more action, combined with silly dialogue lacking the style and charisma we're used to from earlier (in particular Sean Connery). Barbara Broccoli and co. seems to be in desperate need of a good story, as D.A.D is nothing more than a fancy bowl with nothing in it. The Bond saga has turned into a money-making monster designed to please as many action-lovers as possible. Unfortunately, this is what the films do, and therefore, I'm afraid, the future Bonds will be of the same caliber as this one; an awful money-making action film with the potential to annoy, not to entertain.

No expense is spared for this historical Bond epic and you really want it to succeed.  It has lots of references to previous Bond films.  The brilliant all too brief scene between Bond and Q (John Cleese) sums up the last 40 years of Bond gadgets with some snappy comic dialogue which would need a repeat viewing to catch all the gags and references.  The incoherent plot is as ludicrous as ever, but tries to make it more serious with a united US/British fight against terrorism (North Korea) theme. The first third of the film is great and the middle third keeps a pace, but the final third seems to lose a little direction and drag a little.

There is great action, great villains, cold war tensions, and great gadgets. Q, M, and Moneypenney are in fine form here. In fact, this outing by John Cleese is a marked improved from his shared screen time with the original Q; he can finally take over the role as his own and he's a great replacement for Desmond Llewellen. The only things that detract from the movie are some poor CGI action effects, weak dialogue, and unbelievable action stunts. But it's a Bond flick, so just go with it.

716,grahamsdean,reused ideas and fun gimmicks,2,19 September 2006,"A couple fun gimmicks, but mostly reused ideas and the worst part is the special effects seems to have lost the style of James bond, by having some stunts computer animated instead of real action, like all other bond films have been. The most disappointing bond film for a big James bond fan, even member of international James bond fan club. Really has lost the James Bond's character, in trying for great special effects, which were disappointing in many places. The worst scene for this is the wind surfing scene, just looks tacky, and even looked like parts were being filmed with 1960's equipment. Another part that irritated me was all the sudden slow motion bits, even if only for a couple seconds, just took something away from the film instead of adding it. Although Pierce Brosnan played bond well, the story line lacked a real story line. The idea of diamond smuggling, seen before in diamonds are forever, which also included a laser in space. Bond losing his 007 rank once again, thats not new. There are many more like these, couldn't the writers come up with something truly original. Other than Brosnan's acting the only really good part was the old gadgets in the abandoned train station. Overall a bond film that has lost the touch of what bond films are meant to be.",Die Another Day
717,EuroAramo,Castration of Bond,1,21 June 2006,"The worst I have seen and I have seen them all at least 20 times each.This one is a homage to Brian DePalma who is notorious for stealing scenes from great directors to make a movie (See Untouchable with scenes stolen from Hitchcock; Eisenstein, etc.) In this Bond, the weapon is stolen from Diamonds are Forever, The Hale Berry laser scene is a copy of the Goldfinger laser scene which by the way was voted as one of the most memorable movie scenes with the famous line from Auric G. ""No Mr. Bond; I expect you to die"". The Astom Martin is a throw back to Goldfinger/Thunderball.James Bond, the main character, once the most suave, dashing, sexiest and for lack of a better word ""the most perfect man alive"", who made some of the most gorgeous women in the world surrender themselves to him and compelled men to wishing they were him, has been castrated in this movie.It seems that since Judy Dench took over as M in Goldeneye, all the male employees of MI6 have become impotent and occupy secondary roles. Our hero is totally ineffective in this movie and is cast aside to a secondary role while Dench, Berry, Pike and Moneypenny are elevated to hero status. ITS A ""CHICK BOND"" WORLD I GUESSThe opening scene is supposed to be the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, except there is military presence!Our hero, who in the past opening sequences managed to escape from the most dire of situations relying on his gadgets and instincts is caught. Hint to Write and/or Director: BOND NEVER GETS CAUGHT; HE IS SUPER AGENTA Female Korean soldier is in charge of torturing Bond, who we are told is suspected of cracking under pressure and revealing secrets. This the symbolic castration and conveys the message that Bond is castrated.Berry throughout the movie is portrayed as superior to Bond. In fact Berry's character is exactly what Bond was in the past (now you know why I call this movie ""Chick Bond"")Moneypenny the secretary knows about MI6's most secret meeting place, but our Super Agent only suspects it existed. (Its a ""Bond Chick"" world)Pike's character, which I am still not sure whether she is a ""00"" or not, apparently has more of ""M""'s confidence that the man who has served Her Majesty's government since the 1960s with a perfect track record (See it is a ""Chick Bond"" world)Madonna sings the theme song (Final proof that this a ""Chick Bond"" version of a great franchise)While Bond always had the best gadgets, the bad guys have even better ones that can beat Bond's which is a symbolic castration of his character as well.The entire movie would make the ""NOW"" happy, but made a life long fan like me want to sit down and watch all of Connery's Bond movies.BEST SCENE: Bond cruising down a Havana highway driving an immaculate 1950s Ford Galaxy with a Latin version of the opening theme playing.WORST SCENE: The rest of this waste of money, time and material.",Die Another Day

720,ReaperFett,One of the best,10,20 November 2002,"Let's cut to the chase. This is Brosnan's best, and probably a top three for them all.Now, reasons :)
Film begins with a great sequence, leading up to the best credits sequence so far. The Madonna song does fit it, it actually made it sound good (Not as a song, just in the sequence :) )First, acting. Brosnan was perfect for the role. He was inbetween the more serious Connery and the more jokey Moore. And it worked. We also saw a darker Bond.The Bond Girls did well too. Halle Berry did good as Jinx, managing to be a strong character but not lowering Bond's status. Rosamund Pike also did great in a role which had less moments.Special mention must go to John Cleese, who was a vast improvement to his character in TWINE. The jokes are free flowing, and there are references to previous films all the way through.
The action was a LOT better than most of the films. Bond films have a tendancy to work on the setpieces rather than the action. Not so in this one.And the car. Oh BOY the car ruled! There's one gadget most of you probably wont have heard of yet. And it is great. And to double it, there's TWO gadget cars!
Special effects were both good and bad. As a whole, they were outstanding. But theres a scene later in the film that looks so fake it is stupid. And the director puts slow motion to good use, but sometimes it felt as if he was just bored and wanted something to do.
Overall, go see the film. NOW.",Die Another Day

Halle Berry is quite horrible, though, it's funny she gets the Oscar for her work in monster's ball, and in the same year performs terribly bad in die another day. the rest of the characters are well casted for the most part. I'll say the first two acts are quite good and interesting. There are many stabs at humor which most of the time succeed in a small laugh. I especially love the title sequence and thought it was well edited. But the movie goes downhill in the 3rd act. It's too overdone in the finale and was almost painful to watch. My main complaint is there are far too many cheesy lines of dialogue in this movie. Too many to count, if they left them out, it would have been far, far better.

People will carry on their fear, ignorance and Xenophobia towards North Korea, the message that it sends out to those countries that we can still single out as ""the bad guys"" are dodgy to the extreme (who next, Iraq, Iran, ""Palestine"" or an Al-Qaeda type organisation without a country, but still offending an already rife middle east?). Quite apart from the US needing people to pick on to take the attention from their flagging economy, shotgun politics and witless President, the Bond films also need their to be some ""enemy"" states out there.Anyway, this film also contains at least two of the worst recent moments of special effects.  At least the hang glider surfing past icebergs was funny, but the moment when the land-speed-record craft goes over the edge of the ice-cliff was pathetic (I mean - couldn't they afford to build a bigger model to make it a little more realistic, this was tonka toy scale), as well as the car out of the back of the airplane.There is also blatant and possibly self-referential (you'd like to think they meant it to look so bad in a we can laugh at our franchises history kind of way) blue/green screening on the hovercraft chase.But the invisible car wasn't as bad as I had heard it was, the Aston Martin itself was the sexiest thing in the film...It would also be so refreshing and even sexier if the bond girl didn't give into the Bond charm, I mean - I would respect that woman, an iota of brain activity can be stimulating!Maybe it is time for the ""gay Bond"" film, where someone is so There is also blatant and possibly self-referential (you'd like to think they meant it to look so bad in a we can laugh at our franchises history kind of way) blue/green screening on the hovercraft chase. that it is Bond that cannot resist their manly temptations... now that would be a ""new"" stunt - for Bond anyway!",Die Another Day

Some scenes are quite funny such as the scene where James bond tries on the jet pack from the movie ""Thunderball,"" and says ""does this thing still work?"" The only thing that dispointed me was the poor dialouges for Koreans. I am Korean my self so I was able to understand all of the Koreans in the film, but most of their lines didn't even make sense.

That scene made the whole movie seem idiotic and started things on a downer (worse than License to Kill).And then the script was soooo stupid. An invisible car? Is this X-men? Yeah...let's take it in the snow. That makes sense. Halle Berri believable as a spy? Not as bad as Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist, but still pretty bad. Korean guy becomes Caucasian? And then the whole story was just a ripoff of GoldenEye with yet another ""evil"" satellite.While Pierce Brosnan fits the mold perfectly, writers/directors (Oprah-watchers?) have ruined the character in their attempt to make him sensitive and more ""real"" (i.e. mopey) but somehow they have chosen to make the scripts more preposterous (and horrible). The way things are going, Judi Dench should give him a hug and blankey (before she sells him out).Judi Dench is not good as ""M"". I assume it is the scripts.

They completely took the tried and tested Bond formula, threw it out the window, and replaced it with CRAP!Bond films are supposed to have dramatic throwaway openings that get you all fired up for the rest of the movie.  This film spends about 20 minutes showing Bond getting tortured.  Oh Joy.  Show me more.Then they fill the movie with plot devices like genetic manipulation, gadgets like the invisible car, and locations like the ice palace that are to silly and unbelievable for even a Bond film.Finally, they try to shoehorn in ""cute"" references to all the other bond films.  Someone somewhere thought they were cool for thinking this up and probably broke their arm trying to pat themselves on the back.

The BOND girls were there, but lacked their usual style.Mostly it was far fetched (as if the other BOND films weren't far fetched enough).

I couldn't understand why Toby Stephens had to wear the plastic electrifying suit at the end, it was a bit sad, he's meant to be a Bond villain.My overall impression was disappointment - also shared by other people in the theatre who left before the end credits.

It provides excellent action scenes and the prerequisite explosions for any big budget popcorn movie.  Pierce Brosnan does a fine job in the movie, although it looks like he has never picked up a sword or a cigar in his life.Halle Berry does fine work in the movie portraying Jinx, the American NSA agent.  One interesting part of the film absent in previous films is a bit of strife between American and British forces.  They have similar goals, but their agents and administrators clash a bit during the film.I have an affinity for the ""real"" Bond movies (read: w/ Connery) but I really enjoyed this one.  You go in expecting Bond, not fine cinema, and you leave satisfied.Negatives of the movie include a HORRIBLE title song by Madonna and equally retched cameo.  The score is excellent, and features a Clash song prominently.  The plot is a bit transparent and gets a bit fantastical, almost cartoonish in the last 30 minutes.There are references to other Bond movies in the film (Halle's Ursula Andress swimsuit and a Diamond ad that says ""diamonds are forever"") that should amuse the Bond-nerds like myself.The sexual innuendos, always a staple of Bond films, were predictable and not very clever.  Also, the CGI seemed a bit over the top at times- the ""iceberg surfing"" scene comes to mind.  Icarus seems to have the power to ravage icebergs and sold ground but it takes minutes to melt an ice house and only damages the Villain's plane.Go see this one expecting an above-average movie in the Bond series and you wont be disappointed.  Let the bad parts, when they come, roll of your back and you wont be too distracted.The plot is clearly defined in this one, and I am very happy to see the resurgence of Communist Villains.See it in the theatres or on DVD.

734,osfancy,Too Much Today,4,23 November 2002,"I was most disappointed with the film and its overzealous attempt to please its audience from what I can only assume is feedback from previous movies. It bared little resemblance to the original Bond film's that came before it and at some stages in the movie displayed a sharp contrast. The use of his car was not limited but overused as it seems to have been an integral part of the film's appeal.The use of special effects in this film were commendable but in some scenes poorly done, with special attention to his parachute flight over the waves in which he is easily seen in front of a screen -- a technique used liberally in older films.The characters in the film were not in my opinion well chosen. The villain lacked any truly recognizable trait nor was it easy to spot who he/she was. The character of Jinx as being an NSA agent was somewhat unnecessary, an attempt I fear to Americanize James Bond films.The film's plot was interesting to say the least. Most of the situations in which James Bond & Jinx found themselves in lacked any connection to even a vague notion of reality, when the film makers drew the line between realism and fantasy they obviously used the thickest marker they could find.I cannot blame the film entirely for its shortcomings as I perceive them, since I expected too much.

736,PorkPie007,The film is good... very good.,9,23 November 2002,"Die Another Day is truly one of the best Bond films ever made in my judgement. Despite a certain few outrageous premises, and the work of science fiction rather than science fact for a couple of the elements of the film, it is still excellent. The main plot does leave a few inconsistencies, and does to some extent rework parts of the story of Diamonds Are Forever, but this is meaningless. The film is more or less an action-packed, fun-filled ride of sheer enjoyment. Some of the special effects leave a little to be desired, but that did not bring down the enjoyment factor of the film.Brosnan's scenes as the disavowed double-o are intensely powerful, and some of the action sequences, though elaborately constructed, are surprisingly simple to follow, with normal ideas worked in alternate ways of a very high calibre. The fencing scenes especially are executed with skill, and being a fencing enthusiast myself, I completely understood how complicated and potentially dangerous some of these could be. The car chase across the lake is also magnificent.Although Madonna's theme song seemed utterly terrible when first heard upon release, it has perfect relevance and fits flawlessly into the title sequence images. Unfortunately, some of the incidental music was less well-placed in certain scenes.Berry did nothing for me as a physical Bond girl (due really to her short hair, as I like girls with longer hair - she has a good face and figure), but she was a very good sidekick for Bond, especially of this era (although some of her witticisms paled in comparison to Bond's, and her addition of the word ""bitch"" was quite unnecessary on its occurrence, obviously a comic afterthought). Pike was fantastic in her role, and her beauty was accentuated deeply by her costumes, the lighting, and even the camera angles.The one-liners were plentiful, each well-delivered, and many brought the house down at my local theatre. The references to the other Bond films were many, and I have noted each in the Trivia section. My expectation of the film was a somewhat poor one, primarily upon hearing of references to every other Bond film, but due to good directing, nothing is cheesy and really obvious (imagine as I did, if you will, Bond winking directly at the camera after each reference).Almost every scene is well-rounded, and it is such a pity that the latter third of the film was so loud and brash after a better, quieter, first two-thirds.It really was only the use of a few poorly constructed concepts that lowered my appreciation of the film, but it was certainly the best of Brosnan's Bond films. I also did not enjoy much the few camera shots that were accelerated to reach the action at the beginning of a shot and then dropped immediately to be played at normal speed for whatever reason, and I had the same opinion of the slow-motion scenes. These camera movements are very un-Bond-like, and made it seem as though perhaps a new franchise was being born, as did the foolish addition of a bullet to the pre-credit gun-barrel opening shot.Overstated super-villainy remained, as it should in every good Bond film, a definite plus point if another is needed. See this film, as it is quite a close contender for the top spot of all of the Bond movies. This film (and perhaps the whole Bond franchise) will, of course, be quite ruined if plans do ever go ahead for a spin-off film- / game-series including the character of Jinx, as this is only a poor excuse for merchandising.

Those expectations were partially met with the huge line-ups into the cinema. The expectations were then dissolved upon the first note of Madonna's awful theme song ""Die Another Day"". The notion that James Bond is kept locked away for 14 months, grows a beard and is under suspicion from intelligence because he may have ""spilled the beans"" is unsettling as is the whole character of Bond, who has gone from a suave, cool and seemingly invincible secret agent, to a weary, burnt out and penetrable man. Although it must be said that Pierce Brosnan does hold the movie together and behind Sean Connery and Roger Moore, makes James Bond believable. Halle Berry's character Jinx, is just plain unnecessary and really serves little purpose in the plot, but to add another Hollywood ""name"" into the mix. With such a stellar cast of actors: Pierce Brosnan, Toby Stephens, Judy Dench, Michael Madsen and John Cleese it should of been easy to match a good script and director. But so much is the case these days that all the good actors in the world can't save a script that is confusing, disjointed and is totally consumed by a copious amount of special effects and stunts. The whole movie is like a giant film clip for a Will Smith song. It has some truly awful digital images and effects that are almost as unrealistic as the plane crash in ""Air Force One"". And this is where the movie disappoints the most. On top of the bad effects, the stunts and sequences go beyond fantasy, which is not James Bond. Invisible cars, surfing on a piece of metal from a jet car that has just fallen off a ice cliff, a giant satellite, which takes solar light and makes a huge laser, a massive ice made dome hotel, a suit and glove that shoots high powers of electricity look more comfortable in a Star Wars flick than a James Bond film.To serve the masses the film has forgotten the James Bond formula that has made classics like ""Diamonds are Forever"", ""Goldfinger"" and ""Octapussy"" some of the best secret agent films ever. Too many token characters, a weak villain, poor effects, far too many destinations and sequences makes a bundle of mess that will have to be up in strides if this James Bond fan will return to the cinema for another Bond film.I was hugely disappointed and I have to rate it one of the worst films I have seen this year. 1.5 out of 10",Die Another Day

I'm not sure I would have put this in just yet as I don't think the time is right for this sort of thing in a Bond movie - however - they explained the science behind it well and as time had increased lots over the others - it's not a problem by anymeans.A really good movie, my favourite Bond film by far - three words:GO WATCH IT :)Michael",Die Another Day

But there is definitely something missing from 007's latest outing.I'm not gonna put spoilers in here because the film as a stand alone is pretty good. Great set pieces plus everything else that you would expect from Bond. But maybe that was the point. I was expecting so much more because it was a Bond movie, that I left the cinema feeling like I had just watched another run of the mill action movie.Brosnan is certainly not a fault and this is probably his best Bond yet. I think part of the problem was the bad guys. I just didn't believe they could even begin to beat my grandmother let alone MI6's top man. Gustav Graves? Who cares.And oh yeah - Madonna - NEVER ACT AGAIN!! And your song sucks too!!Rating 5/10",Die Another Day
744,bobbigmac,Possibly the best bond ever.,10,1 December 2002,"I think this films is quite possibly the best bond film ever made. (Definetly the best Brosnan bond film). Great script, excellent soundtrack (Madonna's track aint too good but i've heard worse). Its a bit actiony for typical james bond, and there are some slightly implausible bits, but i'm happy to see that bond is still pushing the technology barrier to its limits. (And anyone that says the invisible car is impossible is just wrong. Various research labs throughout the world have been working on a similar technology using a variation based on optical fibre.) I'm very glad i went to see it.",Die Another Day

With an excellent supporting cast including Halle Berry, Judi Dench, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Rick Yune, and John Cleese; a fantastic action director in Lee Tamahori; and some of the most beautiful locations in the world, I recommend Die Another Day to everyone.

You see I really loved this bond film but not because it remind me of the previous installments, this is a new bond for a new audience i have to say it rocks! Its over the top and a little silly in places but thats what i want when i go see a movie. If i wanted to see a serious flick i wouldn't go see the 20th installment of a film about a secret agent.Seeing bond dueling it out in a classic sword fight was the highlight of the film for me,putting a little style in an modern action film and there where so many more good moments that like that which left me feeling good when i came out of the cinema and had me and my girlfriend diving around trying to re-enact them.There were a few minor problems though, Brosnan's age for one. I just can't picture a man that old getting someone like Halle Berry. Madonnas theme song also lacked some of the style that went along with previous bond scores.All in all though Die Another Day proved to be a highly enjoyable film and I recommend it to anyone who prefers fun to realism.",Die Another Day

749,shooter_macduff,Didn't I Already See This?,6,29 November 2002,"I have three major complaints about this movie:1. The ""satellite-with-diamonds-meant-to-destroy-Earth"" was done, in Diamonds Are Forever.  While it was a different concept, and the satellite was for a different purpose, I couldn't help but think, ""I've seen this, why aren't you guys being original?""2. Lee Tamahori's use of ""John Woo"".  There were several slow-mo shots, and each time, my focus was taken away from the otherwise great fight scenes, and switched to comparing it to Woo's style.  There are certain movies where this effect works well (The Killer, The Matrix, even parts of MI:2), but not for Bond.  Bond movies, in my opinion, are not supposed to rely on camera tricks, they are supposed to rely on Bond's suave, but tough style of getting the job done.3. Halle Berry.  In my mind, Bond girls are in the movie for action, but not fighting, if you know what I mean.  Halle is a terrific actress, but she's not meant for this type of role.  When the creators of this film put a big-time star like her into their movie, they have to give that star a lot of screen time.  The Bond girl is not supposed to have a major, or even large role.  Plus, Halle's performance wasn't all that great.  She was good with her looks, but not so good with her acting.All in all, I thought the movie was a good one, but not a true Bond movie. It was too ""Hollywood""; too much explosive action, not enough Bond-style spy action.  Also, was anyone else furious over Madonna's song and cameo?6 out of 10 stars.",Die Another Day

751,kamikazefighter9,This movie blows,1,23 November 2002,"Contains Spoilers I have been a big Bond fan for a long time, and have found that the trend of Bond films is not a good one.  First off, the first half was better than the 2nd...But I didn't really like the 1st half so that doesn't say much about the 2nd.  There is one thing that Bond has done from day 1 till now that different actors have done differently...That is, their 1-line sexual innuendo.  Shawn Conery had his fare share, but they were nothing like Moores and Brosnens.  I found the dialogue in DAD was horrid.  In the first half I the film which actually had more than 1-liners, it seemed like they were forgetting their lines and then it took them a half a second to recall them before they said them.  It really seemes unnatural to me.  Then you have Jinx...I am not against having women in significant roles in bond films.  However, She really doesn't ever work with James till the end, it really shocked me that he ends up with her in the end.  The meet about 1/4 of the way through the film, and then have sex, and then she's gone pretty much till the last 1/3rd of the movie.And talk about stupid use of effects, the laser scene in Iceland, where the room looks like a disco with deadly lasers flying around, that was just silly.  And right before that when the evil boss said to evil henchmen number 2, Kill her...And Evil Henchmen #2 said, I'm going to use the laser!...Then you see a laser slowly move to cut Jinx's head off...It was an attempted death scene right out of Austin Powers.The story was horrid.  It has to be one of the silliest plots I've seen, only slightly better than the ""Cave Dwellers"" (a Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie).  It was hard to follow as well.  I also find that the end was done horrid.  They should have gone snuck aboard the plane in Iceland. They didn't need to go to N. Korea again.  It really cut the finale in half and made me angry that the movie was still going.The beginning of the film cut from traditional Bond film style. Typically (and as far as I know), the beginning sequence although relavent to the main plot, is not the main plot.  And how they show Bond being tortured during the theme song, (Which really stinks for a Bond theme song, it doesn't have enough melody to it), really strays from previous films.Anyways, I dunno if this makes sense, I am writing at 2:30 in the morning, and felt that this movie was just horrid.  It is in my top 3 list of the worst bond films.  They need to can Pierce, or atleast get better writers.",Die Another Day
752,dibabear2,Another Day for Bond?,7,28 December 2002,"Overall, it was a good Bond flick with most of the traditional ingredients. Brosnan has grown into the role, especially when you compare his somewhat stiff, though good, reprise in Goldeneye.Madonna's theme song is pretty ugly and I won't be buying the CD thank you very much.  For me the most major annoyance is the use of Matrix-like stop action crap.  It's disrupting to the action sequences and doesn't add anything to the film in my opinion.The worst scene is the Bond parachute surfing bit.  Half the theater laughed out loud, myself included.  While the Bond films always pushed the envelope of plausibility (especially the later Roger Moore films), this particular scene was so bad to be laughable.  Luckily it and the finale were the only really poor scenes in the film.I'm happy that Brosnan will come back for a fifth appearance as Bond.  He seems to strike the correct balance between Sean Connery's serious Bond and Roger Moore's more clownish version.I'd give the film an 8 but given the above glitches, it's probably a 6 or a 7.  Of course, if the next film continues in the direction this one has gone (techno title music, goofy camera effects, way unbelieveable stunts) it might be the last one I'll see.",Die Another Day

The first comment on the page, the guy was saying it was like an action sci-fi film well it was an action film but it was no sci-fi film, it had an element of sci-fi from the satellite but a lot of bond films are created around a space and satellite plot so really it might have been an omage to earlier bond films, but I would like to see it again just for the opening scene and the opening credits which were ace.",Die Another Day

I found Halle Berry's, Madonna's, John Cleese's, Judi Dench's, Rick Yune's, and Pierce Brosnan's acting to be dreadfully bad. The special effects were terrible, the CGI was bad, the invisible car was so absurd it was just totally ridiculous even for a Bond film.Brosnan gave the worst performance of Bond I have ever seen. He was so wooden and so utterly dull and boring that I actually found myself wanting him to get shot in the film. The one liners and innuendos that Bond is so very famous for were at an all time low in Die Another Day. I haven't seen many films that were any dumber or any lamer, with dialogue and line delivery than this film.In final review this is a B-movie of straight to video quality that had a total cost (production and marketing of $170 million) and made $425.5 million. Go figure huh? Well that's the power and legacy of Bond. Brosnan and the producers are doing there very best to destroy that legacy, and I belive that they succeeded with this entry. If the next film is as bad as this one is Bond is dead. The box office is already going to dip because of how bad Die Another Day is and another film like this would kill Bond.",Die Another Day

But these Bond girls were very beautiful and these two movies were simply marvellous (outstanding like classic MGM musicals or Hitchcock thrillers with Cary Grant). Today, Bond is just another action movie.Brosnan is humdrum and brainless as usual, but so was Connery when he played Bond.

Gadgets, Spies, Beautiful girls, etc.  What more could you ask for?Granted, this movie has explosions, gadgets, and beautiful girls, but there is no acting.  Maybe the people say 1 or 2 lines before an explosion.The books, Bond is more of a gentlemen spy.  They are spy novels with action sequences.  Not all action with a mention that he is a spy.  And with each new movie, the gadgets just get more and more preposterous.  An invisible car?  Destroying an ice palace just to kill one person?  At least the original few movies had gadgets that were reasonable (the suitcase from From Russia With Love makes a brief appearance, along with several old gadgets).When anyone actually did say a line, it was a stupid point joke.  The first time, alright, but the 10'th time I heard a pun containing 'point', I was just moaning.  It's not that I think Pierce Brosnan is a bad Bond.  It's just that there's no substance to work with.  The Thomas Crown Affair is closer to a Bond movie than this piece of garbage.  Throw in an awful Madonna song to boot, and you have very little to redeem this movie. Hopefully the next Bond (although it may be his last) will be better.",Die Another Day

I do not agree with the 51st State style direction as well, Bond is not a Hong Kong shoot 'em up, it is a National Treasure. Pierce Brosnan is adequate as 007 but the casting of Halle Berry because of her breasts was a sad day in the Bond legacy. The baddie was rather mediocre although Rosamund Pike does have potential as an actress. Bring back Guy Hamilton and give the legend that is John Cleese some good lines.

765,jamesharris,shoot the script writers,1,9 December 2002,"DAD has to be the worst entry in the history of Bond.This is even more frustrating when the first twenty minutes were so impressive. The entrance into Korea,Moon's ferocious temper and the chase sequence were well done with the notion of Bond being imprisoned for fourteen monthes novel and original. Bond's subsequent arrival in Hong Kong is deftly handled but the movie goes downhill from the moment Bond arrives in Cuba. Halle Berry is completely miscast as Jinx and seems to think she is in an Austin Powers movie.Her publicist trots out the tired old line about Jinx being the first Bond leading lady to equal 007, but in reality almost all of the Bond girls were tough and independent and let down by poor acting...as happens here. The ludicrous invisible car has been the subject of a great deal of criticism but I'll just say that with this level of technology why bother training double 0 agents?anyone could do the job.Star Trek's Mr Scott famously said that he couldn't change the laws of physics but to judge the poorly judged set pieces here apparently Lee Tamahori can. The less said about the effects the better. There are some inspired casting choices from the European /Asian quarter.Rosamund Pike sparkles as Miranda Frost despite being hamstrung by the script and Rachel Grant shows that her first big screen appearance certainly won't be her last. John Cleese is a pleasant surprise I hated his clowning in TWINE but he works well here and establishes a genuine touch of dignity to some very silly scenes. Traditionally the US casting in Bond films is poor and apart from the over rated Halle Berry Michael Madsen phones in a performance that shows why his career consists of z-grade straight to video garbage. Which is basically what DAD is...albeit with a bigger budget.",Die Another Day
766,jteh,SPOILERS - 10 things I Hate about Die Another Day,6,14 December 2002,"HUMOUR? ________ The extended passages that are meant to be witty reparte in sexual innuendo is Jurassic poo from the Benny Hill School of humour The moral of the story; drop two lame double entendres and you're in bed with Halle Berry (Academy Award Winner 2002 tm)DIALOGUE ________ Based on the lack of credibility the acting is quite servicable but cannot rise above the lines that pretend to be witty. It almost rivals Star Wars - Attack of the clones in terms of turgid dialogue; `I love you.   pull my finger' This is not the fault of the actors but the writers trying to fit in three bad sexual innuendos instead of one witty one. Obviously they don't get laid in real life so they have to compensate for this in virtual realityBOND WOMEN ________ In this film the Bond Women tm. must either be saved, serviced, or killed. If they are too old then they are just hard bitches with BAFTA Awards. The support role of Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) is reduced to a weak plot device and another notch in Bond's bedpost - it hardly a flattering role to look pretty and carry a sword. It's easy for Halle Berry to look sexy but her performance is weak - she has no real material to work from. Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies may not be as sexy as Halle Berry but you can actually believe that she is the real deal. The females in this film looked like models that were told to hold a sword or pistol and look good with a fan blowing in their hair.Just swing your hips in slow motion - it's good for the multiple cross-promotional commercials for Revlon. In this film the young females are nothing more than eye candy due to the weak writing.CLOSE - TOO CLOSE FOR CREDIBILITY ________ Bond and Jinx have several chances to kill Zao and Graves but they throw them away before you can say `Look behind you!'. Like `Scream' we see Bond and Jinx with a 100% kill option for the most dangerous enemies in the film. End Result: a fist fight or getting captured. In `Scream' we see the girl in a bikini at a cross roads between `Escape Route' and `Certain death' and the bimbo always picks the later option - why does this kind of stupidity occur in a Bond film?VULNERABLE? ________ I am invincible! - (Goldeneye) Give the baddie a machine gun mounted on a Jaguar - give Bond an invisible bulletproof car - where is the real jeopardy?HOMAGES or WEAK REPRODUCTIONS with no twist ________ This film is recycling at its worst - nothing new just churning old ideas. Lame homages to previous bond films include the;Q gadgets, Diamonds forever satelite frickin' `laser beam', Having a dual with the bad guy in incognito over over a gold bar or in this case a diamond, Frickin' `Laser beam' torture, Getting sucked out of the windows of a depressurised airplane,Halle Berry pretending to be Ursula Andress.It's good to see the old Bond scenes replayed from the old movies with a few cosmetic changes but to not improve on them or add a decent twist is just plain boring and lazy! I know - we'll have 5 frikin' laser beams instead of 1, and 5 evil Asian men get sucked out of the airplane instead of one fat German one - now that's an improvement over the previous 19 films!ANTI CLIMAX ________ The finale between good and evil is a fistfight on an airplane (the Goldfinger homage quota is fulfilled) Where is the excitement? Gone is the wit / intelligence and style. It becomes a Arnold Swartzennegger muscle fest from the 80's.Henchman Zao - is the only real bad guy who gives Bond a run for his money. He gets killed too easy in the anti climactic car chase. In the film it's the closest thing Bond gets to an evil rival but really it boils down to gadget vs more gadgets and he gets killed off well before the `big ending'At least the car chase had a few good and visual ideas ie. Ejector seat flipping the car as seen in ALL the promos; (Way to go markerting department - show all the best bits in the ads to guarantee a let down in the cinemas - you've got your money now.)CHARACTERS ________ All the characters have a distinct lack of motivation A bad guy who cannot go to sleep because he has changed his DNA - not much was made of this fact - maybe he has to do things faster but really this doesn't add up to a hill of beans and they don't bother following this through. Why was Miranda Frost a double agent - something to do with winning gold at fencing at the Olympics (?!) or was it because Evil Incorportated offered her a new makeup line that was to die for in cross promotions.BOND FOR THE FUTURE ________ I suspect this is a Bond pitched at wider market of younger and less discerning teens.In so doing this I believe they will sacrifice the older audience who prefer to rent video rather than go out and see the film in theatres. If Eon productions continue on this route the following film sales will hurt in the longer term.With this film they're drawing in both young and old. That won't be the case if they follow this new formula for the next couple of rounds - there will be a definite backlash. The public can only be had a couple of times before they avoid the Bond Franchise and write it off as a farce from the 80s.What I want to see in Bond? If I ruled my world I'd like to see more - style, wit, innovation, a litle more mind over muscle. Now they have the money they have run out of ideas and want to play it safe with reruns.I have an idea. How about an even bigger `Frickin' laser beam shot from the moon, which we shall call the `Death Star' Any takers? Anybody?Jacy (Evil jr) Teh",Die Another Day
767,jteh,Dumb in many Ways - like a porno without the sex,6,13 December 2002,"The writers committee has managed to suck the mojo out of this Bond film. It takes over 2 hours to get to the end of this souless action template. Between the action there's lots of turgid dialogue and a weak excuse for a plot. It's like a porno where you want to fast forward to the good bits but they just never come. This isn't the worst or the best of Bond films. I think best or worst lists are stupid. Top ten lists are for simple people who eat Big Macs and want others do their thinking for them. Each film has a different context and judgement criteria.DAD looks like a Bond film, it sounds like a Bond film but after 2 hours it's a pretty stale rerun - you've seen most of this film before in other films and it has nothing new to add to the formula. Have you ever tried to chew on a second hand gum and hope there's still some flavour left? See this film if you want to know what it's like.Some people refer to this as `homage' - I think it's just lazy copying of your homework and a lack of imagination.The things that bring this film down are the lack of credibility and quality of the action - as the two are intertwined. The removal of credibility results in the removel of jeopardy in the action. If Bond is near invincible then there is no tension in the action apart from a series of pretty, flavourless explosion spectacles that mark the current American action film market. As we all know, Bond films ride the tightrope between fantasy/spectacle and reality. In this case DAD has fallen heavily on the side of fantasy at the expense of suspense and jeopardy.<SPOILER BIT HERE>The story tries to have it both ways with credibility. At the start of this film we actually see Bond as fallible - he gets caught and tortured by the bad guys. This brings Bond down to earth and almost makes him believable as a gritty character. The next thing we know he's jumping into his Astin Martin Vanquish car that is INVISIBLE and he's driving it to the bad guys' lair, a Big Mac Opera House that is entirely made of ice. He is subsequently greeted by Dr Evil who has just come in on his rocket powered sled.The credibility that they are so eager to establish at the start amounts to nothing - why did they bother?<END OF SPOILER BIT>Apart from a car chase scene and an over the top sword fight there is very little tension to give Bond a real challenge. The bad guys practially fall over each other in their eagerness to get killed by Bond and Jinx.It looks like the production team are taking a page from the Sylvester Stallone school of script writing - think up all the action scenes then make up some lame excuses for a plot to link them together then add water and shake.Has Bond gone Pearl Harbour on us? When out of ideas add more explosions and if that sucks just make bigger ones - don't bother with any suspense just enjoy the CGI and laugh it up. There's a difference between something innovative or witty and just absurd. Bond is starting to look more and more like it's wannabe competitors, like XXX. If they are not careful people will forget what the difference is between a Bond film and  all the other crass action flicks out there. As a humble suggestion to any future writers out there: Concentrate on quality rather than quantity and relying on post production CGI to cover up the lack of plot with big planes, explosions and multiple frikin' laserbeams.Jacy Teh (Licenced to whine)",Die Another Day

Throw in Halle Berry running around in a bikini exposing her anorexia - and this is their idea of a film? I don't think even a 5 year old would call this a film. Pierce Brosnon, as bond, is a miscast and has very little screen presence, partly because he cannot rise above his weak character. The makers have simply cashed on the bond franchise, and given us nothing but a commercial action pot boiler, that is all mindless action and not an ounce of plot.I do not recommend this to anyone, unless you want to get a few hours of sleep in the theatre.

769,LordShank79,Most ridiculous film since Moonraker!!,7,21 December 2002,"In a word: so-so. Ok, that's actually two words, but it adequately describes my feelings towards this film. For the first hour or so I was hooked. The pre-credits sequence, whilst the weakest of the Brosnan films, was still very good, and once we got past the wretched Madonna theme I started to really enjoy what I was seeing. Bond's imprisonment, expulsion from MI6 and subsequent escape made compulsive viewing, and the swordfight was the best thing this side of Star Wars. Even Halle Berry was quite watchable, despite having a little bit TOO much screentime for a Bond Girl in my opinion. Indeed, everything was moving along quite dandily until the fateful word 'Icarus'. Such things are legendary in Bond films, but this messy and unneccessary sci-fi element felt at odds with the rest of the story. As mentioned many times, the CGI surfing looked totally amatuerish, and though I personally quite enjoyed the invisible car, the chase sequence lacked tension and excitement. Nice guns, though. The editing was also a little strange, and the slow-mo shots made little difference to the impact of the images. On the whole, I felt this was a missed opportunity. It's almost as if the script writers had set their hearts on making a different kind of Bond for the new millenium, one with a darker edge, only to relent halfway through and bolt on elements fans expect to see in every film. It made for an uncomfortable mix of the old and new. On a positive note, though, Brosnan was as good as ever, the score was excellent as always, and it IS Bond. But as disillusioned Star Wars fans will tell you, the audience will only stay with a franchise whilst it remains fresh, new and, most importantly, of highest quality. I hope the powers that be take a note of constructive criticism as well as dollar signs, and give Brosnan a suitable swansong for his fifth and final Bond. It just scrapes a 7/10",Die Another Day

Neither the writers or director have any confidence in Bond or themselves and allow the script to shudder to a halt and do an about face several times. Pierce Brosnan is too old to play Bond now but the failure of the film doesn't rest entirely on his slender shoulders.I doubt that even Connery could save this sub standard effort with a weak cast,lousy derivative script and appalling direction.

If I were Micheal G.Wilson or Barbara Brocolli,I would ask Brosnan for the 6th Bond.Because after him ,the franchise is going to reach a dead end.Like when Dalton got the role.and I think there is not a better choice than Brosnan(considering his age in 2007 o 2008).

But ""Die Another Day"" takes the over acting to a whole new level and re-introduces a new element to the modern Bond movie - the element of the completely ridiculous. Not since ""Moonraker"" have we seen a Bond story so completely brainless, with over the top sci-fi comic book story line (complete with invisible car and Dr Evil ""laser"" beams). Add to that the camp villain weekly portrayed by Toby Stevens and the pure cheese that is Halle Berry's Bond girl & this movie is left with nothing to offer. Sir Ian Fleming would be rolling in his grave. Avoid at all costs.",Die Another Day

Brosnans acting is as wooden as ever, and the story is just laughable. Let's face it, there is noting left that distinguishes a James Bond movie form any other action movie.

The plot is stupid. The gadgets are stupid (invisible cars? Who the hell thought of that?). The big action scenes are stupid. The characters are stupid. etc.A few moments in this film really stand out as being awful. One of these is the ridiculous surf scene where Bond uses a piece of metal and a parachute from a crashed 'something' and uses them to surf this huuuuuge tidal wave. Not only does this scene look unbelievably fake, but it also is too ridiculous even for a Bond movie. Bond films are known to have over-the-top action sequences that probably wouldn't ever happen in real life, but this just takes it too far.They tried to mix Bond, The Matrix & music videos.

777,prince_baron_007,WORST BOND MOVIE EVER MADE BY A WIDE MARGIN,1,23 November 2003,"For years people have argued over the likes of Diamonds Are Forever, The Man with the Golden Gun, A View to a Kill, and Moonraker on the subject of what is the worst Bond film ever. Well as soon as this turkey Die Another Day was released that discussion became forever and permanently DEAD. Die Another Day contains some of the most IDIOTIC one-liners of all time, DREADFULL CGI, HORRIBLY unfunny jokes, pathetically LAME sexual innuendos, a Bond girl (Halle Berry) that is probably the WORST Bond girl of all time, a main villain (Toby Stephens) that is like Robocop meets a snootish/spoiled British brat, a main henchman (Rick Yune) that is like something out of a Star Wars movie for crying out loud, and last but certainly not least, Brosnan stinks it up as well.Brosnan is now officially the WORST of the five Bonds, and this was by MILES the worst acting performance by any Bond ever. This is supposed to be a remake of Moonraker, which has often been derided as being the worst Bond movie, and as usual the remake is 10 times worse than the original. For any serious Bond fan this is an absolute DISGRACE. Ian Fleming, Harry Saltzman, Cubby Broccoli, Terence Young, and Peter Hunt must be rolling in their graves after this joke, and poor Guy Hamilton, the last of the original Bond creators that is still living probably nearly had a heart attack when he saw this piece of trash.Barbara Broccoli, Dana Broccoli, and Michael G. Wilson, along with MGM should be ASHAMED of themselves. They have completely DESTROYED Cubby Broccoli's legacy. And to top it all off and add insult to injury, the only good character in the film Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) is extremely underused, and the worst thing of all, Madonna (who sings a very good Bond theme) is not only singing the song, but is in the movie. One of the worst actresses ever and she is actually BETTER than Berry and Brosnan are in this, and they are supposed to be ""talented"". Berry and Brosnan are so pathetic and lame with their acting in this that they should both have been FORCED to reimburse people who paid money to see this film out of their salaries for the movie. And as far Tamahori goes.........I won't even discuss my feelings on that one, because that would not be appropriate for this forum.

779,DanEvans9495,The 20th and worst Bond film,2,25 February 2007,"Some 5 years after it was released, Die Another Day has failed to improve with age. Aside from a plot that borrows from Diamonds are Forever and some very poor effects, the film also seems to have some of the most unmemorable locations in any Bond film. Indeed it may be the first Bond not to be filmed in any of the main locations which it is set in. Cornwall doubles for Korea, Spain for Cuba and Norway for Iceland. Much criticism has also been centred on the theme tune by Madonna, alongside her appearance in the movie. Then there's the invisible car. Thankfully the producers released the errors of Die Another Day and the new Casino Royale is superior in everyway. Pierce Brosnan deserved better for his final film as 007.",Die Another Day
780,The_McGuffin,It's Really the 2nd Half That's Terrible (NO PLOT SPOILERS),6,13 October 2012,"I actually think the first half of the film is brilliant. Really terrific pre-credits sequence. Memorable villains throughout the film, great respects paid to all of the previous Bond movies to celebrate it being the 20th outing. Bond captured, tortured, and disavowed. Love it. Underground secret London base for rogue agents was always one of my favorite things. Especially with all of the old Q gadgets being showcased in storage there. The fencing scene is also really exhilarating and well choreographed. The Cuba stuff feels like classic Bond, and no one can argue that Brosnan isn't on point throughout. The film really takes its turn once you travel to the ice palace. The movie becomes cheesy, the graphics become more glaringly atrocious, and it just goes off the deep end. The only redeeming part is the car chase on ice, and even that loses credibility since his enemy's car is tricked out as well. It becomes too much of a team-up movie that utilizes Halle Barry's character, Jinx, far too often. I paid to see James Bond, not Catwoman. Despite all of the issues with the second half I really think, in different hands, it could have been pulled off well. The Icarus idea is cool and a nice tribute to Goldeneye and Diamonds Are Forever. I love the North Korean aspect of it all. It just seems like Tamahori wasn't right for the part. Don't even get me started on the slow-mo. I wish this film was better. Brosnan deserved a better sign-off.",Die Another Day

And that's just not right.If you like pure action without a story or if you're in love with Halle Berry (who was awful in this movie by the way, she can do MUCH better) by all means go see it.

Perhaps that's why I'm giving it a higher score than most. Being inaccurate and impossible aren't sins. Oh, and I think Toby Stephens as Gustav Graves was a great villain. Not quite as good as Alec Trevelyan (my favourite villain, and Golden Eye is my favourite movie), but he was decent. To say the least.Maybe it's because you're all die hard 007 fans.

It was a typical Bond movie with fast cars and fast women. It has all the classic elements of a typical Bond film.After the disappointment of World Is Not Enough this movie is like a breath of fresh air.

784,Leah_loves_Chewbacca,"I watched, but nearly died trying",4,27 October 2005,"I'll preface this by saying it took me 3 nights to watch this film. Try as I might, I simply couldn't bring myself to stay awake and while some part of that may have been due to the manly pillow I was snuggled next to, I put to you that many a film HAS held my attention despite the invitation of unconsciousness.To start, while every Bond film has its outlandish suspend-disbelief-and-hang-on-for-the-ride scenes, the ones in this film just didn't appear realistic, nor particularly original. Were they supposed to be a throw-back to films of 30 years ago before modern special effects? (To whit, Bond surfing the mini-tsunami. By which I mean the second surfing exhibition in the movie, as if the first weren't enough.) Though this explanation would work to assuage some part of my grievance, it appears that nobody involved in this movie's conception put that much thought into it.Second, how could I have walked away with the impression of Bond as blundering in his ineptitude? Yes, he is a fabulous surfer and stunt car driver, but these scenes were unrealistic and thus, easily dismissed. The movie starts with him being caught and held in captivity, and yet he never actually figures out who betrayed him. Rather the villain finally reveals what an idiot the both of them are about 40 hours into this film: Bond for never figuring anything out, and he for taking the time to educate Bond rather than simply killing him. (Yes, this is a common motif, but at some level we do want our hero to display some cunning rather than just accepting that his foes will ultimately self-destruct. Again, this film may have benefited from some actual thought.) Third, the film was flat BORING. I don't know if the action scenes were too long, or if I just didn't care about the characters enough to stay focused, but they repeatedly found me nodding off. The only exception was the laser scene which was frightening in its potential for gore, but also comical with Halle Berry yelling at Bond that she's in danger even though he's currently contending with foe while simultaneously dodging numerous laser beams.Finally, Bond rarely seemed capable of actually getting HIMSELF out of scrapes. He spends the entire movie getting either captured, or rescued by women. While this may be progressive, it's not Bond.P.S. Yes, she's Madonna, and it must have been quite a coup to sign her for the movie, but shouldn't they have insisted she produce a decent theme song? Where is the integrity???",Die Another Day

""Die Another Day"", as most of the Brosnan's appearances as the doble-o agent of the Mi6 was frequently overshadowed by the legend of the original (and invencible) Sean Connery series, and actually by the human, less controlled, and far more complex Daniel Craig's aproach. Personally I like so much ""Die Another Day"" specially for the opening sequence where James Bond got imprisoned for a long time in a North-Corean concentration camp, escaped and got rescued cast away. Maybe is the first time that the actual concept of an almost (not absolutely) invincible agent, and that's the value of this picture, as a turning point of the franchise.",Die Another Day

And even when the writers have some moments to let the characters act there are no surprises in that story. You don't have to be extra smart to know the next two or three developments of that story minutes in advance.I don't think that we have seen that much explosions in a Bond movie before - and dear Special Effects Team - we have seen it done better in any other action movie. If you ever wanted to see a really awful bad CGI have a look at the ""Bond surfing a huge wave"" part - can this be done any worse?Well, there are also some positiv thing to say.

It is high paced, the performances are great, the plot is pretty ambitious although the DNA part is too far-fetched. Pierce Brosnan has refined his James Bond at best, he is strong enough while providing a human touch. Rosamund Pike and Toby Stephens give a brilliant performance. Michael Madsen is charismatic although his part is really small. Halle Berry is good although somehow wasted. James Bond is shown for once in a very weak, desperate and insecure position giving him a more human and believable side.The duel in the club between Bond and Graves is probably the best episode of the movie.Madonna's title song is nice but not adapted to a Bond soundtrack.

I read all Fleming's books in my teens and I don't know how many times I've seen all the films. Although there have been some real lows along the way, I've never actually left the cinema with a complete sense of emptiness until I just walked out after seeing Die Another Day. It was bitsy, it lacked flair, the baddies were flat and un-engaging, the plot... what plot? The invisible Vanquish... what was that all about? And some kind of holo deck? The DNA replacement therapy that turned Asians to Caucasians... absolute rubbish. I'm amazed that when I write this, Die Another Day has achieved almost 7 on the IMDb rating. How is that possible? This is not just some action flick where the audience can be bought with special effects and loud noise (neither of which were particularly impressive, just to add insult to injury).

Pierce Brosnan isn't a very good Bond, but the material (the lines, the action) that they (the director) give him is even worse.The movie is packed with action scenes, the one more unbelievable than the other. Bond isn't Bond anymore. It's more a copy of that new breed of heros, like xXx.Now I know why Sean Connery doesn't want to play in a Bondmovie anymore. Roger Moore looked like a Bond and Timothy Dalton was maybe the last real Bond. Maybe they have to look for a new Bond (It may sound ridiculous, but I would opt for Robbie Williams).

792,Ari-24,Mediocre at Best,2,1 December 2002,"I am a huge Bond fan. I have seen every single James Bond movie from Dr. No, till this most recent flick, Die Another Day. This movie starts out fine with great gadgets, awsome action sequences and an already thickening plot. Up till that point, I was psyched. What the James Bond films are losing more and more, is James Bond. So far before the opening credits, I am supposed to be thrilled, but then again I may as well be watching XXX with Vin Diesel. After the opening credits (which have a twist in this film), I am supposed to meet Bond, and we are about to get down to business . . . wrong. More action and violence. In fact one never meets James Bond till a half hour into the film, when he stumbles into a Hotel. I will admit that there is a good amount of Bond instead of XXX type action, but there is not much inbetween. One minute Mr. Suave, and then the next Rambo.Another complaint is the completely farfetched action sequences. For god sakes, there is something called reality. I see way too much of world-class XXX stunts, that is completely impossible, that is not what James Bond is all about. One or Two of those per movie please. This movie had hundreds. It makes you start to question why James Bond hasn't died yet, and you finally want him to screw up and just not open the parachute in time (or something). Bond is not only losing touch with reality in action sequences, but also logic. John Cleese, shows bond a car that can become invisible (yeah right!) and suddenly a few days later it is in Iceland. I know that this is possible, but it still raises questions when one does not actually see the transport. There are many more that I won't even get into.The problem with this type of action and illogical bumps in the plot, is that it stops you from actually watching and enjoying the film. For the first time ever watching a James Bond movie, I actually stopped enjoying the film because of the STUPID action.Now for my praises. That plot was great. The acting didn't take away from the film, although Halle needs to practice the Heroine roll in films. They gave the film a very nostalgic touch, which meant a bit more to a veteran watcher like me, for they included several gadgets in Cleeses lab from other movies that Bond Jokes about.Summary:Action was so unrealistic that it took away from the film. Dido for illogical plot ripples. James bond is not what he was (I suppose that over 40 years that is bound to happen). Good plot, pretty good acting.",Die Another Day

794,tedbroadbent,"The action sequences are linked by one liners, the film lacks any real substance",6,20 November 2002,"40 years, 20 films, you would think that the franchise might make an effort with this landmark film. Indeed they have made an effort but the end product is sadly lacking.Admittedly it starts off well with Bond infiltrating the Korean Demilitarized Zone and hijacking a helicopter to take him to meet the villain of the piece. After a breathtaking hovercraft chase over land mines bond is captured and spends 14 months being tortured. It is a bold move by the script writers but ultimately it is not significantly used to have any great influence on the film. I much rather prefer Bond to make a clean getaway perhaps not catching his target but destroying their base, etc very much along the lines of the best pre title sequence so far in ""The World is Not Enough"". It is then we witness or should I say hear the worst part of the film Madonna's theme music, I am sure this will be discussed elsewhere but it's disco beat does nothing but annoy.Through out the film Bond does not appear strong enough, Brosnan keeps on saying how he likes to portray Bond as someone who does not have all the answers, unfortunately his is taken to an extreme in the film with Bond stumbling from one action packed scene to another, even in the car chase across the frozen ice plains see him trying to avoid himself getting hit rather than trying to kill the bad guy. We see Zao use his Jag's wide array of weapons while bond uses nothing but anti missle decoys. Despite this, the sequence is probably the best part of the film. Stunts such as these are only linked by sparse dialogue mainly consisting of one liners, the double entendres are becoming too cliched and have no meaning. The best example is between the conversation between Jinx and Bond where there is supposed to be sexual tension is nothing more than embarrassing. This and a shoddily written plot, basically the technology is a bit too over the top - even for a bond film, sees any orginality non-existent.MGM see Bond as a cash cow and the super spy as such is no more. Die another Day  knows it has guaranteed box office and never does it differentiate from other films in the genre, the overuse of Slow motion is unnecessary and it blatantly copies from the matrix. The originality is gone and the franchise needs to have a good look at itself to bring back the bond of old and to mix it with exciting action, the balance between action and sleuthing is crucial.Overall the film is not one of the greats but it is an entertaining two and a half hours.",Die Another Day

797,papadimitriou,"You know the name, you know the number...",8,20 November 2002,"Many reviewers were fast to copycat each other and call this new Bond movie as the best in 20 years. While I agree that 'For Your Eyes Only'  is surely one of the best Bond ever made, I wouldn't go that far. Pierce Brosnan does again a very strong impersonation of Bond. Some would say in between a rough Sean Connery and a lighter Roger Moore. In the first part of the movie, he was actually more Timothy Dalton. The rough, hard-edged Bond. Suffering. Dark. The real spy. The real Bond from the Ian Fleming's book. The best Bond. I was overjoyed. The pace from the pre-credit scene, trough the torture, the imprisonment , the hotel scene (one of the best in Bond's history) the Cuba episode (Bond is a real spy again) and  the London showdown (the saber fight is nothing short of fantastic and Cleese as R is pure genious) led me to think that all the hype was true. It was promising to be the best Bond ever, with a grace that only 'From Russia With Love', 'On His Majesty's Secret Service', 'For Your Eyes Only', 'The Living Daylights' and to a certain extent 'The World Is Not Enough' were able to touch. A pure marvel. Only that after this first hour or so, the movie started to be a Roger Moore vehicle again. Very entertaining. Very spectacular. But not bondian. Where had the style and the wit gone ? Away from Britain, for sure. Only to the far end (the Moneypenny scene) was the audience led to step on this ground again. So, no, sorry, it's not the best Bond movie ever. It ranks very high no matter what and should surely please the crowds as so many other action-Bonds have. Being a Bond movie, the mistakes are charmingly forgivable. Being a Bond, the action and the plot still are lot better than any other action movie around. By very far. James Bond will return.",Die Another Day

(Mega SPOILERS ahead).Pre-titles: A surprise here. For such a good Bond movie, I thought the pre-titles sequence was nothing special. I feared a re-hash of the TND pre-titles, and it was. I also didn't care for that washed-out overly saturated look the DP gave the whole sequence. Bond movies are not supposed to look that way. Stop trying so hard, I thought. But then there was something about Bond hanging on the bellafter the hovercraft goes over the waterfall that made me sit up and say, hmmm, nice Bond moment there. Then.Titles: Amazing, breathtaking, inventive, interesting, incredible! Even that lame Madonna song with that annoying audio drop out couldn't ruin it. Here I realized DAD was boldly experimenting with the formula without betraying it. This wasBond, but not the same old Bond and it worked beautifully. Oh, Scorpion Girl.I love you, you little savage cutie-pie.Bearded Bond/Hong Kong stuff: This was so bold, so unexpected, so unBond,and so overtly dramatic, I should have hated it. But I didn't. I loved it! Bond goes into cardiac arrest? I was stunned. The audience was stunned. The movie hadus all by the throats. We're not just watching a great Bond movie here-we'rewatching a great movie, period. And then Bond walks into the Hong Kong hotelin his ragged condition but still with full Bond aplomb and, hey, this movie is working!Cuba: Okay, for everyone who says Timothy Dalton was the book Bond...no,you're wrong. Pierce Brosnan is the book Bond here, Pierce Brosnan isConnery's Bond here, Pierce Brosnan IS James Bond here! This is the best part of the film, in my opinion. Classic Bond. I love, LOVE, that Bond and Jinx hit the sheets right off the bat. Of course this is how it should be. I realized I've grown very tired with the Bond-has-sex-with-the-main-girl-only-at-the-end formula. I think it works much better that Bond and the main girl START their relationship with pure, animal lust, then grow to respect one another. It's Bond and Tracy. Sex first...love later. Nice.London calling: All the scenes set in London are fabulous. I loved the Blades swordfight, classic Bond and villain duel turned up to the maximum. And JohnCleese IS `Q'. 'Nuff said.Iceland: I love the location, the ice palace, the Icarus satellite demonstration, the dragster, Miranda, etc...but I did feel the wall-to-wall action in this part of the film started overwhelming what up until then had been a very clean narrative. Jinx is captured and saved twice in the same location? Overkill. A major set-pieceshould have been sacrificed here to lighten the load on the storyline (and the audience). In my opinion, the big glacier surfing stunt could have been lost, cool as it was. My objection to this scene wasn't with the cheesy CGI, it's with the fact that it was SO big it played like a sequence ending climax and took away from the ice ballet car chase that followed. Yes, I got a bit lost amid all the action in Iceland, but this is my ONLY complaint.Climactic battle: Awesome, incredible, one of the most exciting Bond climaxes ever filmed! I love the Icarus satellite burning it's way through Korea as the plane disintegrates in mid-air. Loved that Miranda took the time during all this chaos to change into that sexy fencing outfit for her big fight with Jinx. And Graves died the way a Bond villain should die-big! The audience cheered.Then there was the final Moneypenny scene that had the audience almost ontheir feet with cheers and laughs and, yes, at that moment DAD was the BESTJAMES BOND MOVIE EVER!Now to address a few of the elements of controversy that I've heard in regards to this film.DAD goes OTT with the sci-fi element: What? How? I think DAD did what all the `spectacular' Bond films do and that's bring it right to the line without crossing it. Nothing in DAD is impossible-it's improbable, yes, but it's not impossible and that's the Cubby Broccoli edict. No probs. And I welcome the return of the BIG, fun Bond film which DAD certainly is.Jinx/Berry: Come on, she was awesome! Like it or not, Halle Berry as Jinxenters the pantheon of great Bond girls. She was also flippin' hot!Too much CGI: Nah, it was fine. Even the much-maligned glacier surfing stuntdidn't bother me. Hey, I didn't let the Tarzan yell ruin Octopussy, I'm not going to let one bad special effect ruin DAD. I'm there to have fun and I did.Congrats Eon, MGM, and everyone involved with DIE ANOTHER DAY. Even ifwhen I come down from my high-I decide it's not the best James Bond movieof them all, it's still the best Bond movie in over a decade and one thatreinvigorates the series and that's an amazing accomplishment.",Die Another Day
799,Andy Eyre,"If you miss one film this Christmas, miss this.",4,20 November 2002,"A serious and misguided departure from the classic James Bond formula, this film not only fails to live up to expectations, it morphs into Robocop and blows them out of a 25th storey window.Gone is the suave, sophisticated James Bond we love, and in his place stands a generic Sly Stallone clone. The double-act appears to be a blatant attempt to generate a spin-off series, and the baddies too are faceless wonders, with no menace or purpose except to act as punchbags for the dynamic duo there.To be fair, none of this is Brosnan's fault ... he simply does what he's told, and the scriptwriters seem to have stolen from every Bond film, and then some. Originality has never been the point of the James Bond series, but this is taking the proverbial biscuit.Obvious attempts to play up to American sympathies are the crowning glory of this magnificent show of Hollywood film-making talent - the CGI effects are rubbish (clearly, hiring real stuntmen is a lot of effort these days), and the attempted matrix-like cinematography just makes a bad film look worse.Verdict : 4/10 - If you must have James Bond, dust off your DVD collection and put Thunderball on instead. But don't waste your money to see this film.",Die Another Day
800,hardstama,Ruining Bond forever,1,25 November 2002,"If this film was entitled Die Another Day, and the lead character was called something other than James Bond, then I'm sure it would have been vastly enjoyable movie, but as it stands I left the cinema infuriated at the change from the 'hi-tech adventure thriller' formula that has served Bond so very well up to this point, into 'fantasy adventure with a splash too much CGI effects'. I mean, invisible car? 14 months of torture? Kite surfing on a typhoon wave? We might be amazed by the incredible but we are most certainly not fooled by the impossible. The fact is that the beauty of Bond is that, if he was the world's greatest secret and an allround talented guy, then the scrapes he gets past are just about believable, but 'Die Another Day' has turned Bond from a super human to a superhero, and unwittingly so. It does not seem an intentional change.At times the CGI is fantastic, but there are moments whe you feel you are watching your kid brother give a demo of his latest playstation 2 game.Bond's detachment from MI-6 and from M is also an unnerving, uncharacteristic and unnecessary move. Whilst it proves Bond is not dependent on his institution, there never has been that implication from previous Bond films and it leaves you feeling like Bond is under-appreciated. An emotion that none of us Bond lovers have ever felt. Also, Bond's captivity shows a weakness that we needn't see. To us, Bond is flawless. His 14 months of imprisonment could at least have resulted in a break out rather than a poncy exchange. Surely if Bond can drive an invisible car then he can also break out of prison!?! Let's just hope that the next production team don't try too hard and go back to the basics that made Bond the world's most successful secret agent. 'Die Another Day' is not a true Bond film, it is a fiery fantasy adventure that ignores everything that Bond stands for. A downright disappointment. 2/10",Die Another Day
801,Constructor,Shaken not stirred,9,20 November 2002,"I am sure Die Another Day will be one of the more controversial films in the Bond pantheon. I liked it tremendously, but was surprised by the darkness of the tone.The imagery of the downbeat pre-credits sequence, in which James Bond finally resembles a secret agent, never really leaves the viewer throughout the film, which sees a colder, slightly embittered, older 007. Even his initial flirting with Jinx and subsequent love scenes have a more sombre tone. Political prisoner exchanges, sleeper agents, the North and South Korea conflict, a genuinely fearsome weapon of mass destruction (as first for a Bond film), allied intelligence agencies at loggerheads - so far, so realistic.But fourteen months! Harsh, even given all those terrible one-liners. The sequence plus his rejection by MI6 makes you feel Bond's anger and pain which is a first for the series - Bond has never seemed human before. On the other hand, he is still Superman at times. We learn for example that Bond is a superb surfer and fencer, can drop his heartbeat to almost zero by willpower, is capable of taking of what seems to be the entire North Korean army, that MI6 have pioneered the 'holodeck' technology used by Captain Picard and co, and also that his unbelievable car makes the Stealth Bomber look like an antique. The villain's secret is a clever twist. Whereas Moonraker was a farce, here somehow it all works. Have fun spotting the in-jokes, too.There are some incredible set-pieces in the movie - an extended swordfight involving everything from epees to broadswords, an Icelandic bar out of a Bacardi Breezer commercial, a thrilling car chase/advert across the ice, to the final showdown in the North Korean Demilitarised Zone. Bond also demonstrates that he can out-x Vin Diesel.Lee Tamahori has done an excellent job of developing Bond's human side, which Pierce Brosnan has given glimpses of in his previous three films in the series. And yet the film remains true the series in sheer incredulity in other areas. Genetic modification may only be years away but why Cuba (other than being a sexy location)? How did the villains manage to develop such a weapon? I presume they managed to, effectively, clone Bond's car by obtaining plans to it from their mole but this is never confirmed, nor is how their agent managed to access such a breadth of information. Still, this is same intelligence agency which let a British-hating Liensk Cossack become a 00 agent...Brosnan, Stephens and Yune are all excellent. Unfortunately, Judi Dench hardly features and Pike's role is underwritten. And we learn the truth about Moneypenny all along! As for Halle, she does well and that first scene is memorable, but I am not utterly convinced by Jinx. Even the ending reflects a new, darker Bond - though not to the extent of On Her Majesty's Secret Service.There are flaws - the ice palace occasionally looks fake from the outside, and I am not sure about the use of slow-motion at points. Also the film is a little overlong.As I said I liked the film and was surprised by the risks taken in portraying a different side to James Bond. I think it deserves to do well. The ultimate test of the film's quality will be in thirty years' time. Will it be considered along with Goldfinger and From Russia With Love as one of the greatest Bond films? I think so. Brosnan has made his mark.",Die Another Day
802,rwiggum800,"new movie, but same Bond?",9,23 November 2002,"After reading the review provided by IMDb, I agree with the last critic mentioned. I am a huge Bond fan, and initially, and I mean from the gun-barrel sequence, this was a different Bond movie. Using common sense, I reasoned that movies must evolve to avoid becoming stale, and parodies of themselves, so I put the ""new nuances"" aside and just watched the movie. You know what? Despite the XXX-like approach to quite a few stunts, it was pretty good. An excellent movie, a pretty good Bond movie.  Halle Berry stumbled her way through the movie-barely, and supporting cast was all right. Don't be soured by the ""newness"", looking back, you can discern differences between and among all the Bonds, both movies and actors. At least the gross of the movie will support future installments-but who will be Bond......",Die Another Day
803,Loonieburger,Cheap Tuesday wasn't cheap enough...,1,27 November 2002,"One of the first things I noticed was that there were several older (40+) folks in the crowd.  Many of whom had brought kids with them.  I've always thought Bond was like sesame street in that parents and kids alike can enjoy them, albeit for different reasons.  Kids will love the gadgets and explosions, etc. (not that the adults don't) but the adults can enjoy the double-entendres, amongst other things, without fear of their children catching on.  When 'Jinx' has to exclaim, ""Take that bitch!"" rather than the typical high-brow British dialogue we've all become accustomed to, I saw many parents wince.  Sad.  They took this 40 year old franchise and systematically wrecked everything I liked about it.  From Madonna's opening theme (which sounded like a baby being hit with a cat) to her cameo, to the out-and-out predictability of the whole thing, the movie lost me...or was it the lack of plot that lost me?  They tried to Americanize the film, and failed miserably.  Thank goodness for Cleese's performance.  If they can but build on his immutable character, perhaps they can get back on track for Bond 21.

806,ea29olb,Where are the true bond fans?,1,25 November 2002,"Wow.  To go from watching Sean Connery as a brilliant bond, Roger Moore picking up right where Connery left off, a few decent Timothy Dalton flicks (even though he wasnt a real great Bond character), to several very good Pierce Brosnan films, Die Another Day is simply disappointing.Die Another Day is an attempt to stray from the original Bond traditions and create newer ones.  Lets start with the opening scene.  Bond is always on some kind of mission, completing it and scoring with a hot chick..enter the theme song.  Die Another Day you have Bond getting captured and tortured during the theme song?? To add to that, Bond gets is a$$ kicked way too much!  He is saved from torture, luckily beats Gustav in the fencing/sword fight (Bond fencing??), and again is saved by Jinx from the black henchman when she fires the laser through his head.  I didn't realize Bond was such a p*ss.In past Bonds, there will be up to 5 women that Bond 'meets'..Die Another Day there are a total of 2. The gadgets are pretty cool, although the invisible car stretches it a little bit.  The surfing with a parachute was really bad. Way too much computer imaging. Maybe I am being too cynical, and the producers are trying to capture a new age of people, but I think they would be far more successful if they stuck to the original Bond themes.",Die Another Day

810,sprocket,Fantastic film - for 10 year old schoolboys!,1,1 December 2002,"The cast are excellent, including the ""un-knowns"", and Daniel Klineman's opening titles are as wonderful as ever. I only wish that EON had decided to make a James Bond film with them, instead of which we are subjected to something on par with the incomprehensable Batman franchise (One step ahead of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!)I have been a fan of the series for decades and realise that there have been moments when, not surprisingly given its age, the series has breifly seemed to run out of steam. However in the past the producers have always aimed for an audience with an IQ and expectations higher than that of the average 10 year old schoolboy. Not so with Die Another Day, which proves to be only marginally better than the appalling Bond rip-off Mission Impossible 2.
With the kind of money and expertise available to the makers of the Bond series, all of which was used to perfection in the previous film, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day is inexcusable.EON are now taking 3 years to produce these films as opposed to the 2 year gap for previous productions, so I think it should be reasonable for an audience to have high expectations of them. Having seen Die Another Day I would suggest that they should take even longer, or not bother at all.For me the best part of the film was the fact that somebody else bought my ticket.

812,JSGully,If it ain't broke-- Don't fix it! Shame to the Bond-Legacy,4,23 May 2006,"After just watching this movie for the first time, I felt the urge to join IMDb and write a comment on this movie out of sheer disappointment. I have and hopefully always will be a Bond fan, while not the most artistic or stunning movies, they always guarantee fun and have a unique flair. Or did up until now at least... I don't know what changed with this movie in terms of the production team, but somehow this movie marked a downhill slide, hopefully one that will not be a permanent characteristic of future bond movies.As others have noted, the special effects were at some points a bit too much. There was too heavy a reliance on cgi action scenes that tore away from the possible-but-not-plausible style of the bond films. Along the same lines a lot of the hallmark traits of the bond films were taken too far and wound up destroying the film. The gadgets and technology in the film was for the most part believable and exciting, but at points seemed a little too much (gene-therapy that completely alters the body with flashing light masks?), possibly by developing some of these ideas more they could have been better integrated into the film.Another major flaw was the actions sequences: they were a bit too raw and underdeveloped to say the least. In other bond movies they blend seamlessly in with the plot but in this one some of the scenes seemed stretched-out or forced in (ie the car chase sequence). This movie's predecessors featured more believable actions scenes that grant the same amount of intensity but in smaller doses.Tragically, the worst flaw of this movie was the dialog: Bond films have always been chock full of witty lines, humorous innuendos and funny wise-ass remarks. In this movie these hidden joys were too blatantly force fed to the audience, and this along with obvious (opposed to implied) graphic violence, detracts from the witty, slick and clean James Bond character of the past.The plot for the most part was classic Bond, although there are some discrepancies that arise from dealing with a post-Cold War era that pull away from the previous Bond films. My only complaint with plot was the heavy reliance on Halle Berry's character, Bond is generally the solo-star with a female accomplice, not a die-hard co-star. Finally on my list of complaints, I have to say that I was extremely annoyed with the scoring/music for this film. Bond movies have always incorporated more or less the same music or at least the same 'classic spy' style music aside from the Intro and Credits. In this movie they pulled away from that tradition and instead incorporated god-awful techno-style 'Bond music' that didn't fit with the movie's nature. This is most obvious with the Intro song which replaces the common cold yet vibrant music with aforementioned 'techno-style' music, especially in the bond 'gun-barrel' opener. Not to mention the Intro-scene itself which instead of the stunning incorporation of masked/skinned females and tech-laden motifs also included live movie footage (come on the intro is one of the coolest parts don't kill it).All negativity/criticism aside, it was still a fun movie to watch. I just wish that it had not deviated from the classic Bond trends that we know and love and would resist the 'hollywoodization' that has destroyed so many adventure/action titles (Mission Impossible anyone?). It is a shame that Brosnan, one of the best Bonds ever (aside from Connery) had to go out with this one after three amazing Bond productions.",Die Another Day

817,xizor-3,Destined to be the Most Underrated Bond Film?,10,25 May 2003,"""Die Another Day"", the 20th cinematic epic in the 40 year-old ongoing adventures of ultra-suave superspy James Bond takes the sleuth to giddy heights he hasn't reached since Roger Moore's take on the character in ""Octopussy"" (twenty years ago). Pierce Brosnan is perhaps the best of the five actors to take on the role, but it had been felt by many that he had yet (even with GoldenEye, the 90's classic that even fans today judge each new film against) to find the perfect script that would put him in his most memorable adventure yet. Luckily, with Kiwi director Lee Tamahori (""Once Were Warriors"", ""Along Came a Spider"") at the helm, James Bond returns in a film that shakes up the system but keeps the all-too-familiar elements that we have come to love.Pierce Brosnan as James Bond: When watching ""Die Another Day"", you won't be comparing Irishman Brosnan to Sean Connery or Roger Moore. With this, his fourth performance as James Bond, Brosnan takes full command of the role. He wisely takes the character to new depths (such as Bond's 14 month capture and torture in a North Korean military prison) without becoming melodramatic or too overly emotional. He remains true to the character and as audience-pleasing as any post-Connery actor can get without feeling like he's trying to imitate Connery's suaveness and cruelty or Roger Moore's comedy and constant winking at the audience. With Tamahori's help, he emotionally develops the character in the ways that Timothy Dalton and George Lazenby failed and still remains the all-knowing James Bond you know and love. Bond is a human in this film and not a superhero.Halle Berry as Jinx Johnson: With Halle Berry's introduction to James Bond comes perhaps the film's most controversial mixed-bag. With her entrance in the film (a homage to the bikini-clad beach entrance of Ursula Andress in ""Dr. No""), she enters the high-style history of the Bond Girls - but in a good way? Berry is perhaps the most exotic beauty of the recent Bond Girls - and that helps; but her character is plagued with some terrible and cringe-worthy dialogue (""Yo Mama!"", ""Read this, bitch!"", etc.). The street-smart aspects of her character that are meant to seperate her from the purely British Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) seem undefensively trashy in the film when Bond Girls are meant to represent an unattainable amount of style and glamour. Berry's first scenes in Cuba are chock full of the feminine glamour and clever dialogue; but when we meet her again in Iceland, the almost trashy street-smart aspects of her character appear. It's one thing to have an independent female spy in her character (as has been done right with the female leads in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", ""Moonraker"", and ""Tomorrow Never Dies""), but it is another (and more disappointing) thing for Berry's character to have been taken in the direction that she has. It's a shame this happened to Berry. And what is with her name? The character was originally written as Jinx Jordan; a far more exotic name. But shouldn't we have guessed that ""Johnson"" would be used eventually?Toby Stephens as Gustav Graves: With four Bond films under his belt, it's a shame that Brosnan has only had one truly satisfying villian (Sean Bean in ""GoldenEye""). Luckily for us, the producers have cast a great villian in Toby Stephens. Stephens starts the film as the classic Bond villian; a mysterious billionaire who's bent on holding the world for ransom. Only at the end of the second act do we come to find out that Gustav Graves is not all he appears to be. Stephens is perfect at capturing the public sneer and arrogance of a British billionaire who appears to be ""Public Friend #1"" but reaching an intensity in his eyes in only a matter of seconds. Tamahori not only gave us an exciting action sequence in the sword fight at the Blades Gentleman's Club in the middle of the film; he gave us a multi-level character study of Graves in the face of losing (How far will this character go to win?). Eventually, the layers begin to fade away and we begin to see that Gustav Graves is on the edge of insanity. The scene where he shoots his father aboard the Antonov is particularly revealing in the lack of emotion he shows. Great acting from Stephens, who I hope will go down in the books as one of the classic Bond villains.Rosamund Pike as Miranda Frost: Where Halle Berry's character was very unappealing and uninteresting in personality, Rosamund Pike's character, MI6 agent Miranda Frost, is the opposite: a sexy, smart, and well-spoken character. The only negative aspect of Miranda Frost is her small amount of screentime. For such an interesting and important character to the story, she is given surprisingly little presence in the film which unfortunately makes her fight with Jinx at the end not as climactic as it could have been. Though she's no Xenia Onnatop or Fiona Volpe, Pike holds her own as a Bond Girl.Rick Yune as Zao: After several films with disappointing and unmemorable henchmen, the producers and writers have given us a great villian in Zao. An interesting visual image in the tradition of Odd Job, Jaws, or the often-forgotten Red Grant, Zao becomes a truly important character to the film without being overplayed. He appears to have a brother-like relationship with the main villain of the film and is, for a change, an interesting character behind the horribly disfigured face.The Supporting Cast - Judi Dench, John Cleese, and Samantha Bond: The supporting cast all provide great performances and work expertly with their well-written dialogue. Judi Dench expands on her character from the emotionally-charged situation we found her in in the last film and provides an extension of the ball-busting boss kind of relationship that she and 007 had in ""GoldenEye"". John Cleese steps up to the role of Q with confidence and wit, leaping away from the buffoonery he was written in ""The World is Not Enough"". Samantha Bond is terrific as always, giving us a witty and clever Miss Moneypenny and taking the character in a completely new direction with her limited amount of screentime.Screenplay by Neil Purvis and Robert Wade: After the emotional and complex story that Neil Purvis and Robert Wade developed for ""The World is Not Enough"", it is not a surprise that they were given a chance to write the screenplay for ""Die Another Day"". Though the team is great at crafting great stories and situations, they had a miss in the character of Jinx Johnson. Where all of the other new characters in the story are interesting and complex without being melodramatic or cheesy, Jinx Johnson is both. She is given weak and cringe-worthy dialogue. It is a shame for the character and the film that Bruce Fierstein was not given a chance to polish the dialogue between Jinx and Bond as he had with the film before. The writers, however, are great at giving us a Bond that is the best of both the Fleming and film incarnations. While not quite the sparkling dialogue of ""Thunderball"" or ""GoldenEye"", it works. The subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle references to the past 20 films are a treat. Should they be invited back to write the next film, I'll have full faith that they will give us a good story. However, I have one minor complaint; and that is that the caper is basically a repeat of the ""hold the world for ransom"" threat that Blofeld devised in ""Diamonds are Forever"". It's a shame that they couldn't have come up with a better caper for such an interesting villain. Could we maybe have Fierstein back for the next film, if only to polish the dialogue?Editing by Christian Wagner: One of the more controversial aspects of ""Die Another Day"" is the very modern style of cutting employed by editor Christian Wagner; something that has drawn much criticism from the fans who favor the more traditional style in a Bond film. For me, the speed-up/slow-down style of editing used in some of the action scenes works as a great advantage to the film. Often times, the editing technique that is a typical trait of Christian Wagner's work wakes up the audience in a fight scene or a dramatic change of location (the transition from M's office to Iceland, for example). This is the modern style of cutting action films; and while it may not be as unique as Peter Hunt who pioneered the editing styles of action films in the early Bond films, it is the way things are done today. I would rather have dramatic and hyper-active editing with fast and exciting action such as this than the dull and worn-out editing by Jim Clark in ""The World is Not Enough"".Photography and Production Design: Director of Photography David Tattersall (""Star Wars: Episode II"", ""Vertical Limit"") gives us one of the most incredibly-filmed entries in the series and puts great locations like Spain (doubling for Cuba) and Iceland to terrific use on film. My only complaint is that the producers seem to find it easier to double for locations than actually go to them. Coastal Spain stands in greatly for Cuba (and if I didn't know about it, I probably would never have noticed). Much to Tattersall and Tamahori's credit, it seems like they have thrown all of the effort they have into making the locations feel like they really are North Korea or Hong Kong. Unfortunately, however, the scene where Brosnan appears at the ""Hong Kong Yaht Club"" with the harbor behind him looks almost obviously green-screen. Production Designer Peter Lamont (""Titanic"", ""True Lies"") has suceeded in creating some terrific sets for the film, most notably in Gustav Grave's Ice Palace lair in Iceland. Also a notable success in the set design is Col. Moon's North Korean base that appears in the opening scene in the film. Lamont and Tattersall together provide a great and glamorous atmosphere for ""Die Another Day"" that is rarely felt in a Bond film. Without the expert handling of both, the locations and sets never would have seamlessly blended together as well as they have and the credibility would have been lost (as with ""The World is Not Enough"").Title Sequence by Danny Klienmann: The visuals of the title sequence by Danny Klienmann are absolutely terrific. Kudos to him for taking a risk and mixing the old with the new. He's given us a title sequence that is clever and has a lot of meaning to the story. Hopefully, this kind of tradition will be continued with the next film. Did anyone else catch the subtle homages to ""Goldfinger""'s title sequence in this scene?Title Song by Madonna: Unfortunately, Madonna's talent is wasted on a terrible title song. With no real melody, the song is incredibly weak. The lyrics themselves are a mixed bag, but you would never hear them under all of the pop sound effects and dance beats. Same thing with the strings, which themselves are not even real. Her cameo in the film is simply atrocious.Score by David Arnold Though not represented well on disc, David Arnold's score is a terrific combination of the classic 60's feel of ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and the modern edge of ""The World is Not Enough"" without feeling like a retread of previously covered material. The cues underscoring the scenes in Hong Kong and Cuba are particular highlights of the score; most notably the Latin flavor in the Cuba scenes. His new technique of blending different layers of orchestra works well in the action cues (especially in ""Iced Inc."", the cue that underscores the car chase in Iceland). It's a shame that Arnold was never able to record ""I Will Return"", the theme he had composed that is woven in sections throughout the score. For a more successful score on the next film, maybe Arnold should use less sampling and more orchestra - which, in my opinion, gives the world of Bond more glamour and class.Direction by Lee Tamahori: Pierce Brosnan may have found his best direction in that of Lee Tamahori - a director who's not afraid to take risks and try something new with the tried-and-tested formula of the films. Luckily for us, the risks are paid off and if Tamahori should return the franchise would be safe in his hands. A bullet spirals down the gunbarrel! Bond is captured and held in a prison for 14 months! Ballsy firsts like these are simply delicious.Unfortunately, the Brosnan films seem to have never found permanant writers, D.P.'s, editors, and directors. I hope that all of these positions are filled with the technical crew of ""Die Another Day"". I would love to see Tamahori, Tattersall, Wagner, Purvis, and Wade all come back for another Bond film; and I really hope that they do. Though we may all be victims of the ""Bond fever"", I think this is quite possibly the best and most satisfying Bond films in the last 20 years.",Die Another Day

For those of you who haven't seen it (should you still want to) I won't ruin it for you (the actual film ruins itself better than I ever could), but it is truly beyond belief.

820,redeagle717-1,The Worst Bond Movie Ever,3,16 December 2006,"The list of why this movie is horrible is endless. The most notable reason for why it sucks is because of how extremely far-fetched and stupid the writing for this movie is. The villains are very flat characters guided by stupidity. I kept wondering how the hell Zao had a car that had thermal sensory options with a machine gun mounted on it. The whole notion of a beam in the sky, like from Diamonds Are Forever, that literally destroys the earth is an easy way out of something else that doesn't sound that far fetched. Laziness is what compelled the writing, directing, and acting of this movie. Graves was the worst of them all- with his stupid one liners like ""I have to live out my dreams"" ""I never sleep"" and ""there's plenty of time to sleep when your dead""- nonsense- bunch of crap things that make no sense. The thing that really upset me was how Bond is captured in the beginning and goes through a 14 months of prison. What the heck? Bond always wins in the beginning and keeps you cheering as you do. The ice palace was a bunch of nonsense too, and this whole notion of Iceland being this icy country- get your facts straight- Iceland should be called Greenland and vice versa- BIG MISTAKE. As a small country, Iceland is only a sixth ice- the rest is greenery. The other thing that angered me is how they made Frost resemble another Asian person who beat Bond up in Korea- doesn't work. The only thing in the movie that was interesting to watch was the unrealistic sword fight between Graves and Bond. Sometimes, I didn't even know where the movie was taking place- like when they are about to snipe Graves and they cut through the fence of the military airport without being caught- WHAT?- (how could they have defended themselves from the military if they shot Graves?) and make it onto the plane- hogwash! No thought was put into the movie whatsoever. I'm glad Casino Royale came out because it redeemed Bond and you must admit that Brosnan was getting to old for Bond. 3/10-. Crap Hell",Die Another Day

He is known for making great escapes in previous outings, but the escapes he makes in this one take the biscuit; it is so unrealistic as to have come straight from a computer game.   Believable it might be for a character like Vin Diesel's XXX to do some of the stunts in this film, but a 50 yr old like Bond, no way.   This film drowns under a tidal wave of daft special effects and a plot that is not even remotely believable.  As for the famous Bond sense of humour, well it was non existent.

One of our writers used the review after seeing the film to fill in the missing or misunderstood parts. Now with that said and done I though the movie was great! Lots of twist and special effects but some over use of CGI.  While story and plot were great some lines of events were slightly hard to follow one can stay with it.

829,minnow11,Different from the rest and Better from the rest,8,3 February 2003,"After watching the film I am amazed. Pierce Brosnan is the best man to have played the character and Die Another Day shows him at his best playing it.Die Another Day did not feel like a James Bond film, a lot of new ideas were thrown in. Best example would be with the movie's intro clip which did not consist of the traditional successful mission with 007 escaping victorious, instead the complete opposite. The mission is compromised and after killing one of the leading terrorists, he is captured and held captive for 14 months.Pierce was born to play James Bond. He is very slick even in the heavy action scenes (apart from when he forgot to stretch and pulled a muscle during early production lol). The dialog in Die Another Day is more humorous than ever and Pierce Brosnan carries out a very natural, masterful performance to deliver it.John Cleese has been one of my memorable stars for years and others like myself in Britain are proud that he is now in the James Bond films ensuring displays that will be remembered world-wide. John Cleese is brilliant as the new 'Q'. The relationship between 'Q' & James Bond is maintained in the traditional warm and humorous manner as 'Q' presents the most lovable car yet.The computer graphics are stunning and quiet obviously the best to have ever been seen in a James Bond film. The credits intro with Madonna's quality theme song clearly demonstrates this, representing the new style of a James Bond film. It doesn't just show transitions of dancing girls like the others all did, but Die Another Day's intro includes the mix of computer animation and footage of James Bond being beaten and held captive. Very clever.Brilliant film. The acting, script, story, graphics, music, the gadgets, cars and ladies. Everything about Die Another Day is brilliant. Go for it...watch it and enjoy it.",Die Another Day
830,mylittleoctopussy,Connery Had DAF...Moore had Moonraker...Brosnan has DAD...,6,27 November 2002,"Contains Spoilers Hmmm, where to begin. First of all, I didn't hate this film. It had far too much going for it for me not to like. But for everything that went well, there seemed to be so many things that went horribly wrong. Let's start with the opening sequence. In a word: awesome! The first few minutes where Bond replaces, and later impersonates, the diamond smuggler is well done. Very slick. The ensuing explosions and chase aboard the hovercraft are exactly what one expects from a Bond film opener. Then Bond gets captured. Interesting. It tells the audience that this film will be markedly different. Madonna's theme never really held a lot of weight with me. It was okay. It sold a lot of copies. It made #1 on the record chart. Blah, blah, blah. It's still not a powerful theme and will most likely be forgotten once Madonna releases something new and the clubs stop playing it. Not only that, but due to it's synth sound and flat vocals, it couldn't be used elsewhere in the film except during a brief party scene in the ice palace. (John Barry is still the king of turning theme songs into instrumental ballads!) I will give good marks to David Arnold, though, for this go-around. His DAD soundtrack is much more inspired than the music for TWINE, plus we get to hear the Bond theme throughout. The opening credits sequence was fresh...using scenes from Bond's torture mixed with female bodies, scorpions, fire and ice. It worked. It also allows time to pass until we see Bond again 14 months later. I had no problem with Bond being captured for 14 months. It made for an interesting plot twist and gave Bond a bit of humanity which he's lost for quite a number of years. BUT...my big problem (and a plot-hole you could drive a tank through) was the fact that our evil villain Colonel Moon gets in a huge accident (thanks to Bond) and ends up getting radical facial and body reconstruction. He also receives a sort of gene therapy through which he becomes Gustav Graves. I can live with that. Cool plot twist. Yadda, yadda, yadda...But we are expected to believe that in the 14 months since his accident, Colonel Moon went through all this therapy, changed his identity, his whole body and face...then started a company and made millions...then built a super laser sattelite which has been launched into space and heralded by heads of state...and he's made such an impact that he's to be knighted by the Queen...all in 14 months!!!???!!! A few years, possibly. But 14 months? Puh-lease! Having gotten that off my chest, I will now say that all the actors in the film were excellent! Graves, Zao and Miranda were all deliciously evil and diabolical. Jinx made an awesome Bond girl for the new millenium (and a far cry better than Dr. Christmas Jones...shudder...) The regulars were perfect...""M"" and Moneypenny (this film has the best Moneypenny scene EVER!) The producers ushered in a new ""Q"" and did a fantastic job. The settings were phenomenal. From Korea to Cuba to that wicked ice palace. High marks to the set designers and location scouts. BUT...Bond has to keep with the times, yes, I know. But the overabundance of CGI in this film doesn't make it better...it makes it cheap. If I want to see crappy CGI effects (Did I actually see Bond surf a tsunami??? Good Lord...) I'll go rent ""XXX"" or ""Spy Kids"" or something else Hollywood churned out. But Bond traditionally used stuntmen and models to achieve a reality that just didn't even seem to appear in DAD. The plane disintegrating at the end was just a wee much. And Bond's escape from the falling plane by trying to get a plummeting helicopter going...well, that ranks up there with the opening sequence of Goldeneye where he dives off a cliff and flies into a plane and then manages to get it going. The end scene is an eye-roller, at best. And as cool as some thought that the invisible car was...come on. Bond should be grounded in some sort of reality. The invisible car was something out of Batman or X-Men...not Bond. Finally, what was with the Robocop suit Graves wore at the end? Where did it come from? One minute he controls everything with a keyboard and glove, suddenly he's got a ridiculous armoured suit. Can I just say when he turned around and stood there, the audience in my movie theatre cracked up. Too hokie! The movie could've been really good, but, like Connery's Diamonds Are Forever and Moore's Moonraker...it's just an overdone turkey which will make loads of money. This is definitely NOT Brosnan's best.",Die Another Day

Bond is a joke in the film - even to the other characters. No one takes him seriously, or acts like he's remotely threatening. The fact that he was captured, and never escaped? But instead went through what seemed like YEARS of torture -- this character is a sad excuse for James Bond. There are two major female roles in the film, and both of them are awful. Halle Barry's acting is the worst of the film, and her character is completely unbelievable. Her first scene is nearly unbearable, and I found myself wishing she was actually killed off. Rosamund Pike was a bit more tolerable, but not by much. At least her acting was believable, and her voice didn't sound like nails on a chalk board through the entire film.If you've seen other Bond films, you understand the outrageous villains and wacky action sequences -- but diamonds stuck in someone's face for years? I'm nearly positive they would have eventually removed those diamonds from his face -- maybe around the time he started turning into a Caucasian man? The film was extremely racist, and offensive. The message was: It's better to be white. And the giant tsunami at the end? Where exactly does it go?

840,Yamadak,Whats wrong with this picture?,1,22 November 2002,"I admit that Bond may not be the most PC movie character ever. The millionaire-playboy-spy-nymphomaniac-lothario is not necessarily what the national women's organization has in mind. But, despite all that, he is who he is, and those who don't like him don't need to go see these movies.Or Change these movies as has been done here. A lot of critics are praising this movie for making James Bond vulnerable and taking him out of his element. People seem to think this is an original idea. They think this because when it was done before in License to Kill, the movie tanked so badly it almost killed the franchise.No one wants a vulnerable Bond. I don't want him to be a sensitive nurturer. I want Sean Connery smacking Tatiana in From Russia with Love accusing her of lying. I'm not supporting abusing women; rather I'm pushing for a certain lack of sensitivity. The unshakeable Bond who knows no fear and no situation he can't handle. I hated seeing Bond captured and tortured in North Korea of all places. Bond would get captured but he'd sleep with someone, trick someone else, and escape Scot-free.Then, they turned this into a buddy comedy with Halle Berry's ""Jinx"" a name so cute it almost makes me want to vomit.

For me Pierce Brosnan has been unable to carve out his own Bond personality and as a result he always looks somewhat uneasy in the role.The visuals in Die Another Day are fantastic and the well advertised car chase on Ice is vintage Bond but I'm afraid that's where my compliments end. Bond has been transformed into some kind of super hero. He is able to survive the most deadly situations without a scratch, resorting to frankly ridiculous means of escaping the grim reapers clutches. The story line is predictable and unoriginal.

842,laszlo2u,Good fun for Bond fans,6,23 November 2002,"I'm a casual fan of the Bond films, especially since Pierce Brosnan took over the title role.  He's the first actor to do the role justice since Sean Connery left it behind.  For those who require something new and different, there's no point to seeing this film- you can pretty much watch any Bond film and get the same results.  For Bond fans, the consistency may be something to cling to.  There is a wrench thrown in the works when Bond is nearly run out of MI-6 early in the film, losing even M's trust.  But other than that, you get exactly what you expect from this film- several fantastic chase scenes, a few uncannily handy gadgets, fast & sleek exotic cars, and some PG to PG-13 love scenes.  And, one thing I've come to expect is either one stunt which so blatantly defies all laws of physics that it comes off as more of a comedy element, or a horribly-done blue-screen shot that seems to almost parody itself.  In this film, we're treated to a surfing shot that looks like it was shot on the same set & using the same technology as ""Beach Blanket Bingo.""  The only thing missing was someone off-screen tossing a bucket of water in Brosnan's face.  But overall, it was a fun film to watch- let's face it, we don't watch Bond for its originality.  We watch for the roller coaster thrills, and ""Die Another Day"" definitely delivers on that count.",Die Another Day

Although its a little more far fetched than the usual bond and with a hint more sci-fi than usual , its not into the realm of glowing colour screens built into everything (ala Mission impossible 2) , but it does seem to get close to it.

850,nawaaz_ahmed,I want my Bond back,3,24 November 2002,"I am a big Bond fan - although I am not one of those who think Sean Connery is the best Bond and all the rest are worthless. I love Connery's Bond - cruel, powerful, charismatic; I also enjoyed Roger Moore's outings (except for the last two - ""Octopussy"" and ""View to a Kill"") - his Bond was light-hearted but clever and unflappable; I personally think Dalton made the best Bond - his Bond was gritty, strong, and  believable (!). This latest movie with Brosnan confirms my opinion that the Brosnan Bond is vapid, generic, and ineffective.Most of the credit (?) for this must go the screenplay writers and the director who seem to have forgotten a basic tenet of storytelling - make your audience care for your characters and what happens to them. A quarter into the movie and I no longer cared about its outcome - DAD just failed to make a case for continuing to watch the movie although it had all the ingredients. There has been a lot of brouhaha about how ""Die another day"" (DAD) has deepened Bond's character by having him tortured and making a rogue agent out of him. This is laughable - all that torturing (in a beautifully imagined title sequence) seems to have deepened Bond as little as it affected me in the audience (the visuals were seriously undercut by the Madonna song). The rest of the movie did not *show* any changes in the Bond character (what ever happened to ""show - don't tell""?). For a Bond movie that has successfully developed a different Bond character, take a look at ""License to Kill"" where Bond's vengeance seeking feels real and unforced and the touch at the end with the cigarette lighter only serves to reinforce the tragedy.This lack of storytelling is so egregious in DAD that the movie seems to lurch from one set piece to another without a hint of development. The good Bond movies build their story up from premise to finale through a tantalising series of climaxes and anti-climaxes. These movies were essentially duels between Bond and the arch-villain and pace themselves as such, with the energy escalating with each encounter. DAD does away with such niceties. The duel in DAD is a prime example of this - nothing that comes after has the raw feel of this fight sequence. Coming as it does at that point in DAD, the extent of Bond's investment in the duel with Graves is inexplicable given that this is the first time he is meeting Graves and knows nothing about him. DAD, then, immediately moves to the blowing up of Graves' castle in Iceland. Whatever happened to Bond the spy? What happened to discovering who Graves was and what he was upto? Whatever happened to suspense and tension and anticipation? Why a finale without anything leading upto it? Why a betrayal which lacks any power to shock because the script did not take the time to lay the ground for it? Even ""The World Is Not Enough"" for all its flaws did manage to make Electra King's betrayal vital and effective.I think one of the main problems with the Brosnan Bond movies is a diluting of the Bond charisma - to the point that it begins to feel generic. Yes, the gadgets are cool, the explosions are spectacular, the locales as beautiful and the women as alluring as ever. But the movies now lack that something that kept the previous movies together - style. Brosnan's Bond lacks style - his movies are so chockful of explosions now that the details that etch out his style are missing. Bond's mystique comes from the way he talks, the way he stalks, the way he handles the guns and the girls - DAD concentrates all its energies in showing off the set pieces and blowing them up that it sees to have nothing left for Bond himself. Whereas the great Bond movies use the chases, the exploratory wanderings in the villain's lairs as well as the fillers in between to show Bond's style, DAD treats Bond as it would any other generic action hero.Whatever happened to James Bond? I loved my Bond - I want my Bond back!",Die Another Day

857,Jsquared,The Worst Bond Film,1,25 November 2002,This was the worst bond film ever.  It had too much plot and was more of a buddy movie ie Bond and Jinx. Bond is supposed to be a character who is almost invincible.  He is not supposed to get captured for 14 months or rely upon another secret agent for the entire pic.

858,pjpinnow,Bond's Nadir,2,26 November 2002,"Die Another Day is beyond doubt the nadir of the Bond franchise; the film is wracked with a paper thin plot, insipid dialogue, and a palsied directorial hand.  The writers, producers, director, editors, et al seem to think that they can pawn off a Mission Impossible style spy flick as a genuine 007, yet they have only succeeded in making a Bond worse than On Her Majesty's Secret Service - - in fact, the only film in any franchise which immediately comes to mind for comparison is Batman Forever which sank the Caped Crusader quicker than Robin could say ""Holy Torpedo.""  Let's hope that those involved with this abomination will remember a few simple rules the next time through.  First, with maybe two exceptions, any movie that features Madonna, even in a cameo role obviously added on to glorify her titanic ego, is bound to fail.  Second, lines of dialogue like ""Take that, b****"" could be improved with the slightest effort from any gin-addled bum passed out on the sidewalk before the studio.  Third, an Oscar-winning performance by a fine actress does not guarantee sterling acting when said actress is a Bond girl; Halle Berry was worse than Tea Leoni in Bad Boyz when half the theater audience I viewed the film with began shouting ""Exposition! Exposition!"" Fourth, when Bond villains spend less than a minute explaining how their Doomsday device will work, the brevity of their speech is due to the utter outlandishness of the writer's stupid idea and due to the fact that the writers could not work out this clap-trap even in their own shallow minds. Finally, cut out all the ""action direction"" which relies on rapid cuts, sudden and unnecessary zooms, and inexplicable jerky use of slow motion; Bond films have never needed to rely on such pedestrian tricks to wow viewers before.

Even Pierce Brosnan and Hallie Barry, who I think are both good actors, were not that entertaining to watch in this movie because of the fact that the creators of the movie put almost no effort into character development or dialogue in the script.

860,s_york1984,GREAT BUT SOMEWHAT WEIRD!?!?!?,10,6 December 2002,"At first I thought that the movie was boring coz in the beginning all I saw was talk and more talk... but when Bond started the first explosion my spirit inside me woke up in a shock! The car chase was great and so is the sword fight that Graves and Bond had as it became to be a serious fight. At first, I thought what ever happen to Zao. We all thought that he died in the explosion, but to our expectation as we all know villains never die easily. As for the case of Colonel Moon who was changed into Gustav Graves with the help of a DNA change that made him a rather good looking person...
These are some of the questions that always disturbs my mind:1.I was wondering how Graves clothes and hair could look good even thought he had to jump in the air. is his clothes and hair really that stiff that it can't be messed up??? 2.does a diamond really stick to your face when it explodes on you??? 3.what was the purpose of graves telling the his old dad that he is still alive, even though he was going to kill him in the end??? 4.did they make the satellite weapon in just a short time??? 5.what was the purpose of Zao and Graves in having a DNA change??? was it for them to attract women like Graves did on Miranda Frost??? 5.why did Frost chose to volunteer to become an agent even thought she worked for a multi-millionair villain. Is it for her to protect him???Comments for every character: First is (James Bond)Pierce Brosnan as usual he played his part as for the action and for the having sex with women.(Jinx)Halley Berry was great in the things she does and her outfits were all daring that it fit her for being the bond girl.(Zao)Rick Yune, I never thought that he'd like rise from the dead for his revenge but a great villain especially when they were at the car chase. Even for me it must be hard to have diamonds stick to your face while walking.(Miranda Frost)Rosamund Pike, at first I thought she was to help Bond but it turns out that she was a female type of villain in the movie.(Gustav Graves)Toby Stephens, he was at first a mystery, because of his role as a bond villain who was trying to wipe out all his enemy including Bond who he was trying to kill.

862,mi6agent-1,I tried to like this one...,1,1 December 2002,"Ok, let's get this straight: I'm not one of those conservative fans who refuses to accept anything new; I'm only seventeen and Goldeneye is one of my favorite Bond Films, but this one was definately a huge disappointment for me. I'll try to illustrate why:1) The scoreTo start with, I have nothing against David Arnold as a composer, I admire his work for ""Tomorrow Never Dies""; I liked the way he mixed the classy orchestral sound with swinging brassy jazz (`a la Company Car) with a little electronica in other parts. DAD's soundtrack however, is far less memorable. And the new gunbarrel music has gone down the hill since TND, which had a beautiful gripping sound. The techno in DAD just sounds thin and cheap.2) The gadgetsI felt the gadgets were tremendously overdone in DAD. There were just too many. Gadgets should be used in an intelligent way, not just frittered in an effect showcase. And they shouldn't be completely out of this world, like the cloaking device. The Star-Trek holo-deck was useless. The Darth Vader suit and that blue mask made me laugh.3) The camerawork and directing styleWhat do slow-motion effects have to do with James Bond? He lives in a world without time travel or space distortion. Too many flashbacks are annoying and unappropriate.4) JinxFirst of all, I don't find Jinx all too attractive, but that's just me. She was far too strong a character. It should be about James Bond saving the world, not him and some sidekick.5) MadonnaYou call that a song? Bits of silence woven into a silly tune. If you have a voice, why do you have to use a ""square"" voice distortion computer? And demanding a role in a film just because you sang the title song is plain arrogance. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was fantastic in comparison to that. And Goldeneye...Dispite all that the film did have some excellent moments...1) The swordfightNow that was something! The confrontation with the evil mastermind which slowly turns into a brutal fight! It's right up there with the Bond and Goldfinger golf scene.2) John CleeseNeed I say more? I think he did a superb job. He is definately the successor.3) The pre-title sequenceThis was a refreshing twist to what has been done in the past. Thumbs up!4) Bond referencesFrom the book about birds and Q's lab to witty dialogue references, there is a great deal to look out for. A good idea for Bond 20.All in all I must say I really tried to like this film (movie). The fun degraded towards the end IMHO. I'm trying not to think about that title song :  The techno music during the end credits made me want to get out of that cinema as soon as possible. Just in case you're wondering, I'm *not* a classical music freak LOL. If covered songs prove that a tune can be successful throughout decades, why is it necessary to ""modernise"" bond in that way?Anyway, don't let me spoil the enjoyment for you. It's just my opinion. I accept the fact that James Bond probably would cease to exist if they made the films according to my wishes.Peter F.",Die Another Day
863,shayborg,Quite possibly the worst Bond film ever,4,1 December 2002,"In general, my three main motivations for watching Bond movies are the action, the women, and the plot.  _Die Another Day_ is sketchy on all three.I'll start with the action.  Most of the action scenes are well animated and well done, particularly the one at the very beginning of the film.  However, it seems to go downhill from there.  The fencing scene is well done, but the rest -- the car chase near the end sin particular -- are predictable.The women are Jinx, a ""Cuban"" with a strong American accent, and Miranda Frost, assistant to the villain Gustav Graves.  Both are good looking in the tradition of Bond films.  However, Halle Berry's acting talents are unfortunately hidden in the considerable shadow of her breasts.  The director makes an effort to make Jinx different from most of the previous Bond girls, more in the vein of Agent XXX from _The Spy Who Loved Me_.  Of course, she ends up foolishly going into the enemy's lair repeatedly and needing Bond to save her every time.  She's also far too easily seduced.  Frost, on the other hand, is far too one-dimensional to be interesting.  Excellent looks, as always, but a shallow character.Finally, we come to the plot.  The word that comes most readily to mind is ""contrived"".  It is unnecessarily intricate in the details, yet the general overview is far too simple to reach the standards of most of the Bond movies.  Frankly, I was disappointed at the end of the movie.  There were practically no twists at all, and from about the halfway point on it becomes more or less obvious what the plot is.  Once that happens, it travels in a predictable straight line, leading up to the happy ending with barely a deviation from the good-over-evil angle that is always pervasive in Bond movies, but never overwhelmingly so as in this one.There are also a couple minor details that weren't done well either. Bond's car has one neat trick, but other than that it seems run-of-the-mill -- and (TINY SPOILER) the other guy's car can do all the same stuff Bond's can!  The humor is just not there for the most part.  Berry tries hard and does a good job with what she's given, as does Brosnan.  But the writing overcomes their best efforts.  (""I got the thrust of it"" almost drove me out of the theater with its awfulness ...)  Moneypenny's little scene near the end is funny, though it makes me feel bad laughing at her.So the final verdict is that _Die Another Day_ is a movie with potential at the beginning -- even the theme song and credits are good -- but goes downhill from there to become, in my book, one of the worst Bond movies ever created.",Die Another Day
864,dent10,Another disappointment,1,2 December 2002,"Another disappointing bond film. What ever happened to the well written Bond movie? And the special effects in this movie were far from special.

Forget the Bond of the 90's and oh oh's, the Bond of the 60's and 70's is what people want. What about the Bond theme, that is a must and it was not used much at all.

The bad thing is, I never even saw it coming.

The script was overloaded with innuendoes to the point where I wanted to plug my ears and just be visually stimulated. Even that wouldn't have worked, as I would have had to watch Mr. Brosnan try to pull off increasingly unbelievable and unrealistic stunts in front of a poorly rendered digital background. The fight scenes seemed forced, as if the characters had no real reason to fight, and then did anyway.

This latest instalment has both too much and too little of all three elements and falls over trying to regain it's balance. Let's examine...Girls. OK, so we have double trouble with two Bond babes - and very easy on the eye they are too. But for all their one-liners (and of a cheaper variety than usual, might I add) the relationship between Bond and Jinx always seems a little artificial. As for Ms Pike - did the traitor really have to be THAT obvious?Gadgets. James was driving an invisible car. Nuff said.On second thoughts - I gotta comment on just one of the many annoying plot errors involving the car. Towards the end of the chase en route to rescuing Jinx, James activates the tyre spikes. Hang on - didn't he just spend the last 20 minutes barreling around on an ice lake, in complete control at high speed? But he didn't need any spikes for THAT? Riiiiiight....Getaways. Yes, Bond can escape from any situation, any time, using any method he so chooses. Yes, it's a given that no weapon can successfully injure him more seriously than his current bimbo can treat with a cloth and a touch of disinfectant. But the opening chase (I'll focus on just one for the sake of brevity) had him six feet away from a whole regiment armed with machine guns and worse. One thing they can't hit James himself, but seems they couldn't even slow his 'craft down. And could somebody please tell me how the rest of the army managed to appear from nowhere without James even hearing them or attempting to continue his escape?All-in-all, the plot required an inhuman stretch of the imagination to comprehend, the effects were over-laden, excessive yet sadly unremarkable. Any originality in the story was noticeable by it's complete absence and from the time the supporting cast provide the most satisfactory characters (John Cleese as Q, Dame Judi as M), you know something's seriously wrong.After all's said and done, you'll read this review and a dozen others slating it, but you're still gonna go to the cinema and watch the film.

879,iluvit,Disappointing,3,10 January 2003,"Was really looking forward to this film, especially having sat through the action-packed, but characterless, Triple X the week before.Sadly this Bond movie was just awful. - Poor development of character, despite an unusual start to the film - Far too much reliance on special effects - many of which were not even remotely likely. - Awful sound track, and probably the worst opening Bond theme tune ever. - And what happened to the use of the James Bond music.... you know, the guitar riff. Usually James gets to say ""Bond, James Bond"" at least once in the movie, and the little tune goes ""dum diddy um dumm"". Where's it gone? The whole thing was totally uninvolving.The villain was ok. And the lesser villain (with the diamond face) was actually the more interesting of the two, but he never really got going. The sword fight was pretty good. The rediculous scene with the rocket-powered ice skating vehicle... what was that all about?? One minute he's doing 400mph and the ray's right up his tail pipe. Next minute he's stopped, and the ray's miles behind him. Errr.. surely if you slow down, it catches you? And the scene that followed that one was not even worthy of a cheap TV series. Damn shame.Bond's supposed to be about wit, sophistication and daring. He's supposed to be the man every man wants to be, and every woman wants. OK, perhaps that's not PC any more, but it's what a Bond film is, and I for one would love to see something that is not PC for a change. If the producers want to do something revolutionary then how about that?... an non-PC film. Now there's an idea.So all I saw here was a bunch of gadgets, some product placement (although not as bad as earlier movies... Bond in a family saloon, for heaven's sake) and bad digital effects.Final verdict? Go see it if you've nothing else to do, but really there are a lot of better films out there.(All my opinion, of course!)",Die Another Day

What promised to be an excellent film from one of the more original opening sequences is too hurrid in its plot, in fact the plot line does take it too far even for bond. What ever happened to the detective work of the Connery movies - Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is just Mr Bang Bang Bang Bang. The character development was poor and some of the gadgets and effect defied belief. For instance there could have been much more interplay between Bond and Frost, not just the 'I won't sleep with him' one scene, sleeps with him the next - what happened to the chase. Thinking back to OHMSS Bloefeld's plan was to hold the UK to ransom by using biological agents to disrupt agricultural production - a bit more realistic than a guy who falls off a hovercraft, has his face rebuilt, becomes a multi-millionaire, launches a solar beam satellite etc all in 14 months will Bond is locked up. so to the script writers for the next film get the tempo right and try and inject some realism and suspense.",Die Another Day

The movie quickly got better soon after with the great narrow escapes we have come to know and love. But then it dragged on. and there was another narrow escape. And another.

We get Halle Berry as the sexy Jinx and just when the film is about to get very exciting in every way, it starts going downhill. And there is no stop down the hill. 007 goes to Iceland (my home country) and there's this silly scene with a castle of ice, an invisible car, bad CGI and the film never recovers.

Firstly Pierce Brosnan is past his sell by date.He has still not made the character of Bond his own and plays it as a generic caricature of the Bond trademarks.Its also embarassing to see him trying to get by on boyish charm as he pushes fifty years old.I hope this is his last Bond film. Halle Berry is even worse.She fills a bikini top well enough but she cannot act and is laughable in the fight sequences.Her dialogue is delivered with a smug ""i'm funny aren't I"" style that annoyed me. The plot is the weakest aspect of the movie.It defies credibility and ignores the laws of physics.Bond is often outlandish but this is just OTT.Watch Goldfinger or The Living Daylights and you suspend disbelief until you get home but with DAD you cringe as you watch it. The difference is that unlike the other Bond films you are laughing at Bond not with him. As has been reported elsewhere the effects are atrocious but I find it depressing to think that there are those who think that decent visuals would have saved this half baked disaster. Madonna's title song is horrible although her cameo is too brief to be annoying.David Arnold has run out of ideas and should be replaced. On the plus side John Cleese is point perfect as Q,Rosamund Pike is an attractive foil for Bond ( although the twist to her character would fail to surprise a Neanderthal) and bit players like Emilio Echevarra and Rachelle Grant add some ethnic vitality to the cast.

After watching the main title sequences, I thought that ""Die Another Day"" was going to be one of the best Bonds every; I was thoroughly disappointed. I could not tell whether it was homage to the previous Bond movies or a made for TV pilot for a Halle Berry spy series. The story is an amalgam of every spy movie in the last 40 years, it is so convoluted, and fantastic it will baffle the most ardent Bond watcher. It even rips off ""The Outer Limits"". There is an incredible amount of hardware and technology in this movie and after you find out the sinister plot by the villain, not the producers, you will shrug your shoulders in disbelief. The acting is non-existent, even for a Bond movie, and the sexual innuendos are surprisingly taken to a new low. The only real bright spot in the movie is Rosamund Pike's portrayal of Miranda Frost. Halle Berry's performance in this movie is only bettered by her acting in ""Swordfish"".The problem with this movie is that it just tried to do excessively much. It seems to me that the amount of technology in a Bond film is inversely proportionally to the quality of the film.Also, I am not really sure Pierce Bronsan is really right for the Bond job.",Die Another Day

891,ChopperDave,One of the best non-Connery Bond flicks (spoiler?),8,28 March 2007,"Having seen every Bond film first run in a theater, this film revived my hope in the Bond franchise. Bond films so seldom have any teeth or grit to them anymore. Fleming's lethal and vice-ridden emotionally detached hero turned into a politically correct soft pretty boy in a tuxedo for decades, the series was about to go the way of the dodo. A role finally revived by Daniel Craig.It is unfortunate that they lost their nerve half-way through the plot and decided go the old formulaic route of super-villain causing WWIII. In the first half Bond re-discovers he has a pair and tells M and MI6 where to go, escapes their imprisonment and goes on a personal mission of revenge. In the second half we get the obligatory embedded car advertisement, a ludicrous piece of high-tech junk from Q and a megalomaniac super-villain.I am amazed by the outright hatred of this film by the so-called fans of the franchise. The majority of it directed at Halle Berry has caused me to wonder whether the bad reviews were written by white supremists. She has to be the hottest Bond girl in years (I'd have to go back to a 22 year old Jane Seymour in Live and Let Die to top her). Rosamund Pike is a mousy lump of oatmeal in comparison, it's almost like they didn't even try to make her attractive (rather odd since I do like her and Bond women tend to look hotter in Bond films than any other film they've done).She's certainly not the worst actress to be a Bond girl. That title goes to Tanya Roberts in View to a Kill beating out even Denise Richards for a performance so bad that had opening night fans at ""Grauman's"" Chinese theater howling with laughter at her delivery.And speaking of Live and Let Die, Halle Berry certainly makes up for Gloria Hendry.This is certainly the best of the Brosnan Bond films.",Die Another Day

After that this film turns into an overcooked cheaply spiced meatloaf that is impossible to get down your throat. There is no chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Halle Berry which is unfortunate, but don't blame them. Toby Stephens and Rosamund Pike give such bad performances it seems unlikely they could ever do worse. The only supporting actor who gives a noticeably good performance is Emilio Echevarria, so thank god for him. What is Michael Madsen doing in this movie? Maybe they could bring back Felix Leiter in the next one. My favorite was Norman Burton in ""Diamonds Are Forever"". All in all this is another lousy project from one-hit wonder Lee Tamahori.

'Die Another Day' feels like James Bond has stopped being a dignified, intelligent British spy and become a gun-toting psycho who kills in amusing ways without remorse (a villain gets a laser through his mouth) The plot is almost identical to 'Diamonds are Forever' (one of the weaker Bonds)but without any humorous/identifiable/nice characters (bar John Cleese, who makes the film feel a lot more British.) Halle Berry is an uncharismatic and boring 'Bond girl' who has no chemistry with Pierce Brosnan. They simply converse by exchanging puns. On the plus side, Toby Stephens is good as the villain and Judi Dench returns as M. (Although she has very little to do) While most of the action is either stupid or CGI, there are some inspired set-pieces, such as the car chase in Iceland.

As for the special effects, don't even go there. Tamahori said ""I wanted to introduce CGI to bond, so it will be used more in the future"". Intorducing CGI to Bond is a bad idea. Obviously there will always be some CGI graphics but the best part about a bond film is knowing that the stunts are done for real. I'm am personally scared to see Bond 21 after seeing this movie. Die Another Day must have been one of the worst Bond Films ever, End of Story. And Tamahori should be ban from directing Bond films for the rest of his life.

And to be honest if George had made more than just one he would be above Pierce too. Why? Because Pierce's performance as Bond in this movie was a complete joke. I was almost in tears at the idiotic lines, and the stupid sex scenes.

896,SpaceThunderKid,"Oh yes movie, fill me with your puns.",7,31 October 2012,"This movie... is silly. VERY silly. In some ways, I feel this film tops some of silliness seen in some of the other goofier Bond titles such as Octopussy, Moonraker, and Live and Let Die. Yes, I just claimed that this film is sillier than a film where Bond dresses as a clown to infiltrate a circus. Seriously. I'm serious. Partially because of the over the top chase sequences that seem to be ever present in the Pierce Brosnan Bonds, the outdated and overused CGI near the end of the movie, and few weak plot twists. However, above all... the puns/innuendos. They are prevalent, blatant, and gloooooorious. Some may say that puns are the lowest and most overplayed form of comedy and wordplay, however I contend that, in a way, puns are so lame and so unfunny, that they become hilarious. Much how films like Robot Monster and Troll 2 are so bad they're good. Now, enough about puns, let's talk about the bond car. This thing is amazing. I hate cars, and I want one. Like many of the Bond cars, this automobile has some nifty built-in spy gadgets and weapons. Most impressive are it's ability to appear invisible to the naked eye and two retractable auto-aiming shotguns hidden in the front of the car. This movie is amazing, but only in that ironic so-bad-it's-good sort of way. So, if you're looking for a more serious Bond, I'd recommend the Daniel Craig Casino Royale, From Russia with Love, the Spy Who Loved Me, or Goldfinger. Also, this awesome quote from Roger Moore: ""I thought it just went too far – and that's from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!""",Die Another Day

I have seen all the Bond flicks and Die Another Day is just a modernized version of Goldfinger, Diamonds are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, and some of the over the top Bond films. Furthermore I have been hearing that the CGI was fake and no good, but all Bond films feature something fake. For example seeing Sir Sean act behind a projector screen makes it seem a little fake, Moore too except there was a stuntman doing the stunts and it would switch back to projector screens to show Moore.

Brosnan has brought nothing to the series, in fact he never truly played Bond. He plays Remmington Steele, an overly watered-down version of the part he should have been playing. In his four movies the man has not made Bond his own. While an adequate spot holder, Brosnan will fade away with time.

He's extremely relaxed in the role and just looks what a James Bond should through the description in Fleming's books. A real action hero and just a really cool character. For those who disagree with me go and look up Ian Fleming's description of James Bond or even close your eyes and imagine James Bond.

I agree that the invisible car was too much. I agree the CGI of the burning plane and the surfing among ice blocks weren't done properly. But that doesn't justify judging the whole movie as crap, when we DID enjoy the other strong parts: hover chase, sword fight. I expect people contributing comments to IMDb to be objective and balanced as I consulted their views quite often. This time I was disappointed reading how unbalanced they are. When we did highly commend on the poor Roger Moore's pasted fights on cable cars etc we should be grateful for CGI's solutions to unthinkable action scenes in future Bonds. I think DAD is a fun and still an attractive action flick which we expects from Bonds. Craig's CR is way better in the fight authenticity, but I missed the Bond typical 'goodies' which should be different than common 'spy movies' many people praised in CR. The worst part in CR is playing cards is irrelevant to current world affairs which used to be Bond's main interest. CR is a trip back in time, no suspense at all in the card games.One last note: I am sure DAD's score was very much influenced by 'You Only Live Twice' excellent theme song.",Die Another Day
903,martin-708,Definitely the worst...,2,8 April 2005,"In short, the first half is up to scratch as far as good Bond movies go, but as soon as that ice palace shows up, turn it off. Most of the acting is a little off, and Berry is not suited to the role she plays as much as I like her in other movies. This is the only Bond film I cannot happily watch from beginning to end. The movie's biggest flaw is the over use of CGI scenes. Bond has always had a 'real' feeling to it simply because the stunts were done for real, and instead of using crappy computer graphics, they used models if the real thing couldn't be used. The worst offenders CGI-wise are: the kite surfing scene (simply looks like a computer game with Brosnan's head glued on), the plane burning up and falling apart (looks like a cartoon), and the glacier being destroyed by the ridiculous space weapon. Very cheesy dialog too... especially the end scene... makes me want to vomit every time. The good points about this movie are: John Cleese - i can't think of a better replacement for Desmond. He's kept his Basil Fawlty humor and it really works well for Q. The whole Q scene is a highlight. The opening surfing scene is well done and simply thrilling on the big screen. Nice hovercraft scene although this where many of the movie's practicality flaws begin. It's also nice to see Bond in some REAL trouble for the first time in his career, and this also allows for the pre-credit sequence to flow into the rest of the movie which is something that doesn't usually happen. Oh, i didn't mention the worst damn title song i ever heard in any movie. Thankgod they didn't use it as a recurring theme throughout. I've had this movie on DVD since it became available and saw it a few times while it was in the cinemas. I've watched it periodically since then 'trying' to like it, but it still falls apart about half way as i said before. Every bond film up to this one has felt like a bond film, but sadly this one doesn't. Tomorrow never Dies felt the absence of Cubby Broccoli but still made it as a Bond movie. This one had a nice beginning, but seemed to lose focus and become ridiculously over the top by the end. It's as if the film makers lost the plot about Bond somewhere along the way.

The scene where Bond activates the old jet pack is insultingly idiotic. Almost every line from Jinx (Halle Berry) had me rolling my eyes.

905,cmoorececil,The Spark,10,26 January 2017,"01/26/2017In my opinion,007 has very many pieces and lots of sequels to its collection. I became a fan and viewer right in this chapter. As a growing child I I only knew of the video game on Nintendo 64. I played it with the nephews of my widowed mother's boyfriend at the time and always I enjoyed it. So I decided to watch the movie.After that exciting hour or so, I was thrilled enough to continue looking the sequels. I still to this day enjoy a good 007 flick. Sean Connery does a brilliant job in this role and brings a very soothing feel to the character 007. I feel he has a very delightful approach. He satisfies many of us watching him take on some of the most mysterious guys around town up to no good. A+Always accompanied by a well-equipped ally, Sean Connery, joined by the beautiful Halle Berry became even more interesting being that he had such a gorgeous apprentice. I often wonder what it would be like to be apart of the team. It always seemed like fun as I observed the interesting story line. The writer leaves so many possibilities for additional character injections. Very exciting.I rated this movie 10 stars because it has a very wonderful concept. It allows room for growth yet it also could be ended for good. Very mysterious. It makes the audience really pay attention. Even in the newer films of 007, the soundtracks are enough to bring an old audience back into the story-line if they ever were to be directed elsewhere for whatever reason. Adele made me come back with her phenomenal voice. I could not get used to the new 007, Daniel Craig. He is also a wonderful actor. However, this took some time.

The film largely in my mind is Lee Tamahori the directors fault the subsequent director of ""xxx2"" he just turned bond into something he's not an animated character. bond is the worlds greatest spy and ""no one does it better"" Lee Tammahori also made the fatal mistake with regards to ""die another day"" add cgi and special effects to James Bond. Tne latest film casino royal will be better so go watch. i just feel sorry for pierce Brosnan his ""bilion dollar bond"" was reduced to special effects rubbish as a result of die another day. worth a rent and a great film but not a patch on the other James bond films visit www.free bond news.com for the latest bond news.",Die Another Day
907,joseph_halstead,Pretty Good Bond Film,8,2 March 2006,"I think that there are certain ever-present elements in every installment of James Bond that are meant to please their true fans. There are quite a few harsh critics to this movie, and I must say that if you watched Die Another Day and you weren't grinning ear to ear the whole time, then you are not a real Bond fan in my opinion. The James Bond franchise is cult-like in status; it was never meant to win Oscars or otherwise rival the acting skill presented in the classics.That said, I think that this may have been Brosnan's best Bond film ever- despite his then-growing dissatisfaction with playing the Bond role. He continued to bring just the right balance of seriousness, patriotic feeling and comic relief needed to make the role a true Bond. He mirrors Roger Moore in this sense.Some may have a problem with the fact that Bond flicks are getting increasingly global; that is, there are many scenes from a variety of locations (or at least they are portrayed as these different places). Older Bond films often centered on a storyline that unfolded in two different countries at best. I like the intrigue of such an international scenario, however. This is also rightly a James Bond trait. The Austin Powers series makes fun of this particular trait but the existence of Austin Powers really represents an appreciation for the Bond cult.I am sad to see Brosnan move on, but understand why he would feel too old for the role (although the role always did call for an experienced, rugged looking 40-something that Brosnan can still pull off- this was the true sex appeal in seeing him hook up with 19 and 20 year old chicks, like it or not).Hopefully Daniel Craig can carry the torch as the Bond Evolution continues.",Die Another Day
908,pierfra007,"great movie, but still a B-movie",7,22 March 2006,"I use to ""love"" Bond Movies, since I was a kid. but this time the English spy doesn't feel the same. this movie is good, with all good characters, a villain who doesn't need to conquer the world, bat just thinks about his own country. full of old movies scenes, like the one nobody seems to have noticed: Halle Berry getting' out of the water is exactly like Ursula Andress in Dr. No! the problem with this movie is that is just a B-movie... no more women with class, but strong women with weapons... like the fight scene in which Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike engage a sword duel, that reminds me of Kill Bill scenes (even if DAD is older). it's just a well payed B-movies. acrobatics CG scenes, smashing cars... I feel like the first part is beautiful, interesting, with a Bond that needs his ""spy abilities"", and the second is an action movie like the Stallone's or Van Damme's... I think that the greatest Brosnan Bond is always Goldeneye.",Die Another Day
