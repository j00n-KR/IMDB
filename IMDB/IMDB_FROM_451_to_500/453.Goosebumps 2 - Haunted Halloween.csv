0,Leofwine_draca,Generic kiddie-themed horror,4,22 February 2020,"HAUNTED HALLOWEEN is the second film in the GOOSEBUMPS franchise and a typically light horror-style adventure for kids. The emphasis is on creepy, CGI-fuelled creations, with an ordinary group of kids finding themselves menaced by all manner of Halloween themed weirdness, including living pumpkins. The ringleading antagonist is a living ventriloquist's doll, although he's overdone a bit and makes you long for the days of MAGIC and DEAD OF NIGHT. The good news is that Jack Black has far less screen time here, although the main actress looks about ten years too old for her role and the interplay with the kids feels more than a little tired.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
1,SnoopyStyle,kiddie horror,6,21 April 2019,"Aspiring writer Sarah Quinn (Madison Iseman) is struggling with her college entry essay. Her boyfriend just wants to have fun. Her nerdy brother Sonny (Jeremy Ray Taylor) annoys her. He and his best friend Sam Carter (Caleel Harris) have started a junk business. They are called to clean out the abandoned childhood home of R.L. Stine (Jack Black). They find Stine's book. Ventriloquist dummy Slappy suddenly appears and Sonny unknowingly brings him back to life. Slappy wants to be a part of his family unleashing chaos during Halloween.This is pretty good for a TV Goosebumps movie on a kiddie channel. As a theatrical offering, it doesn't have the grandeur or the scares to cross over into adult or teen market. In addition, it's tough to sell parents to take their little kids to a horror movie. It's stuck somewhere in no man's land. It needs to be a little darker and a little more theatrical to get the teens. Jack Black phones in his fifteen minutes and delivers one good joke. The kids are fine but nothing that special. The writing misses a few things. Sarah needs to physically write in the book with a pen to wrap up that aspect of the story. Slappy is interesting and could deliver more sequels. The franchise is unlikely to break out and is probably on a declining trajectory. It's stuck in kiddie horror land.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
2,boblipton,Amusing,6,1 November 2020,"In the second Goosebumps Cinematic Universe, some kids (of course) have some issues. There's Madison Iseman, who's terrified she's not going to be able to finish her essay on fear and get into an Ivy League University; there's her kid brother and his best friend, who are bullied in school. The boys run a business carting away old junk for free, figuring they'll find some stuff worth reselling in the trash. When they're called on to empty the attic of an abandoned house, they do: Slappy the demonic ventriloquist's dummy. He proceeds to turn half the town into monsters.Like the earlier movie, Jack Black plays R.L. Stine in the second half of the movie -- the real author gets a cameo near the end. It's juvenile, of course, and rather silly, but there are some of the anxieties that kids really experience, and the humor is deliberate and the special effects good.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

4,paul_haakonsen,"Almost the same as the 2015 ""Goosebumps"" movie...",5,5 January 2019,"I decided to watch ""Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween"" because I did actually thoroughly enjoy the previous ""Goosebumps"" movie from 2015. And based on that movie, then I actually had high hopes for ""Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween"".While ""Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween"" definitely was a visually pleasing movie, then it was just a very unnecessary sequel. Why? Well, because it was essentially the exact same as the 2015 movie, just changed the scenery, the monsters, and the characters. But the essence of the storyline and the outcome was the exact same thing. So that felt very anti-climatic and very much like a slap to the face with a cold, dead fish.If you haven't already seen the 2015 ""Goosebumps"" movie then this sequel will be a good movie to watch. However, if you already did see the 2015 one, then there virtually is no need to watch ""Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween"". I am not kidding.The CGI department definitely did not fail to deliver, because the CGI in the movie were quite good, just as they were in the previous movie. And that is actually the selling point to ""Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween"", sad to say.This is very much a sequel in the very definition of a sequel. So it was soup being boiled on watered down broth.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

6,view_and_review,Weak,5,28 January 2019,"I'll sum up this movie with one character--the bully, Tommy Madigan (Peyton Wich). He had to be the weakest bully ever formulated. All bullies are pathetic because bullying in itself is just a pathetic act. This bully had the inauspicious title of school bully AND he was weak. Yeah, he had the crew, the size, and the tough demeanor but he failed miserably as a bully. He terrorized two smaller kids-- somewhat-- but ultimately was punked by a tough talking girl that was smaller than him. His tough exterior was thoroughly punctured by the end.What happened to the bullies of the 80's and 90's? Those bullies established their meanness in manners that were completely humiliating to their targets so that you knew they were bullies and you wanted to see their downfall. Those bullies had to be beaten and crushed to get even. The Goosebumps 2 bully just needed a stern talking to and that was enough to make him cower.I know this was a small portion of the overall movie and really wasn't germane to the plot. That's because the rest of the movie was equally uninteresting and left nothing to like or discuss. So, like its bully, Goosebumps 2 was weak.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
7,neil-476,"Undemanding, but what did you expect",7,26 October 2018,"Sarah and Soony are the kids of single mother Kathy. Kathy is dependent of Sarah to babysit Sonny, albeit Sonny shouldn't really need it. Both kids have school pressures, Sarah has a demanding boyfriend and Sonny has a demanding best friend, so distractions abound. Halloween is on its way when Sonny and his friend find a book which brings a sinister ventriloquist's dummy to life. And things get worse...This second movie inspired by RL Stine's Goosebumps books is good, mildly scary, family fun. The 3 family members are all likeable, slightly flawed, very recogniseable and identifiable, and well-played. The special effects are all well done, scary enough for small children without being really scary. And the story works well and, ultimately, emphasises the positive side of family.Ken Jeog is, as usual, very funny, as a neighbout who overdoes the whole Halloween thing.This film is slight, but good fun.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
8,morrison-dylan-fan,Slappy's storybook.,7,18 December 2018,"With a friend telling me that her daughter is a big fan of the first Goosebumps movie,I quietly started to hope that a second one would be made. Looking for a flick to watch with her and the kids before X-Mas,I was thrilled to find the second one on DVD, which led to me turning the pages of this new Goosebumps.View on the film:Whilst ending with a delightful 30 minute mad-dash ""greatest hits"" final similar to the first film, the screenplay by the returning Rob Lieber and Darren Lemke displays a more focused approach here,with the choice to have the film be largely based around one monster (Slappy) allowing for the friendship between Sarah, Sonny and Sam to be given space. Taking over from Lieber directing the first movie, director Ari Sandel & cinematographer Barry Peterson do really well at giving this family-friendly Horror a creepy atmosphere, thanks to the stop-start puppet motions of Slappy. Bringing R. L. Stine's most famous monsters for the final, Sandel gives them a brightly animated look, which gives all the the creatures a lively vibe as they haunt the town. Facing off against Mick Wingert giving a wonderfully sinister voice to Slappy, Jeremy Ray Taylor,Madison Iseman and Caleel Harris each give very good turns as Sarah, Sonny and Sam, due them balancing the friendships between the frightful and the brave,as they fight to shake off the goosebumps.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A cash-grab sequel that's decent enough in its own right.,5,1 February 2019,"'Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween (2018)' doesn't feel like 'Goosebumps', to the point that its few creature cameos even seem forced, and that's really its main problem. To be honest, it feels like a cash-grab; it's an attempt to make a franchise from something that ties together and celebrates an already existing franchise. If they wanted to make a series out of this, perhaps basing it in a reality where the 'Goosebumps' books exist and are used as a tangible basis for the 'bumps in the night' wasn't the best idea, since the series itself is just a loosely connected string of spooky stories that surely pretty much all could have been adapted for the big screen themselves. This picture isn't all that entertaining, regardless. The focus is placed on the main villain of its predecessor, except that he's voiced by, essentially, a spot-on Jack Black impersonator instead of Jack Black himself and is kind of one step removed from the initial character in an odd but ultimately passable way. This leads to a story that initially seems to want to aim for 'creepy doll for kids' but then spirals into 'take the third-act from last time and run with it'. These halves contrast quite heavily. Still, the cast are more charismatic this time. There are also a couple of more famous cameos, which are somewhat enjoyable but don't really do much other than tease what could have been. In the end, this is a clichéd and danger-free experience that lacks the charming premise and delivery of the original. As a stand-alone experience, though, it's mostly fine. You might forget it pretty quickly, but it's decent enough. 5/10",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
10,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,14 January 2019,"Goosebumps 2: Haunted HalloweenNowadays the only thing kids read are online comments about how they should go kill themselves.Fortunately, the friends in this horror movie have found something less dangerous to read.When Sonny and Sam are hired to clean out a dilapidated dwelling they discover an unpublished book by R. L. Stine (Jack Black), the author of the Goosebumps series. But by opening the book the boys unleash a ventriloquist's dummy that uses the book's power to bring other fictional creations to life. With help from their neighbour (Ken Jeong) and babysitter (Madison Iseman), they must get the beasts back in the book.Lacking all of the nostalgia of the initial instalment, this mostly Jack Black free sequel suffers from a serious similarity to its predecessor's story. Save for a handful of scares, this generic follow-up is disappointing.Besides, it would've been smarter to just self-publish the manuscript under your own name.

11,westsideschl,More of the Same,3,28 January 2019,"A redux of a script used many times before & so unimaginative it has to made in quest of money only. Usual kids go through someone else's dusty forgotten junk; find mysterious book; open it up and out pops a talking evil doll/puppet; eventually, as usual, other creatures come out. Creatures tend to always look the same in this pop out world. Kids & others get chased around by scary pop out creatures, but all ends well as they get put back in. Of course book survives for another sequel. Poor acting; dumbed down dialogue. Passable fast food quality for under 13 audience.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
12,Platypuschow,Goosebumps 2 Haunted Halloween: Saturday morning entertainment,5,11 January 2019,"I quite enjoyed Goosebumps (2015) it was silly larger than life fun based on books I certainly enjoyed as a child. I did however not expect a sequel!Led by two very entertaining kids, flanked by the always likeable Wendi McLendon-Covey and less so Ken Jeong the movies cast is a solid one.SFX? Ropey in places but the movie is on a big scale, monsters of all shapes and sizes so the cgi is rife.Plot? Highly generic stuff but passable enough to kill 90 minutes with.So where do the real issues lay? Well the tone seems rather different, this doesn't feel like a loyal Goosebumps sequel it feels like something you'd watch on a Saturday morning with your kids. It feels like Kenan & Kel Halloween special, the horror is pretty much non-existent and instead is a full on goofy family comedy. That really damaged the film for me, sure I didn't expect actual horror but a degree of threat like the first movie would have been nice and not a full on children's movie. Absolutely no parental supervision needed for this one!I enjoyed all the wacky monsters, I liked how bright and colorful the whole thing was and how the two leads managed to be likeable despite my hatred for kids. Haunted Halloween isn't bad, it's just very disappointing and if this is the direction they're going in then I'm not fussed for any more films.The Good:Looks great for the most partCast do a decent jobGreat monstersThe Bad:CGI fails in placesSaturday morning tone did nothing for me",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

14,ops-52535,hallowiiin,8,14 December 2018,"Well i saw the first goosebumps,in fact twice in a short time,and found that good, and this one does not stand bakc to the original.. a bit thin story maybe, and jack black stealin the show in the end, a bit mondane,but as a part of the big game hes compulsary i guess. what i propose is that mr black should try out and remake some of orson wells works,as he gets more mature hes become a spittin image of the great actor,producer and director....
what amazes me most in this teenage horror flick is the light,colors and wonderful animations. a bit tiring in length are some of the sound effect that are well on overdrive. the music are sewn in as a rabbit in a haystack,and gives life to it all
but the teenage actors are good,some twinkling stars there.
recommended... yes indeed",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
15,paulclaassen,What a letdown!,3,19 September 2020,"'Goosebumps 2' has a new cast, a new director, and a new look. Unfortunately - as a general rule, it seems - sequels never quite live up to its predecessors. 'Goosebumps 2' is not even half as interesting as 'Goosebumps'.Although I was initially reluctant to watch 'Goosebumps' - fearing it might be a slapstick comedy - I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately the same sentiment does not apply to 'Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween'. This was indeed slapstick, and - despite the monsters - definitely aimed at a younger audience. The film also lacked the emotional depth which elevated the original from comedy to comedy drama. 'Goosebumps 2' was mostly just silly.They tried so hard to make the film creepy via the doll, Slappy, but unfortunately it just didn't work. It felt as if they tried to mimic Chucky from the 'Child's Play' films, but it simply wasn't as effective. The first half of the movie only revolves around Slappy. The acting is unconvincing and the humor forced and unfunny. This was so immature... I was so relieved when Jack Black arrived, but - sadly - his character didn't contribute much to this installment and was rather dispensable, actually.The visual effects - and monsters - only arrive after the halfway mark. By that time I already sort of lost interest, no thanks to silly dialogue and an uninteresting script. Some of the monsters from the original film are back - also my favorite, the werewolf - but they're not given much to do here and the visuals are not nearly as good as its predecessor.'Goosebumps 2' is definitely more for kids. I didn't find this funny or exciting.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

It doesn't have the 90s feel.The only highlight was Slappy. everyone else was whocares.They have over 60 Goosebumps episodes for ideas and they failed to utilize it. It's like the MCU all over again.,Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
17,briancham1994,Doesn't live up to the original,6,27 June 2020,I liked the original but this one felt a bit shallow. The first half is a typical supernatural dummy plot which would work as a short TV episode. The second half is a reproduction of the first movie but not as interesting. It doesn't tie into the first movie well and I'm disappointed that we didn't see those original characters again.,Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
18,cruise01,"Cheesy fun, just like watching an episode of Goosebumps but it is forgettable.",6,13 October 2018,"Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween (3 out of 5 stars).Goosebumps 2 is trying to be just as fun as the original movie which it does have some entertaining creativity with the fun monsters. But it does not live up to the first movie. The film does feel like watching a Saturday morning episode of a goosebumps episode that is an hour and a half. There is a simple story, mediocre acting, and cheesy visual effects of the monsters. But it is fun and entertaining. Kids and some fans would enjoy. Sadly, the film does lack the theme song yet again. The plot follows a teenage boy Sonny (Jeremy Ray Taylor) and Sam (Caleel Harris) who scavenge broken down houses for scraps. They find a manuscript to a goosebumps story called Haunted Halloween by R.L. Stine (Jack Black). They open the book and release slappy the dummy. Which slappy is trying to take over the town by releasing more monsters that turns every costume and Halloween decorations to life. Sonny and his older sister Sarah (Madison Iseman) are trying to save their hometown from this madness. There tries to be a little story especially with Sarah. The film begins with her having a writer's block. And her trying to get into a university. While her boyfriend is holding her back from achieving her dreams. While Sonny and Sam are geeky kids trying to start their junk yard business by collecting junk. It is a story about kids trying to achieve their goals while their mother is busy working overtime. When Slappy is released, turning the Halloween decorations to life. It can be very creative and fun. Seeing a giant spider made of balloons, hovering over houses. And pumpkin heads and witches terrorizing the neighborhood. It is a lot of fun. Even gummy bears coming to life and having an evil smile. Sarah (Madison Iseman) does give a better performance. A teen girl that is trying to prepare herself for adult life. Getting hurt and held back cause of her boyfriend. While the rest of the cast is quite dull with their performances. Jeremy Ray Taylor and Caleel Harris are forgettable. There characters do not stick out like Sarah but just regular ordinary geeky kids. Even, their mother Kathy played by Wendi McLendon-Covey was dull. Ken Jeong does try to have fun playing their neighbor who is obsessed with Halloween and his decorations. The visual effects are decent. Almost looks like a tv budget cgi with the monsters. This film would definitely fit in with the straight to tv movie quality. Overall, Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween is a fair film. Seeing Halloween decorations come to life is a lot of fun. The story is decent and forgettable. The characters are not as noticeable like the last movie. The acting performances are tedious.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
19,TheMovieDiorama,Goosebumps 2 is all honking geese and zero bumps in the night.,3,6 May 2020,"""This is Halloween. This is Halloween. Halloween! Halloween!"". Oops. Wrong family-friendly spooky sensation! Stine's series of children's horror books were an essential ingredient for pop culture adolescence for many youthful individuals. After all, it is the second-best-selling book series of all time. For those too young or too petrified to watch 'Cannibal Holocaust' or 'The Amityville Horror', Stine's daringly imaginative tales of fright were the perfect replacement. Letterman's previous adaptation a few years ago was able to capture the buoyancy of its source material with various chills along the way, even if the final product was incredibly watered-down and simply a menagerie of Stine's creations.Sandel's sequel, which again sees the antagonistic ventriloquist dummy Slappy reanimate all things Halloween to cause a wave of destruction, is essentially the exact same film. Yes, really. Beat for beat. Three kids use a plot device of Stine's, in this case an unpublished manuscript, to capture howling beasts, carved pumpkins, ghoulish ghosts and tasty gummy bears, before attempting to stop Slappy. Sounds familiar, right? Inherently, that's the problem. The overwhelming sense of familiarity. It leaves an entirely predictable trail of breadcrumbs that, even the target demographic of children, would find simple to follow and repetitive. Its predecessor settled on humour rather than tame scares, a choice that disregarded its source material. Well, in comparison, this not-so continuation has been blisteringly hosed down by Slappy himself. The fatigued cheesy comedy is overbearing to say the least, turning one or two predictable jump scares into an eye-rolling sensations. With zero natural chemistry exuding from its three main stars, every line of supposed hilarity was forced beyond measure.Characterisation was weak all-round, with each character fitting an essential archetype. The bullied overweight kid is the ""smartest guy in school"". His friend is, well, who knows! His unusually calm older sister instantly believing his remarks of a ""dummy coming to life"", despite the fact she forgot to lock her school locker that kept Slappy hidden away...twice. Black is back, for approximately five minutes to steal the spotlight from everyone. In that respect, it worked. Jeong provides some humble humour as the neighbouring holiday-enthusiast, but severely under-utilised. Once all the shenanigans had been put to rest, a ham-fisted moral is then obligatorily shoved in at the last second! Despite no overarching development of said moral through the preceding runtime! ""Follow your dreams!"". Urgh. Gimme a break. Atleast the traditional Halloween costumes and visual effects were pleasant enough to amuse.That said, Haunted Halloween is not a Goosebumps adaptation. It just isn't. Absent of horror chills and maximised on frenzied chaos. A sequel that rehashes its predecessor's story without the same general entertainment or level of ingenuity. Uninspired, lethargic and overfamiliar. Halloween is cancelled...",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

22,southdavid,Pumpkin' rubbish.,3,16 October 2018,"Sonny (Jeremy Ray Taylor) and his friend Sam (Caleel Harris) discover R.L. Stine's forgotten first novel whilst undertaking some house clearance work in their neighbourhood. Unlocking the book releases Slappy, the psychokinetic ventriloquist dummy who though initial seeming benevolent has an evil plan to overthrow the town. The first ""Goosebumps"" movie, from a couple of years ago, is far better than it has any right to be. Despite its relatively thin premise, it was very well written and had a good young cast that had chemistry together. Unfortunately the follow up is very much from the ""straight to video"" school of sequels, even if it's managed to land a cinematic release. The cast quite simply are not as good and in the first one, nobody is glaringly terrible, but there's little spark between them to make me actually believe in any of the relationships. The supporting cast feels a little bewildered too, Chris Parnell and Ken Jeong, try and wring something from characters that don't have enough to do to make much of an impact. But it's the script and story that really let the film down. A facsimile of the original film, the plot is designed for all the characters to return form the first, even though most of them have little part to play, apart from wandering around in the background of a scene. The dialogue though is exceptionally poor, clunky exposition and (especially when Slappy arrives) the worst collection of puns this side of ""Batman And Robin"". It is, at times, physically painful to sit through. The effects are decent though and it looks generally pretty good as the Halloween decorations comes to life. It was a bit much for some of the younger children in my particular screening, but generally the film is no scarier than your average Halloween display. There's also a decent idea for a second sequel that is hinted at. With a better writing staff Id' be interested in seeing that sequel - but if it's more of this, then no thank you.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

27,CubsandCulture,Needed more Jack Black,6,18 September 2019,"The Goosebumps franchise as never been anything but a charming cheesy kid friendly take on the horror genre. The first film was pretty much exactly what you would want from the series but this one is tired. It is predictable beyond belief. It is missing a certain element to really make the tone of the film land.I suspect that cutting down on Jack Black's Stine role and passing off the voice work for Slappy onto another actor is the culprit here. The new character are fine but the proceedings lack the gleeful mania that Black brings to his films. Moreover, the new Slappy voice is annoying because it sounds like a bad impression of Black instead of the trickster in the first film.

A good sequel!",7,19 October 2018,"This turned out to be a bit of a nice surprise, I found it to be a step up from the first movie overall, and I thought the two lead boys were much more fitting for a Goosebumps flick than the stiff they had in the first one, they looked just like the type of kids that you'd always get on the TV series. I was never bored as such with this but I did think that after a strong and surprisingly creepy first act where they bring Slappy to life, (great to see they used the chant to bring him to life like in the book this time!) it ran out of steam a little, I enjoyed it better before it got too wacky! It was wise making Slappy pretty much the star from the get-go this time around, and he was a lot of fun, I think he was a little bit scarier than before, what he does to the mother near the end was legit mortifying, that image made me go all creepy for a second! I loved the scene where he brings the masks to life and the rest of the monster emerged from them almost like out of a cocoon, that was a very cool and creative idea, they weren't as many monsters this time though, and only one that was gigantic! I loved the little epilogue that saw Slappy kind of winning over his creator in a last minute twist that was worthy of one of the many eye-rolling out of leftfield gotcha endings from the books! It was that unexpectedly dark little twist after the saccharine ending that made me decide I liked the movie. The movie had several scenes and moments in it though that I couldn't help but notice had some very hard to ignore similarities to ones from horror classics, and they were just a bit too obvious for them to be considered sly ""loving homages"", such as Slappy reading out the life-giving chant over and over while thunder crashed, which really felt a bit too Chucky summoning up mighty Damballa! And when they used the book to suck the monsters back into imagination oblivion, it felt just like a different version of the Ghostbusters trap thingy to me, and in the genuinely fun and impressive sequence where the gummy bear sweets come to life and turn nasty, the moment when they were throwing plates at the kids made me instantly think of the famous kitchen scene from Gremlins, why put that in? It wasn't anything too distracting though and I was willing to go along with it because movie, but it borrows pretty heavily at certain points. They should've made a Goosebumps movie years ago when their popularity was at its peak, or at least adapted just one story instead of haphazardly trying to cram everything that made the books so great into one movie because the approach doesn't work too well, at least not for me! So this was just about good, it was a bit too much of a kiddie movie for me but it was cute and very enjoyable and I'm sure they did what they could with it, and as it stands it's a better effort than the first movie was in my humble. I'm not exactly the right age demographic but I think it's best enjoyed as a goofy lighthearted monsterfest and Halloween movie. Show it to your younger kids, or better yet, try to get them into those fantastic books, they're much more fun! Happy Halloween now! X",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

Goosebumps 2 has such a feelgood fantasy fun mood & tone to it that IT'S so enjoyable & so entertaining.
The Halloween setting is perfect for a Goosebumps movie so right away that element is excellent & the 3 main leads (the kids) are all nice & fun not annoying & that's rare in kids films.Slappy the evil dummy is excellent here as the lead villain & it's so cool to see him brought to life with loads of scenes that are funny & creepy just like in the pages of the books!!!
I also loved the homage to my all time favourite Horror movie Halloween 3:season of the witch (1982) with the 3 kids wearing costumes of The Pumpkin,The witch & The skeleton that was a great little nod to an 80's Halloween cult classic i loved it.So yes a perfect fun fantasy Horror adventure sequel & yes the excellent Jack Black turns up again as R.L.Stine!!! it's all good fun with a lovely spooky Halloween atmosphere",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
31,Pairic,Entertaining Horror Comedy,8,8 November 2018,"Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween: The R.L. Stine Goosebumps books where the characters come to life are back. We have magic mixed with Tesla in this intriguing tale set in Wardenclyffe New York. Two young teens, Sonny (Jeremy Ray Taylor and Sam (Caleel Harris) are cleaning out an abandoned house (a previous residence of author Stine). When they move a stuffed cat a secret chamber is revealed and they find a locked book with a key. Finding a scrap of paper, Sam recites the words on it and they find a ventriloquist's dummy.On their way home the dummy defends them against bullies. It is only later that they realise the dummy, Slappy *(voiced by Mick Wingert, puppeteer Avery Lee Jones), is alive. Next day when it finds out that Sonny's sister Sarah's (Madison Iseman) boyfriend Tyler has cheated on her it causes him to fall off a ladder. Slappy also helps Sonny with his science project, an attempt to create a working scale model of Nikola Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower with disastrous results at school. The evil side of slappy now becomes more apparent when his scheme to bring Halloween creatures to life and conquer the world. Sonny, Sam and Sarah must trey and stop him.While the film is mainly aimed at children/teens it would take very little to trans form it into an an adult horror film. From the outset Slappy is quiet sinister and his his manic laugh is disturbing rather than endearing. Some wonderful scenes: gummy bears coming to life, merging and absorbing a boy; rubber bats flying off and dive-bombing the citizens of Wardenclyffe; model witches dragging people into the sky. Best of all though is Slappy's attempt to make Tesla's Tower functional again.An entertaining Horror/Comedy by director Ari Sandel. 8/10.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
32,rgkarim,"Not as Many Goosebumps In This installment, but Fun Nevertheless",7,12 October 2018,"The book series that got me hooked to reading many years ago has tried to keep its relevance as up-to-date as possible. With the first installment doing pretty well, it's no surprise that they made a second film and yours truly is ready to dive in and figure out what lies in the latest book of R.L. Stine. Can this family friendly horror keep things spooky enough to warrant a theater visit? Robbie K here with a review on the latest silver screen sensation: Movie: Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween (2018)Director:
 Ari Sandel
Writers:
 Rob Lieber (screenplay by), Rob Lieber (story by) 
Stars:
 Wendi McLendon-Covey, Jack Black, Madison Iseman 
LIKES: Family Friendly: The Goosebumps books have been a solid intro into the world of horror that brings kids into the fold of literature. This movie sticks to those guns and adds that kid friendly element to warrant a try for a family outing. Is it dark? Yes, but the studio managed to dilute the darkness to be manageable (for the most part) that kids should have a laugh at it. Case in point a three-year-old did very well in my viewing. Good Pace: Short and to the point, this movie was a quick, fun adventure that did little to slow the antics down. From the get go, you'll be immersed into the adventure at hand, as what can be describes Stranger Things, meets a Disney vibe and is executed well. The fact that time seems to fly by is a good sign that this will be fun for most. Plus, 90 minutes is a good target goal in my opinion. Creature Design: While certainly not as epic as Stine's descriptions in his book, the crew in the movie studio have done some decent research. The new creatures that inhabit the screen have got some flare to them, and while not the most realistic, at least have that same Stine vibe to them to still be easy for the little ones to handle. The Use of Slappy: Slappy in the last film was not as utilized as I expected, reserved for a few jokes and that was it. The sequel though really brought him out in spades, using him to establish a bit ,ore of the horror element, while also grounding the story down. Slappy was much more himself in this installment, his malicious side mixed with his deceitful antics bringing back memories of the horror that was Slappy in his books. A solid antagonist to support the story, I enjoyed this character much more. DISLIKES: 
Under Utilization of Characters: The kids get center stage and do well, but the older cast members not as involved as I was hoping. Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ken Jeong were reduced to a few short sequences, still bringing their tricks to trade, but not getting involved in the story like I had hoped. As for Jack Black, he's there, but not much more I can say . They really diluted ""Stine's"" part in this film and left me a little bummed with my Haunted Halloween treat. Not as Much Nostalgia: Part of the fun of the last movie was all the references to the books and trying to find the cameos in their involvement. Sadly, this film short sheeted us in this factor. Yes, there are a few nods, but Haunted Halloween is trying to go a little more original than its predecessor. Nothing wrong with that, it's just I missed the find your childhood reference component from the first film. More Creature involvement: Design might be good, but Haunted Halloween 2 didn't use their creatures to their full potential either. Many creatures get their kicks for a few seconds before being reduced to background images and occasional sound effect. Such a step down in this design, Haunted Halloween didn't have quite the spectacular impasses they wanted to bring in, and that left me feeling a little bored in terms of suspense. Predictability/Trailer Spoilers: My friend Tim has shared wisdom of be careful what trailers you watch. These words are very applicable to this movie, as watch enough of the trailers and you have 80% of the movie. Haunted Halloween has little in terms of grand surprises, and by watching these trailers, you can skip this film in the theater. The Story Component: It's not that the story was bad, but it was much less involved than the first installment. Very straightforward, very cliché, and very piecemeal that it feels like an unfinished manuscript. Slappy may have tied things together and made one heck of an antagonist, but their execution of his skill set was just missing something. Some of the antics, gimmicks, and threats were very lighthearted, and due to the kid atmosphere, I feel they threw some punches to not go too extreme to leave nightmares. The Verdict:  Goosebumps 2 has some fun little quirks that will be very appropriate for the family atmosphere of the movie. With good creature design and pacing it shows some promise to being the horror movie for the young and young at heart. However, the originality factor took a little from the adventure I enjoyed in the first installment, primarily at how disjointed this movie felt in integrating all its characters and creatures. It's a step back in quality overall, and you can skip this one due to the trailers, but not the worst movie to come out overall. My scores are: Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7.0
Movie Overall: 5.5",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
33,rannynm,"Spooky, fun and creative",9,11 October 2018,"Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween is spooky, fun and creative! It is very engaging and entertaining throughout the whole film.The story is about a young boy, Sonny (Jeremy Ray Taylor) and his best friend, Sam (Caleel Harris) who finds a book. When they open it, a doll called Slappy comes out! The boys lose the book, but keep Slappy. The friends are very surprised and a bit scared when they discover that the doll can talk. He seems nice at the beginning. He wants to have a family. But later, the boy, his sister Sarah (Madison Iseman) and his best friend realize he is strange and don't want him to be part of their family anymore. Slappy has his own personal agenda and decides to create his own family. He makes Halloween come to life as he invades the whole town with monsters and all the creatures as allies. This is a very scary Halloween for the town of Wardenclyffe, where the story takes place, as all creatures make real chaos. Sonny, Sam and Sarah team up with neighbor Mr. Chu (Ken Jeong) to find the book that Slappy from to figure out how to stop him. They discover that the book can suck up monsters and they are determined to save the city.The story is based on R.L Stine's books. This is where Jack Black comes in as he reprises his role from the 2015 film, playing the writer who came to help. His performance as the author is excellent. I love his voice work giving life to Slappy the Dummy.The movie is funny and spooky in equal amounts. There is mystery and discovery all combined in the storytelling. There's kind of a homage to horror films, as we see some classic monsters. My favorite scenes are the ones with the Halloween decorations coming to life in the store and the fight with the gummy bears that become real and attack Sonny and Sam.The effects are very well done. This story focuses on the 3 main characters and the actors did a good job carrying the film. There's a tribute to the books and literature. There's a beautiful metaphor with the blank pages in the book which is powerful. It is so interesting and kind of reminded me that reality is scarier than fantasy and there will be more stories to be written. The message of this film is, ""when we face our own fears we learn how not to be scared.""Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween opens October 12, 2018 and is the perfect movie for kids this Halloween. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommended it for ages 6 to 13 and grown ups as well.By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

36,jeremycrimsonfox,"Viewer Beware, You're In For The Same-Old",3,25 May 2019,"Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween is basically nothing more than a rehash of the first film, which had monsters from the Goosebumps series coming to life. All Sony did was change the characters, settings, and made Slappy the main antagonist and the one who brings the monsters to life. Also, the monsters are not too scary, which leads me to believe this movie has been toned down for younger viewers (Goosebumps is supposed to be for older kids). While Slappy is as evil and Jack Black reprises his role as R.L. Stine, despite it being decreased, the two fail to carry this film out of the shape it ends up in. As a person who read the books while in middle school, I was disappointed this did not live up to the first film, let alone the franchise in whole.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
37,phubbs,Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween,4,12 May 2019,"This inevitable sequel apparently seems to be an entirely new story which isn't linked to the original, something that took me by surprise. Not that I recall much from the first movie as almost all movies these days are the same garbage over and over, but the original did leave off with that invisible boy writing a new book. So we're not going to see what happens with that then??Instead this movie takes us on another route to yet another sleepy small all American town with another bunch of kids. Its the usual spiel, two young boys out for adventure, an older sister trying to get into college, the apparent single mother, and the local school bully. It's your bog standard setup all round. Naturally the boys eventually stumble across Slappy the dummy who eventually reveals himself to be alive. At first the boys think this is great but soon discover the dummy is evil. Alas its too late because Slappy is already setting his plan in motion to bring everything Halloween related to life in order to make Halloween forever...just because.So essentially what we have here is exactly the same story as the first movie (Slappy trying to take over a town), but with a different set of kids. There really doesn't seem to be any proper rhyme or reason to having everything turned into a cheesy Halloween festival, not really sure why Slappy is so obsessed with this idea. I mean, once everything is looking like Halloween town with goofy monsters and trick or treat decorations running around, then what? What is Slappy's endgame here?This movie is so damn cliched and predictable too. Right from the start when we're seeing the local town with all the various Halloween decorations up everywhere, you know straight away all these things will be coming to life at some point. And sure enough. Not only that but many of these creatures are the same damn creatures from the first movie! We've got the werewolf again, the abominable snowman, the gnomes etc...The only difference this time is they replaced the massive gnome attacks with gummi bears (of which there was only a small toy bucket full of gummi bears, yet when they attack there's like millions of them). But what's more, the visual effects are awful! The CGI throughout this movie is really average to say the least. Not even on par with the first movie.Everything is as cliche as the Halloween decorations. Yes admittedly this is based on a kids book franchise and yes this is supposed to be for kids, but come on! The cast isn't specifically bad per se but simply safe and unimpressive. It's like this is their first gig after being picked up from some crappy kids cable channel. But it doesn't help when the script gives them the corniest dialog possible and they're doing the most cliche things possible. It's like the writers got their ideas from the big book of movie cliches that have been done a gazillion times before. I mean seriously, the whole school bully angle, Jesus Christ how generic can you be??The only highlight in this entire cliche-ridden movie is the brief return of Jack Black as R.L. Stine. From the second Black steps up to the camera with his first line of dialog the movie goes up a gear. But this is only temporary as Black flits in and out of the grand finale until its all over (he misses it). The kids save the day and Stine turns out to be of no use after all. I suppose its good that the big Hollywood movie star doesn't save the day but clearly this movie needed more Black. The difference in quality he brings with his comedic acting is as clear as day (loved the 'IT' reference). Big mistake leaving him out.Spoiler alert! The movie ends on yet another cliffhanger which theoretically should lead into the inevitable third movie. But firstly, they did the same at the end of the first movie and didn't follow that up so...And secondly, this sequel failed at the box office so I'm not sure if we'll see a third.4/10",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
38,RforFilm,"Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween is a shameless, rushed, cheap cash-in, that plays like a bad cable movie of the week",2,19 October 2018,"A lot like how many people have read to be frighten by Stephen King stories, kids like myself used to read R.L. Stine ""Goosebumps"" stories in order get our first doses of fear. Having gone back to couple of them, they were not exactly scary. In fact, the tone is so campy that most could identify that R.L. Stine was going for something more comedic; a lot like a kids friendly Tales from the Crypt. Most of the books were copies of stories already told, but some were original like Monster Blood, One Day in Horrorland and The Haunted Mask did showcase some freaky monsters and scenarios that most children could relate to.What I'm getting at is that this is the kind of kid I grew up as. I wasn't exposed to the harder stuff of A Nightmare on Elm Street and Texas Chainsaw Massacre until years later. When Goosebumps was released in 2015, it brought me back to my childhood as the film did a good job recreating that campy tone that the books and TV show carried before. I felt that a sequel could bring out more monsters and even let Jack Black play around more with R.L. Stine. Unfortunately, none of that is in Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween.In Wardenclyffe, New York, hefty teenager Sonny (played by Jermey Ray Taylor) lives with his older sister Sarah (played by Madison Iseman) whose trying to get into Colombia. Sonny's family is looking after his friend Sam (played by Caleel Harris), while the latter's father is away. Sonny and Sam are running a junk business, but are also bullied. Things change when they are called to haul junk out of an old home, which contains a trunk. When opened, they discover Slappy the Dummy who doesn't do anything at first. When a chant is read, he demands to be a part of the family.At first, Slappy uses his psychic powers to help the boys. When they refuse to let him join the family, he escapes to a store to bring the Halloween decorations to life. Sonny, Sam and Sarah research the events in Madison, Delaware to find that Slappy did the same thing there. They try to get in contact with R.L. Stine (played by Jack Black), but he doesn't pick up. The teens realize that they need to get to Slappy and stop his magic before this Halloween lasts forever.While there's a lot you could do with ""Goosebumps"", it's a shame that Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween does the bare minimum in terms of a sequel. Let's start with the story, which is just a repeat of the original movie. It's just more monsters going after people, and while I wouldn't have an issue, most of them aren't anything from ""Goosebumps""; their just generic witches, ghosts, pumpkins, and other spooks from a Walgreens. What kind of director doesn't take advantage of the heavy amount of monsters that R.L. Stine has created to go for something plain?When talking about the monsters alone, they're just okay. While Slappy and some are still practical, most of them are animated CGI monsters that aren't even rendered well. It looks like whatever budget the first had was cut in half. The good news is that most of the action is focused on Slappy and he does get some good scenes in.The good scenes are not enough to adjust for the script problems. Along with being a repeat of the first, much of what these characters do make little sense. The monsters are invading, but Slappy claims to have an ulterior motive. Why? He didn't in the first movie. I'll bet that the script and even filming was rushed just to make it out to maybe make a buck. Everything about this feels lazy. The actings lazy, the filming is lazy, the writing is lazy, the effects are lazy. Even Jack Black does little to help. His scenes are so brief and unrelated to the story that you could have cut him and nothing would have been lost. I'll also bet his scenes were shot after principal production.I'll give this two gummy bears out of ten. At best, it's harmless for kids. It reminds me more of a Disney Channel movie of the month then a Goosebumps movie. If your curious, I'd say give it a rental, but it's nothing to rush out to theaters to see. If Goosebumps was like a happy meal, Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween is like all marshmallow cereal: nothing but sugar, fat and likely to give you a headache later on.

Director Ari Sandel has given us a sequel that is on par with Goosebumps(2015). The visual effects & animation are top-notch. There are many funny set pieces in the movie that children will find very enjoyable. However, most of these jokes don't really connect with the teens & the adults in the audience. This is the major flaw of the movie. Neither this film nor its predecessor can match up to R.L. Stine's creepy Goosebumps novels or the classic Goosebumps(1995-1998) TV show. Wendi McLendon-Covey is brilliant as Kathy. Madison Iseman is fantastic as Sarah. Jeremy Ray Taylor is outstanding as Sonny. Caleel Harris is spectacular as Sam. Ken Jeong is awesome as Mr. Chu. Chris Parnell is hilarious as Walter. Bryce Cass is amazing as Tyler. Peyton Wich is impressive as Tommy Madigan. Mick Wingert is the star of the show as Slappy.

Everything felt rushed and it felt like they threw everything right away without any explanation. And while you're watching you'll immediately know what's going to happen with just one glance. The story is as cliche as they come and in turn makes it laughable. Jokes also didn't land for me, it was cheesy as they come. A couple of them did get me to chuckle but that was it. The saving grace of the film was ""Slappy"", the villain of the film.

43,destroyerwod,Fun family movie for Halloween,7,18 September 2021,"Watched this one as the 2nd movie of ""Halloween Season 2021"" and in a way i kinda wish i waited a little longer because the Halloween spirit is well represented so it would had maybe fit more later, but oh well :PMaybe im a nostalgic but the stuff you see in this movie wich is pretty much required for the movie to work does not seem to happen as much where i live for a number of years, even pre-covid. I mean peoples decorating hardcore for Halloween and tons of kids roamind the streets. You do see a few kids here and there and maybe 1/3 of the houses put some tiny decoration like a pumpin or a skeleton hanging on Halloween night but there is not much major crazy decorations like it used to be and well in advance as before.So finding this in this movie always pump me up. That said outside the set up itself the characters do not really ""celebrate"" Halloween since the plot start early in the day and they are busy with it, but yet that Halloween spirit was well enough represented that i got my kick out of the rest from the backgrounds, monsters etc.I know im staying vague so far but lets say that if like me you taught Slappy was the main Goosebumps vilain you should be satisfied. He had a place in part 1 but here he is really put forward. Otherwise beside a brief cameo from Jack Black the characters from part 1 do not comeback, its an original story and the monsters you saw in 1 also either are not in 2 or have a very tiny part (just being show but basically do nothing), in a way its not a bad thing as it create variety, we don't want a reharshal of the first movie.Anyway all of this to say its a fun movie especially if like me you have child nostalgia for Halloween or you have legit children lol to watch with.

Unlike the first, where they just threw in every Goosebumps monster and villain they could think of, this feels more like watching the characters actually live a Goosebumps story. There were some good laughs, and there were actually a few genuinely scary moments. This has all the fun and cheesiness you'd expect from a Goosebumps property. Although the film did work well with its own original story, part of me keeps hoping that one day they'll do an anthology movie where they adapt at least 3 Goosebumps stories into one movie. There were a few dumb moments in this movie, but they weren't so dumb that I was facepalming or groaning. They fit with the tone of the film, because that's what this film is: Dumb, but fun dumb, not bad dumb.

I thought it would be a nice movie to watch on Halloween but what I got was a cheesy film full of weak characters and hit-and-miss comedy.Its characters can either be mean, cynical or idiotic and are not believable. They tend to fight over their decisions on how they're going to defeat Slappy when kids their age with half a brain could make smarter and more wise decisions in their situation. Even 11-year-olds can be smarter and more trusting of teamwork than a couple of brainless, uncooperative teenagers.Its jokes are nothing hilarious. They usually get a chuckle out of me but some of them are quite corny and cheesy as is the action. The film is a little boring and slow-paced and doesn't really speed up until an hour into the film, where things start getting a little more interesting.I can see by the end that there's room for a third film but I'm a little worried. If the first one is really not that bad but the second one is just mediocre, I'm worried about how the third one will play out. Unless they can make the third one have more friendlier, stronger, smarter characters and not take so long for the story to get going, that would be an improvement.If you want to take your kids to see a film or just enjoy a good kids film, go watch Smallfoot instead.

53,yogeshevolution,No goosebumps here,5,28 December 2018,If you have watched the 1st part then this sequel is not going to give you goosebumps. This is family movie to watch on Halloween which may serve the purpose but for those who are expecting more this movie is going to disappoint. The only character which makes a mark is Slappy the dummy.So if you are looking for fun filled evening with family you can watch it.,Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
54,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of Goosebumps: Haunted Halloween.,8,14 October 2018,"Having read very bad reviews it lowered our expectations that Haunted Halloween was going to be good. So here our review:Slappy is summoned (this time the curse like in the books and TV series bring him back to life) and he wants to be part of the family, only under the condition that everyone does exactly what he says. Sloppy, like in the books is very controlling and he does just that in Haunted Halloween. It's very intimidating to say the least, because Slappy goes from one person to the next (usually school bullies) getting even or causing trouble. All this happens in the first act, and it's off to a magnificent start. Story starts in just around 15 mins into the movie. After things don't go according to plan Slappy decides to summon his real family, the goosebumps characters! We'll let you work the rest out from there. 
The effects are worse than the first movie, and the script wasn't as clever or genius like the first movie, and a lot of the jokes fell flat. The kid characters are also not as interesting as the ones from the first one. It really did have a lot to work on, but funny thing is despite all of that it's hugely entertaining! 
By the way, *SPOILER ALERT* Jack Black is in this playing R. L. Stine , but it's more of a cameo role. And the Stephen King reference should make you laugh! And one more spoiler, The Haunted Mask is in it, and gets loads of screen time! But, it's entertaining, fun to watch, and something you should definitely watch on Halloween. 4/5 stars. Jay and Nick.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

My i Don't Think That Everyone is Not Gonna Eat No More Of Gummy Bears After They Watched Them Attack!, The Two Main Kid Characters.So, Anyways Oh!

60,michaelgarykelley1994,"As A Big Fan, This Was Actually Decent",7,24 January 2019,"As a major ""Goosebumps"" fan, I can say my favorite monster is Slappy the ventriloquist dummy, and that I adored the first film. This sequel film took a while to be made and released, since it was drowned in development problems, but I DID enjoy it, and I AM glad I own it on DVD. Oddly enough it looks as though the new name for the film is simply ""Goosebumps 2"", instead of ""Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween"" (which just sounds better, all around). This was a fun film, but it's nowhere close to being as heartfelt or fun as the first film was, in my opinion.I love the way the film is crafted for ""Goosebumps"" fans. Most folks who don't read the books would probably wonder how Slappy has managed to live, after the ending of the first film. To a ""Goosebumps"" fanboy, we know that every sequel to almost every book, no matter what series, never really begins where the last book ended. Honestly, though, we never really need to know how a monster character returns from a previous story. It's just not important, and I love that about both the movies AND the book series (which I've been reading since I was a small child).Slappy is found by two older boys who take junk off of people's hands. They found him inside R.L. Stine's old house from the first flick (apparently Stine moved away, at some point). But Slappy isn't stuck in the book from the end of the first film, now. The boys read the very famous voodoo words from a card in Slappy's pocket, and they eventually discover that he's actually alive.You could very well call this another Slappy Show, and I know that bothers many fans. Slappy seems overexposed to the franchise, and I can admit that, even though he's still my favorite monster from all of the books. He's just too much fun to hate, even here, when a different actor was playing him (Jack Black did the voice in the first film). I don't mind the newer actor-he sounds almost identical to Black until he laughs his absolutely TERRIBLE laugh. It's silly, and not tense, or biting, like what Jack Black had given us. I'm definitely not a fan of that new laugh. Slappy seems happier, in this film. He actually wants to be part of the family with the one boy, his sister, and his mother. Slappy is so likable here, even if he's drastically different in personality from his character in the first film. Again: continuity doesn't matter in the ""Goosebumps"" world, so it doesn't bother me, and shouldn't bother the dedicated fans. One of my favorite moments I texted my mother about was when I got to see Slappy the Dummy playing PlayStation. I never expected to see that, and now I have. What a wonder.The rest of the cast tends to be just okay. You've got a lot of young people I don't know, but I do recognize the actor who played Ben from ""It"". Honestly, I don't think they were given much to work with. The mother of the two main kids is absolutely horrible. The Asian guy from the ""Hangover"" films is horrible, too. And I mean, HORRIBLE. Both of 'em. At least the aunt in the first film had some charisma, and could actually pull comedy off well. She seemed like she actually cared about the project. Neither the mother nor the Asian neighbor seemed to give one turd about the respect and fanbase behind everything ""Goosebumps"" related. And it shows. One character that none of us thought would be in here, when it was supposedly announced that he wouldn't return at all, was Jack Black as R.L. Stine. I was so happy when he showed-up in the trailers for the film, last year, but he's literally just a tacked-on subplot. And that's immensely disappointing. It's like the filmmakers or Sony or someone involved with the movie saw a YouTube video where people were upset that Black wasn't going to return (given that most people seemed to find him as a major highlight of the charm of the first film), and decided to go ahead and tack him right on to the sidebar. He's barely in the film, but his presence really helps you realize what's actually missing from this sequel. Maybe we shouldn't have had a second film, altogether? I still liked what I got, for the most part. At least we got that incredibly fun ""It"" reference. Definitely a highlight for ""Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween"".The writing wasn't very strong, nor were the emotions or comedy. That's something noteworthy in difference of quality and direction between this film and the previous one.The CGI, in my opinion, is a very mixed bag. There's tons of it, and yet it feels like there isn't much. The film itself feels cheaper than the first film, and it feels like it's much less grandiose than the first film tended to be, at times. But there are some incredible things done with CGI, here. The design of the witches is absolutely stellar. I love them. The killer gummy bears, on the other hand, look like first-tier poop, once they grow to be life-sized (again: as we've seen in the trailers). If someone is wearing a monster costume, then it's pretty obvious. And, speaking of costumes, the main characters even have a cool reference to ""Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch"", at one point! I couldn't help but smile at that.When it comes to the musical score, it's esssentially the exact same music from the first film. I liked the original film's score, so that worked well, if you ask me. Very suiting.Like I mentioned earlier: the film feels cheaper than the first flick. I hate that the film flopped, because it's decent, for more of a children's film that older ""Goosebumps"" fans can still enjoy. It was fun, and that's all it needed to be. But I also find some things in the film (one in particular dealing with the mother) that were genuinely creepy. Too bad most people don't appreciate ""Goosebumps"" anymore. Maybe it's time to pack it away in a toy chest, along with ""Star Wars"", ""Star Trek"", and so many other once-upon-a-time classics that fascinated people like myself, growing-up in the 90s and early 2000s?Overall, though: if you're a fan of Slappy the Dummy, or just plain, fun kid's movies, try this one out. But make sure you've seen the first film, because you might have some small things float right over your head. Believe me, it's worth seeing them close together.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

62,benjaminwest-242,A not so good sequel,4,1 November 2021,"Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween showed promise in the beginning sequences, but ultimately failed in a terrible fashion. Firstly, the film is too a like to the previous film, noticeably all throughout the plot. The acting is subpar, with multiple veteran cast members not getting nearly enough screen time. The main, younger cast performed decently, but cringey dialogue and a ridiculous plot full of many holes dragged them and the entire experience down. The usual high school tropes are those overused and only serve as a fill-in to further the story. Emotional depth is therefore weak, where no characters ever receive any real development. The comedy is hit or miss, as well. The highlight is a more thorough examination of Slappy, but this far from saves the film. Overall, a disappointing Halloween story.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
63,Clank_Zoka,I Mean..... What Did You Expect?,4,21 October 2018,"I never read any Goosebumps books, just wants to put it out there, I have no knowledge of the book series, yes I have heard of it, but I have never readed any of the books, okay so with that said, the first Goosebumps movie was good, not great but good, fun visuals, great premise, interesting plot, and fun characters, along with mostly good acting but Jack Black was the main highlight, sure it was goofy, cliched, predicbale, generic looking and it was mostly harmless, but I had a good time with it, so I think a sequel is needed for the first movie, to continue the story of R.L Stine, Zach, Hannah and Champ, what will the invisible boy do to our heroes and so much more, so it could the next continuation right?....... well I saw it yesterday and....... yeeeaaah not as good as the first movie, in fact, it's just like the first movie all over again, except a different location and with different people... mostly.It's about these three kids, two of them want to sell lots of junk for money and the other is.... a girl who wants to go out with a boy, then the boys have bullies too and a Mum who barely has time for her two children and whatever nonsense they tell her, she don't believe them, but when Slappy somehow come out of the book, he has a evil plan of taking over the world and control Halloween, so that means our heroes must stop him from doing that...... yep, it's one of ""those"" films, the one where it's just a basic plot and humour that is all over the place, with things like that, it's make a film just exactly what it is, a generic kids film with cliches and that's what this movie is, maybe for a lot of people that won't bother them, but for people like me, this was reeeeeeally bland, I mean yeah it did make me chuckle, one scene or two made me laugh, but that's not saying much, subplots are very little but what they have, goes nowhere, I'll admit I do like the ending and the moral behind it, but that doesn't save the movie's generic plot and humour, it may not be terrible, but it just has a bland feel to it.The visuals are nice, well shot, looks pleasant to look at, the CGI on the monsters look cool and have great designs, the puppetry on Slappy is great when it comes to it's action it can get creative and quite fun, however this also looks quite cheap, while the CGI is good it can get a ""it doesn't really look like it's actually there"" vibe and it really does it generic for the most part, the CGI on Slappy looks really bad, I don't know why they had to put it on him but it doesn't look good, while it's nice to look at and well shot, it can look like a average looking film, like in a school or in a house, but that's just a nitpick, overall, visually it does look nice, the CGI is decent and the puppetry is great, but it lands right on the generic side.The characters have very little to offer, most of them are generic forgettable trophy's, Sonny and Sam are just the two main characters who want to get money, but are also pretty stupid as well, Sarah is just basically the girl character, Kathy Sonny and Hannah's Mum is just a overacting character, Mr. Chu Is cringe, the bullies are not very threatening, Tyler the love Interest of Hannah is just that, Walter is okay, HOWEVER!..... the only two characters that I actually liked where Slappy and (this is not a spoiler) R.L Stine (Jack Black), those two have a lot more personality then the rest of the characters, more funny and exciting and crazy too, even though R.L Stine is not in the film for that long, but Slappy steals the show with every trick, I really enjoyed him, he can also be very threatening at times, along with some funny monsters too, the acting is fine, Jeremy Ray Taylor (A.K.A Ben Hanscom from the 2017 IT remake) Caleel Harris and Madison Iseman are fine I guess, not bad at all just okay..., everyone else is basically doing what their role is, Ken Jeong is basically playing a similar Mr. Chow from the Hangover trilogy, Wendi McLendon-Covey is good as the mum Kathy, Chris Parnell (Voice of Jerry Smith from Rick and Morty) is actually one of the few better actors in the film along with.............. Jack Black, Black was easily the best actor in the film, he was a lot of fun to watch, even though he was even funnier in the first movie and the House with a Clock in it's Walls, so with generic characters with no personality or development, played by okay actors is really nothing memorable, however Slappy and Stine were the better characters and Jack Black is always a delight.So yeah.... I didn't like this film at all, not a bad movie by any means, but not good at all, a really basic plot, an average looking film with cheap CGI and dull characters, however it can be funny at times, the visuals can look pleasing, the puppetry is great and a few characters and actors stand out, if the kids want to see a good Halloween kids movie for the half term, the Book of Life, the Hotel Transylvania films and heck the first Goosebumps is far better then this movie, but if the kids really want to see it then take them to see it, I think they'll enjoy it more then adults, but I recommend renting it, I think it should of gone straight-to-DVD..... that would of been better, it's not as cancerous as the Emoji Movie or Smurfs, but even I take Peter Rabbit over this.I'm giving Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween a 4.9/10.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

73,cguldal,Needed more Jack Black,6,3 November 2018,"This sequel is not as good as the first one. I think Jack Black was sorely needed, not necessarily because the acting was lacking, but the script seemed a bit too flat at times, characters stating the obvious after the fact, etc. The involvement of the store clerk was unnecessary and was only there to later connect with mom, who seemed more like an extra (again, not because of the acting, which was good). The young actors and the neighbor were successful and did a good job with the lines, I thought. The meta stuff about the plot turns and elements was funny. The bullying stuff was OK, but really stale by now, as it seems to be in every single movie involving kids in school, where the bully is just a stupid, book-hating idiot, and the kids being bullied are just nice, smart kids (and I would argue being bullied would not make anyone nice, at least...) As for the main plot with Slappy, I felt like there was no real mystery, no real drive. Slappy wants a family, OK... And he will try to get it... OK. But at no point do we feel the drive, understand his motives. But then again, I am probably expecting too much from a dummy.Overall, en enjoyable film, especially for the fans.

75,iamjacksmoviechannel,"Not as good as the first, but fun",7,13 October 2018,"So last week after Venom I said that nobody at Sony would know what going dark was if it licked them in the ass with a giant symbiote tongue. This week, I take it back. Goosebumps isn't going to wow you with what it has to say, nor does it have much to say in the first place, but this totally understands what it wants to be. Like the books it's based off of, it's the scary movie starter kit for kids. You get your halloween fright monsters, you get some mild jump scares, you get inspired lunacy and funny references, some for kids, some clearly aimed at adults. This movie is everything the first movie was and everything that House with the clock in the walls wanted to be. If you're reviewing it, sure, you can come up with the problem that the plot is pretty much the same from the first movie but the first movie generally was just the creation of a playground to workout zaniness and frights anyway so as long as those work...Here two kids find a book from R.L. Stine. It winds up bringing Stine's dummy Slappy back to life. Slappy in turn decides he wants to complete the story of one of Stine's earlier works and unleashes a bunch of monsters on the small town in order to do that. The whole thing is a bunch of fun and nobody is having more of it than Jack Black. He voices Slappy with Crypt-keeper like precision, especially the laugh. He later shows up in person as Stine, full of hillarious mock arrogance. Slappy is also sure to be the best character here, one who even at his most tame is really mischievous and at his most menacing is enough to make you fear for whoever he's around.This is also another marvel for Sony Pictures animation. The visual effects, from the costumes in the halloween store that come to life to haunted pumpkins, to demonic gummy bears. Every once in a while the mom from the Goldbergs or Ken Jeong will come in for some comedic support. The kid actors are fine too and there's a nice message about facing fears. Really if I was 10 i'd think this was a great movie but even as an adult, I laughed at its absurdity while admiring how it balances being wacky, frightful, and also kid friendly.

78,fatemaster2003,"Expected Too High, Ended Up Disappointed Instead",5,18 October 2018,"First of all, I'm also one of the big fans of the ""Goosebumps"" novel out there. I basically grew up with it and these novel's have accompanied most of my childhood with cheesy (though there's a couple scary one too) stories written by R.L. Stine. So when I heard that Goosebumps will be resurrected to the big screen, I was super enthusiastic with this news.The first Goosebumps from 2015, that's a much better quality movie and I totally love it (still do until now), though there's still room for improvement. With the great result from the first one in mind and also a hope that the sequel would be much, much better, I watched the 2nd one tonight......and I ended up DISAPPOINTED!!!First, since we're talking about Goosebumps in general, this movie surely lack the element of surprise. And by surprises, I'm not saying the cheesy jump scare where you practically can see it coming from miles away, but more about the sudden appearances of certain monsters or creatures that made Goosebumps novels such a hit back then. In here, those creatures just appear TOGETHER! Are you making a halloween movie or a brawling movie, dear director???Second, the main characters. Goosebumps 2 is really lacking the development and backstory of each characters here. It's like, you're suddenly presented with some random characters, give them some dreams and wishes, then throw them in into the story (imagine Interactive story book where you're presented with options in each pages) just as pawns of the sort to go through this scary town and experience the thrill. Oh, and you know what? The cameo doesn't help also!Third, what the hell with the main villain? Yes, I know that ""THAT GUY"" is by far the most menacing of all. He got the brain, the power and even the magic in him. But why turn him into a super cheesy villain where his evilness is only to ""hosed"" people or make some things alive? Honestly, even though ""THAT GUY"" is around, but I couldn't sense the threat and evil in there... His intentions are like those coming out of children's story book.Fourth, even though some of the special effects are great, but honestly speaking, it's not that great. In an era where movie producers can already create devastating tsunami coming, or earth cracking and splitting, or the epic fight between kingkong and T-Rex or dinosaurs roaming around earth without much problem, most the ghosts and ghouls of Goosebumps 2 really just looks like people cosplaying around while bullying the neighborhood to make a chaos (is that even a chaos?)All in all, I'm honestly disappointed in this sequel. Feels like the director doesn't understand what makes the Goosebumps novel such a hit back there. Feels like, they are treating Goosebumps franchise as an easy money-milking property only...I can only hope that the next sequel (if any) will be much better and darker in tone...",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

The plot was a bit slow and not that suspenseful or exciting. And despite Slappy being featured more in this sequel, he actually was not as creepy or menacing as he came across in the first movie.While the first Goosebumps movie felt more like a love letter to the franchise, this movie's recipe felt more like a TV movie that tried its hardest to use the Goosebumps books as inspiration only to be just lightly Goosebumps flavored (and heavy on the Halloween candy).Very fun, very Halloween-y, but...not that Goosebumps-y.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

I recommend watching it before Halloween due to the movie's plot but it could also work as a nice Sunday family watch. This movie is better than original and improves it in every way. The story is a semi-direct continuation of the 1st movie. The adventure and acting is good. The CGI are surprisingly good. All action set in this ideal American town is well directed and will keep viewers interested and deeply involved in the movie. I find this movie far better and more suitable for younger audience than the Tower Clock movie with Mr Black. This movie was definitely not intended for younger audience but Goosebumps 2 is solid and should be given a chance. Light, good, easy watch.

The acting in this one seemed less stilted, and the dialogue a little (lot) wooden.

98,photobykjerstein,Hopefully the last one,3,13 May 2019,"Just the fact that Ken Jeong is on the cast list testifies that it will not be a particularly serious movie.If the first Goosebump was for the teenager audience who must not see adult horror movies, then this is clearly for the minors.In the first movie, Slappy is the villain, here he is almost a hero the first, at least, 35 minutes.
He helps the two boys against the bullies, helps them with their homework and such, as well as the one brother's sister, helps her getting revenge on her boyfriend after he has been her unfaithful.
... right untill they try to turn Slappy off, then he become the Villain again.
It is only after 43 minutes that we see some creatures from R.L. Stine's books as Slappy goes to the supermarket and makes the costumes live.The funniest thing is that they break into a older lady's house and the two boys get into a fight with gummybears.
To make a long story short, the first Goosebump is about a lot of monsters and fairytale creatures, where Goosebump 2 is more about a insane angry Slappy.So with hope in my voice I say this; ""Let's just say Goosebump is a completed chapter now.""",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

My kids loved seeing the Halloween decorations coming to life (especially that balloon spider and cgi seemlessly blended with practical effects) and the cinema was full of kids laughing out loud at certain parts.
Fans of Jack Black's R.L Stine character may be disappointed, but Slappy being the main protagonist more than makes up for the lack of Stine.
The acting is fine for purpose, no Oscar worthy performances here, but the 3 main characters (Sarah, her brother and his friend) are likeable enough. So while Goosebumps 2 is not exactly making ground-breaking cinematic history, given some of the rubbish kids movies I've seen this year ('Monster Family' anyone?!) it's certainly one of the more entertaining ones.

We were both fans of the first one, and was overly excited to go see this one. Taking my (5yr old) daughter to see this film was enjoyable; and even though it is labeled as a family movie, we both found ourselves spooked at times. It had some good spooky moments that made for a fun thrill. The movie is fun, and recommendable to anyone.My problems with this movie: at times the movie seemed flat. A few scenes that were meant to be comical fell short, with only a few chuckles at best. Some of the lines felt dry and occasionally forced. I felt that too much was focused on the cgi (which was amazing) and not enough on writing.The acting choices were great, but the characters seemed uncomfortable in their roles. Jeremy Ray Taylor was incredible in 'It', yet he sort of felt like he was pained to keep his role. Jack Black was not shown until the last few minutes of the movie, and it was very rushed.That being said, I thought the movie was very good. I do recommend this movie for a good family time. Enjoyable and fun.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

The first Goosebumps movie was enjoyable for almost all audiences despite some jokes being to childish and I expected so muchI think the actors did a good job but the characters that they had to give life to were just poorly imagined and too flat.Also, Jack Black's appearance although we would have wanted more was clearly unnecessary and was treated as a narration or explanation if you haven't watched the first movie.

It had fun likable characters and a great villain in Slappy the evil dummy. Fast forward 3 years and here's the sequel. 99% of the cast from the original is missing and the new characters aren't as interesting. They're serviceable but kind of forgettable. The story is also not as well paced as the original and is too fast for its own good coming in as a little too short. It needed about another 10 minutes or so in its last act.But I can't hate it because it's still a lot of fun. Once again Slappy steals the show and there's some surprisingly creepy scenes involving him early on in the movie. The other Goosebumps monsters are fun too and the halloween setting puts a smile on my face. I also really dug the musical score by Dominic Lewis. If you have kids I highly recommend taking them to this one. Although there might be a few scenes too scary for the younger ones it's the perfect horror movie for them to watch during the Halloween season.

However, this movie did not give me the same vibes I had from the last movie.First off the CGI in this movie was pretty terrible. I was kind of expecting the CGI to be at least okay, but it was even worse than the previous Goosebumps movie. The acting is also not that good (and script). There was also a character named Mr. Chu who plays a neighbor next door and was completely useless for this movie. He felt very forced and was only used for some jokes (which were not good). The villain of this movie, Slappy, was kind of boring at times and didn't really have any scary scenes which was disappointing to see.

With me being a fan of r.l stones work and horror as a whole I came in with high expectations. The only thing that weighs this film down from a 10/10 to a 7/10. It copies other films. The dummy -slappy- using voodoo to make objects feels to much like in cult of chuck where Chucky uses voodoo to make other good guy dolls to come to life.

137,kaywilliams-90488,A Humongous Disappointment,3,24 October 2018,"My friends and I loved the first Goosebump movie so much, that we went to see it three times! And when we heard that there was a new film coming on, we assumed that it would be leading off at the point were the first one ended, but sadly no. This movie was unfortunately terrible. I'm only giving it three stars because the mom in The Goldbergs was in it, and of course Jack Black.
The cgi was okay, but I expected better just because it was a movie and if you an make dinosaurs look like their walking the earth, then why can't you make the monsters look actually scary and not like a Halloween YouTube tutorial??
The acting was mediocre, and I forgot the kid that played in the movie 'IT's name, but for some reason his acting in this movie had decreased from his other role, and I don't know what's everyone's obsession with having at least one intense bike riding scene in EVERY movie but it's getting over played and just annoying. Madison Iseman from 'Jumanji' was in this film, and honestly, I didn't really like her acting in that movie either, and this was no different. I just feel like she doesn't give off the right emotion in specific scenes. When she's supposed to be sad, she's mad, when she's supposed to be scared, she's just breathing hard, like I don't know, that just my opinion.
I was also very disappointed in Jack Black being in the movie for like a good 10-15 minutes. His role was so irrelavant to the story, that of you take the scenes out that he was in, the movie would still have made sense. Honestly, it was a waste of time for him, especially the past roles he's played that led him to being the legendary comedic actor we know.
The parts that I'm presuming that we're suppose to be funny, we're terrible. Nobody in the movie theatre laughed, the only part I found funny were the kids next door neighbor, but even his forced on comedy was kind of out-stretched.
I know this movie was intended for kids, but I was 13 when the first moving came out, and I went to that one three times, and I give it 10 stars! I was 15 when this film came out, so don't be like, ""well you're too old to enjoy a movie like this"" because no, I'm not. I was hoping that some characters from the first movie would reaccure, but I couldn't even imagine Dylan Minnette in this movie, he's to busy actually creating good content.

They don't often make movies like this anymore, so take it for what it is and tap into your lighter side.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
144,ej_alvarado,Funny movie,7,28 October 2018,"The movie has a good history, but the cast is so bored; Slappy is the best of the movie. In general, I enjoyed the film, it's perfect to watch with the family.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
145,paddylegard,Decent horror for the family!!,8,31 October 2021,"I watched this with an 8 year old and we both loved it (I'm 38!!) I love horror films anyway, it kinda reminded me of a family friendly 'child's play' for the first half hour! Give it a go...",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
146,JimmyFrechzinaer,Well. It's something.,3,27 December 2018,"The only thing i wanted from this movie, is to have fun. And i did, kinda.
This film isn't good, or even alright. It's another mediocre kids movie.
I didn't really love this movie.
It has some good moments, but those are ruined by the utter stupidity of what this movie is.
I like Jeremy Ray Taylor, he was amazing in IT, but i felt like he was weaker in this movie than he was in IT, probably because of the mediocre script.
Now there IS fun to be had here, but it is ruined by how this movie plays it safe so much.
I did like some of the monster's and how they looked (besides the CGI monstrosities). The practical monsters looked pretty good, even though they were on the screen for about a couple of seconds.
Also i didn't really hate the neighbor who was obsessed with Halloween decorations. He was fine, he moved the plot, so i'm just gonna say he was good. But the best part of this film is how FUNNY it is. What i mean by ""Funny"" i don't actually mean well-told jokes or good humor, i mean that this movie is fun to laugh it.
Overall, i liked the kids, the dude obsessed with halloween, how cheesy it was, and the practical monster effects. Though there WERE some bits that were absolutely hilarious and that i laughed at so unbelievably hard.
I didn't really like the script though, the dialogue is the average kids movie dialogue, also i really didn't enjoy slappy in this movie, he was just goofy, and not in the way he was in the first. Instead he's just. Bland.PROS

147,tnharlan,Best Movie!,10,3 October 2020,"Everything you would want in a Halloween movie is in this movie! It's funny and not too scary for my kids. It's so creative on every level. I'm not sure how this movie would get any negative reviews, unless your NOT into Halloween, then that would make sense. This is on my family's top 5 favorite Halloween movie.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
148,jeterjordo,Absolutely Amazing!!!,10,11 October 2018,"Well, as a goosebumps fan. I REALLY loved this movie and highly enjoyable! Great Effects and Great Cast! I recommend this movie.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
149,jawaada,A movie lacking storyline and contains Sony products.,1,13 October 2018,"One of the films that I personally find strange was slappy who appeared good in the first place and then decides to go on evil. Second thing is too many sony product placements, bitcoin reference and apple products which really isn't needed in this second installment and spoiler alert, after 2 guys retrieve the book, fight against monster gummy bears, the sleeping woman before didn't even for once wake up. What's did she consume, high doses of sleeping pills? And last thing is rl Stine SPOILER Alert who arrives late after 3 kids save the day against slappy. A second installment that will dissapoint you.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
150,oct-21342,Don't go,1,14 October 2018,The first Goosebumps movie was great. This one had nothing to do with goosebumps it was about Halloween coming to life. My 7 year old grandson was very disappointed. It seemed like they just threw a movie together to get something out. Don't waste your money. Jack Black was only in the movie for a few minutes.,Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
151,rlwyllie,Major Disappointment,2,14 October 2018,"This movie was a major disappointment in comparison to the first Goosebumps movie. The acting was horrible, the storyline was very weak, and it didn't have the feeling of a Goosebumps movie at all. Jack Black easily could have been removed from this movie and the storyline wouldn't have changed. Hopefully the next one will improve!",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
152,changhock,Great Show,8,29 October 2018,"Show is great for young and young at heart, funny and scary at same time. Hope to see goosebumps 3, R L Stine being rescue",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween

Sub par story
Meh villain
Predictable ending
Not worth watching just watch the originals.
Verdict: MEGA CASHGRAB",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
154,forafistfulofherbs,Not as good as the first,5,23 February 2019,Kids might be happy but this was abit of a let down from the first movie.,Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
155,dahabreh-31921,Disappointing,2,28 February 2019,"It's just your below average dumb teen movie. Definitely fun for kids but that's just about it. The story telling is unrealistic and i have so many problems with it considering the fact that the acting was incredibly awful- even for a kids movie.
Let's start with this- Main two characters, Sam and Sonny, find a talking walking magical puppet and they act surprised for 5 minutes and the next thing you see is them playing video games with it.
Sarah, another main character, doesn't even act shocked or surprised even for a tiny little bit when she comes in contact with the evil puppet, slappy. Instead, she immediately rejects him and decides that he needs to go. Like hello? You just saw a talking puppet that is evil, you should at least act a little bit scared.
The mother of the family also does a terrible job of being your average hard working protective single mom.
The main characters decide to call the author of the book that caused all of this mess for help and it takes the author, Jack Black ( Character's name is Stan L), about 6 scenes to finally get to the place to help the characters take down the evil puppet only to find out they've already figured it out and basically his entire role was to give the leading role, Sarah, a pep talk to inspire her to write her college assay to get into Columbia college. Jack Black was terrible in his acting, even for a kids movie!!!
Was it fun overall? Yes. Is it worth it? No. Entertaining for kids? Definitely. Impressed by it? No, It was disappointing.",Goosebumps 2 - Haunted Halloween
