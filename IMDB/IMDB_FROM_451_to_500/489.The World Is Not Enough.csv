0,TheLittleSongbird,"Incredibly underrated, second only to GoldenEye as the best of the Brosnan Bonds",9,25 August 2010,"I am a fan of James Bond, and I have to say I love The World is Not Enough. It mayn't be the best of the Bond films like I consider a film like Goldfinger, but it is easily one of the better Bond films with Pierce Brosnan in the title role. I also think it is incredibly underrated, for as I have said this is really good and second only to GoldenEye as the best of the Brosnan Bonds. I loved that The World is Not Enough was a welcome return to the gritty glamour as seen in From Russia With Love, and that the story is quite hard-hitting as well as suspenseful and thrilling. The stunts are truly spectacular, as is the action which is enough to make your adrenaline pump up, with the opening speedboat chase complimenting it perfectly. The cinematography is effortless and the scenery is splendid, while the music and theme song are certainly memorable. The acting is very well done, Pierce Brosnan is very likable and clearly comfortable as Bond, while Sophie Marceau matches him perfectly and her character Elektra King is for me the best and sexiest Bond girl in ages and Robert Carlyle is perfect as the vicious and chilling villain. And I actually didn't mind Denise Richards that much, admittedly she isn't brilliant, but I certainly didn't hate her, and Judi Dench once again proves what a fine actress she is and even gets to go out into the Middle East battlefield and show off her gadget ingenuity. Overall, this is really underrated and quite an excellent film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The World Is Not Enough
1,bkoganbing,Feeling No Pain,5,14 June 2009,"The Soviet Union has broken up now and SPECTRE seems to have lost some of its punch in the world that James Bond now faces. In The World Is Not Enough, the threat is one in keeping with the times. Terrorists are threatening the west's supply of Mideast oil and of course 007 is called in to deal with it.At first it's just a kidnapping of oil heiress Sophie Marceau, but when Pierce Brosnan delivers the ransom, the father of Marceau, David Carlyle is killed with a remote control device for no apparent reason. As the film develops the reason becomes quite clear.Bond has a really deadly adversary, but a situation that seems a bit much for me. Robert Carlyle was shot in the head and the wound healed over. He's not getting the medical attention to get the bullet out and it will eventually kill him. But in the meantime as it travels its way through his brain, it is killing all nerve endings, no taste of smell or taste and most importantly touch. He feels no pain and is in his mind invincible.Marceau is of course Bondified in the course of the film as is nuclear scientist Denise Richards. Did Albert Einstein have Richards in mind when he went into physics?The World Is Not Enough is not one of the best Bond features, a most improbable foe keeps it from top rank, but Brosnan Bond fans should like it.",The World Is Not Enough
2,Leofwine_draca,"One of the weaker Bonds out there, but at least the action's decent",6,4 December 2016,"The latest James Bond outing is a fun, if stale, formula piece which offers up little originality and yet has such a polished, flawless sheen that you can't help like it to a degree. Ideas were very thin on the ground here and the plot is a very loose one involving various traitorous characters swapping sides and shouting at each other a lot. It's all very confusing and to be honest not very interesting - mainly because none of the actors and actresses on screen appear to be getting into their roles, instead looking simply bored.Pierce Brosnan has settled into the role nicely, but his portrayal here is nothing short of lazy. He is also let down by his supporting cast - although to be fair the script isn't really interested in giving depth to our characters, instead preferring to have them as one-dimensional stereotypes. Sophie Marceau was hyped up as the newest femme fatale yet I think she seems out of place and miscast here - she's too sophisticated to be a realistic villainess. Robert Carlyle makes the most of his over the top villain, but he is barely on screen and the script gives him only a few lines.Various other supporting characters pop up, including Judi Dench, who looks even more out of place than usual when she gets trapped behind bars; Desmond Llewellyn is as mischievous as ever as Q, poignantly in his final role, and Robbie Coltrane overacts for all he's worth as a greasy Russian swine. The usual familiar British actors also pop up, including Michael Kitchen and John Cleese. But it's Denise Richards who stands out, for all the wrong reasons, as one of the most wooden Bond actresses out there - until Gemma Arterton came along in QUANTUM OF SOLACE, at least.What this film does benefit from are a couple of show-stopping action sequences, especially the opening boat chase over the River Thames which is the best that Bond has ever been. Unfortunately, things lose their way a bit with a terribly clichéd and unbelievable ski chase and a silly moment where Bond and co defuse a bomb while flying down a pipe (!). Thankfully a moment where helicopters with circular saws demolish Bond's car and a building makes up for these minor mishaps. The ending feels rushed but is pretty good too. Altogether, this is not the best Bond I've seen, and I'd rate it alongside something like THUNDERBALL.",The World Is Not Enough
3,SnoopyStyle,functional Bond movie and nothing more,6,26 November 2013,"Pierce Brosnan returns to play 007. This time, he faces terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle) who killed an oil tycoon in MI6 headquarters. Bond is sent to protect his heir Elektra King (Sophie Marceau). Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane) is a casino owner with questionable motives. Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) is a nuclear scientist decommissioning nukes. Bond must stop a dastardly plan from Renard.This is the contribution from British director Michael Apted to the Bond franchise. It has a lot of the trademarks of that franchise. It has the convoluted plot, sexy ladies, and exotic locations. What it doesn't have is anything new, unexpected, or original. It delivers just enough so that we can call this a Bond movie. Pierce Brosnan has never been one of the stronger Bonds. Robert Carlyle doesn't show up in the movie for the first half of the movie, and he isn't a memorable Bond villain. Sophie Marceau has the more juicy role. And Denise Richards has her boobs. The action isn't anything spectacular, and the final fight is too confused. The exotic locations are weakly exploited. It's a functional Bond movie and nothing more.",The World Is Not Enough
4,Horst_In_Translation,The fox in sheep's clothing,6,4 June 2020,"""The World Is Not Enough"" is a British/American co-production from 1999, so this one had its 20th anniversary last year and this is really, really a long time. This is the third of four James Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan, so only one more and he was gone and Craig took over, so this is also proof of how the franchise has not been extremely prolific in the last two decades. At easily over two hours, it is a rather long movie. They got a pretty prolific and experienced director for this film as Michael Apted has been active in the industry since the early 1960s already. I will spare you the names of the three writers (the fourth is Ian Fleming of course) as you can easily check them out for yourself if you want to, but I found it interesting how all three of them were really prolific with the 007 franchise. What surprised me even more is that two of them also worked on several Daniel Craig films several years later. This film is basically a combination of old and new. As for the old, there are some characters you are used to already if you have seen one or both previous Brosnan 007 films. This includes Judi Dench's M, Samantha Bond's Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn's Q. About Moneypenny, there is not too much to say here. I was just surprised to see that she was actually allowed inside the briefing room, maybe she is in fact more than a high-profile secretary. For Llewelyn it was the final of many Q performances. This was apparently clear beforehand already and that is why they got John Cleese in for a bit of a successor character and his role is a bit more on the funny side compared to the old Q. However, Cleese also only showed up for one more movie and his turn as the science expert ended at the same time as Brosnan's years as 007. They went with a young Q afterwards, Whishaw. But what I actually wanted to say is that I would have hoped for a better farewell to Llewelyn. This is one of his most forgettable efforts because of how the character was written. And finally, M. She has a bit of a personal story here, is even put behind bars by the bad guys surprisingly towards the end before Bond comes to the rescue.Bond is once again presumed dead by the way. It's not the first time it happens and definitely not the last time either. He always finds a way to make it back to the living though. Now, as for the new here: I already talked a bit about Cleese. I actually did not remember him at all although I have watched this film before. Shame on me. He was kinda fun and I think I would have preferred him to return for the Craig movies. If Llewelyn can play the part until his mid-80s, then Cleese sure wasn't too old. Oh well, wasn't meant to be. There are two really minor performances by European actors that caught my attention. Ulrich Thomsen is in it and so are two of my fellow Germans, namely Claude-Oliver Rudolph and Justus von Dohnányi, relatively famous actors here. Blink and they are gone though, reallly tiny roles. Robbie Coltrane has a bigger part and that one was a positive surprise. I like the actor and also his final deed how he saves Bond from that insane main antagonist was a smart inclusion. That was a unique torturing machine by the way. Garrote is the name. Really bizarre, but it was a good inclusion. These newer (Brosnan) films lack a bit of wit here and there and creativity to show us how Bond gets almost killed by different technological installations, which was always a big thing in the old movies (not just Goldfinger's laser), and most of the time he is just successfully getting away from gunfire (like the early, admittedly pretty spectacular, boat sequence) or explosions, so this old way of (almost) killing somebody was appreciated. They should have included this scene with her actually killing somebody.This was of course done by Sophie Marceau's character. She seems like a Bond girl and love interest early on, but she proves to be downright evil. In an older Bond movie, we had a similar background story with one female character's parents being killed by the villain and there was also a setup in terms of who the real antagonist was. But there it was not the daughter the way it is here. In a most convenient fashion though, they get in Denise Richards' character basically the moment that Bond suspects there is something wrong and not what it seems when it comes to Marceau's character. Marceau has received a fine reception for her portrayal overall while Richards got the exact opposite, took home awards for bad acting. That surprises me a bit I must admit. I mean she was not brilliant, but I did not think she was that horrible. Basically, these awards make her the worst Bond girl portrayal in history. A bit harsh for sure. The most positive reception here probably went to the song and I am glad about that. I like it. I don't know much about Garbage, but their track here makes me want to find out more about them. Again, I thought it was bit of a pity they did not use the tune throughout the movie anymore on other occasions (maybe just an instrumental version), but only at the beginning the way the title song is always used in Bond films. It carries the same name like the movie and this name is used on one specific occasion towards the end when we hear James say these exact words. Good inclusion there.Unfortunately, on other occasions this film had too much focus on action for my taste and, even if this is subjective, this is just not my favorite genre by any means. Maybe my least favorite in fact, so I did not appreciate it. And rarely these action sequences did a lot for me like very early on when the sequence up in the air mounts into the song or later on when Richards' character helps Bond get out of a hopeless scenario and he ""flies"" away like Tarzan with everything exploding behind him. That was alright. Another actor I haven't mentioned yet is Robert Carlyle in his career-defining performance maybe, certainly much better than in this long-running garbage (no pun intended) fairytale fantasy series. He was alright as Renard. Do you get the reference linked to the title of my review? It seemed early on as if his character was the main antagonist, but eventually he was ""only"" the no°1 henchman. I liked the idea that he could not feel any pain. I think he also would have been good enough to be indeed the main villain. But then again, he was more a man of his deeds and not one of strategy and politics, so I kinda agree Marceau's was the better choice. Also not unusual at all that the biggest henchman survives the main villain in the end and gets the final fight sequence. It was done like this in the old Bond films too. Still I felt that they did not make the most of his character and the henchmen in this film generally weren't exactly a quality achievement. The Russian dude (Coltrane) is still among the better, but then again he became a friend. However, that strong Black dude with the long dark hair was really entirely wasted. Pretty sad. And that is basically everybody there was.Overall, this is one of my least favorite Bond films, but as I love the franchise, I still give it a thumbs-up. Here and there, we have fun moments like when M watches not Bond as she thinks, but the two at the very end. Or the first meeting between these two with the doctor joke reference also put a smile on my lips. They came back to that with Bond indeed making a Christmas joke about her name at the very end, a pretty sexual joke, but I thought it was really funny and hilarious, for me personally by far the funniest moment from the entire movie. Of course, not all jokes were winners like the millennium bug reference also at the very end (even if I liked Cleese as I stated earlier), but it still is a bit of a nice exhibit of how the new millennium was really so much on people's minds back then that it even found its way into the new Bond movie that was released less than a month before New Year's Eve 1999. Oh my... how time flies! Okay, what else can I say here? I generally agree with those who say this is a rather weak Bond. Many think that Brosnan's time as 007 got worse with every movie made and there was a constant decline in quality with many hating the fourth and final film (partially because of Madonna). I myself remember really liking that one though. I will watch and review that one soon, so for me this third installment here is the weakest entry.Also in terms of cinematography, I was not exactly wowed for example by the scene in the snow that could have been much more stunning to watch. Then again, content-wise, it was already really forgettable. Oh yeah, snowy mountainsides are something you frequently find with Bond. Same is true about casino sequences and here we got one as well, even if it is really short and irrelevand and nothing compared to Casino Royale for example. Another reason why I did not like this one was the bad guy's/girl's motives. The whole idea about the pipeline, although at the end it makes more sense than earlier in the middle of the film. I just wish they would always try to burgle Fort Knox. I frequently struggle with the core ideas on the villains' minds. Not just here. Probably just me. However, I was slightly baffled by how Bond gunned her down so easily. Made very much sense though. She was at least as evil as the other bad guys. And letting her live or going easy on her would have been despicable gender discrimination. Okay, time to finish. Despite my negative criticisms and the fact that Brosnan is my least favorite 007 (although I like the actor in other projects), I give this film a positive recommendation. Sometimes I was not entirely sure, but it isn't too shabby and that last line was just a riot. Go see it, but not before you have seen most of the classics from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and probably also 2000s and 2010s. The 1990s were the weakest Bond decade. Turks may disagree because he saved them here. A cautious thumbs-up for ""The World Is Not Enough"".",The World Is Not Enough
5,classicsoncall,"""There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.""",6,7 January 2019,"I'd like to think I was paying attention pretty well but I was left confused with the story line more than once. Then I'd pick up the thread later on in the picture and began to wonder at what point I might have missed something. The action as usual is impossibly insane and over the top, and all I could do was shake my head at the idea that Denise Richards was cast here as a nuclear scientist. But at least it was good for some comic relief. The best thing I found to like about the movie was seeing how Q (Desmond Llewelyn) was breaking John Cleese in to become his replacement. As klutzy as he was here, Cleese managed to recover to become an effective 'Q' in ""Die Another Day"", while improving his position in the alphabet. All in all, this was not one of my favorite Bond's, although I am getting used to the idea that Pierce Brosnan might be the quintessential Double 0-7, with sincere apologies to Sean Connery.",The World Is Not Enough
6,gavin6942,A Bit Corny,6,28 August 2017,"James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) uncovers a nuclear plot when he protects an oil heiress from her former kidnapper, an international terrorist who can't feel pain.While I tend to like Brosnan as Bond (not saying he is the best one, but a darn fine one), and this movie hits all the right notes, it tends to be a bit corny. The smut jokes seem cheaper, and the inclusion of John Cleese is (appropriately) silly. The tone just feels off, despite it still being a generally well-made movie.One of the highlights for me, actually, is having Garbage (or is it just Shirley Manson?) perform the theme song. Being someone whose best years were in the late 90s, that really hits home for me and makes this somewhat nostalgic even if the film as a whole may not stand the test of time.",The World Is Not Enough
7,jboothmillard,The World Is Not Enough,8,12 September 2005,"This Bond film was not just the third of Pierce Brosnan's films, but also the Bond film made with Millennium based things in it, e.g. The Millennium Dome, the main girl being named Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) and mention of The Millennium Bug. Anyway, a kidnapper of wealthy daughter of Sir Robert King, Electra (Braveheart's Sophie Marceau) plans to do something to do with her oil pipeline, or is it more than that? Renard (The Full Monty's Robert Carlyle) meanwhile is trying to steal some sort of plutonium device to create a nuclear bomb, and the bad news is that Electra may be involved. Also starring Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky, Dame Judi Dench as M, Maria Grazia Cucinotta as the Cigar Girl, Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny, Michael Kitchen as Bill Tanner, Colin Salmon as Charles Robinson, Goldie as Bull, and the last appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q before he quit, and not long before his tragic car crash, John Cleese is his replacement, first called R.

8,ccthemovieman-1,Greatest Bond Opening Scene Ever,7,20 September 2006,"The last James Bond film of the 20th century began in spectacular fashion. Now, a lot of the Bond movies have great openings, so that's nothing new, but this one outdid itself. This 15-minute opening may be the best ever with an amazing boat race and opening credits. It gets my vote, anyway.After that, frankly, it slowly goes downhill. (That's the problem with too good a start!).In the end, it's okay but hardly a memorable Bond picture. It has the usual assortment of heroes and villains, wild and improbable action scenes, tons of sexual innuendos, sharp DVD picture and great 5.1surround sound. New actors to this series included Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards and Robbie Coltrane. None of them are big drawing cards who are going entice people to see the movie.I didn't find any of the characters particularly memorable, unfortunately, so I can't rate the film higher than a ""7,"" but that opening was a ""10.""",The World Is Not Enough
9,rmax304823,"Not Shaken, Not Stirred.",5,5 July 2011,"Every once in a while I try to check out a James Bond entry to see if there's anything new going on. After all, the first few had a certain panache back in the early 60s. It was known that JFK was an avid reader of Ian Fleming's novels. College kids were reading about James Bond. It was fresh stuff, a spy who was licensed to kill, given to high-end living, wisecracking under stress, faced with colorful masterminds who might be only half human, a babe under every arm, and sporting the comic cartoon handsome face of Sean Connery.I don't know where it all went, but it went alright. The essence remains the same but the accidents have changed. One handsome face followed another in the series. The Bond Girls with their funny names came and went before showing up in Playboy.The series raises some interesting and thoroughly researchable questions. How many desperate chases can be built in one or another setting around how many disparate modes of transportation? I use the term ""modes of transportation"" rather than ""vehicles"" because vehicle chases, even the least probably, are old fashioned. Cars, trucks, boats, airplanes -- they're all so yesterday. This one alone has skis, hang gliders, propeller-driven snowmobiles, parachutes, and I don't know what all -- none of which is usually thought of as a vehicle.The explosions are as big as ever, and so are the villain's ambitions. I think this one has something to do with building an oil pipeline through the Caucasus, avoiding centers of terrorism like Iran and Iraq. (This is 1999 we're talking about.) The villain is impervious to pain because he has a bullet in his brain -- his medulla oblongata in fact, which actually controls not sensation but blood pressure, breathing, and other low-level functions. Not that it matters. I mean, the guy can hold a red hot stone in his hand.Sophie Marceau, a pretty young thing, provides the love interest, all glamorized and impeccable. Denise Richards provides the pulchritude. With her dark eyebrows and plump lips she looks made for James Bond movies.There's no actual point in going into details of the plot. The story isn't that different from any of the other Bond movies except in its setting. In this case it includes the majestic Alps and some highly unlikely slopes down which Pierce Brosnan and Sophie Marceau glide. I wouldn't have skied down those slopes. I would have taken a photo of them and left them glistening under the cloudless, high-altitude sun. The hang-gliding snowmobiles that shortly appear in order to shoot the two skiers full of holes are all colored black and are a fornication upon that pristine landscape.I was barely interested. I tuned out before the end. Best scene: Denise Richards slips out of her Hazmat suit and wears only a tank top and shorts and has a brief exchange in Russian with Bond. Otherwise, what we have here is another endless variation on a possible series of infinite permutations.",The World Is Not Enough
10,Tweekums,Fun but forgettable Bond,7,17 April 2014,"In the opening scenes Bond recovers a quantity of money but when it is returned to tycoon Sir Robert King it explodes and kills him. Chief suspect is psychotic terrorist Renard; who had previously kidnapped King's daughter Elektra. She had managed to escape but Bond is convinced that she is still in danger. Having taken over her father's business, Elektra is in Azerbaijan when Bond catches up with her and it isn't long before an attempt is made on her life by attackers using para-gliders which bear the markings of a Russian security agency. A consultation with former KGB officer Valentin Zukovsky, previously seen in 'Goldeneye' leads him to an old Soviet missile site in Kazakhstan where weapons are being decommissioned. Here he finally meets Renard before he can escape with a stolen warhead. He also meets up with scientist Dr Christmas Jones who joins Bond to hunt down the weapon before Renard can detonate it and engineer an oil crisis.This is a fairly average Bond film but even average Bond is quite entertaining. The story is obviously far-fetched but it is still entertaining and has a good twist part way thorough. As one would expect there is plenty of fairly spectacular action; the best being when the para-gliders attacked Bond and Elektra as they were skiing Bond films do seem to like featuring great action scenes on the ski slopes! The pre-title boat chase is also pretty spectacular. Robert Carlyle was quite menacing as Renard although he is nowhere near as frightening as when he played Begby in 'Trainspotting'. By this, his third film as Bond, Pierce Brosnan is clearly comfortable in the role and does a decent job even if by this point in the series the character has become a bit of a caricature. Sophie Marceau makes Elektra an interesting and seductive character but I couldn't believe in Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist this is largely the fault of the costume department she may look great in a tight singlet and hotpants but she doesn't look like a nuclear expert! Overall this is a fun but ultimately forgettable Bond film; worth watching but by no means a classic.",The World Is Not Enough

Prime suspect is kidnapper Renard (Robert Carlyle), whose failed abduction of Sir Robert's daughter Elektra (Sophie Marceau) left him with a bullet in his brain and a score to settle.Hard to believe it, but the Brosnan Bond series gets even worse with this dreadful entry that features one of the dullest plots ever (oil pipeline....yadda yadda....kidnap...yadda yadda....nuclear bomb...yadda yadda), a couple of forgettable villains in the form of Marceau's oil heiress Elektra King and Carlyle's infatuated kidnapper Renard, and—in perhaps the most far-fetched thing you will probably ever see in a Bond movie—wooden beauty Denise Richards as vest-and-hot-pant-wearing nuclear physicist Christmas Jones!A few well executed action sequences just about make this one worth a go, the pre-credits chase being full of great boat stunts and the caviar factory/helicopter saw scene packing in plenty of destruction and mayhem. The supposedly exciting finale, however, is a complete mess—precisely what is happening at any one time is anyone's guess as Bond and Jones press random buttons in a flooding sub while Renard attempts to load nuclear rods into the reactor.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb.",The World Is Not Enough

Great fun, as long as you can follow the plot and action (which if you are a Bond fan would be a snap).  One of the best bond films and action films of the year.

And oh yeah - deal with Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards).This was a Bond movie with many potential titles, such as Bond 2000, Death Waits for No Man, Fire and Ice, Pressure Point and Dangerously Yours. The final title is based on Alexander the Great's epitaph ""Orbis non sufficit,"" which is the Bond family motto.Robbie Coltrane returns from GoldenEye - his office is covered with cheesecake photos of former Bond girls - and Desmond Llewelyn, who died in a car accident not long after the film's premiere, appears for the last time as Q. He's shown training his successor, who is jokingly referred to as R and played by John Cleese.Joe Dante and Peter Jackson, were initially offered the opportunity to direct this one.

14,studioAT,Not great Mr.Bond,2,12 November 2015,"The world is not enough opens with a great pre title sequence that while going on too long is one of the best of the series. However after that (and a dire opening song) the film for me never recovers.The plot is wafer thin in places and then too chaotic the next. Bond spends half the time running around or making overly lewd sexual comments.We are blessed with a stellar secondary cast this time around though (after the so-so line up for Tomorrow Never Dies) with Judi Dench getting more to do and both Robbie Coltrane and Robert Carlyle on top form. In Sophie Marceau we also get a very attractive Bond girl and I didn't find Denise Richards half as bad as some reviews state.However I didn't enjoy this film that much, purely because there were lots of bells and whistles, but not that much of a decent story.",The World Is Not Enough

17,hitchcockthelegend,Revenge is not hard to fathom for a man who believes in nothing.,7,5 August 2012,"The World is Not Enough is directed by Michael Apted and adapted to screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein, using characters created by Ian Fleming. Music is scored by David Arnold and cinematography by Adrian Biddle.Bond 19 and 007 is required to protect a female oil magnate from potential assassination, but it soon becomes apparent that something far bigger and sinister is around the corner.Pierce Brosnan returns for his third turn as super suave secret agent James Bond and all the crucial elements for the franchise are firmly in place. From the exhilarating pre-credit sequence down the river Thames (14 minutes worth) to the glorious over the top explosive finale, this is a Bond film for those that enjoy the cheeky action led mania over thought and depth. Into the Bondian mix are the usual stalwarts; Judi Dench as M, Samantha Bond as Moneypenny, Desmond Llewelyn as Q (bidding a sad farewell to the franchise with a poignant moment) and Robbie Coltrane joyously returns as Zukovsky. Bond girl duties fall to Sophie Marceau (beautiful and solid) and Denise Richards (sexy, elfin like, but out of her depth) and the psycho for hire role lands at the considerably fine feet of Robert Carlyle, even if the latter is badly underused.The World Is Not Enough (the Bond family motto) is a whizz bang entry in the series and finds Brosnan well settled in the role; nailing the multitude of traits that make Bond a man that women want to bed and a man that men want to be. Locales are lovely and interesting (Turkey, France, Spain, Azerbaijan), the plot carries some intelligence (with a decent mystery element for a change), characterisations are high end and Arnold's score is a safe accompaniment; as is the title song by Garbage. It is, however, all too aware of wanting to appease Bond fans across the spectrum. Thus the comedy moments come off as saggy and the more scientific aspects (as gloriously ridiculous as they are) feel more like auto-pilot plotting. Still, you get what you pay for with 90s Bond, and the action sequences are terrific. After the mixed Tomorrow Never Dies the makers were clearly intent on taking the fans on a ripper of a ride, and no doubt about it, they achieve that in spades; with the two hour running time just flying by.Eon of course would take things one step too far three years later with the nadir that was Die Another Day, thus making this the last good Bond film before Daniel Craig's fabulous re-invention arrived in 2006. 7/10",The World Is Not Enough
18,Theo Robertson,Fairly Poor Bond Film,5,4 February 2003,"TWINE opens with a terribly overproduced action sequence of a boat chase that goes on and on and on . It`s not thrilling , it`s not clever but most of all it`s not entertaining in the slightest . I want to tell the producers of the Bond franchise that BIG does not always equal good . A gritty adventure like DR NO , or a film that makes Bond more vulnerable like GOLDFINGER or an attempt at character development like LICENCE TO KILL or GOLDENEYE make far better Bond films than a stunt fest like MOONRAKER . Oh and cut back on lines like "" Would you like to check my figures "" or the awful pun at the end because they pull the film back down to the Roger Moore era  My main gripe about TWINE is the cast who deserve a tirade of abuse for such disappointing performances especially Robert Carlyle . In the late 1990s Carlyle had replaced Sean Connery as god in Scotland and it`s not too much of an exaggeration to say the whole country was looking forward to his role as Renard , but he`s very poor here as a Bond nasty . His accent and mannerism just doesn`t feel right and he comes close to parody . Worst of all it becomes obvious Carlyle has only been reading the scenes in the script that he appears in . Remember that Renard is a man who can feel no pain ? Well notice his fight scenes with Bond where he gives a pained expression after  getting hit ! Also very shabby of the director not to notice this and edit these bits out . Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist ! Yeah right . And how many films have you seen which have had John Cleese being as unfunny as he is here ?I was going to say this was by far the worst Brosnan Bond film but I haven`t seen DIE ANOTHER DAY yet . I did notice however that TOMORROW NEVER LIES wasn`t as good as GOLDENEYE but was much better than TWINE . I hope we`re not seeing a series where each succeding film is worst than the last",The World Is Not Enough
19,preppy-3,Silly but enjoyable,7,8 December 1999,"The plot's forgettable, the acting (except for Brosnan) pretty bad and the dialogue is laughable (favorite line: ""I don't know what a madman wants to do with a gallon (or something) of plutonium, but it doesn't sound good!). Still, I was never bored!  These Bond films are escapism--pure and simple. This one offers nothing new, but Brosnan is very comfortable in the role of Bond (still, he's no Sean Connery!) and things move at a fast pace.  I've already forgotten the plot (not that the plots of Bond movies are memorable!) but this is a movie to just sit back for two hours, turn off your brain and enjoy a big amount of action and explosions, and whatever.

20,LeonLouisRicci,High Gloss & Low Expectations Keep James Bond a Box-Office Winner,7,25 April 2017,"After a Promising Start, the Pierce Brosnan's James Bond Series of Four Films Never got Great and seemed to Tread Formulaic Water.

Her Skills as an Emoting Thespian Never come close to the Accented Cuteness. Robert Carlyle is the Villain and is OK but is Far from a Great Bond Nemesis. Robbie Coltrane makes a Return Appearance and Fills the Frame in a Few Scenes.Overall, the New Millennium Welcomed Bond with High Box Office and a Measured Reluctant Acceptance of the Franchise Moving Forward with High-Gloss Mediocrity Rewarded as Expectations became Less and Less as the 40 Year Franchise Soldiered On.",The World Is Not Enough
21,lastliberal,I thought Christmas only comes once a year.,7,9 May 2007,"Some consider Goldeneye as the only Brosnan film worthy of acclaim. Others felt that The World is not Enough was his best film. And there are a few who are willing to give that honor to this film.While Brosnan and Sophie Marceau light up the film, there are some that think that he is really the supporting actor here. And there are many who believe that Brosnan and Denise Richards make a lousy couple.Marceau stands out as a romantic actress, not an action hero. She was Princess Isabelle in Braveheart and she shines in the French films La Fidélité and Chouans!. So, it is natural that Bond would fall in love with her - who wouldn't? Now Denise Richards (Christmas Jones) is the action star, with credential from Wild Things to prove it. Hoever, she is compared to Jill St. John and Tanya Roberts as one of the worst actresses ever to appear in Bond films.The pre-credit sequence is probably the best ever done. The World is Not Enough theme song done by Garbage is outstanding.Bottom Line: there is no bad Brosnan film.",The World Is Not Enough
22,zardoz-13,"A Top-Notch Thrillathon of Bullets, Babes, Bad guys, and Bond, James Bond!",10,21 March 2008,"The 19th installment in the James Bond film franchise ""The World Is Not Enough"" looks poised and muscular enough to renew the famous British secret service agent's license to kill for the next century. In the right hands, this predictable but dependable formula of sex, violence, witty dialogue, elaborate plotting, and epic villainy rarely misses. Comparatively, ""The World Is Not Enough"" shares the spirit of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and ""Octopussy."" All Bond movies are alike, of course, but this escapade differs in its gallery of villains, its serpentine plotting, and its elegant but aggressive verve. The imaginative screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Bruce Feirstein features dramatic bedrock. Although the filmmakers have dispersed the usual spectacular special effects and high octane action stunts throughout ""TWINE,"" strong, solid characters and an interesting plot are what hold this actioneer together. Unlike the sinewy ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" ""Twine"" unfolds with a seamless grace instead of as a string of impressive episodes lashed together by an acrobatic plot. Happily, story takes precedence here. If you're not careful, the surprises may actually catch you by surprise.Naturally, the villains operate on a grand scale. For the record, ""TWINE"" weaves a mysterious web about nuclear terrorists out to destroy an unfinished oil pipeline across Western Asia to Istanbul. First, they blow-up petroleum tycoon Sir Robert King (David Calder of TV's sci-fi series ""Star Cops"") right under 007's nose in an explosive assassination in the heart of MI 6's headquarters in London. Second, they go gunning for Sir Robert's gorgeous daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau). Initially, M (Judi Dench) doesn't want James Bond protecting Elektra because he injured himself during a hot pursuit of the assassin who killed Sir Robert. Bond seduces the spy agency doctor and receives a clean bill of health, so M reluctantly assigns a vengeful 007 to serve as Elektra's bodyguard. The assassins appear in droves. Bond still nurses a dislocated collarbone from his first bout with these brigands in the dazzling pre-credit action sequence. The boat chase that occurs down the Thames near MI 6 HQ after Sir Robert is blown to bits gets ""TWINE"" off to a rip-roaring start. 007 steers a special mini-rocket powered speed boat that allows him to turn aerial flips and submerge to avoid hitting water barriers. He tries to capture the murderous hit lady, but she commits suicide in a hot air balloon while Bond dangles beneath her on a tether. Putting a bullet into one of the balloon's propulsion canisters, she atomizes herself. Bond falls and dislocates his collarbone when he bounces off the roof of a building. This physical flaw lends his 007 a modicum of vulnerability and something for the wily villains to exploit. Meanwhile, as 007's ruthless opponent, Reynard (Robert Carlyle of ""The Full Monty"") has survived a prior execution attempt by MI 6. Apparently, 009 put a bullet in Reynard's brain, but the resilient bad guy keeps on going. The slug severed Reynard's nerves, so he feels no pain and grows stronger than ever! Reynard plans to steal a nuclear device and smuggle it on board a Russian submarine as a part of his diabolical plot. Robbie Coltrane, who first appeared in ""GoldenEye"" as the hefty criminal mastermind Valentin Zukovsky, returns as the same character in a much larger, more forceful role.The action scenes are better than ever, and Bond finds himself in some truly tough spots. The snow chase where a squadron of parahawks, parachute sailing boats with skis equipped with machine guns, attack 007 is the stuff of which adrenalin is made. At one point, Bond uses one of his tricks from ""OHMSS"" to fool the villains and send them over the snow cliff. In another scene, helicopters equipped with huge buzz saws that can slice through metal objects like a blow-torch through butter come after our hero.Director Michael (""Gorillas in the Mist"") Apt gives everybody in ""TWINE"" a chance to display their thespian talents. Pierce Brosnan shows why he is still playing Bond. He brings even greater depth and presence to the role than he did in his first two outings. Brosnan has developed a signature gesture for his James Bond that he employed with great success in ""GoldenEye"" during the tank chase. At the appropriate moment, the dapper 007 adjusts the knot of his tie at this throat. Indeed, Bond tangles with a tough, vicious bunch, but his ability to improvise gives him an edge. These villains give Bond a real run for his money.As the evil Reynard, Carlyle resembles Darth Vader with his helmet removed, but this gifted English actor invests his villain with more emotional resonance than the usual Bond baddie. Because he is slowly dying from the bullet in this brain, Reynard fears nobody and nothing. Meanwhile, Sophie Marceau excels as Bond's shady leading lady. Electra King has more strength and substance than the typical Bond girl. As James Bond's girl Friday, Denise Richards continues the trend begun in ""GoldenEye"" that the women are not only good looking but intelligent. Dr. Christmas Jones, a high level nuclear weapons expert, helps Bond out of a tight scrape or two. The best news is that the story gives Judi Dench her biggest role as M. She makes the most of her first opportunity to venture out of her inner sanctum into the dangerous world of 007.""The World Is Not Enough"" qualifies as a top-notch thrillathon of bullets, babes, bad guys, and Bond, James Bond!",The World Is Not Enough
23,neil-476,A good Brosnan Bond,8,9 September 2012,"Bond carries out an errand for M which has a tragic end when her friend oil magnate Robert King is killed by explosives planted in the money Bond recovered on his behalf in connection with his daughter Elektra's kidnapping. It is feared that the kidnapping, from which Elextra escapes on her own, is by terrorist Renard (who is dying due to a bullet, shot by Bond, lodged in his brain and gradually shutting down his senses). Bond travels to Elektra's oil pipeline base in Azerbaijan: as well as being somewhat taken by Elektra, he also encounters busty short shorts-wearing physicist Christmas Jones...The third of the Brosnan Bonds benefits from having a plot which (mostly) makes sense and is somewhat more credible than usual, an interesting and unusual villain in Robert Carlyle's Renard, and an attractive, textured and conflicted character in Sophie Marceau's Elektra.Of course, in the largely unnecessary Christmas Jones it also has a character who ranks high on the not-inconsiderable list of Most Preposterously Named Bond Girls....",The World Is Not Enough

True to form ""James Bond"" (Pierce Brosnan) does indeed recover the money only to have it explode when presented and killing Sir Robert King in the process. Fearing that Elektra might be the next victim, James Bond is then sent to protect her but what he doesn't realize is just how extensive Renard's organization is and the actual agenda he has in place which goes well beyond simple kidnapping or revenge. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a well-polished espionage film which had a fair amount of intrigue and a lot of action as well. Possibly too much action and not enough suspense in my opinion--but such is the way the film industry has evolved with pyrotechnics and chase scenes having become a requirement for unimaginative directors these days. Be that as it may, Pierce Brosnan performed quite well as James Bond and this was still an entertaining film--in spite of the somewhat routine direction mentioned previously-and I have rated it accordingly.",The World Is Not Enough

Pierce Brosnan's third outing as Bond and his best moment arrives in a vital scene where he is faced with the possibility of shooting a woman. Marceau is a wonderful in a mysterious role. Denise Richards as Jones is a terrible miscast that nearly sabotages the whole film.

While, Sophie Marceau pretty much takes up the role of both of these to a degree and incredibly alluring, it's a bit of a mess.

27,HotToastyRag,A bit spooky,7,1 March 2021,"In The World Is Not Enough, James Bond has to protect an heiress whose father has just been assassinated by a massive bad guy with his eye on world destruction via oil pipelines. Sounds spooky, doesn't it? This one is pretty creepy, but it is wildly entertaining, just like all the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. Robert Carlyle is the bad guy (yes, that's really him under the skull cap), and his nerve endings are failing him. Do you think he might cut his hand with broken glass to creep out the audience? Do you think Sophie Marceau (the heiress) might have some creepy trauma connected with her past? There's also a pretty scary scene where Denise Richards is trapped as water gushes in, but it might not frighten anyone unless they're afraid of water, like I am.So while The World Is Not Enough is a little scary, there are also fun parts. Like the ""Pierce Brosnan jacket"" that turns into a puffy, indestructible igloo that can survive an avalanche. And the character name of Denise Richards: Dr. Christmas, setting up a ridiculous pun at the end of the movie. My all-time favorite is GoldenEye, but my brother's favorite is The World Is Not Enough. He was totally in love with Denise Richards when he was a teenager, so I think we went to the theaters more than once in 1999.

28,Aaron1375,Bond does things a bit more differently this go around.,8,1 November 2010,"This Bond film was certainly a step up from ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", as this Bond film did some things differently than other films in the very long running series. It also does some things the same as ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", in that this film and that one have two of the weakest Bond girls ever to be on film. Halle Berry was not all that good a Bond Girl, but she was aces compared to Denise Richards. I am sorry, she just does not have a Bond feel to her, though she is marginally better than Teri Hatcher from the previous film. Neither of these girls just seem like they belong in a James Bond movie. Not to fear, Sophie Marceau is more than capable of being in a Bond movie, Robert Carlyle is also a good albeit underdeveloped villain. The inclusion of M into the storyline was inspired as Judi Dench is great and it is nice to see her take a larger role in the movie. The action is superb and it was interesting to have Bond injured in the pre-credit sequence. The film threw a curve ball or two as well, and this one would not get quite as over the top as the next movie ""Die Another Day"", though I kind of enjoyed that films over the top feel. The cast here is good, with the exception of the horribly cast Richards, the plot interesting and the action good. It does run a bit long and one part of the film reminded me a bit to much of a scene from ""Broken Arrow"", however overall I found this entry into the James Bond franchise a solid winner.",The World Is Not Enough

Other highlights include a paraglider-snowmobile assault in the snowy mountains, underground mayhem at the ICBM base in Kazakhstan, a wild sequence inside a pipeline to deactivate a bomb and a thrilling climax in the Bosphorus strait near Istanbul.Many complain about Denise Richards as the nuclear physicist, Dr. Christmas Jones, but she does a fine job and looks great, especially in those short shorts at the ICBM base in the high desert. Meanwhile Sophie Marceau as Elektra King is alluring in a classy way. Also on hand in the feminine department are Maria Grazia Cucinotta as the opening femme fatale, Serena Scott Thomas as Dr. Molly Warmflash and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny. Judi Dench of course returns as 'M.'This is a competent Bond flick with all the requisite staples; it's just kinda unmemorable in the grand scheme of the franchise.

30,The_Void,Disappointing third outing for Brosnan's Bond,8,20 December 2006,"Well, I'm not the biggest Bond fan at the best of times - and unfortunately, The World is Not Enough cannot be considered 'the best of times' for the enduring series of films. Pierce Brosnan isn't my favourite actor to take the central role of James Bond, and on the whole - the quality of the films Brosnan has starred isn't very high. The World is Not Enough is probably the worst of the four films that Brosnan made - and that's actually a shame as with some better storytelling, the plot could have been made interesting and there is certainly enough here to spring an exciting thriller from. The plot centres on oil, and oil tycoon Sir Robert King. King is unfortunately killed during a bombing at MI6 headquarters and Bond is sent to protect his daughter, Electra, from harm. Around the same time, it emerges that terrorist Renard seems to have something to do with the assassination of Robert King - and Renard isn't your average sort of guy, as the bullet in his brain means that his senses are shutting down - and he's getting stronger all the time. The further in Bond gets, the more the plot thickens...The Bond villains are a big part of the series, and this one has to be respected for 'Renard' - aside from the fact that his character is more than a little bit silly, he does at least make a good villain - all the better for the fact that he is played by Robert Carlyle. There's a few other villains thrown into the mix too, but none of the rest are particularly interesting - and that's where the film falls down. Denise Richards is the Bond girl this time around, but director Michael Apted doesn't seem too bothered about that side of the story as she is completely underused and is more memorable for her silly name (Christmas Jones) than any scene she's in. There is a number of big stunts that feature in the film, and this ensures that the disappointment mounts more as despite the fact that most of them are heavy on explosions etc - there isn't one that I'm going to remember by this time next month, so it just seems like a big waste of money. The film features one of the best title sequences in Bond history, mostly thanks to the song by Garbage - but unfortunately, the film itself doesn't live up to that opening, and The World is Not Enough, is not enough.",The World Is Not Enough
31,mm-39,Bronson finally gets it right,8,26 January 2002,"Well, better than the last 2, and the last one was a step backwards.  The humor, charm, and seriousness Bronson portrays, melds into a combination that creates the Bond character.  The story is strong, but no one would survive an explosion in a pipeline.  The shockwave would be too great, but its Bond anyways.  The lead bad guy plays a great role, but Denise Richards get across more like a dingbat, then a nuclear physicist, when she delivers her scientific line.  She's there for fluff.  Not a bad story, or cast, and Bond actually acts as him, a turn in the right direction",The World Is Not Enough
32,Mr-Fusion,Stale,5,12 November 2015,"Here's why I've never put much stock in the Brosnan era: We got one great movie, two flavorless action flicks and it all ended on a series low point. I liked him as Bond, but one for four is no way to go out.""The World Is Not Enough"" runs on the same auto-pilot as the previous movie - same stock ingredients - and it's not nearly as exciting as it was back in '99. It moves from one setpiece to the next with filler in between. The filmmakers flirted with shaking things up (remember the fan outcry when word got out that Bond would be injured?), but after an x-ray, he's back to business as usual.I will say this: the entertainment value spiked when Denise Richards showed up. Not because of boobs, but because she's jarringly awful. And working alongside her more skilled fellow actors somehow (I'm not sure how) actually spices up the professional but bland soup. It's completely illogical how a weak link like this can make things better, but there it is.5/10",The World Is Not Enough
33,SimonJack,More intrigue than most Bond thrillers,9,17 March 2018,"As a mystery, ""The World is Not Enough"" is one of the best movies based on Ian Fleming's Agent 007 of England's Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6. This film has plenty of intrigue that the audience isn't aware even exists in the first third of the film. About midway, one begins to suspect that there's something not yet known about the bad guys. And the last one quarter to one third brings the mystery out into the light.This is one heck of a James Bond Thriller. There are a number of unusual aspects in this film. More than the usual amount of scenarios take place outside of the glamour and glitter of big cities, fancy digs and party places. Filming locations included Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Spain, France, England, Wales, Scotland and the Bahamas.And, true to the form of the James Bond series, some new and different sources of mayhem are introduced in this film. The most gruesome of these is a helicopter tree saw. It's more ferocious than any pictures I've seen of such equipment. I don't know where modern writers come up with these ideas, but I doubt that Ian Fleming would have written about such a ""weapon"" in his mid-20th century novels.John Cleese joins the Bond ""family,"" introduced as ""R,"" to be the eventual successor to ""Q."" The aging Q has been played for several films by Desmond Llewelyn, who was 85 years old when this film was made. He died the same year. Cleese, of course, is no spring chicken, coming on board at age 60. But one can see a different comedy wrinkle he can add, continuing on as the new ""Q.""I marked this for possible spoilers just for tipping folks off that there's more intrigue about who the real culprit is in this film. But, I won't divulge who or what happens in the plot. Here are some favorite lines in this film.Q, ""Now pay attention double O seven. I've always tried to teach you two things. First, never let them see you bleed."" James Bond, ""And the second?"" ""Always have an escape plan."" He slowly descends.Elektra King, ""There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.""M, ""If there's even the slightest chance, Bond will survive.

34,ShadeGrenade,"""Never let them see you bleed, always have an escape plan!""",9,17 June 2012,"Time flies, eh? It seems like only yesterday that Pierce Brosnan was 'James Bond' ( in fact, 'Die Another Day' was ten years ago ). With 'Goldeneye', the handsome Irish actor established himself as the screen's most popular 007 since Roger Moore. 'The World Is Not Enough' was his third ( and, as it turned out, penultimate ) outing, and a strong entry it is too. The title is Bond's family motto ( first revealed in 'O.H.M.S.S.' ). The movie gets off to a cracking start with the murder of oil tycoon 'Sir Rodney King' ( David Calder ) at M16 Headquarters, London. Bond chases the assassin ( Maria Grazia Cucinotta ) in one of Q's inventions - a souped-up speedboat - along the Thames, in a sequence which outdoes the similar one in 'Live & Let Die' ( and this is before the titles! ). Michael Heseltine's Millennium Dome puts in an appearance ( remember how the Murdoch press worked like stink to brand it a flop even before it opened? How satisfying it is now to see the same Murdoch getting similar treatment! ) Fearing an attempt will be made on the life of King's daughter 'Elektra' ( the stunning Sophie Marceau ), M assigns Bond to be her bodyguard. After her is anarchist 'Renard' ( Robert Carlyle ), who has a bullet lodged in his brain. He is slowly dying, but is impervious to pain, making him one of 007's more dangerous adversaries. Some stunning set pieces including a para-hawk ambush in the Caucas Mountains, a helicopter-mounted buzz-saw pursuit in a caviar factory belonging to 'Valentin Zukovsky' ( Robbie Coltrane, in his second appearance in the role since 'Goldeneye' ), and finally, a struggle in a sinking submarine. There is a 'View To A Kill' feel to the whole thing ( especially when we learn that the villain wants to nuke the oil pipeline in the Bosphorus so as to make Elektra the number one oil supplier. Very reminiscent of Max Zorin's plan in that earlier movie ). Brosnan is great; one wishes he had done more than four movies. The weak link in the cast is Denise Richards as 'Dr.Christmas Jones' - she is beautiful but hopelessly unconvincing. John Cleese appears as 'R', Q's bumbling assistant. Intended to be a regular, he was ditched after Brosnan left.Michael Apted, the director, was not generally known for action movies, keeps it all bubbling away nicely. The title song by David Arnold and Don Black is okay, but needed someone like Shirley Bassey to do it justice. The group 'Garbage' sadly lived up to their name.The film's release was unfortunately overshadowed by the tragic news of Desmond Llewelyn's death. The much-loved actor had played the tetchy 'Q' ever since 'From Russia With Love' ( 1963 ). It is heartbreaking now to watch his final scene; as he doles out advice to Bond, he descends slowly into the floor, never to be seen again. Bonds may come and go, but there can surely be only one 'Q'.",The World Is Not Enough
35,JamesHitchcock,"Well, at least the Millennium Dome has some use",7,28 August 2007,"Two important elements in the success of any Bond movie are the calibre of the Bond girl and the main villain. Where both are good, such as Honor Blackman and Gerd Frobe in ""Goldfinger"", the result can be a classic. Where both are weak, as with Tania Roberts and Christopher Walken in ""A View to a Kill"", the result can be a very disappointing film (although, to be fair, Roger Moore's performance in that film was also very much below par).""The World Is Not Enough"" (the title is taken from the Bond family motto) takes the unusual step of combining Bond Girl and villain in one person. There have been female villains in previous episodes, even glamorous ones such as Naomi in ""The Spy who Loved Me"", but they have been relatively minor characters, subordinate to a male criminal mastermind, generally middle-aged or elderly. There is normally no doubt about which side the male villain is on (although ""For Your Eyes Only"" may be an exception in this respect); nobody familiar with the conventions of the series will be surprised when, say, Drax in ""Moonraker"" or Naomi's boss Stromberg turns out to be the bad guy.Sophie Marceau's Elektra King, however, is the first principal villain who is young, female and beautiful. Moreover, for much of the film we do not perceive her as a villain at all. She is the daughter of a prominent oil tycoon who inherits his business after he is murdered at the beginning of the film, and we are initially led to believe that the mainspring of the plot will be Bond's attempts to protect her against Renard, the ruthless international terrorist who was responsible for her father's death and who is threatening to blow up her pipeline which connects the Caspian oilfields to the West. Only later do we realise that Elektra and Renard are actually in league with one another and that she has an even more sinister plot in mind.Given that Elektra effectively combines roles that in most Bond films would be played by two different actors, it is fortunate that the lovely Marceau copes so well with the burden placed upon her, making her character both detestable and desirable. (Although Elektra is half British and half Azerbaijani, Marceau herself is from France, a country that has provided three other lovely and talented Bond girls in Claudine Auger, Carole Bouquet and Eva Green).To even up the balance, a more conventional ""good girl"" love interest has to be provided for Bond in the shape of Denise Richards who plays nuclear physicist Dr Christmas Jones. Although Richards is as attractive as Marceau, she is unfortunately much less talented, and proves to be the weakest Bond girl since Roberts. She is never convincing as a scientist, not because of her looks (contrary to what some might think, there is no genetic link between beauty and stupidity) but because of her weak acting; whenever she has to discuss anything technical it is all too obvious that she has no idea what she is talking about and is simply repeating lines learned by rote.Another feature of ""The World Is Not Enough"" is that it appears to be less of an extended advert for the travel industry than most Bond films. Although Istanbul (famously featured in ""From Russia with Love"") makes another appearance, most of the locations- the industrial city of Bilbao, London's East End, the Caucasian oilfields- are not the sort of glamorous tourist destinations featured in most films in the series. There is a particularly good opening sequence in which Bond takes part in a thrilling speedboat chase along the Thames and in which the Millennium Dome makes its first screen appearance. (It is a pity that M's line ""Well, at least the Millennium Dome has some use"" was cut, although admittedly we did not realise in 1999 what a massive white elephant the Dome would prove to be the following year). There is also a chase scene involving snow and skiing- something that has perhaps become an over-familiar cliché in Bond movies. Pierce Brosnan is as assured and capable as ever in the main role, and there are some good supporting performances from Judi Dench as his boss ""M"" and Robbie Coltrane as the dodgy Russian businessman Zukovsky (who also appears in ""Goldeneye""). This film marked the last appearance of Desmond Llewellyn as the eccentric scientist ""Q"" and the first appearance of his successor ""R"", played by John Cleese as a sort of hi-tech Basil Fawlty. Denise Richards apart, this is one of the better Bond films, with an excellent balance of excitement, humour and glamour, and probably Brosnan's best together with ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". 7/10",The World Is Not Enough
36,MovieAddict2016,Danger. Suspense. Excitement. Not This Time.,5,26 March 2003,"The World is Not EnoughI have tried to sit through this Bond film multiple times, and I only did so the first time I viewed it. I figure that you should stick with a movie, through good times and bad. First of all, I don't like wasting money on something. Secondly, I like to see it all just to say I saw it. Third of all, I see it all so I can review it.So I sat through this film the first time, but it was painful the second and third, and I found myself going over to the computer and typing up some reviews instead. The movie isn't all that bad in the beginning, other than having a few outrageous stunts (even for a Bond film), but it's from the midway on that bores me. It just becomes dull.This Bond outing features Pierce Brosnan going after some baddies bent on doing something somewhere, for some reason or another. All I could make out was that there is a guy with a bullet in his brain that slowly eats away his ""pain receptors,"" making him ""immune to pain."" That is the excuse for an indestructible bad guy who stands a chance against Bond.Bond teams up with Sophie Marceau to track down the bad guy, but soon finds himself with Bond Girl Denise Richards, playing Christmas Jones: Short pants, tight shirt covering big breasts, and big lips. Oh, yeah: She's a nuclear chemist out in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of other chemists--all stupid men that dress decently and actually look like someone who would have gone through years of chemistry instead of vogue class. Now, I can accept beautiful women in most Bond films: It's the franchise's strongest trait. Or one of the strongest traits. But having Denise Richards play a nuclear chemist is beyond belief: It's truly laughable!Pierce Brosnan once again proves to be a great Bond runner-up: I'll be saddened when he stops playing the character. But hey, he's in his fifties--let's be thankful he even lasted through one of the films much less 1...2...3...4...etc...Sophie Marceau is nice as a Bond girl, but she is wasted at the sight of Denise Richards, who does not even know the meaning of acting, much less contain the charisma to become a Bond girl. Not that she's a horrible actress, but you have to see her in this movie to understand where I'm coming from.This is probably one of the worst Bond films I've seen. My favorites include: ""Goldfinger,"" ""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia with Love,"" ""Moonraker,"" ""Goldeneye"" and a few others. If you like any of those Bond films, I suggest you stay away from this painful excuse for a Bond film.The first half is pretty good, but the last half is miserably slow-paced. I always turn it off half way through. I suggest you do, as well.Perhaps the only other point of seeing this film is to say a fond farewell to Q played by Desmond Llewelyn (1914-1999). By the way, John Cleese takes over Q's position as R. Unfortunately, not even he can save this film.
2/5 stars -John Ulmer",The World Is Not Enough
37,KineticSeoul,It's a solid Bond film,8,18 February 2016,"When I was a kid ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was my favorite Bond film that had Pierce Brosnan in it. But my perspective changed after growing a bit older. This is actually a solid Bond movie and I just don't get why it got quite a bit of hate from reviewers. The pacing and direction is actually quite fun. It's a fun popcorn action flick that is fast- paced for the most part and has a story that is good enough to make it a solid entry. I am not quite sure of Denise Richards playing a nuclear physicist and one of the Bond girls. But she didn't bother me, I think she gets quite a bit of hate because she just doesn't seem like a nuclear physicist because of the way she talks and dresses. Denise Richards to me is basically one of the scientist or physicist that are in comic books. Betty Swanson from the Deadpool comics being one of them. Plus she was a nice eye candy throughout the ordeal as James Bond's guide. This is still a campy Bond film, but just not as corny as the previous ones with Roger Moore. However the actress that really nailed it was Sophie Marceau as the sexy and seductive femme fatale, Elektra King. Despite the fact that most movie buffs will catch onto her motives very early on. It was also nice to see M (Judi Dench) play a bigger role this time instead of just the boss that gives out the mission information. The action sequences are done really well and when I say action there is quite a lot of action set pieces in this that is fun to watch without it going way over the top. Overall, this is a solid entry with Pierce Brosnan as Bond.8.3/10",The World Is Not Enough
38,OllieSuave-007,007 Strikes Again!,7,11 March 2014,"This is Pierce Brosnan's third movie as James Bond 007. This time, Bond is sent to protect Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), the daughter of a murdered oil tycoon. Villain Renard (Robert Carlyle) is secretly planning the destruction of a pipeline, which would lead to the destruction of Europe. Bond teams up with research scientist Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) to stop the plot.Plenty of fast action sequences and thrilling stunt scenes in this movie as well, especially the ski scene. Marceau makes a spellbinding Bond Girl, whereas Richards looks like just another girl on the block, not having the seduction, beauty and class for a conventional Bond Girl. And, this film also marked the final appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q. The character pointed out that he is retiring and his assistant R (John Cleese) would probably take over. Q's final words to Bond was ""Always have an escape plan,"" and then it shows his final scene - lowering out of sight on a moving platform while Bond looks on. This is a fitting tribute to end Llewelyn's Q saga.The story has an exciting twist to it, so it is an unpredictable movie that would be captivating for the audience. However, I thought that this film was a little on the boring side, particular in the middle scenes where it lacks action and adventure - it's just a lot of lackluster talk. The main action doesn't take place until the climax. Overall, it is an average Bond entry for the series.Grade C+",The World Is Not Enough
39,bensonmum2,"""There's no point living, if you can't feel alive.""",8,25 March 2008,"From the time he took over the role of James Bond, I've tended to dismiss the Pierce Brosnan era as one of the weaker periods of the franchise. That assessment was cemented with Brosnan's last outing as Bond in Die Another Day  quite possibly the very worst of the 21 official Bond movies. But something odd keeps happening. I keep going back to The World is Not Enough. I've actually probably seen it more times in the past 5 years than any other Bond film. I realize now that it's not only Brosnan's best effort in the series, but also it's one of my five or six favorite Bond movies.In The World is Not Enough, Bond is sent to the Caspian Sea to protect an oil heiress, Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), after her father is killed in an explosion at MI-6 Headquarters. King's is in a race with three other groups to be the first to complete an oil pipeline to bring their product to market. And someone seems intent on making sure Elektra doesn't win the race. Bond discovers that a terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle) may be responsible for the father's death, the threats against Elektra and the pipeline, and the theft of enough plutonium to destroy a good chunk of Turkey. But Bond also discovers that things may not be as they seem. Is Elektra really as innocent as she seems? Or is she, as unthinkable as it may be, in league with Renard? There are a lot of things about The World is Not Enough that keep me coming back. The most obvious is the plot. It definitely has a darker, more realistic tone to it than one normally associates with a James Bond film. It has more in common with To Russia with Love than it does the quip-filled gimmicky Bond movies of Roger Moore. And Brosnan does a more than competent job playing Bond with the same sort dark tone. The World is Not Enough actually shows Bond killing in cold blood. Don't get the wrong impression  there is still humor to be found in the film, but it's used very judiciously. Speaking of realism, other than the whole bullet in the brain making him impervious to pain, Robert Carlyle's Renard is a much more frightening advisory than the cartoonish villains with their ridiculous plans to take over the world. Renard could almost be a real-world terrorist. I also appreciate the increased role for Judy Dench as M in The World is Not Enough. It's good to see M out from behind her desk and in the field. But the real highlight of the film for me is Sophie Marceau as Elektra King. Not only does Marceau prove herself to be a talented actress, but the writers actually gave her something to work with. Too often in the Bond movies of the past, woman who start out as Bond's enemies find themselves swooning after a single encounter. Not Elektra. She remains defiant till the end. In fact, Elektra turns the tables on Bond. She uses Bond the way he normally uses women. And in this instance, Bond's the one doing the swooning. Elektra may not be the normal, run of the mill Bond girl, but I for one am glad of that.As for the negatives found in The World is Not Enough, I'm going to beat the same dead horse found in most other comments and point to Denise Richards. In a word, she's terrible. Her entire career is based on her looks because she certainly can't act. I cannot remember a single actor in any Bond movie (and that includes the likes of Tonya Roberts) who was so ill-suited to play their part. Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist  yeah, right.Five years ago I rated The World is Not Enough a 6/10. The rating, however, seems to go up with each successive viewing. I'm at an 8/10 now. Who knows what will happen the next time I watch this movie.",The World Is Not Enough
40,gridoon,"It begins well, but ultimately it's disappointing",6,22 May 2007,"""The World Is Not Enough"" begins with an exciting pre-credits sequence: a wild speedboat chase on the river Thames. Maria Grazia Cucinotta looks fantastic, with or without guns, and it's actually quite a rarity to see the British secret agent James Bond involved in field action in Britain (and in London, no less). But if this action sequence feels fresh, the same cannot be said for the rest of them (the ski chase, the underground shootout, the submarine climax, etc.).However, the biggest problem with this film is the villain: Robert Carlyle's performance is fine, but his character is not very interesting - the only thing that separates him from a million other terrorists is that he feels no pain (due to a bullet stuck in his brain, which is shutting off his senses), but even that characteristic is not used nearly enough. The lack of memorable henchmen doesn't help, either. Sophie Marceau gets more screen time than Carlyle and owns the screen when she's on it, making TWINE the first film in the series where the female opponent of Bond actually seems more important than the male one.Brosnan is a solid Bond, equally comfortable in a tux or with a gun, and Denise Richards, although miscast and with running from danger as her No. 1 function, is still fun to watch. The film also marks the final appearance of the simply irreplaceable Desmond Llewelyn as Q.To sum it all up in one sentence, TWINE is better than TND, but not as good as Goldeneye. A 6 out of 10.",The World Is Not Enough
41,Lejink,Sub-standard Bond,4,25 September 2020,"All flash and bang but with no wallop, watching this third appearance by Pierce Brosnan as Bond was a curiously empty experience. It tries to get the viewer involved by creating points of emotional involvement in and around 007, like making him the unwitting messenger of death for a knighted British oil baron first of all with a personal connection to M and also with a beautiful daughter who blames him for her father's death. But in this Bond, turnabout is unfair play as almost everyone he encounters from there on seems to turn out to switch allegiances both towards and against him, apart that is from Denise Richards"" sexy nuclear scientist Christmas Jones with whom Bond strikes up an alliance in his usual race against time, this time to stop ultimate big baddie Robert Carlyle's Renard blowing up the main oil pipeline to the west.Like with the later Roger Moore films too, this is the first of Brosnan's outings where for the first time I noticed the plentiful stunt work by his stand-ins although to be frank they were mostly for rather underwhelming action set pieces. The pre-title sequence gets rather silly when James jumps into a mini-speedboat, not for the first time either and pursues the glamorous villainess up and down the Thames who when she eventually tries to escape by going up, up and away in her beautiful balloon only ends up going up, up in flames. Then there's the climactic scene which for some reason is played out in the confined space of a submarine thus offering limited potential for action, spectacle or even a decent fight scene. In between there's a snow-chase we've also seen before while the subterranean action scenes also have a familiar ""Temple of Doom""-like appearance to them.There's also an awful lot of expositionary dialogue to no doubt try to keep the viewer onboard with what's going on but quite to what end M is later kidnapped is never really made clear. Meanwhile, even on the cusp of the new millennium, Bond's sexism continues unabated as he seduces the Secret Service doctor, naturally female and pretty, to get the medical all-clear to continue his mission while the film also ends on a crudely vulgar one-liner to get the cheapest of laughs. Sophie Marceau as the double-dealing Elektra becomes the latest Bond girl to bed and then attempt to kill our hero but seems too young and lacking in menace in the part while Richards barely registers at all in her rote role.As for the supporting cast, Carlyle does what he can in his renegade ex-KGB psychopathic part, which means he goes thick with his Russian accent but thin on characterisation, ditto his fellow-Scot Robbie Coltrane in his official KGB-heavy part whose Zukovsky seems to belong to a film 30 years before. The worst miscasting though is surely John Cleese as Q's bumbling new assistant.With Brosnan now starting to go through the motions in the main part, a bland title theme and an overlong running time, this was a curiously un-involving experience, a film in which the word Bond is not enough to guarantee viewing pleasure.",The World Is Not Enough
42,bowmanblue,Never quite got all the hate,7,11 January 2018,"There's been good Bond films and bad Bond films, but, in the long run, they're all pretty similar and you should - by now - know what you're getting with Bond, whether you're watching the new 'grizzled' Daniel Craig era, or anything before that which is distinctly 'lighter' in tone. I'm not going to say that 'The World is Not Enough' is 'classic' and will be remembered for being one of the seminal films of the franchise, but I was always surprised about the amount of hate it generated. Most people agree that the previous film 'Tomorrow Never Dies' was Pierce Brosnan's highpoint as the super-spy and the following two films were a slow decent into the reboot which came afterwards. I always thought that Brosnan had really settled into the role by now and was clearly having fun with it. As usual, he's got to save the world again and, besides the excellent action (highlight being the boat chase down the Thames) and naturally exotic locations, this one gave us quite a few new elements to the traditional mix. First of all we see more of MI6. I know it's a small thing, but I felt we got to see a lot more of what goes on behind the scenes of Bond's world. Plus Judi Dench was given a bigger role than any previous 'M' has ever been afforded. The villains (and, yes, there are two - just in case you don't know I won't spoil one of them). However, Robert Carlyle seems to be enjoying playing the bad guy who's impervious to pain due to a bullet being lodged in his brain, slowly cutting of the sensations one by one. Robbie Coltrane returns as his Russian gangster, which is a nice touch as it brings the 'Brosnan era' films together as one and - as a fan of John Cleese - was delighted to see that he was being lined up as Q's replacement (sadly the last time we got to see Desmond Llewelyn on screen).So, all in all, I thought it was a good time if you're looking for a decent enough Bond film that will kill a couple of hours. I guess most people's criticisms were levelled at Bond-girl, Dr Christmas Jones (played by Denise Richards at the height of her fame). Yes, I know it's a stretch to see her as a 'nuclear scientist' but - hey - this is James Bond, after all! Okay, so she's hardly going to win any Oscars for dressing like Lara Croft, but - again - she's hardly a reason to completely hate this film.If you're a fan of Bond then you should know what you're getting and this one should tick all the boxes you require to sit back with a vodka martini or two and have a good time.",The World Is Not Enough
43,ThomasDrufke,No Depth,5,2 November 2015,"I feel spoiled that I was able to get into Bond at a time when Daniel Craig was at the helm. I feel bad for people who grew up with the Brosnan films, which are turning out to be weak to say the least. It's not all Brosnan's fault, it's the writing, directing, and overall lack of great story telling. The World is Not Enough is yet another example of a lackluster and disappointing Bond installment.In the ongoing list of nuclear based villains, this film contains perhaps the strangest. A terrorist with a link to MI6, can't feel pain because a bullet is logged in between his membranes delaying all types of pain and feeling. What? I know Bond villains can have their fair share of strange qualities, but to have a guy with a bullet in his head that can't feel pain was way too far fetched. But even looking past the villain, there's not much substance to the story or other characters either. The action is definitely fun, but way more over the top than it needs to be. I think that's been one of the major issues that the Brosnan films have suffered from, they have relied too heavily on the action sequences to entertain the audience.Even the stunning Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau can't save this film. There's nothing to their characters. The plot is similar to that of 2012's Skyfall where Judie Dench's M is one of the main characters and the target of the lead villain. But this film tries to tackle a global nuclear angle that Skyfall didn't have while doing the story ten times as good. It's another solid cable watch but without substance, it's not worth sitting down and watching the film.It's worth noting that this was Desond Llewelyn's last film before his death in 1999. He's been one of the few bright spots in the bad Bond films and he always brings something more to the great ones. It's sad to see that his last film wasn't the best one, but his performance as Q in 17 of the Bond films will never be forgotten.+Llewelyn's emotional exit+Action is fun-Weak writing-Over the top characters5.4/10",The World Is Not Enough

45,lesleyharris30,"Uneven Bond,",6,28 December 2016,"The World Is Not Enough is a decent movie with a flawed plot and a mediocre cast. It certainly has some terrific action sequences throughout that make it worthwhile, including some stellar high budget fight scenes, explosions and special effects better than any 007 film prior to it. Judi Dench also shines in this film as M, always a pleasure to see her in this role, she embodies the character to full effect. The chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and his love interests in this film is weak, this is such an important element to any Bond film that not having it work out leaves a gaping hole in the movie overall. Brosnan himself is not in great form in the role, he seems somewhat tired of it all, as if the novelty had worn off for his fourth movie. The plot is also very uneven, it simple goes through the motions, nothing is ever effective. There are no big twist or turns throughout, each scene merely follows the other without anything overwhelming ever happening.It still has fun, enjoyable action that passes as what we have come to expect from a James Bond movie, but the plot and performances stumble. The World Is Not Enough is certainly flawed, worth a watch if you are a fan of the franchise but do not expect perfection. Bond must defuse am international power struggle as the world's oil supply hangs in the balance. Best Performance: Judi Dench / Worst Performance: Denise Richards",The World Is Not Enough
46,CuriosityKilledShawn,This movie is not enough,6,19 June 2001,"Probably the most inconspicuous movie of Brosnan's tenure as James Bond, for all of its stupidity, Die Another Day gets talked about much more, while TWINE seems to go under the radar. Released towards the end of the decade/century/millennium the movie doesn't seem to anticipate the new beginning right around the corner and instead recycles ALL of its ideas from previous Bond entries.This time around Bond is assigned to protect Elektra King, the daughter of a recently-assassinated oil magnate who was previously at the mercy of a failed MI6 operation and left in danger by M, who gambled with her life to no reward. Perhaps if they had used an already established character and brought back an actress from a past movie this might have worked better, but with only two movies under his belt, and a soft reboot, this was not practical for Brosnan.The pre-credits sequence is the most exciting part of movie, putting its best action up front and filling the remaining running time with lower-key espionage and suspense, which is okay, I suppose. Initially protective of Elektra, Bond becomes suspicious the more he investigates the villains attacking her new oil pipeline, led by Renard (a wasted Robert Carlyle), a terrorist with a bullet in his brain who cannot fail pain or fear. Nothing is done with this, and he's one of the weakest villains of the series.Neal Purvis and Robert Wade clearly had no ideas or inspiration when it came to churning out the screenplay. It feels more like a Bond movie than the generic techno-thriller that was Tomorrow Never Dies, but as I said we've seen all of this before. Speedboat chase, check. Oil pipeline action, double check. Ski chase, quadruple check. Submarine action, check. Disarming nuclear warheads, check.It does bring back Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky, which is a bonus, but there's few highlights here. It's not a bad film, just lacking any real spark and an awkward movie to close out the millennium on. Apparently it ran at 160 minutes before being cut down to 128 at the last minute, as if it wasn't slow enough, I can't imagine a longer cut being more interesting, the workman-like nature of the screenplay is the movie's biggest failing.",The World Is Not Enough

48,callanvass,Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist should tell you all you need to know about this one,4,22 September 2013,"I consider myself to be a James Bond fan. I enjoy quite a few films in the series, but this movie is way too dumb for its own good. It would help if it had good action scenes like Tomorrow Never Dies did, but the action scenes aren't anything that special. First and foremost if you expect a good movie going in with Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist, then you need to get your head checked. It also tries to be cutesy by giving her the name of Christmas Jones (Yes. There are lame Christmas jokes as well, in case you wondered) The only real enjoyment I got out of this movie was gawking at two gorgeous woman, Denise Richards & Sophie Marceau. Sophie's vindictive performance is probably the best thing about this crappy movie. Pierce Brosnan is good as usual, but he has to work with mediocre material. Robert Carlyle is OK, but makes for a rather bland villain. Denise Richard's laughable character doesn't change the fact that she's drop dead gorgeous. You won't catch me complaining about her! That's for sure. John Cleese takes over for Desmond Llewelyn (Q) He's actually pretty funny. Too bad it's not a better film. This isn't quite as bad as the worst Bond film, A View to A Kill, but it's definitely the second worst. Final Thoughts: Guys have Denise Richards & Sophie Marceau to fawn over.

Richards is not terribly convincing as a nuclear scientist. While ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was one of the better entries in the series, this followup is pretty ho-hum. Perhaps we have had enough of this series, as the filmmakers continue to recycle the same old formula. Sadly, Llewelyn's last appearance as Q.",The World Is Not Enough
50,The-Sarkologist,A Well That is Beginning to Dry,4,10 February 2020,"Well, I do vaguely remember watching this film back when it came out, and watching it again recently I sort of remember a number of the events in the film as well. However, I also sort of remember not quite liking it, and watching it now I can sort of understand why that is the case. In a way this film really felt very piece meal in that it seemed to be a series of unconnected events strung together to form a story.Okay, it probably isn't as bad as that because there is sort of a story to this film. Basically we have an oil billionaire who wants to build a pipeline that bypasses Russia. Yeah, this is sort of something that seems to be happening in the real world, but for some reason it still has not quite come to pass. Anyway, it seems as if there are people that want to stop this from happening, namely the Russians (which is also the case today since Russia controls most of the pipelines into Europe).In a way it is interesting to see that this issue is explored, though I also notice that there has been a pipeline that has already been completed along this route (in fact there are two). Yet, it also seems to be prefiguring the nature of corporations as resorting to terrorist tactics in order to secure monopolies on their product, in particular oil. Mind you, oil doesn't seem to be as important these days though, especially with people moving over to renewables.However, as for the film, yeah, it is your typical Bond film, but it doesn't seem to have the charm that the original ones seemed to have. Sure, we have bad guys, and we have exotic locations, and we also have Bond charming women into his bed, which I have to admit is also something that probably doesn't go down all that well these days. Okay, he is getting a little less forcefull, though charming the doctor to enable him to get back into action sort of doesn't sit all that well with me. Sure, one could argue that this was the late 90s, but that is a pretty lame argument in my opinion.So, I do have to admit that it does seem as if the Bond franchise is starting to hit a brick wall, and that the creators are starting to run out of ideas. Okay, it probably does have something to do with the fact that Albert Brocolli has now passed on, so the original brains behind the series has now gone, leaving us with a new generation. In fact, it seems as if they are beginning to flag this move with Leuwellyn announcing his retirement and pointing to John Cleese as his successor (though it is interesting that Cleese only appeared in one other film as Q).While I'm sure that there are some die hard Bond fans out there, in my mind, this film just didn't seem to cut it.",The World Is Not Enough

The film has an elaborate ski sequence which eclipses any scene in the previous 007 films. The opening boat chase on the Thames is one of the most impressive actions are pieces in a Bond movie in recent memory.Like Connery and Moore before him Pierce Brosnan gives his best performance as Bond in his third movie. He really is at home in the role here and is great. I have to say though. It's time first time I have noticed a stunt double for Brosnan, it was the hot air balloon sequence. With the exception of maybe Tom Cruise and Jackie Chan, most people would have had a stunt man, there.The theme song is garbage (pun intended) though and is easily the worst one since..... The worst one so far.I loved Q's final appearance and I think Brosnan has the best chemistry with Desmond Llewelyn. After serving 5 Bonds in 4 decades Llewelyn finally retired and Brosnan does seem genuinely sad about it ""C'mon... you're not really retiring, are you?""Someone else he has great chemistry with is Judi Dench's M, if Brosnan was Bond in Skyfall, it would have carried so much more weight, as they are great together.Sophie Marceau is great as Electra King, I really like Robert Carlyle as Renard and it's always good to see Robbie Coltrane.Now onto Denise Richards, casting her as a Bond Girl after the stir she caused in Wild Things was a bit of a coup, and she looks great in her tight vest and shorts, but she does not deliver the dialogue well.",The World Is Not Enough

55,zkonedog,As Slick As Bond Gets,7,3 March 2017,"After two previous Bond outings, Pierce Brosnan was able to hone in his Bond persona and turn in perhaps his best overall performance as the British spy in ""The World Is Not Enough"". Sadly, after an incredible ""first act"", the second half of the film drags it down almost two whole stars.For a basic plot summary, ""World"" sees Bond (Brosnan) up against the Russian baddie Renard (Robert Carlyle) for control over a key oil pipeline. Along the way, Bond runs into a few beauties (Sophie Marceau & Denise Richards), gets his orders from M (Judi Dench), and receives the gadgets from Q (Desmond Llewelyn).The first half of the film is some of the best Bond action ever. Brosnan is incredibly slick, his chemistry with Marceau is palpable, and the action is full-throttle without being over-the-top. Basically, Bond is firing on all cylinders.However, when Renard is introduced (and proves to be nothing ever close to menacing) this film takes a sharp nosedive. Only adding to the misery is the terrible acting from Richards. I know that Bond girls are usually ""seen but not heard"", so to speak, but I think one can say that Richards is the worst of the worst by quite a large margin.Overall, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is a very fun Bond outing until it nosedives about halfway through. My exact rating would be 3.5 stars, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt because of how much fun I had in the first half.",The World Is Not Enough
56,johnnyboyz,"Running on some interesting ideas, but all too eager to submit to action genre tendencies; The World is Not Enough is frustratingly only really mildly diverting.",6,15 January 2010,"1999 James Bond franchise entry The World is Not Enough treads a fine line between espionage inspired pulp and dumb, guilty action flick. Its somewhat overwhelming narrative to do with double crosses, use of alias', terrorism, kidnap and estranged relationships is balanced somewhat effectively by director Michael Apted, who combines these elements with a number of action set pieces that aren't really interested in anything else but blowing something up. The film, a polished and reasonably well done thriller, sets this stall out from the very first frame when a break-neck exchange between the hero of the series and a Swiss banker transpires in the Spanish city of Bilbao. It sees the men banter furiously about something during the exchange of some money before having everything transpire into a punch-up-come-fight scene-plus-getaway.A similar mixture of dialogue, which plunges you head first into a confusing exchange all linked to a much bigger picture, plus chase infused action occurs again shortly afterwards when an unexpected explosion occurs at MI6 HQ and a boat chase down the River Thames occurs; a chase which submits to the desire to encompass not only the typical iconography of the water-side set The Houses of Parliment, Tower Bridge and The Millennium Dome; but even finds time to shoot off river to encompass a red bus. So very early on, the film sets out its stall; its desire to cater to a younger, more expectant crowd in terms of what it is they've come for as well as a more mature audience looking for narrative and character, two things Apted does well given the demands to incorporate into the two or so hours he's working within.The World is Not Enough sees Pierce Brosnan in his third of four outings as James Bond, the British spy of book and film fame, doing his usual globe trotting; women encountering & guns and gadgets utilising act. Bond's nemesis this time around is Renard (Carlyle), a nifty little villain who cannot feel pain and is a physical ticking time bomb of both rage and slow burning death, as a bullet lodged in his head slowly kills off his senses - although sight and sound are still incidentally prominent. An additional element arrives in the form of Elektra King (Marceau), the daughter of a very rich business tycoon whose industrial speciality is pumping oil through Western Asia. Elektra is recovering from a kidnap ordeal which she suffered at the hands of Renard. Without giving anything away, Marceau's ability to play two different sorts of roles is impressive.There's a lot more to the film's narrative than the previous entry, 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, and that in turn aids in giving Bond a rougher, more hardened edge because of what transpires – something Brosnan puts across in an impressive manner as the screenplay compliments his aggression. Given this was the first Bond film produced after the release of Mike Myers' Bond spoof, the first Austin Powers film, I got the feeling the production team wanted to go for a little more than the prior entry's droll structure of episodic set pieces and Bond clichés, and they just about pull it off.This is most prominent when identifying the number of ideas the film actually has, none of which are sadly ever really fleshed out to a point of pure satisfaction. I think the fact that the item of oil acts as a means to get most of the characters to clash is somewhat interesting; as is the nature of the intimacy regarding two certain characters' relationship. Without giving too much away; two characters will engage in rather-a stripped down, borderline sado masochistic affair, in which self-harm and what one can truly 'feel' is the catalyst for its existence. The few scenes between the two that we are given evoke a sensual tone just as much as they evoke a violent, self-harm infused and jolting one; built on a prior record of captivity and mind-games between the two and further inflicted on the opposition. Let's be hounest, more scenes in which characters are lying on a four poster bed whilst running ice cubes down their body as thematic ideas of a sensual; sado-masochistic nature are played out is infinitely more interesting that flying snowmobiles crashing into trees and blowing up.But the film is not without faults; Denise Richards' female, scantily clad nuclear physician Christmas Jones is somewhat vile and acts solely as an obligatory love interest, nothing more – I acknowledge all of the criticism that's come before regarding it and agree. Looking at the film a number years on, it feels somewhat nostalgically stuck between the old guard and the newer guard, or what we've been getting in recent years. The elements of Judi Dench's female 'M' character and a physically scarred, sadistic villain are counter balanced with a colourful display of cinematography as well as some slapstick shenanigans in the form of the character of R (Cleese), Q branch's replacement for the character of Q (The long standing Desmond Llewelyn). Some ideas have been maintained, those of which were not present in decades ago entries, while others that bring to mind a more 'classical' image of a Bond movie have all but been banished in recent Daniel Craig additions. This is why The World is Not Enough feels stuck, not in a negative sense, wedged even; between two Bond aesthetics. Overall, however, it works.",The World Is Not Enough
57,filipemanuelneto,An unconvincing Bond and a great villain.,5,2 April 2016,"Directed by Michael Apted and produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, it has script by Bruce Feirstein and Robert Wade and is the nineteenth film in the franchise. In this film, Pierce Brosnan plays 007 alongside Sophie Marceau, in the role of Electra King, Denise Richards, in the role of Christmas Jones, Robbie Coltrane, in the role of Valentin Zukovsky and Robert Carlyle, in the role of Renard. In this film, Desmond Llewelyn made one of his last appearances as Q, alongside his replacement, John Cleese, in the role of R, his assistant.In this film, James Bond will protect the life of Elektra, the young and seductive daughter of an oil tycoon, murdered by the construction of a pipeline in the Caspian Sea. Despite the orders received, Bond will discover that the girl keeps dark secrets from her past, and isn't as angelic and helpless as she seems.Its not the first time that James Bond gives attention to problems related to oil or energy, we already saw something similar in ""The Man With the Golden Gun"". However, its this film that focuses more directly on issues related to oil industry and the control of oil production, either by countries or by certain firms. Sophie Marceau deserves congratulations for her excellent interpretation in this film, where she had a deeply complex character. Indeed, Brosnan's time's movies, despite its serious flaws, gave some of the most remarkable and memorable villains of the franchise. As for Brosnan himself, he continued to make his role unconvincingly or unsurprisingly, warm as a bread without salt. The film is full of errors, paradoxes, continuity failures impossible to disguise and blatant advertising of various sponsors. The machines are also worth mentioning in this film, in particular the helicopter with saws which, in the most striking sequence of the film, chases Bond cutting a BMW and a caviar warehouse as if they were butter. The opening theme of this film is the longest in franchise so far. Sung by Garbage is excellent although its too long.",The World Is Not Enough

Brosnan's Bond movies are either great or really good. ""The World Is Not Enough"" is a really good one. Brosnan is in fine form, as is the rest of the cast. Even the usually annoying Judi Dench manages to do a nice job. The script is tight, the action scenes are exciting and the Bond girls are top-notch. The last twenty minutes or so are edge-of-your-seat stuff. John Cleese has a great debut and Desmond Llewelyn gets a great movie send-off. Llewelyn's goodbye is classic.

During this assignment, Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul.This one has an amazing pre credit scene (not the lousy window jump sequence). The boat chase sequence is amazeballs.The villain, Reynard, is truly sinister n Carlyle did a fine job but his character ain't developed well.The story ain't engrossing n none of the henchmen is memorable.This time Bond faces Reynard who is hell bent on causing chaos n destruction.Bond faces many henchmen, Gabor, Mr. Bullion, etc. But the most noteworthy is the attractive cigar girl (Giulietta da Vinci).Bond gets to cool off with Serena Scott Thomas, Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau.Some info on Reynard:
His real name was Victor Zokas n his childhood was particularly traumatic as he was raised in poverty.At the age of fourteen, he ran away from home and joined the Soviet Army. Due to his vicious nature n brutal methods, he was given a place in the KGB. Due to his cunning and effectively discrete ways, he got the nickname, ""Renard The Fox"".Aft his expulsion from the KGB due to his evident mental instability, Zokas took ""Renard"" alias and became one of the world's most feared terrorists.It was 009 who shot Reynard in the head n although a doctor was able to save Renard's life, he was unable to extract the bullet from his patient's skull.

61,Anonymous_Maxine,"Is the 007 series suffering from the same big-budget, low-thought production system that seems to be plaguing the Lethal Weapon series?",6,9 August 2001,"(spoilers) The Lethal Weapon series began with a succession of excellent action films, but as of late, particularly in the fourth installment, the content just went overboard and much of the quality was lost. This same thing seems to have happened with the latest installment in the James Bond film series, and although The World Is Not Enough does have its redeeming values, its blunt financial motives are all too obvious. Clearly, the `Bond girl' is a significant tradition in any Bond film, and the casting of stunningly beautiful Denise Richards in this role would reveal the film's commercial intentions all by itself. But on top of that, they throw in a hilarious name (Christmas Jones) and claim that this heartthrob is a freakin' nuclear physicist. Watching Denise walk around in her cute little shorts and halter-top while she talks about plutonium and physics is just funny, and it takes away any possible chance of her character being taken seriously. If they expect her to play the part of a highly educated physicist, they could have at least dressed her to look less like a high school girl.
The World Is Not Enough starts out with the traditional Bond opening, with the cool, collected Bond conversing with the enemy only to wind up making an elaborate escape and barely getting away with his life. Some things about this scene just come off as weird or incorrect. For example, consider the fact that while the opening scene takes place in Europe, the police officers that burst into the room are speaking Spanish. I really hope that I am just missing something and that that wasn't just randomly thrown in. The action was excellent, but in most cases it was so ridiculously exaggerated and unrealistic that it made it funnier than exciting. I realize that this IS James Bond, and this is the kind of crazy stuff that he is famous for, but it is a little upsetting that the screenwriters couldn't come up with some kind of action that is possible in real life but still creates thrills and excitement. Does that little speedboat that Bond takes off in have wheels? It's cool to see a boat jump up on land and slide a bit while the hero jumps out and makes a heroic rescue or something, but this thing was STEERING. Bond was literally driving it around the streets, and don't get me started on the idiotic underwater scene. Also, there obviously wasn't much proofreading done on the scene where Bond and Jones jump off of the vehicle in the tunnel, while traveling at 70 MPH!! Surely the typical Bond film's audience is aware of what would happen to someone who hit cement while traveling that fast. And especially in a tunnel, that's probably certain death. And it was not a very brilliant idea that was devised in order to get a jumping-out-of-a-helicopter-on-skis shot  the helicopter pilot tells them that the wind is too strong to land, and this is followed by a shot of the helicopter hovering over the mountain in an utter absence of wind other than what is created by the rotors. Bond and Elektra jump out and we get some unnecessary but beautiful scenery shots as the ski gracefully down the mountain in their cute little ski outfits. This whole scene is unnecessary and, to make it worse, it's followed by one of those breaks where the plot is explained boringly through a bit of dialogue.The narrative structure of this movie is badly flawed, with the action literally stopping periodically in order for the characters on screen to discuss with each other, in pure dialogue, what is happening in the story. This type of weak presentation is something that is more at home is cheesy action B-movies, and it's almost heartbreaking to see it in a James Bond film. There is also an awkward use of sound while one of these little duologues is taking place while Bond and Elektra King (Sophie Marceau, one of the few reasons to watch the film) walk through a crowd of people. There are people running all around them, and the camera is pretty far away, yet you can hear them perfectly as they speak in normal tones, and you can't hear the people running around them. The reasons for doing this are obvious, but it makes the crowd seem eerily silent. And then you have the helicopter with the circular saws attached to it. I sure hope that one of the writers was fired (and beaten, for emphasis) for THAT little idea.It's the other Bond tradition - the villain - that saves the movie. Robert Carlyle is wonderfully menacing as Renard, the bad guy who literally has no feelings because of a bullet that is lodged in his head and is slowly numbing all of his senses as it gradually kills him. Not only was he an excellent villain for this movie, but he also gave the best performance of anyone in the entire, film, followed closely by Judi Dench as M. While the concluding action face off between Bond and Renard is effective (thanks, in no small part, to the quality performance from Carlyle) and even fairly exciting, it dissolves into dumb action film cliché as Bond (of course) gets the girl. Granted, I wouldn't complain about that part, James Bond always gets the girl. But did we really have to have a shot where the distressed and frightened Christmas Jones happens to fall right into Bond's open arms? That's bad form, as Hook would say. The World Is Not Enough is definitely a characteristic James Bond film, but I really wish that there was more quality involved in the formula these days, and less flying snowmobiles piloted by miracle marksmen. And if only they sold some of those x-ray glasses as collector's items",The World Is Not Enough
62,elshikh4,The Frigid Bond !,6,16 September 2009,"My first Bond to attend in a theater. And not one of the best Bonds, or the best movies I attended in a theater!Firstly, I hated Brosnan. I didn't experience an atom of acting, attractive presence, or wittiness; he thinks that fixing his tie is a funny move!I hated, with maybe the entire world, Denise Richards. She can act as good as a refrigerator!I hated the goofiness that runs in this movie's veins. For instance: HOW none of Elektra's henchmen, or Elektra herself, knew about the disappearing of the bomb's microchip? Or HOW none of the workers in the nuclear factory knew about the most wanted international terrorist who works among them without any disguise (having one apparent bullet in the head)?!! And I didn't understand, and I think nobody ever did, HOW Bond figured out that the briefcase of Elektra's father is going to explode??!! Actually, the question must be how dumb the characters in a Bond movie, or the viewers in front of it, can be?!I hated that Bond was the one who left the Russian nice assistance to be murdered; he gave him up, ran away with the girl, then had been caught. So he was cowered, with no manly ethics and yes, that clumsy to be caught as well! let alone how M's feelings caused the complexity of Elektra's kidnapping, or how M was so naive to be kidnapped. Ok, the dignity of the MI6 was never more insulted!I hated the idiot BIG sequence when the evil guys send a helicopter, one that chops off trees, to kill Bond; Yes, you'd find situations like that in the franchise, but less provocative, because this round, I was like ""They gonna chop off the house that Bond is in it, the whole harbor, then chop him??!!"" I think there are easier, faster and more secretive ways to kill the man. This showiness killed the sequence already!By the way, I didn't hate the climax, where Renard / the evil man puts in the large crankshaft of the nuclear rocket out of its activation duct, then Bond puts it out, then Renard puts it in, then Bond puts it out again; as that was comically amusing like a Laurel & Hardy's routine!But I hated the scene where Q got to leave for good. Not because the event itself, but for replacing him with totally uninteresting buffoon, who would take off the importance of being the earnest Q in front of reckless 007. And also for Desmond Llewelyn's performance. He looked a bit tepid (the Brosnan effect? Maybe!). In that scene, his eyes didn't tell; was he sad?, was he glad? It seemed like he didn't act!I hated that the movie gives one historical intro then fails to give anything like it, or as huge, after. I hated that Sophie Marceau wasn't convincing enough. And ladies and gentlemen, I hated the repetition of another usual Bond's last moment where he-has-a-girl in hot-position while his-superiors-watch-in-shock with wicked-punch-line always said-by-Q. I know that Bond is formulaic, but with seeing that same end, many times before, that's boringly formulaic!So, what could be loved about this movie? It's simple: the intro chase, couple of lines, the shot in which Robert Carlyle as Renard smiles before Bond Kills him, enjoying that someone finally will end his misery, Dived Arnold's imposing music, especially the memorable track while the boat chase, and the title's song; it's certainly more effective than the movie itself.Add to that, the surprise behind Elektra's character. Aside from being so unpredictable event, it was the unprecedented step to turn the evil guy in a Bond movie into evil girl. Well, it was about time, and in fashion too after ""M"" becoming a woman in (GoldenEye - 1995). 4 years later, the killer machine in (The Terminator) cinematic series would become a woman in (Terminator 3). As you see, women became more influential, evil, and metallic!I didn't ask ""What Michael Apted is doing here?!"" I kind of asked ""What the real action princes were doing away from it?!"". It is only a special movie for the ""serious"" Apted, though I didn't feel anything special with the movie itself, so why to bring him in the first place?! He made a good movie, but averagely entertaining, and without intended seriousness!When Bond, riding his advanced boat, bursts in a peaceful restaurant, I imagined Connery, in a case like this, giving a cynical smile, Dalton screaming ""Go Away!"", Moore stopping to taste a glass of wine, then gives an opinion to continue the chase! Unfortunately, Brosnan disappoints any hope with severe features and silent eyes. This frigidness, which maybe Brosnan intends to be distinct among the other Bonds--separates between him and the funniness of the character on one side, and the admiration of us on the other side. He makes the silly Bond real silly to say the least.Generally, (The World Is Not Enough) got a face like Brosnan's; I hated that the most!",The World Is Not Enough
63,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,3 November 2020,"So Goldeneye wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either and it was a solid entry into the 007 franchise. Tomorrow Never Dies was fan-freaking-tastic....... and then this.Yay, it's 007.What the heck happened? I'm thinking Goldeneye (N64) happened. I'm thinking that they made close to as much money off the FPS as they did off the film and wanted to emulate it by making a movie that would transfer well into that genre of video game, but didn't realize that Bond (N64) was only legendary because it was the first time that four of your friends could gather around a television and kill each other.And then... the Bond Girl, as much as I love the final joke about her name, she did NOT come across as a believable nuclear scientist. John Cleese was fun, but a horrible replacement Q.We started to see more Moore style silliness come back in a Brosnan Era Bond who was getting pretty close to Flemming and Connery and that just didn't work.Moore style silliness with a Connery style plot.It just didn't fit well together and, though it is not totally unwatchable, it's also not a good example of a Bond film",The World Is Not Enough

66,drqshadow-reviews,Brosnan Protects the West from Wealthy Oil Tycoons,5,1 May 2020,"A rather static, nostalgic adventure for 007, which frequently calls back to scenes and settings from the character's previous outings. An alpine ski pursuit, for example, not unlike the one Roger Moore undertook during The Spy Who Loved Me. A high-speed boat chase, memorably portrayed in Live and Let Die and Moonraker... and three or four others, actually. Even the criminals' evil scheme, a convoluted plot to monopolize precious resources, recalls the machinations of Auric Goldfinger (he sought gold, of course, while the modern baddies are more concerned with crude oil). The memory-tickling action throwbacks are an improvement, at least; appropriately thrilling, inventive and faintly comical, with explosions galore and a dynamic knack for one-upping themselves.Bond emcees a swinging good time during the early going, before the plot ramps up and the pace slows down. Once that page turns, though, the film quickly grows messy and overwhelming. The excess of overwrought side characters, each with a little twist or swerve up their sleeve, creates a tangle of confusing, unnecessary secondary arcs. Bond himself seems nearly as lost as the audience: hurriedly dashing from one swanky locale to the next, accidentally stumbling across information and ad-libbing his way out of a jam. He becomes someone we watch momentous things happen to, not the clever instigator of such organized chaos.Maybe a good supporting cast would help to patch over such problems, but The World is Not Enough has nothing to offer in that respect. Naughty bad guy Renard, who feels no physical pain, is stoic and boring, his quirky power scarcely explored for more than a few cheap tricks. Christmas Jones, played by a doe-eyed Denise Richards, is laughably implausible as a bombastic nuclear physicist. Not even John Cleese, forced into a suitable role as Q's timely replacement, seems like a good fit. The superficial bits are fun and effective, but the story-driven later acts are all tired and tedious. Call it middle-of-the-road.",The World Is Not Enough

Sadly Brosnan never again reached those heights, and The World is not Enough is a prime example of the vanilla mediocrity of the rest of his run as 007.While TWINE is a better looking and more technically impressive film than the flat and woodenly directed Tomorrow Never Dies, I can't say it's actually a better film. Like that second entry, TWINE is several rungs down the Bond ladder from Goldeneye and without the Bond accoutrements and nostalgia to grease its gears it would be a below average 90s actioner.

Other charter members (and those nearly so) of the close-knit Bond film family began dropping like flies around the time NOT ENOUGH--the 19th Eon Company spy flick--was released in 1999 (most notably, producer Albert Broccoli and gadget-man ""Q"" portrayer Desmond Llewelyn). However, their demise was NOT ENOUGH to derail the seemingly endless train of new Bond actors driving new Bond vehicles.

71,sauravjoshi85,The movie could've been better,6,10 February 2021,"The world is not enough is an action spy movie directed by Michael Apted and stars Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards and Judi Dench.This was the nineteenth James Bond movie and third to star Brosnan.The movie was undoubtedly an entertaining movie and has it's elements to make a superb Bond movie but somewhat disappoints on it's execution and selection of few characters.The plot of the movie is good and as said earlier had a great potential but it seems that the director fumbles many times while making the movie mainly could be because of his inexperience of handling such movies. The action scenes were looked pale and weren't that exciting.Acting is majorly good and special mention for Sophie Marceau who was the shining highlight of the movie. Brosnan was elegant as always but Denise Richards was disappointment.Climax of the movie is good and music is superb. Location and cinematography was good.The movie is not as bad as rated by some reviewers and as not good a mentioned in comment section. Could be a let down for action lovers and also for bond lovers.",The World Is Not Enough
72,r96sk,Underwhelmed,7,26 March 2020,"'The World Is Not Enough' held my high interests for the vast majority of the run time, though by when the credits rolled I felt underwhelmed.This is still a good Bond flick. Pierce Brosnan is a fantastic lead, his first three films haven't broken into my top five of the series but are lined up under the best of the rest; in relation to the other productions thus far, his are some of the more entertaining ones despite not getting high marks.Denise Richards is decent, even if it is a shame her character didn't remain away from the love interest realm for too long. Robbie Coltrane is fun, though his Russian accent isn't the best. The other main cast members are fine, if unspectacular.One irritating thing I have noticed during Brosnan's reign so far is the forced one-liners, which are way too on the head and come out awkward. That's probably been 'a thing' since 'Dr. No', but it's way more obvious to me with Brosnan's Bond.",The World Is Not Enough
73,barnabyrudge,"By-the-numbers Bond entry, professionally put together but lacking in freshness and inspiration.",5,22 September 2007,"Pierce Brosnan's reign as James Bond saw a massive commercial upturn in the series, and his third entry - The World Is Not Enough - is often cited as his best film in the role. But I've always found there's something about the film that doesn't quite gel - while action movie buffs might enjoy some of the elaborate chase sequences, true Bondage purists might find the film rather soulless and routine. It's not a dull film by any stretch of the imagination - action, sex and incident come thick and fast. But the handling seems quite indifferent, one might even say uninspired, and the day after you've watched the film it's hard to recall much about it.Following a serious injury whilst chasing an assassin, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) recovers sufficiently to continue his mission. The death of wealthy industrialist Robert King, a close friend of Secret Service Head ""M"" (Judi Dench), sets Bond on a globetrotting adventure. His first job is to locate and offer protection to King's daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau). He finds her in Azerbaijan overseeing the development of an ambitious oil pipeline, but almost from the moment of his arrival he finds that she is being hunted and harried by various enemies. Elektra is already traumatised after earlier being kidnapped and abused by criminals, and Bond feels her emotions are on the brink. Later, though, Bond discovers that during her imprisonment she fell in love with one of her captors, the lethal Renard (Robert Carlyle). In fact, she and Renard are now planning a devastating crime which will see the destruction rather than the completion of her beloved pipeline. Bond's task is made doubly dangerous by the fact that Renard is oblivious to pain - a bullet injury to his skull has taken away his sensation of pain, making him stronger and harder than any normal man. Bond teams up with nuclear physicist Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) and together they attempt to thwart Elektra and Renard.There's no denying the spectacle on display here - a speedboat chase along the Thames, a ski chase in Azerbaijan, an escape from an endangered nuclear site, the defusing of a bomb whilst in transit through a pipeline, and a finale aboard a nuclear submarine are among the big sequences. But the disappointing aspect, for me at any rate, is the rather by-the-numbers manner in which the story moves from one set piece to the next. Brosnan is pretty good as Bond, more ruthless here than we've seen him for many years (the scene where he kills Elektra shows grit that is rare for this series), and Marceau makes an alluring villainess. Sadly, Carlyle's villain is totally under-developed, and Richards is highly implausible as a nuclear physicist. On the whole, The World Is Not Enough emerges as watchable but unremarkable entry in the 007 canon.",The World Is Not Enough

I first played the game and it was quite fun, there was so much action. In this film sadly there is very few action in comparision, most scenes which in the game had tons of action in this movie are just talking scenes. Even the action itself was much better in the game than here, shootouts and explosions were superior and more fun.",The World Is Not Enough

76,drystyx,disappointing and dull,1,26 February 2008,"Bond films must meet a certain criteria. Call it the ""Brocolli"" effect if you want. They must have the Bond elements 1. The glib, witty, cool, collected Bond character 2. Stunning scenery 3. Various venues and exotic locations most people rarely see, notably the Mediteranean, other seas, deserts, outer space, mountains, the romance countries (Italy, Portugal, Greece, et al), underwater scenes, sky scenes, and jungles. 4. Adventure and non stop action. 5. Beautiful women. 6. The usual British characters such as M, Q, and Moneypenny. 7. The colorful supporting cast such as the Russian spy leader. 8. A bad guy who even kills his own bad guys 9. An over the top plot such as world domination.This film tries to cover all this, and of course the beautiful women are here, but the rest is rather bland in comparison to other Bond movies. On it's own merits, there isn't much to like. It prides itself more on intrigue and double cross, and killing as many dark haired women as it can, which will endear it to the vast neo Nazi viewers of the American public. They will automatically cheer it on no matter what. But it offers nothing else. It isn't interesting. It has a plot, characters, and scenes you will forget the moment you leave the theatre. It doesn't approach the ""Brocolli"" criteria. It is more like ""Old lettuce"".",The World Is Not Enough
77,slokes,Brosnan's Best Bond?,6,11 September 2006,"Now that it's possible to take account of all the Pierce Brosnan 007 movies, is it fair to say he never quite got into the role?He did leave on a bad note with ""Die Another Day,"" one of the worst-ever Bonds with no help from him. Especially there but in all his Bonds, he carried a higher level of heaviness and arrogance than any of the other Bond actors did, which made rooting for him harder than with Sean Connery, Roger Moore, or Timothy Dalton. Yet at least one of them, this one, he got across that rare mixture of charm and insouciance that otherwise eluded him.I think it has to do with the quips. They are so bad in this film you almost feel for Brosnan having to deliver them. If you have to watch a guy snuggle with Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards when not racing a motorboat across the Thames, it helps when he serves up lines you can groan and feel better about yourself for not ever wanting to deliver, like ""If he's Q, you must be R,"" and ""He got buried in work."" Or asked about his relationship with a woman who just tried to blow him up: ""Strictly plutonic.""That's the best part of ""The World Is Not Enough"": Brosnan is having fun. He's a good actor, who God knows looks the part of Bond better than even Connery did, especially in blue-tinted shades. So when he eases off the throttle, you have a better time watching him. At least I did.And that helps a lot when the story is a mess, like it is here. A globo-terrorist named Renard (played by Robert Carlyle, unrecognizable from ""The Full Monty,"") is apparently plotting to destroy a critical oil pipeline running though the former Soviet Union, and with it capitalist Elektra King (Marceau). It's up to Bond to outfox Renard, though there is much he doesn't know about going in, including how to dismantle a nuclear bomb, which is where physicist Christmas Jones (Richards) comes in.Many reviewing this film rip into Richards. She's not much of an actress, but she comes off well enough here for me, playing her Bond girl part with the right amount of engagement and hotitude. ""You wanna put that in English, for those of us who don't speak spy?"" she asks, a nice line that sets up her scoffing character. She's better than Tanya Roberts or Grace Jones were, anyway. More problematic, not because they aren't better actors but because they have to play impossible parts, are Marceau and Carlyle. She's all over the map, while he's so low-key as the central villain he disappears.What makes this a better-than-average Bond picture is Brosnan's lighter touch and some incredible action scenes, beginning with the long opening, which takes us from Bilbao, Spain to a long chase on the Thames that is the best start to a Bond film since ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" There are other good sequences, too, like Bond and Christmas zipping through a pipeline and a machine-gun battle inside a Russian missile silo.To set this up, ""The World Is Not Enough"" features an outlandish plot that requires Bond's boss M (Judi Dench) to put herself in harm's way for the sake of a friend's daughter she has guilty feelings about, while raising questions about Stockholm Syndrome and how world energy policy might be affected if someone nuked Istanbul. Most of the weirdest bits involve Marceau, who is one reason I enjoyed Richards' performance. At least with her, what you see is what you get.The story's the same for this film much of the time, enough for one to forgive the rest. Director Michael Apted gives you thrill ride after thrill ride, and Brosnan for once makes such a genial center; it feels churlish to wish it made more sense. But I do.",The World Is Not Enough

80,davidmvining,The worst Bond movie,3,2 March 2020,"I...do not like this movie. It's too busy, so busy as to keep any real story from developing. I had lost interest by the half hour point, but I kept with it until the end. I was not rewarded for my patience. I understand that this film does have some defenders, but I don't see the merits at all. The good things are good ideas that are executed badly.It starts with a pre-credits sequence, like every Bond film, but this one is laboriously long, over twenty minutes. Bond has two separate action sequences. The first is in Spain and involves Bond jumping out a window with a briefcase full of money. Then there's a scene of dialogue, an explosion at MI6, and a chase over the Thames (where Bond actually goes into the water...ew). The actual story information passed along in this sequence is actually not that much (and some of it ends up going nowhere), which makes me feel like this is a first draft screenplay that was cobbled together from a couple of other existing drafts.See, the problem is the dual villains and the mystery box effort to hide one of the characters as a villain. We don't get introduced to either of them until after the credits sequence (so almost half an hour into the film), though there is a line of dialogue from the female sniper that features prominently in the opening bit that gets echoed in Skyfall when talking about a much more interesting villain. The first is Elektra King, the daughter of an assassination victim. She's presented as the sympathetic victim in the beginning (a typical Bond girl) and morphs into a heartless villain. Now, I like this idea, the subversion of the conceit of the Bond girl, but it doesn't work for a couple of big reasons.I see The World is not Enough as an effort to mimic and reverse the emotional success of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. George Lazenby's single Bond outing is the only time the Bond movies ever successfully created an emotional connection between Bond and a girl. Everything else has been superficial at best. There seems to be an effort to get Bond and Elektra to the same place, but there simply isn't enough time dedicated to their relationship. They're talking super seriously about desire and stuff within minutes of meeting each other. There's no real chemistry. Brosnan and Sophie Marceau do their best (Marceau is a quality actress), but the writing just isn't there. Much like Paris Carver in Tomorrow Never Dies, the movie never successfully gets them into a believable romantic spot.That would be fine if the movie treated Elektra as a typical Bond girl, but they had big ideas for her. She was the wolf in sheep's clothing and the actual antagonist of the film. Her betrayal of Bond was supposed to be an emotional gut punch, and it falls almost hilariously flat. It doesn't help that her very late explanation of her motives makes literally no sense. She's in control of her company, obviously able to do what she wants (as evidenced by an early-ish scene where she dictates her pipeline bypass a church despite obvious reservations from those around her), and she wants to...claim the company for her mother? I mean, killing her father and putting herself in charge fits that, but what about the rest of her plot that involves blowing up a small section of her pipeline with half of a nuclear payload while giving the other half to a French terrorist to blow up Istanbul?And that brings us to Renard, the French terrorist. He kidnapped Elektra years before, eventually letting her escape, and now he's in the palm of her hand, doing what she wants. The idea of his physical condition is kind of cool (the bullet slowly making its way through his brain, killing all physical senses). I mean, it's essentially leprosy with super-strength (somehow), but whatever. I can buy it. His motive and Elektra's are totally different. They have literally nothing to do with each other. He's a communist terrorist who rails against the West, and she's a decadent Westerner. He wants to blow up Istanbul because...reasons (because she told him to?). It's such a hodgepodge of underdeveloped nonsense that it has to have been cobbled together from different scripts. Maybe they wanted Elektra to be the antagonist, but they just didn't have enough material, so they pulled the Renard stuff from another draft and awkwardly grafted it all together.One thing you can usually rely on in James Bond movies is quality actions scenes, but here the movie falters as well. Michael Apted feels like an intelligent man, but he's not an action director. There's no sense of geography. Bad guys pop out of nowhere. We lose the sense of where everyone is constantly. It's a visual mess of nonsense that never comes together to tell a cohesive story of an action scene.And then you have Dr. Christmas Jones who is, well, she's there, and she's played by Denise Richards. I don't quite get the hate she receives for the role. I found her present in the film and little else.In the end, this film is dreary and dull. There's no real story. It lurches from one scene to the next with two antagonists that never gel, creating disparate goals that feel like they should be connected but aren't. The Bond girls are wastes of ideas. It's flatly filmed with terrible actions sequences. This might be the worst Bond film.",The World Is Not Enough
81,Spleen,Minor spoilers follow,6,2 December 1999,"Pierce Brosnan is better than ever in the role, and the opening sequence, culminating in a superbly choreographed chase around the metropolitan bits of the Thames, makes us settle back in our seats, fully expecting a long, exciting, satisfying ride.  Looked at afterwards the plot seems to be, if not great, at least sound.  So why was I so disappointed?I'm still not sure; but I think the following example from the latter half of the film is telling.  M is captured, and cunningly manages to send a signal to her allies on the outside, who include Bond.  Bond gets the signal - and then he's captured and taken by force to the very place M was trying to lead him to.  This is poor craftsmanship, nothing more.  It's as if different scenes were written by different people, and no-one cross-checked.The script has other notable weaknesses.  The villains' big plan is revealed far too late in the day to really excite us.  It's not really exciting anyway.  And the science!  The ridiculous explanation of what a bullet in the brain does, that unbelievable place in Azerbaijan (or was it Turkey?) with perpetually burning flames, and the cavalier use of nuclear fusion ... they add up to a bit too much implausibility.  (It's the CHARACTERS in the Bond world that can get away with being silly, not the techno-speak.)  But the main problem is just this: all the good ideas have been used up by the end of the first hour.As for Denise Richards as Christmas Jones ... I WANTED to like her, if only to be contrary, but it took too much effort.  I really couldn't see her tagging along with a secret agent.  Christmas lacked the simple charm of the old Bond bimbos and the reason for existing that more recent ones have had; and anyway, Richards's acting was atrocious.Maybe I've over-stated my case.  There's certainly nothing here to make us despair about the future of Bond films: they still have the genuine stunts and location work, and the sense of belong to a lineage completely different to the one that, say, `Die Hard' belongs to.  There's bound to be a weak episode every so often.",The World Is Not Enough

The part that would have made her interesting was purposely hidden to keep it from being obvious.The ""man who feels nothing"" angle was interesting, but we didn't really get much out of that, at least nothing meaty.To make it extra boring, for me anyways, they including a submarine and Denise Richards: it's not even that she's a bad actress, I'm just not a fan.I think I'm swearing off Bond again for a while after this.",The World Is Not Enough
83,eric262003,A Great Addition to the Series,9,21 December 2020,"The 19th addition to the Bond franchise lives up as the greatest Bond there is and that's not just a saying. It really does promise what it delivers and more. The action is exciting, the fight scenes were well choreographed, and the story is both original and inventive. For a legendary franchise that has been around since 1962, it's natural that there might be comparisons to the other Bond movies, but it does hold out very well with plenty to enjoy with very few if any flaws.When it comes to performances, Pierce Brosnan displays greater confidence in his third outing as Bond. Almost like his predecessor Sean Connery, Brosnan knew how to keep the action scenes running and showcase mannerisms that are at the same level as Connery. And when he delivers a one-liner he knows the most effective way to really get it done is by keeping a straight face. His action scenes were also well executed and handled immaculately with grace and poignancy.
.
A really big milestone was the sendoff of Desmond Llewellyn who's character Q was contemplating retirement. As the man behind the unorthodox but effective
gadgets and gizmos, this would be his last appearance as Q after appear in all the Bond starting with 1963's ""From Russia with Love"" and ending it with ""The World is Not Enough"". He would die months later in road accident at the age of 85 and this film pays a dedication to Llewellyn. Here he offers Bond some new inventions and at the end of the movie, he goes off in a very touching way.John Cleese would replace Llewellyn as the new Q, but here, he's just R and the gadgets are upgraded looking more spectacular than ever before. We a have an awesome BMW that comes equipped with a titanium armour and six cup holders. Film and stage legend Judi Dench returns as M in her third outing showing just how powerful she is as a majestic leader without trying to make her demeanour condescending. She does deliver her role with a serious and dedicated fashion even when their is danger when the MI6 headquarters blows up.Of course it wouldn't be a Bond movie without a few Bond girls to go along for the ride. This time we have two main ones, one being good and the other one being evil, but both show an upgrade being that neither one are one-dimensional damsels in distress and can hold out their performance through effectiveness and intelligence. Sophie Marceau is a great performer here as Elektra King whose father ran an oil industry and she has possible links towards an oil pipeline that connects to the old Soviet oil fields. The other main Bond girl is an atomic scientist named Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) who has the capabilities of either saving or destroying the world.The chase scenes here are some of the most exciting ones out there. From the powerboat scene on the River Thames then on land and back in the drink to the hot air balloon scenes, to the climactic ski chase down the slopes, to the scintillating scenes on the snowmobiles and even an undersea adventure happens as Bond takes down a villain while in a submarine. It doesn't get any better than this.Robert Carlyle is excellent as the leading villain Renard a terrorist who's mindset is to vow revenge on M for sentencing him death and to take over Elektra's father's oil empire. It also should be known that he is a very formidable adversary being that due to a bullet lodged in his brain, he can't feel any emotions including physical pain. Another antagonist is play by Robbie Coltrane who plays Valentin Zukovsky, an ex-KGB who now runs a bar, a casino and a caviar factory, who was a prominent character in ""GoldenEye"", but meets his fate in the end.The locations in this movie are truly top of the world. From the oil fields of Azerbaijan to the Frank Gehry' Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, to the Millennium Dome, to the banks of the Thames where an exciting moment happens as a hot air balloon explodes. We also have a Hindu temple where the flames never expire.There are a myriad of deadly weapons to see including a helicopter-borne rotary capable of trimming blades or an archaic, but authentic ancient torture chair. But the narrow escape of Bond is so slick we wonder how does he do it with such ease? Sure made to suspend our disbelief, but could Bond manage to bungee jump from a skyscraper by tying one end to shade cord to his belt and the other end to an unconscious individual's body?Under the competent direction from Michael Apted and the brilliant script by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein, they succeeded keeping the set pieces organized in a more logical format as opposed to the traditional ways where everything is glued together in a neatly immaculate fashion. Bond's clever quips seem to be more into what his character is like and doesn't feel random. Carlyle's villain has more dimension to his character with a more reasonable plot of evil as opposed so some convoluted motives of the other villain than compared to the previous Bond villains.One of the most famous question that has boggled my mind for many years finally fulfilled my curiosity regarding the villains in regards to how do they come with the right equipment needed for their diabolical schemes knowing that their main headquarters are situated in remote areas secluded from the public spectrum? During a snow chase sequence a villain laments that the para-sailors were rented and had to be returned at a certain deadline.",The World Is Not Enough
84,Sandcooler,Has everything that makes a Bond movie work,8,4 February 2011,"Some people choose to take James Bond really seriously, others want him to be somewhat silly and light-hearted. It should be clear that this movie mostly caters to the second group, because you should really steer clear from this if you can't stand an avalanche of cheesy one-liners. Bond is really on a roll here, the corny double entendres just keep on coming. The overall style of this movie is very vivid, the action scenes are as exaggeratedly unrealistic as can be. Bond has always been pretty good at jumping away from explosions just in time, but in this movie he really turns it into an art form. If your suspension of disbelief is still intact after experiencing all that, I'm also more than happy to announce that Denise Richards plays a scientist in this movie. That's stuff you just can't make up, but somehow someone still did. Enough about her though, because Sophie Marceau is the Bond-girl that's really memorable here. Her performance just seems to get better and better as the movie progresses, she completely dominates every scene she's in. She makes the movie lots better than even the people making it seemed to give it credit for, brilliant acting. Overall this is a very enjoyable action flick, might just be the best of the Brosnan ones.",The World Is Not Enough
85,philip_vanderveken,When you just want to have some brainless fun this isn't a bad movie,7,28 November 2004,"I'm not the biggest fan of Bond movies, simply because most of the time it lacks any realism . It's true, the makers have tried to incorporate some actual facts in the movie (terrorists who try to get nuclear material to make a dirty bomb, problems about oil and pipelines,...), but it isn't enough to make this movie more realistic. A Bond movie has never been and it never will be realistic: it's just impossible for one man to do what James Bond does. He cheats death time after time, he avoids bullets and explosions, knows everything about anything and always knows to stop the bad guys at the last moment. So, if you are looking for any realism this movie isn't really the one for you. However, when you just want to have some brainless fun this isn't a bad movie.

87,Gislef,Somewhere in the Middle,6,4 January 2000,"Maybe I'm just getting blase, but TWINE just doesn't quite do it for me. It isn't the worse by any means (no matter how much post-revisionist Moonraker folks weigh in), but it's not the best.  The main thing is that it seems so...formulaic.  Which is ironic, but maybe 20+ movies is too long.It's not that the writers do't try.  We get a few altered elements, like the main ""villain"".  And there's a lot of psychological angst (like in Goldeneye *uggh*).    So it's a marginal 90's kinda spin on the basic themes.Part of it is that Bond needs a decent villain.  Sorry, but Ranard just doesn't cut it for me here.  Say what you will about Tomorrow Never Dies, at least Pryce plays a Bond Villain(tm).  Ranard would be lucky to get hired on as Goldfinger's backup henchman.Bond movies, to me, have also been about exotic scenery.  TWINE fails to deliver here.  There are a few establishing shots, a decent outdoor mountain ski-chase, and then *poof* everyone's inside.  Apartments, submarines, inside pipelines, cells...this is the first time claustrophobic Bond movie. Istanbul, Hong Kong, Baku, Moscow...who can tell?  Everyone's inside most of the time, or on a featureless dock.The main Bond girl is okay, and as for Denise Richards...well, I think enough has been said of her.  She's there so that Bond can get a girl at the end.  Marceau is good, but ""Chrismas Jones""...?  Bah, give me a Pussy Galore or even a Solitaire any day of the week.Pierce Brosnan is adequate for the role.  He is hard-edged here, and I don't think that's out of character for Bond-in-the-movies.  Connery's Bond shoots an unarmed man dead in Dr. No, Moore wasn't adverse to breaking an arm or two in his earlier days, and Timothy Dalton was ruthless.As for the rest of the cast, okay.   Judi Dench is okay, although it's hard to imagine the old ""M"" getting into these kinds of scrapes.The plot?  Who cares.  Although I must admit, as someone else noted, watching these folks casually juggle unshielded plutonium is kinda funny. It's basically an excuse for them to chase around the landscape...but again, they're mostly indoors.  *grrr*Basically, an average entry into the series.",The World Is Not Enough

89,coltras35,""" There's no point in living if you can't feel alive.""",9,28 February 2021,"For the two Sirs ( the late Roger & Sean) their third 007 venture struck gold in terms of excellence and being iconic, and I believe The World is not enough ( the 3rd Brosnan 007) matches the excellence, though lacking in being iconic, however, that doesn't matter, not when you have a solid, fresh storyline - suspenseful, serious at times, tempered with tragic overtones ( especially when it comes to the elegantly beautiful Electra King, excellently played by Sophia Marceau) and an emphasis on character, these hallmarks are evenly balanced by funny one-liners ( ""I thought Christmas only comes once a year.""), great locations, set-pieces, and a plethora of energetic action sequences kicked off by an unusually lengthy, heart-stopping pre-credit sequence. Brosnan is on top form as 007 here handling the drama and humour with ease. A very fresh and lively addition to the franchise",The World Is Not Enough
90,pyrocitor,"A darker, more emotional Bond",9,11 July 2006,"The World is Not EnoughIt would seem that rather than slowly fading away over time, James Bond films only continued to improve in film-making quality and sheer entertainment value as time passed. The World is not Enough, the last Bond movie of the 90s certainly seemed to prove this point, being arguably one of the strongest installments of the franchise ever made. Director Michael Apted proves to be an inspired choice, as he brings out a darker, more emotional side to Bond while still maintaining the light hearted, underlyingly comical feel of the series... not an easy feat to balance the two, but Apted pulls it off with considerable skill and ease. Despite some story elements seeming like they should be too overtly fantastical (a villain impervious to pain) instead don't seem unbelievable at all, and only serve to give the story an added edge. The World is Not Enough also serves as much more of a thinker than the gratuitous action feel of the franchise, with more difficult ethical dilemmas, not to mention elements such as personality disorder Stalkholm syndrome for viewers to mull over. The notion that Bond is less of a superhero and more of a real man, with actual difficult decisions to make and real emotional consequences to suffer comes into play much more prominently than in any other 007 film, for which Apted and screenwriters Neil Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein should be commended for, as well as turning out one of the absolute best Bond scripts to date. Do not be deceived into thinking that the film suffers in the action department due to the more serious, emotional storyline - fear not, this is still, after all, a James Bond movie, so there are still explosions, gunfights, chases and romance aplenty. Apted has also shown his stripes as a superior action film director with such memorable setpieces as attack on a caviar factory by helicopters with giant sawblades dangling from them, a huge confrontation aboard a nuclear submarine, and an explosive ski chase down snowy mountainsides - more than enough to keep the most action sated viewer well entertained for their 2 hours. On the whole, The World is Not Enough also sports one of the most impressive rounds of acting ever seen in a James Bond movie. Brosnan gives arguably his finest performance as Bond here, and it shows well that rather than coasting along on the role, each performance he has been discovering new aspects to the character, and adding to it to improve his performance. His Bond is much less cavalier and more serious and realistic here, with more of a ruthless cruel streak than usual - an excellent performance for which he deserves far more credit than he is bound to be granted. Sophie Marceau also proves to be easily the most complex and intriguing ""Bond girl"" to date with her exquisite performance as Elektra King, the troubled daughter and heiress to an extensive oil pipeline. Robert Carlyle is also one of the most menacing and memorable villains of the Bond movies, and in recent action movies at all. His Renard is not merely a homicidal terrorist, but also a fractured and seriously disturbed and reflective man, balancing the menacing overtones with a philosophical streak, making him a truly compelling villain. The film also builds a much larger character for M, Bond's boss, and it gives Dame Judi Dench to show what an incredibly fine actress she is - her normally hard as rocks demeanor is shattered by wonderfully portrayed feelings of uncertainty and guilt, and Dench brings M to life with a passion never before seen. It's also great to see Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane reprise his Russian mobster character Valentin Zukovsky, and he gives yet another wonderful performance in the role, this time under the pretense of being a ""legitimate businessman"". It is also unbearably tragic to see Desmond Llewelyn give his final performance as gadget guru Q, but his last time inhabiting the role proves to be one of his best performances on record, and John Cleese enters the scene in a brief cameo as Q's second in command, and proves to be a fine replacement for the beloved gadgetmaster. There is, in fact, only one real weakness to the film, and she answers to the name Denise Richards. While Richards may easily look the part of a Bond girl, however hard she tries, the poor woman simply cannot demonstrate acting talent anywhere close to matching her looks. At best she seemed to be reading her lines in a monotone off cue cards, sticking out embarrassingly in an otherwise incredibly quality film. Overall, the World is Not Enough is one of the strongest, and most complex Bond films to date, without sacrificing the entertainment value, which is there, strong as ever, as well as giving the viewer something genuine to think over... a rare feat for 007. For any Bond fans, or fans of well made, quality action movies with a little something more to think over, The World is Not Enough is one of the best films on the market - definitely worth a viewing.-9/10",The World Is Not Enough

94,Joxerlives,Good but unexceptional Bond film,7,18 May 2014,"Pierce Brosnan was unfortunate that his best Bond film was his first and afterwards there was nowhere really for him to go. 'The World is Not Enough' (the Bond family's rather grandiose motto) is not bad but doesn't come up to the high standard set by Goldeneye.The Good? The opening scene in Spain is rather dull although the subsequent chase along the Thames is terrific, we finally got some value out of the Millennium Dome. Although you rather wonder if Bond had torpedoes on his jet boat why he just didn't fire them earlier and finish her off? Great to see Robbie Coltrane back as Valentin (always love continuity where they bring back a character you've seen before rather than just introduce someone as an 'old friend') and a real shame that they chose to kill him off. Very topical with the storyline of pipelines bringing oil from the former Soviet empire, you could expect to read it in The Economist. Very touching to see Desmond Llewelyn's final scene, especially as he died shortly later. She gets huge abuse but I like Denise Richards as Christmas Jones, she's maybe the sexiest ever Bond girl in a true pornstar way, very Lara Croft (certainly more memorable than the ones in 'You Only Live Twice' or 'The Living Daylights' and 'Thunderball'). We also have a female villainess for the first time and Bond ruthlessly guns her down, once again showing the steel beneath the wit and charm. Rather like the relationship between Alexa and her henchman, you wonder who is beguiling whom and it seems certain he genuinely cared for her if not the other way around? The bad? John Cleese was a big mistake, you get the impression that he was just paying for his latest divorce. The film is too long and it's a little unsettling that Alexa's billionaire father seems to be able to use MI6 as his personal muscle? So okay, but not brilliant.",The World Is Not Enough
95,Beta_Gallinger,"A good third Bond film with Pierce Brosnan, even if it's not as good as his first",7,16 November 2008,"This nineteenth official Bond film, Pierce Brosnan's third of four, and the last one before the turn of the millennium (yes, even taking into account that the beginning of this millennium was in 2001, not 2000, as the next Bond film was released in 2002), apparently got mixed reviews upon its release, but I think it's pretty good. Maybe not quite as good as Brosnan's first, ""GoldenEye"", but a bit better than his second, ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", and I may not have expected it to be any better than that one. It doesn't appear to be any more popular than its immediate predecessor, but my opinion still remains.In Bilbao, Spain, James Bond manages to retrieve money that belongs to oil tycoon Sir Robert King, and bring it back to the MI6 headquarters in London, England. However, this money turns out to be explosive, and as soon as King touches it, it detonates and kills him! After this, Bond is sent to protect King's daughter and heiress, Elektra, who is taking over her father's oil business. Renard is a man who is now living with a bullet in his head, and can no longer feel physical pain! He is responsible for the death of Sir Robert, and plans to have an oil pipeline destroyed! Bond is joined on the mission by Dr. Christmas Jones, an American nuclear physicist, and they must work together to foil Renard's plans, which happen to be more deadly than originally thought, and whose side is Elektra really on?! Without a doubt, this nineteenth installment in the official James Bond movie franchise has a very steady beginning, starting with 007's mission in Spain, and going from there to London, where Bond chases after an assassin following the explosion, which is very exciting and sometimes humorous as well. After the theme song, the film continues steadily, and includes another humorous scene with Q, where he talks about his retirement, and introduces his apprentice, played by well known funnyman John Cleese. After that, there's a suspenseful and memorable ski chase (even though this certainly wasn't the first time they included a ski chase in a Bond film). Despite all this, the film sometimes goes downhill a bit, and picks up again after a while. Other suspenseful highlights include the trip through the pipeline, and M learning the truth. For the most part, despite the stumbles, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is a thrilling romp with quite a bit of humour.After playing Q for decades, this film finally marked the end for Desmond Llewelyn in the role, and he sadly passed away soon after this film was released. Although he lived well into his eighties, he still died tragically in a road accident. He played Q in the vast majority of the Bond films made in the 20th century, through five different actors playing James Bond, and while he only appeared briefly in each film, his scenes tended to be humorous and memorable, so he is definitely not forgotten. Sean Connery and Roger Moore certainly didn't finish in the franchise as Bond with very good films, and neither did Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, who started right at the beginning with Connery and went out with Moore, but I would say at least Llewelyn made his last appearance as Q in a decent movie. R.I.P. In conclusion, while ""The World Is Not Enough"" is one of the polarizing Bond films, I certainly can't say avoid it like the plague.",The World Is Not Enough
96,vip_ebriega,'Enough' is never enough,9,5 May 2008,"My Take: Brosnan continues to imbue Bond with gentlemanly charms and rough edginess. The James Bond movies are like Q's gadgets. They're made with all the usual refinements, all the usual attachments, yet every time, its always different. Number 19 in the Bond series is THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, a surprisingly great and immensely underrated modernization of 007. Not only is it Pierce Brosnan's best outing as the suave British super-spy, but its the best Bond film in years. It has everything we pay for in a 007 film, action and thrills at their signature Bond style. Although it requires a certain amount of modernization to allow Bond to fit in to the 90's, the film still carries the traditional Bond, martinis, girls and guns all included. Even if its new, it's still Bond.Pierce Brosnan, arguably, offers his best performance as 007, who is sent on a mission to track a terrorist who may be responsible for the assassination of Richard King, a multi-millionaire oil company tycoon, as well as protect his daughter and heir Elektra (Sophie Marceau), whose serious with her father's business, but still great in bed. The villain is a terrorist called Renard (Robert Carlyle), who has a unique feature: a bullet is lodged into his head, making him immune to any pain until his untimely death. He, like all traditional Bond villains, holds Doomsday in his hands, and intends to drop it. Bond comes across a group of allies and foes including sexy nuclear scientist Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) and crime-boss Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane, returning to the role from the original). Not to mention the lady M, played once again competently by Judi Dench, who is also given much more to do. As well as Desmond Llewellyn's last performance as Q, handing the job to his protégé, played by John Cleese (""If you're Q, does that mean ""R""?"" Bond asks.) THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH won't be complete as an official 007 film without the traditional daredevil stunts. The opening sequence contains a boat chase across the River Thames (in both land and water, no less). There's also a para-hawk assault at the French Alps and an assault in a Caviar factory where Bond is pursued by helicopters armed with large saws. Action scenes are in abundance of course, but also with the usual added wit to the screenplay. Director Michael Apted makes an ideal director and composer David Arnold produces a terrific score, capturing the thrills.The film does have its flaws. Denise Richards lacks the realism of being a Nuclear scientist. The sight of Richards with short shorts and a sleeveless shirt isn't really helping. Her acting pales in comparison to her compatriot, Ms. Marceau as Elektra King, which is superior. But otherwise, she's fine, while others are superior. Brosnan is tougher this time as Bond, but still the same sexist, misogynist dinosaur M says he is. He's still got the charm and almost just as good as Connery, but let's leave that discussion to the message board please.Heavily under-appreciated, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is exciting and spectacular. The kind of film we expected 007 to be in. I mean, danger, action, martinis, girls, guns and ""kaboom!"" There's got to be when he's around, and don't worry, there are.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",The World Is Not Enough
97,one9eighty,Making Christmas come more than once a year.,7,25 September 2020,"In a nutshell:
Bond is charged with babysitting the daughter of an assassinated billionaire tycoon but soon learns of a plot which could affect the world.In more detail:
Sir Robert King is assassinated at the hands of madman Viktor ""Renard"" Zokas (KGB agent turned terrorist), who also kidnapped his daughter Elektra. Bond is charged with babysitting her but he uncovers a mystery that leads him to suspect that Renard is planning something big which could destabilize world finances. Its revealed that Renard will be a formidable foe, he feels no pain thanks to bullet in the head from 009 which is trapped but gradually dulling his sense until he dies. Bond goes undercover to try and find out what is going on, but while Renard is messing around with a nuclear bomb, Dr Christmas Jones blows his cover. Renard hints that he is working with Elektra and then tries to destroy the place but Bond escapes with Dr Jones. While this is going on Elektra has visited and kidnapped M. Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky for info and with the help of Dr Jones figures out the plan that Renard has - to destroy Istanbul, which would destroy some of the world's major oil pipelines, leaving King with the monopoly... wait, wouldn't that make Renard just a henchman to a different mastermind?
With M kidnapped, Renard and Elektra on the loose, and very little time, it's up to Bond to save the world.Review:
Brosnan does well as Bond and I have no issues with him. Carlyle is brilliant as a main villain despite his occasionally dodgy accent and Marceau, who is initially lukewarm become better the longer she is onscreen thanks to some good writing. The combination of Carlyle and Marceau is one of the cleverest parts of the film, while a lot of people looks at Carlyle as the main villain, it is actually Marceau that should be given that credit. Carlyle may start off as the main bad guy, and everything we learn and see points to him too, but by the time we see him on-screen he's transitioned into a henchman role - doing the bidding of a secret mastermind, who happens to be somebody who he previously kidnapped - Elektra King (Marceau). It's not until the end of the film that the truth comes out, and then it gives the film a little bit of a different feel. A Bond film where a woman is the main criminal mastermind and it somebody that's been right underneath the hero's nose since the opening of the film. As good and clever as that was, I was baffled by the inclusion of Denise Richards. She is hyped up as being the cleverest person in the film, but throughout she is constantly clueless and baffled by occurrences. I do not think the production team were treating this character seriously with the likes of Ginger Spice (Gerry Halliwell) being given an audition too, despite no prior big screen experience (barring ""Spiceworld""). There is no wonder she won a Golden Raspberry for her role. I also wasn't rerally sold on John Cleese ebing sold as Desmond Llewlyn's replacement - I don't think the level of humour being brought was right for the film.I enjoyed the film. It is not the perfect Bond film by a long way, and there are issues with some parts of it, but it makes up for it by being strong in other areas. At times though it does feel like this is a Bond by numbers exercise again: gadget - check; women - check; villain - check; over the top escape sequence -check.There is an attempt to step forward, making it cooler, darker, younger and more modern. But the film also takes a step back too with plot issues and predictable scenes and outcomes. It may have been Bronsnan's best outing as the hero in the franchise, but other things in the film detract from how good it could have been. The stunts are big, the antics are excessive, explosions, gadgets.... All the usual really, but something just doesn't feel right. The more I think about it, the more I get confused as to what it is... so I won't think abut it anymore.This 12 -rated film is fun and watchable. You do not need to have seen the entire franchise to appreciate it. It isn't too complex, the themes and content are not too adult that I couldn't put younger viewers in front of it and with good action and plenty of nostalgia it should be good for the older audience members too.In terms of Bond films this is a 8 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 7 out of 10.",The World Is Not Enough
98,Stampsfightclub,Slick thriller in which the actors shine,8,31 October 2008,"James Bond (Brosnan) is sent on a mission to protect the daughter of recently deceased Robert King and is soon finding clues to who was behind his murder.After two impressive enthusiastic performances as Bond in Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies, Pierce Brosnan added more drama to the character in this tense if slightly over-informed thriller.Brosnan again cements the character to the ground with some delicious acting worthy of praise with cheeky puns and great on screen relationships. The adding of the drama was a necessity to the character to create a more human feeling over that superhero cover he previously conveyed. The dramatic reflection on the plot is executed well by Brosnan and has only been bettered by Craig's recent reprisal of the British agent.The actor is given great support by an exceptional performance by Sophie Marceau (Braveheart) as Electra King. Marceau is able to create a vulnerable character and create a sense of mystery about her, a sad sense of sophistication. She is easily the best Bond girl of the Brosnan era and is right up there with the best characters in the series.Denise Richards (Starship Troopers) is disappointing in her role as Christmas Jones, a rather ordinary and plain character who seems just to be along for the ride. Unlike King's mysterious elegance, Jones just feels like an ordinary person caught up in an adventure and is there to just to make up numbers.Two of Britain's finest actors are on screen together after their famous partnership in hit TV series Cracker. Robbie Coltrane and Robert Carlyle are easily the most interesting actors to watch. Coltrane's Zukovsky adds humour to the plot where Carlyle creates the best Bond villain of the Brosnan era with a cold hearted character in Renard, a man with a bullet in his head. Carlyle adds that extra something to the narrative with a strong and dominant protagonist and is one of the main reasons to watch.The opening to the 19th Bond is a very exciting affair with Bond chasing a villain in a speedboat with the then newly constructed Millennium Dome in the background. Fast and action packed with gadgets, this opening sequence will please audiences of any age who will simply smile when we see the straightening of the tie moment.The plot balances the action well alongside the events of Elektra's pipeline business. The political agenda alongside the heavy use of character history is distracting and will have you scratching your head trying to recall the past but like other Bond films you don't need to know who is who and what is what as the action and intensity give the overall picture.",The World Is Not Enough
99,gbheron,Best Bond Since Sean,8,15 July 2002,"Not only do I feel that ""The World Is Not Enough"" is the best Bond film since Sean Connery handed over the franchise, but that this movie is a welcome departure from the path many action adventure films have been taking the last 20 or so years. That is to say, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is not a 'comic book' movie. My use of the term 'comic book' does not imply that it's based on a real comic book. I use the term to describe a specific film genre that is not necessarily derogatory. The characteristics of 'comic book' films include simple plotlines, two-dimensional characters, lack of moral ambiguity, cessation of the laws of physics and a corresponding strong reliance on special effects. Do you get the picture?And since Sean, that's how the Bond films were evolving...until ""The World Is Not Enough"". Not that it's a complete departure from this trend, but this Bond possesses more human elements than we've seen in a long time. Bond is a real spy again relying on his wits, not gadget-man relying on special effects. And as such I think that the movie is all the better for it. Much so.  As I said, this the best Bond in years, so keep up the good work!",The World Is Not Enough
100,stamper,Electrifying,7,25 November 2003,"The World is not Enough, Pierce Brosnans 3rd outing as the British Secret Agent, is a vast improvement over the slightly disappointing Tomorrow Never Dies in my opinion and is his 2nd best to date (end of 2003). The story, as simple as it seems in the beginning has more layers to it than one would expect in the beginning and that, along with some good chemistry between the main characters, good action and good wit, make this film enjoyable and entertaining as a whole. I was especially impressed by Elektra's character and Sophie Marceau's great acting, which makes her my 2nd favorite Bond-girl right behind Famke Janssen. Speaking of acting, I must say that I found Robert Carlyle's acting to be somewhat disappointing, along with the whole character itself. I was not just disappointed about what Carlyle did with the freedom' he had, but in a way I was disappointed in the entire character, who in my opinion could have been worked out better and in more detail. Carlyle wasn't the worst actor in the film though. The worst in that department was Denise Richards, who despite pulling of a good Christmas Jones, failed be credible as Doctor Jones. This was particularly evident in the last 15 minutes of the film, the worst part of the entire experience, in which she seemed rather misplaced. I must say that I found it astonishing that she was so bad, since she had managed to portray her character so well the entire part before that, but maybe that's all she's good at then, looking good and making chit-chat conversation. Concluding I would say that this is a pretty good James Bond film, featuring a great Sophie Marceau; a mediocre villain; a pretty but; bad Doctor Jones and an overall uninspired ending.
7,25 out of 10
post scriptum: Last Bond with Desmond Llewelyn due to the fact that Mr. Llewelyn died only a month after The World is not Enough premiered. His replacement had been introduced in the film however, something of a macabre coincidence.",The World Is Not Enough
101,The_Movie_Cat,The Best Bond Film of the last 12 years,7,31 December 1999,"... okay, so that only includes three other films, but The World Is Not Enough does have some sense of consolidation about it.I WANTED to hate this film, truly I did. The overblown Brosnan era, all money-spinning set-piece explosions and dumbed-down formula is not for me. The ""best Bond since Connery"" is regurgitated by any critic going, yet all I see is a bland, shallow characterisation that trades in his ""licence to kill"" for indiscriminately machine-gunning his enemies.Yet whereas the two previous entries in the canon, Goldeneye particularly, treated their audience with no respect whatsoever, TWINE at least tries to shade in some detail around the formula.Watching the film makes you wonder what really goes in on Bond's head. For the millionth time he has a high-speed ski chase, yet this is no stunt man then close-up of Roger Moore in front of a filmed backdrop situation. Okay, well, it IS, but effects have improved so that it is almost believable that Brosnan is leaping all over the place and stopping four very nice flying bobsleighs. Does he think of his parents, killed in the novels during an avalanche? And what of his late wife from On Her Majesty's Secret Service? (The film which gave us ""The World Is Not Enough"" as Bond's family motto). Does Bond remember her when she is mentioned in this film, or think of her when he sees Blofield-lookalike Renard?But that was then, and this is very much the now, with a 007 that leaps onto the Millennium Dome with possibly the best title sequence in memory. A herd of Rorsharch ink blot tests fill the screen to a so-so song by Garbage, though sadly there is very little psychology in the film, amateur or otherwise. This pans out into a film that loses its muster ever-so-slightly, but still packs enough involvement to keep the viewer interested.Robbie Coltrane returns with the worst ""Scotsman-doing-a-foreign-accent"" since Connery had the lead role. Denise Richards appears as the not-very-good-entredre-and-frankly-quite-ludicrously-named ""Christmas Jones"", who, with her generous figure, cupid's bow lips and pixie nose may not be the most sophisticated Bond girl (or anything approaching a nuclear physicist) but is probably the sexiest. John Cleese makes a cringingly unfunny cameo as Q's successor, and in all honesty, never mind tradition, wouldn't the 007 films be better without these perfunctory and wearily-predictable ""Q gadget"" scenes? They no longer even serve a plot specification, as many of Bond's gadgets aren't explained in this section, and are brought into play (including a crass watch that is more Batman than Bond) without explanation or signposting. As a mark of respect to Desmond Llewellyn (who sadly died Dec 19th, 1999) I feel the ""Q"" element should end here.But again I must insist this film is slightly better than Dalton's below-par ""Licence to Kill"" and easily eclipses Brosnan's earlier efforts. Okay, I'm not too keen on the lacklustre disco soundtrack that passes as incidental, I would've liked to have seen more of David Calder, and maybe we could have done without Renard's silly pun about ""nuclear family"", but in criticising this film I am clutching at straws. What really holds it together is Robert Carlyle, an exceptional actor who breaks the previously-established ""rule"" that a good actor (Christophers Lee and Walken, along with Jonathan Pryce) doesn't necessarily make a good Bond villain. Okay, maybe he should have had more screen time, and maybe he should have been tougher (for someone that has no feelings, he sure says ""ow"" a lot when clobbered by Bond). But Carlyle's real strength is in upping the ante. In film, as with his brilliant turn as Trainspotting's ""Begbie"", or even television, taking the lead as ""Hamish McBeth"" or playing opposite Coltrane in ""Cracker"", his intensity is infectious, causing all around him to try that much harder. An outstanding actor with tremendous presence, particularly considering his height, I would stake Carlyle as the single greatest actor of the 90s and would argue that it is his presence alone that causes this movie to work so well.This higher level of acting even rubs off on the normally flat Brosnan, who gives his best performance by far with a genuinely nasty edge underneath. He's still to get the danger of Connery, be as funny as Moore, or achieve the depth of Dalton, but for once we get the impression of a real person, rather than someone going through the motions. Nice to see Bond doing a little detective work again, too, rather than the glorified action man he's been of late. Credit goes to Judi Dench, who, as an M in the field (not as ridiculous as it sounds), does sterling work and plays off well against the afore-mentioned Carlyle. Hard to believe that in television land she's a light sitcom actress.But what really sets this film out from the rest of 90s Bonds is its story, which, while hardly intellectually taxing, at least gives us enough twists and turns in the plot to ensure that concentration is required at all times.I would rate this as amongst the ten best Bond films, though in truth it still doesn't come close to Connery's legacy or what Dalton COULD have achieved given the right backing.

You're ready for the opening action sequence, sexy title sequence, gadgets, search for the bad guy and beating the bad guy. This is no exception so you have to see which parts of the formula are good and which aren't so good. The World is Not enough is above average in the Bond girls department. Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards are excellent eye candy and are well above average although Richards is not exactly convincing as a top Nuclear Scientist. The direction, credits, stunts, action, dialogue and Brosnan are all upto standard. Unfortunately Carlyle as Bond's adversary and the plot aren't up to standard, so overall it's a fairly average Bond film. 6/10",The World Is Not Enough

Brosnan acquits himself very well and the villainess has a poignant story though the villain seems like a regurgitation of Bloefeld, at least physically. The gold-toothed henchmen adds some subtle comic relief. Thankfully he isn't overused. As for the much maligned Christmas Jones (Richards), what law says a nuclear scientist can't be a knockout? I will concede that Richards is not the most gifted thespian but then again in this role she doesn't need to be. The stunts are good but not the best in the series. The pre-credit sequence at the bank and the escape from the underground tunnels being the best. Overall solid entertainment, 7/10. On an aside the Nintendo 64 version of the game is very good though not in the class of the seminal Goldeneye also for that system.

107,bopdog,Does this stale movie indicate a new cultural rift between America and the world?,4,20 February 2000,"This was showing at the local ""dollar theater,"" so I decided to see it recently. I can only echo the critics on this one-- some fine moments, better than the typical James Bond fare of recent decades, but the whole thing is very, very tired. The good parts include a toning-down of the cartoonish aspects-- although there are still enough ridiculously improbable and impossible events to satisfy even the most demanding 12 year-old.The actors did a fine job. The stunt folks certainly executed their tasks with enough skill-- but the movie simply feels flat and dead. I don't think ANY changes or improvements could improve the 007 theme at this point, nor could any change save the franchise. It all still revolves around James Bond surviving because the villains and their hirelings have this fatal tendency (fatal to them) of gloating first, and shooting later. Well duh! Mike Meyers made great fun with this plot gimmick in his ""Austin Powers"" movie-- the point seems obvious to all by now. But how come the James Bond copyright holders don't know this?This brings up another point, maybe a disturbing one. If, and it's a big if, foreign movie goers (i.e., non-U.S./Canadian) are still drawn into the James Bond allure, and if they still buy the package and enjoy the recent product, it might indicate that the split between American and European/Asian cultural taste has widened a lot more than the ""new world order"" folks would have us believe. Have we become that different? Maybe-- but it is a bit odd to think that the rest of the world is still living in the 1960s. It makes me wonder what other differences might show themselves-- differences on important, real-life topics such as human rights, economics, world peace, etc.???I didn't give this a ""1,"" because it was well made; but it isn't quite up to even average quality for a 1999/2000 movie either. So I gave this a ""4.""",The World Is Not Enough
108,Movie-12,"Slick, action packed and well constructed. ***1/2 out of ****.",8,2 February 2000,"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH (1999) ***1/2Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards, Sophie Marceau, Robbie Coltrane, Judi Dench, and John Cleese Directed by Michael Apted, written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. Running time: 127 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for strong action violence and sexuality)By Blake French:	""The World is not Enough"" is the type of James Bond movie audiences have grown to love. With the latest installments being ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""Goldeneye,"" I was starting to lose confidence in our philandering spy. However, Michael Apted's new thriller has enough action excitement, character chemistry, and plot twists for several films, leaving ""The World is Not Enough,"" as not only an absorbing adventure, but also a strongly crafted one.	Pierce Brosnan is easily the best James Bond next to Sean Connery. He returns as private agent 007, licensed to kill, James Bond, working for his employers M (Judi Dench) and R (John Cleese). In this film, the line of events center on the young daughter of an oil tycoon named Elektra King (Sophie Marceau). She is under much pressure from many worldly individual's due to her inheritance and responsibility with important pipelines. After Elektra's father is murdered, Bond comes to her with the instinct that she might be in danger. Electra realizes Bond is correct, especially when they are chased through the mountains by deadly terrorists with machine guns. She accepts his protection, and ends up sleeping with Bond, developing a romantic relationship that may or may not be a big mistake.	What makes ""The World Is Not Enough"" so good is the development of its villain, named Renard (Robert Carlyle). The way he is presented is exceedingly above average. The filmmakers gradually build up tension the way he is executed on screen. We first hear of him from dialogue of his employee's, who, as they are about to be arrested, kill themselves in fear of what this Renard will do to them. ""I can protect you"" pleads Bond, ""Not from him"" states the accomplice as she puts herself out of her misery.
	We then learn of his level of power and his special abilities. Renard is able to withstand enormous amounts of pain due to a bullet wound in his brain that is slowly killing him, but until it does he'll grow stronger every day. The audience then sees his figure on a computer image; a ghastly looking man with an unmerciful, evil look on his face. When we finally do meet Renard in person, he holds a fire stone in his palm as he beholds smart, decisive plans and murders one of his failed workers.  This development is not near the level of the material presented in ""The Usual Suspects,"" but as sharp and smart as the writing otherwise comes.
 ""The World is Not Enough"" also prevails with its structure. The film's first act is precise and persuasive in its motives and characters. The flawlessly planned break comes when Bond decides to seek out and protect the third witness, Elektra. Each scene following this series of events is exciting and forward moving. The action scenes do not distract the plot from becoming successful, but evolve the tension and contain purpose. I did think the third act dragged on a bit too long, although it did sum up our conflicts. This is a movie that is focused and yet at the same time goes in so many different directions and contains so many unexpected twists, it is hard to keep up with it.  	The acting is galvanizing energetic and, for the most part, well cast. Pierce Brosnan once again brings his sly, stylish wit to the Bond character, giving him life and the womanizing stunts and skill we know 007 to accommodate. Robert Carlyle proves to reprise another villain role, straight from his earlier film, ""Ravenous."" Sophie Marceau is also very charming and seductive, as always, conveying elegant beatitude. The young, perfect Bond bosom, Denise Richards, only proves to be miscast here. We are unable to believe her character, a nuclear physicist named Dr. Christmas Jones. Although she does provide us with one of the movie's most memorable lines: as she and Bond lay in bed, we here James question ""I thought Christmas comes only once a year?""Brought to you by MGM Productions.",The World Is Not Enough
109,timdalton007,Best Of The Brosnan Bond's,9,1 August 2012,"After two highly successful films, it was clear that Pierce Brosnan's James Bond had definitely caught on with both the public and critics alike. But Brosnan's second film had been criticized for its lack of plot and, perhaps taking this criticism onboard, brought a change of pace for Brosnan's third Bond film, The World Is Not Enough. Bringing onboard acclaimed director Michael Apted, better known for dramas and having not directed a full blown action film before, this film would be a more character driven but no less action packed affair all around.The change starts with Brosnan's 007. While Brosnan had certainly proved he could handle both the action and more ""acting"" moments in his previous films, Brosnan is given the chance to show his acting chops in this film. This Bond hearkens back in some ways to Dalton's Bond: a tough but vulnerable man of action caught up in a world where nobody is quite what they seem. The vulnerability is partly physical (the shoulder injury incurred at the end of the pre-titles sequence) and partly emotional as witnessed in the film's last hour or so. Bond here is no less tough or action capable but Brosnan finds the right balance between the two, excelling throughout and proving he is more than an amalgamation of his predecessors. The result then is perhaps Brosnan's best performance as Bond.Far less successful is Bond girl Christmas Jones, played by Denise Richards. While Richards definitely has the looks (and indeed wardrobe) to be a Bond girl, she lacks the acting talent to pull off the nuclear physicist role believably. The character of Jones is given a ton of exposition and Richards, try though she might, simply spits them out as fast as she can as though she might forget them at any moment. It's hard to tale if the role is badly or written or if Richards is simply the most mis-cast Bond girl since Tanya Roberts in A View To A Kill, but Richards' Christmas Jones is the one bad spot on an otherwise good cast.Far more successful is Sophie Marceau as Elektra King and Robert Carlyle as Renard. Marceau in particular shines throughout, given one of the best written female roles in any Bond film and quite possibly the best since Tracy three decades earlier. One imagines that, in the hands of a lesser actress like her co-star Richards, the role of Elektra and the plot twist that comes with her would simply fail to be convincing. But Marceau makes the role believable as she plays two very different versions of the same character, switching for the film's back half. It also helps that she shares some good chemistry with Brosnan which also allows her to outshine Richards as well. Carlyle also shines as the film's villain, the character being built up until his first appearance when the film is almost half over. But while he might not be physically impressive at first, Carlyle proves himself to be more than a match for Bond in both brawn and brain. Like Marceau, he makes an unlikely twist (his own injury) seem not only credible but cool as well.The supporting cast is strong as well. Judi Dench's M is given her largest role yet and is given far more of a character than either of her male predecessors. Robbie Coltrane returns as Valentin Zukovsk and is given far more screen time than in Goldeneye and he makes the most of it. Also of note are Serena Scott Thomas as Dr. Molly Warmflash, Ulrich Thomsen as Davidov and John Cleese as R. Last but not least is of course Desmond Llewelyn, making his final appearance as gadget master Q and he is given a proper send off with one of the film's most memorable moments. The result is an overall strong cast.Unlike the previous 007 film, which was action driven to a fault, this film is a far more character driven story. Both the script and Apted's direction bring this out following the film's opening credits with the film dealing with both vulnerability and trust. As a result, this film presents us a Bond who is perhaps at his most vulnerable and, as a result, more than willing to be cold blooded. The characters around him (minus Christmas Jones) feel far more fleshed out just at a script level than those in Tomorrow Never Dies. Also, the film's plot, with its focus on oil and terrorism, is incredibly relevant thirteen years after its release and, combined with the character focusing, feels like a test run for the Craig films that were to follow in a few years' time.That isn't to say that this film is any less action driven. The film's pre-credit sequence alone contains not one but two stunt filled sequences featuring both Bond's escape from a Swiss bankers office in Spain, a terrorist attack at MI6 and a boat chase up the Thames in its aftermath. It's both the series' lost opening sequence and quite possibly its best as well. From there we are treated to a ski sequence echoing On Her Majesty's Secret Service and numerous firefights ranging from a missile silo to a caviar factory. The film ends with a fight sequence with echoes of the climatic fight from Thunderball, though not quite as memorable. These sequences, combined with the more character driven moments, makes this one of the best paced of the Bond films.So where does all that leave this film? It features Brosnan at his best as 007, it has a strong cast for the most part and it finds the right balance between its characters and its action sequences. As a result then, The World Is Not Enough is easily the best film of the Brosnan era.",The World Is Not Enough
110,FlickJunkie-2,"Great stunts, mediocre plot",7,28 May 2000,"This is the 19th installment of what has become an institution in filmmaking.  James Bond has to be the most enduring of characters in film. He has been in Her Majesty's Secret Service for almost 40 years now and barely looks 45!  `TWINE' is true to the late Bond formula.  A flimsy script serves as an excuse for Bond to wreak havoc and mayhem on evildoers in the name of saving the world.  As always, it is full of gadgets, gizmos, lots of corny puns, serial sexual conquests, pyrotechnics, and stunts galore.  It is a genre unto itself, part comedy, part action/adventure, and part sex fantasy.This installment concentrated on taking the action and stunts to a new and exciting level and in that regard succeeded brilliantly.  This was one of the most impressively stunt intense films I've ever seen.  There were stunts that made use of every element; air, water, earth and fire.  Michael Apted set the bar at a new level with innovative and complex stunt work brilliantly done.  The DVD has a bonus feature that gives behind the scenes looks at the stunts and you get a real appreciation for how much planning and work goes into setting each one up.  I was surprised to learn that Pierce Brosnan actually did some of his own stunts.  Also, Apted's choice of locations was fabulous, with some of the most majestic backdrops you will ever see for an action flick.As impressive as the action was, I still long for the days when James Bond films were stories of international intrigue, with strong and mysterious plot lines, rather than a predictable succession of death defying chase scenes.Pierce Brosnan gets high marks this time out in the starring role.  He was witty, charming, cool, tough and very athletic.  Sophie Marceau was alluring as the victim turned villain, though the part was limited in scope.  Besides her bewitching beauty, Marceau is a terrific dramatic actor and this part really didn't allow her much opportunity to show the breadth of her talents (See Firelight' if you want a better example).  Denise Richards landed her first part playing a grownup in this film.  Her character was included strictly for the titillation factor, a role for which Richards was correctly cast and is amply equipped.  Fortunately, the part did not have a heavy line load and didn't require any real acting, an area in which she has scant assets.This film gets a 10 for the action sequences, and about a 4 for the story. I split the difference and gave it a 7/10 overall.  As Bond films go, this was one of the more entertaining in recent memory.  Action fans will love it.  For those looking for an intriguing plot line, probably not.",The World Is Not Enough
111,redkiwi,What a pile of pants!,2,4 December 1999,"I have seen some rubbish in my time, and some rubbish in Bond films, but this was just a cynical money making scheme with no cinematic merit whatsoever.The opening sequence was supposed to be this great action scene ""showcasing"" the Millennium Dome and other London landmarks.  In truth it was very uninspiring and yawn enducing, and not a patch on Roger Moore's swamp powerboat chase of the mid 70s (Live + Let Die ??), from which much of the action was stolen.The whole film was very ho hum, down to the boring Robbie Coltrane and the surprisingly rubbish Robert Carlyle - who with his silly scar and huge rollover sweater was a dead ringer for those huge necked aliens out of Doctor Who.  And they were probably giving a better acting performance too!Brosnan was average at best and the only redeeming feature was the gorgeous Denise Richards in several scantily clad outfits - although having her dunked in water just so that she could get a wet t-shirt was a bit off - and even the lines about her name (character's name was Christmas Jones), such as ""and I thought Christmas only came once a year"" were predictable from the second that she mentioned her name.All in all a complete waste of time and not one to see again.",The World Is Not Enough
112,Bogmeister,"BOND#19: He Feels Nothing,She Feels Too Much",7,7 August 2007,"MASTER PLAN: blow up competing Russian oil pipelines. By the time of this 3rd Brosnan Bonder, one gets the impression that Bond really needs to start being careful with women. Whereas the Bonders finally acknowledged women's liberation in the late seventies, the nineties seemed to present women's liberation gone mad - for example, one of Bond's most lethal adversaries was Onatopp in ""GoldenEye."" This sense is further validated during the lengthy pre-credits teaser in this one, where-in most of the action and chasing revolves around a female assassin (whom Bond innocently flirts with before she starts the mayhem). Then, of course, the main femme fatale here, Elektra, transpires to be not all she appears to be - the female is the deadlier of the species in the nineties, for sure. Bond's advantage has always been his way with women; this strength can be subverted into a big weakness if he runs across one who is even more cunning than he is. Brosnan's weakness has always been that he was slightly more bland than Connery and even Moore, who projected strong charisma. In this one, he needs to be more intense because things get more personal and iffy all around, involving even M in some unexpected jeopardy. This works towards the film's advantage; unexpected plot twists are rare in a Bond thriller by this time. It's the interaction between Bond and a few key characters, both good & bad, that elevate this Bonder, not the now-standard chases, which definitely have a by-the-numbers feel by this point. The only saving grace to these is an early big chase which takes place on Bond's home turf of London, England, which is rare, and MI6 HQ is directly involved.Speaking of MI6, the regulars get a good workout in this one, which always makes for a more entertaining Bonder. Besides M, Moneypenny and a couple of key staff are fairly well involved with this latest mission. This is the final appearance of old Q, who has been played by the same actor since ""From Russia With Love"" 36 years earlier. We are introduced to Q's assistant and planned replacement (played by Monty Python alumnus Cleese). The credits are an eerie kaleidoscope of trippy color, as if we're back in the sixties, accompanied by a rather mournful title song by Garbage. The tone is somewhat dark throughout the film, with much of the plot and villains involving terrorism and the theme of betrayal. The main villain, Renard, has a bullet lodged in his brain, and he doesn't feel sensation like the rest of us, but this isn't really played up, even in the final fight. Besides, Renard has to take a back seat to Elektra, who gives an entirely new and twisted meaning to the femme fatale term. She turns the tables on Bond, who has always been in control of such situations before, and proves to be that woman who Bond can't really handle. On the downside, casting agents for the Bond film series aimed low yet again with the latest Bond girl: meet Christmas, nuclear physicist. The actress Richards was in her late twenties at the time, but comes across like a 19-year old. Coltrane, as Valentin, was a welcome return in the role he created in ""GoldenEye."" There's also a unique weapon, foreshadowed in an earlier scene, a series of spinning blades deployed from a helicopter. The way Bond's newest set of wheels is dealt with is painful for auto buffs. The climax with the sinking sub was kind of weak; I'd considered the story already ended 5 minutes earlier with Elektra's final scene. Bond would return in ""Die Another Day.""

113,moviesleuth2,The last of good all-out action Bond movies,10,13 June 2008,"I am sure anyone reading the title of my summary title will have two questions to ask, which I will answer up front. First is the use of the term ""all-out action."" No, ""The World is not Enough"" is not the last all-out action Bond movie, but notice I said the last GOOD one, which is true, because by all accounts ""Die Another Day"" was terrible. The second question many will ask also deals with said term, but 007's most recent outing (that has been released), ""Casino Royale"" was good, but not an all-out action extravaganza.Given the popularity of the dashing secret agent's movies, I'll assume that most people have already seen the film, and will therefore skip the synopsis. If, by some act of who knows what, you are reading this review without having seen the movie, drop everything and see it. It's not that I'm going to write any spoilers, it's just that to not see this movie is to deny one's self a lot of brain-candy pleasure.Once again, Pierce Brosnan is James Bond, charming with an almost invincibility and an insatiable desire to woo beautiful women. For his third outing as the guy in the black tux, Brosnan hasn't worn out his welcome. Robert Carlyle creates a suitable villain, and though while not the creepiest of Brosnan's nemeses as Bond (that would be Sean Bean from Brosnan's first outing as 007), Carlyle chews the scenery well and does what he is required of him. Less impressive is Denise Richards as one of the two beauties that grace the screen (that actually play major roles). She does what she's supposed to, but for the most part, she's rather flat (though her first scene was great). It's also nice to see Judi Dench and Robbie Coltrane again, and Samantha Bond is delightful in her short scenes as Bond's female counterpart, Miss Moneypenny.Where have you gone, Sophie Marceau? Carlyle may be the main villain in ""The World is Not Enough,"" but the most villainous and most interesting character is Marceau's Elektra King. She sinks her teeth into the role, and demands our attention fully whenever she's on screen alone, and shares it equally with Brosnan whenever she is on screen with him. Marceau is a talented actress, and should be in more American movies. Judging by Hollywood's fickleness with new actors, her appearance in Rob Reiner's monstrosity ""Alex and Emma"" has thus far destroyed her chances of being in more American movies. That can't be blamed on her, with all of its star power her opportunity to be in it was probably too good to pass up.""The World is Not Enough"" is a great James Bond adventure, and is definitely worth more than a few watches by any action movie fan. It's 007 through and through.",The World Is Not Enough
114,0w0,"Plot holes, and Bond doesn't like killing?",5,11 May 2020,"Denise Richards plays a nuclear scientist in the movie (lol). Yet her character is absolutely useless in every dangerous scene... like when Bond and the bad-guy are fighting, she literally just stands there doing nothing, whilst Bond is getting his face smashed in. She's supposed to be the smartest character in the movie, yet she's the dumbest, most useless character when she's actually presented with an opportunity to do something useful.There's a very unrealistic scene right in the first 5mins of the movie, where Bond miraculously finds a 30meter rappel rope, in a banker's office... how on earth is this remotely possible?Also, Bond has the opportunity to kill the main bad-guy in the story, but he chooses not to... as a 'professional british assassin with license to kill', he seems to only use that license on 'random goons' throughout the movie and never on the actual evil-doers. It just creates another plot-hole.Other than the glaring plot-holes that spoil the movie, it's an OK action film, and there's plenty of pretty girls to look at while Bond runs around NOT shooting bad-guys. 5/10",The World Is Not Enough

Pierce Brosnan does his bit well, looking tense during the tense bits and cool during the cool bits. My favorite James Bond, yes, *including* Sean Connery, so sue me.However, the James Bond shtick (which they are trying to modernize) has always been cheesy. Compared to regular action films, which have gotten more sophisticated since James Bond emerged in the 1960s, in ""The World is Not Enough"", the badguys didn't chill me, and the female physicist was pretty bad (Denise Richards). There were many disconnects with plot, which was confusing, especially in the last 10 minutes. Lots of hastily explained button-pushing and machinery and we're not sure what our hero's trying to accomplish. I was very disappointed by the John Cleese role, which fell flat in my opinion, and hope they work that out for the next film, ""Die Another Day"".It's pretty good compared with ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", but I liked ""Goldeneye"" better myself. I used to love this stuff but I'm starting to realize that compared with other kinds of action movie films, the James Bond thing tries too hard and comes across as silly. You know, they can't have a normal car chase, it has to be super-duper-boat-plane-cars. Jackie Chan films by contrast tend to keep it simple, and the humans and their cleverly set up situations provide the tension, rather than the props. ""The Living Daylights"" is a Bond flick which shows some restraint in this regard. Also ""For Your Eyes Only"", in which Bond's car blows up, so they have a car chase in a dumpy old Volkswagen and it's great.Who should see this film:-- Action movie buffs with nothing better to do on a rainy day,or if you don't find James Bond films silly-- I can't think of anyone elseI'll give ""The World is Not Enough"" a 6 out of 10.",The World Is Not Enough

119,FilmFanInTheHouse,A Nice change to Bond,8,16 March 2007,"The World Is Not Enough is the 19th James Bond to be released and once again, starred Pierce Brosnan as the secret agent for the third time. Each Brosnan Bond film really has a different feel to the previous one. Possibly thanks to the change of director. This film feels very different to the last two. The movie seems more character based than action based. The story is actually an interesting story, but might not be to everyones taste. Some of the stars are a nice addition, but i don't think there is enough character to the villains to make them iconic. If someone asked you to name 10 Bond films, you wouldn't really remember characters called Renard and Elecktra King. Robbie Coltrane makes a welcome return, with a much larger storyline, but there are points in the movie, in which his Scottish accent does slip through. John Cleese is a breath of fresh air as Q's assistant, and speaking of Q. The producers were wise not to include him in any more scenes after his speech and departure in the film. Desmond Llewelyn who sadly died not long after this release, gives a touching and emotional exit to the franchise.The action which is included isn't as big as other Bond films, with one exception. The boat chase across the Thames with one of the best chases seen in the recent Bond films.If you like action, you might want to check some other Bonds out first, but if your prefer character development and a great story, see this.James Bond will return in Die Another Day",The World Is Not Enough

121,jhaggardjr,Excellent Bond movie,9,14 May 2000,"""The World Is Not Enough"" is the 19th James Bond movie and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as 007. This is an excellent Bond movie, just as good as Brosnan's two previous Bond films ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". This 007 adventure has terrific action, beautiful women, and a great sense of humor. It also has some very good performances. The best: French actress Sophie Marceau (of ""Braveheart"") just about blows everybody away with her portrayl of Elektra King, the daughter of an oil tycoon Bond is ordered to protect. She's a great addition to the series of Bond women from the past to the present. Denise Richards (of ""Starship Troopers"") is very good as the other Bond woman, nuclear scientist Dr. Christmas Jones (another awkward name the writers came up with). I still can't understand why most people hated this character. I think Richards is just fine in this role. Robert Carlyle (of ""The Full Monty"") is good as bad guy Renard. Robbie Coltrane is hilarious as Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky. As for the returning Bond series regulars besides Brosnan, it's great to see Judi Dench back as ""M"" this time with a much bigger part (thanks in part to her small Oscar-winning role in ""Shakespeare in Love""). Samantha Bond is also back as ""Miss Moneypenny"". I think Lois Maxwell, who was the original ""Miss Moneypenny"" for the first 14 Bond films, is proud of the job that Bond has done. And finally, Desmond Llewelyn came back for the last time as gadget inventor ""Q"". Sadly, Llewelyn died a month after the release of this movie. He was one of the best things about the James Bond movies. When I went to see the last couple of 007 flicks on the big screen, I couldn't wait to see the presence of Desmond Llewelyn. He was terrific in all the Bond movies he appeared in. He brought a lot of humor to the part of ""Q"" and those inventions were a gas. His presence will surely be missed. Getting back to the movie, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is great fun from start to finish. Make sure you check out the pre-credits opening of this movie. It's a blast.***1/2 (out of four)",The World Is Not Enough

Elektra is seeking to create an oil pipeline in a very troubled part of the world. Many players in the region want to see her fail. She also has the added threat of an ex K.G.B operative who now feels no pain looking to do her harm.Franchise clichés: Pre-title sequence - Gun barrel sequence then sequence proper with Bond helping to recover money for an old friend of M. Things go pear shaped. Has a good chase scene on a river.Theme song - Title song by Garbage. Not bad...has an old style, 1960s feel to it.Q - Check. There is movement on this front though...you'll have to see the movie to see what, though. Watching this film with subtitles, you got to see Q say ""Doh!""...Homer Simpson territory! Q has some bad quips in this movie...as does Bond.M - Implicit in the franchise is that 007 is the best that MI6 have at their disposal...this is made explicit by M in this movie, when she says: ""Bond is the best we have"" and also mentioning in words to the effect that she would never say that directly to him.Moneypenny - Perhaps a bit narky with Bond here, but maybe it is all in good fun...there does seem to be a Monica Lewinsky related joke between them.Silly female character names - Christmas Jones. Not a grotesque name, but Bond finds ways to bring in the innuendo! Sexism/misogyny - Has innuendo early on and the scenes with x-ray spectacles are quite leering.Wine buffery - Would have to check my previous reviews, but you do hear Bond utter the rare phrase (for him): ""Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred"".End teaser - No? I'm watching these movies on free to air, so I'm not sure if the network is messing with the forumala. All I saw was the MGM lion sequence at the end.Watch for: * MI6 headquarters are located in Scotland! Sorry if you already knew that! * Not sure, but I think you see five ""00"" agents, including a woman. Could be wrong on this...a summise on my part.* Perhaps for the first time you see Bond requiring medical attention...normally he seems bullet proof.* Fun with currency conversion!...when this film was made, the quoted exchange rate between British pounds and US dollars was: £3,030,303.03 = US$5,000,000.* X-ray glasses.* Bond's (initially) dodgy Russian accent...to me he sounded a bit like Sean Connery at first! He must be close to double figures now as far as languages he can speak or bluff with now.* A terrorist bomb running on Windows CE! Gosh...why the panic? Odds of a blue screen of death averting disaster must be high, right? * Once you have seen the movie, go back and play a scene concerning a rod fired inside a submarine by Bond. Magic bullet? * Bond mentioning that ""The world is not enough"" is a ""family motto"". For way more on this aspect of Bond, see the greatest Bond movie of them all, ""On her majesty's secret service"". It has a lot of information on Heraldry.* Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane) returns.Notes to self: Federal Security Bureau replaced the K.G.B? Wikipedia confirms this. My note had ""K.G.H""...maybe I made a mistake in my note taking.Devil's Breath - a real place? Wikipedia redirects to an entry for a certain chemical compound, but I didn't see any place name called this.On a final scene to the movie...being logical (yeah...tell me about it!), wouldn't the bends be an issue? 009 is responsible for Victor Zokas' condition. Hmm...Victor has an interesting nickname in this movie...Renoir the Impressionist? Ringo the Percussionist? Ah...Renard the Anarchist...that's it! Hmm...forgot to revisit that early scene where Elektra talks to Bond about her family's empire...important, for later on.",The World Is Not Enough
123,Angeneer,Why are we still going to see Bond movies?,6,9 January 2000,"The unchallenged perfection of Sean Connery created a saga and a perennial ""absolutely male"" character. This is what makes millions of people still going to see some typically pointless, silly and simplistic movie. I guess no one really cared for the sake of anyone in this film, we were just expecting the martini scene, the ""my name is Bond"" scene, the bed scenes and the fabulous curves of the two female leads and Z8. Some action scenes were so funny they reminded me of Kevin Costner ridiculous performance in ""Waterworld"". Generally you all know why you saw this film and this has nothing to do with quality.",The World Is Not Enough
124,chrisbrown6453,Yes! Now this is vintage Bond.,9,31 July 2000,"This is by far the best action in any Bond film.  The action sequences in The World is not Enough, are a little hard to believe, and too inconcievable, but after all, this is James Bond! Take, for instance, the opening scene.  It is 15 minutes of pure nautical adrenaline, with a cool end taking place on top of still being built Millennium Dome.  Of course, none of that could EVER happen, but again, this is 007. This time around, James Bond must feel lucky having DR. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards of Starship Troopers fame) and Elektra King (Sophie Marceau from Braveheart) surrounding him. As awesome as the action is in this Bond film, the storyline is unmatched by any other Bond film. Although I rated this movie a 10, and it is my favorite 007 flick, I was a little upset at whomever made the choice to cast the young, beautiful, obviously not even close, Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist.  Come on guys, all ya had to do was put her in her in a T-shirt in bed, and it would have been just as good, if not better. A word of advice, a movie rental at your local Hollywood Video costs $3.79, spend the extra money to PURCHASE a previously viewed copy ($9.99) for your collection.",The World Is Not Enough
125,bat-5,Nobody does it better.,8,19 November 1999,"When you want action, thrills, women and gadgets, there is only one name to turn to: Bond.  The World Is Not Enough brings back Pierce Brosnan as the highly resourseful 007.  After a wild boat chase on the Thames, Bond attempts to find out who is behind the bombing of MI6 headquarters.  From there, we're whisked away to exotic locales where Bond must contend with a foe who cannot feel pain.  Robert Carlyle is perfect as Renard, who is not your typical Bond villian.  Not content with just taking over the world or controlling it, Renard wants nothing but Chaos.  Of course, no Bond film is complete without beautiful women.  In this one, Bond gets two. The beautiful Sopie Marceau and Denise Richards bring an air of mystery to the latest Bond caper.  As a way to usher in the new era, the last remnants of the Bond franchise bid adieu with Q's final appearance.  Which I will miss.  Q's scenes always got a laugh from me and his utter disgust with 007 breaking his equipment will be missed.  Can't wait to see what's next for Bond.",The World Is Not Enough
126,domino1003,Interesting Degrees of Pain in This Bond Film,9,9 July 2005,"""The World Is Not Enough"" is the 19th entry in the Bond series, with Pierce Brosnan once again as Bond.As the film opens, Bond was on a mission to retrieve a briefcase from a Swiss banker. He's attacked, but not before trying to get some information from one guy, who is killed before he could reveal anything. Returning to MI-6 headquarters, he gives the briefcase to Sir. Robert King, an old friend of M's (Judi Dench). But, unknown to anyone, the money contains a bomb that blows up a nice chunk of the headquarters and kills King. Bond goes after the assassin (Who was actually in the office with the Swiss banker)in an incredibly cool boat chase through the Thames, and into a hot air balloon. During the chase, the assassin kills herself rather than be captured because Bond would not be able to protect her ""from him."" It is during this that Bond injures his shoulder, and possibly pulling him off duty.At the funeral of King, Bond sees his daughter, Electra (Sophie Marceau). We soon find out that the money that blew up King was the ransom to save Electra from a terrorist known as Renard (Robert Carlyle). Bond also finds out that M encouraged King to use his daughter as bait to flush out Renard. Electra was saved and Renard was shot in the head. The shot did not kill him, but it has created an interesting condition: he cannot feel any physical pain whatsoever (Although the bullet will eventually kill him as it travels through his head). Thinking that Renard will go after Electra, Bond is ordered to protect her, especially since her late father's oil lines, which she now owns, are being blown up in Azerbaijan. Soon he uncovers a plot in which Renard plans to blow up the King pipelines with a nuclear submarine.In this film, you see many degrees of pain: Bond has to contend with an injured shoulder (which could lead to permanent damage), and guilt: The guilt over what happened with Sir R. King and what he eventually does to Electra when we find out that she was working with Renard all the time (And what she did to her ear? Yech!). Meanwhile, Renard feels no pain at all (He holds a hot coal with no reaction), but the pain he feels when he loses Electra is a little heartbreaking (After all, he is going to kill thousands of people, including himself, for her). Yet who is better off? One who feels no pain, or one who does? A few more points on the film: This was the last appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" (He soon died after this film's release), and the first appearance of John Cleese as his replacement (Does this make him ""R""?). Plus, it's nice to see Dench as a flawed M. And I sort of had a hard time believing Denise Richards (As Christmas Jones)as a Nuclear Physicist.",The World Is Not Enough
127,willcundallreview,"A Bond that lacks a great plot, but Brosnan excels",6,25 May 2014,"Rating-6/10The World is not Enough is a Bond that although doesn't lack the style we have come to know from the series in the 90's, it just isn't good enough and although also not bad, still lacks the incentive it really could have taken in the end. It has good parts and bad, mostly positive in my opinion but I do really really think that some will hugely dislike this. It even has good acting by the main man, but he can't work on his own and is let down by all the others working alongside him, in the end I felt it was strongly kind of OK, and here is why below.The story isn't the bad thing about this film, it is fine, maybe reminiscent of a Connery or Moore Bond with it's hugely improbable overtones, but yet it still holds well and lots of fun can actually be had with this. It plays out well and goes at a nice pace, never staying in one place for too long as to not completely bore the viewer. Not all the story is good here, too much ridiculousness plagues this movie and just random gadgets and scenes unneeded really hinder this, and in the end the film is really not near being a good one.Pierce Brosnan is good here, as said ruined by others but he keeps the type of Bond we expect to see form him and he really try's hard with this film. Cast members such as Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau are not bad but don't contribute much to the film and in the end become useless characters, disliked Robert Carlysle as the villain as I felt he didn't put enough in to it and looked unbothered, nevertheless he is still deadly to deal with for Bond. I especially liked Judi Dench, she gets to actually act in action scenes in this rather than just in an office and she brightens the darker scenes with her fantastic humour. It isn't written well really, not terrible but poor and if done better would have made this film maybe just a little better, the world choice of the writers never works and I felt the directors touch could not save this and make it good, it just seemed too over the top. I enjoyed the effects, yet again a step up from previous instalments and the film never seemed to lack effects, they actually make this movie better though. The gadgets are cool and new, obviously quite insane but they can be enjoyed and Brosnan yet again uses them with slick suaveness. The main criticism isn't actually the story, it's the half worked atmosphere that is felt around this film, it just seems too undone and like they wanted to make about a quarter of a film but then decided they couldn't be bothered and just filled the rest of it very very quickly. The acting isn't top notch, it is up to the viewer whether or not this brings the quality of it down but what I will say is that, they don't bring much new or fun, Brosnan left without his wings in a sense.Those who are fans of the Bond franchise should enjoy this, I don't think near as much as films in the past or the future, but can be enjoyed though(I did). If you are less accustomed to the series or Brosnan you may feel this is typical popcorn action in the 90's and hugely different to say Connery or even Daniel Craig. One reason I actually would recommend this to people is that, if you ignore the rest of the cast and just watch Brosnan, he is good and he delivers what you want to see from James Bond.Overall a 6/10, this is a Strongly Pretty OK movie, not quite OK and far from Good, although it is also far from Poor and you may think I criticised this more than complimented but it generally is Kind of OK. Good fun with this movie can be had, well at least for those who can easily get lost to the charm of Bond and the slick action, otherwise you may not enjoy this so much but I think you will agree with me that Brosnan in no way ruins this, Don't miss this film out if watching them all in order.",The World Is Not Enough
128,majikstl,"""We know when to kiss, And we know when to kill.""",7,12 December 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH: Though it is the Bond family motto, (Orbis non sufficit), it sounds more like the title of a Harlequin romance novel. By no means world class, but still good enough. 6 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Two teasers for the price of one: James confronts and escapes from some bad guys in Spain, but on his return to MI6 headquarters in London he almost immediately gets involved in a boat chase down the Thames. The boat chase is very well done, but more importantly it is one of the few instances where 007 brings his unique style of mayhem to his home shores. Good show, Old boy! 9 points.Opening Credits: Icky is the best way to describe Daniel Kleinman's contribution here. His artistry is evident, but his choice of images is suspect. Past Bond openings have used motifs of gold and diamonds, but Kleinman's theme is oil, a valuable, though not particularly precious commodity. His images of naked women wallowing in or being drenched by gooey black crude is about as sexually exciting as mud wrestling. As well done as it is, it nonetheless leaves you wanting to take a nice long shower -- and not in a sensual way either. 4 points.Theme Song: If you're going to name your group Garbage, you had darn well better be very good. I can't comment on their other music, but the Bond theme they provide here is less than rousing. Indeed, if Sheryl Crowe's ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" was sleep inducing, this song is likely to put one in a coma. The words and music don't seem that bad; it is Shirley Manson's drowsy performance that proves to be Garbage. 3 point.""Bond, James Bond"": Once again Bond is in a vengeful mood and that means that Pierce Brosnan is doing his Gloomy Gus shtick. There is nothing sadder than a man who can't seem to enjoy his work -- Bond or Brosnan. 4 points.Bond Babes: A poll named Denise Richards' Dr. Christmas Jones as the worst Bond Girl of all time. That's hardly fair considering her competition would be Rosie Carver from LIVE AND LET DIE and Mary Goodnight from THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (not to mention Madonna's cameo in the next Bond adventure). She's not that bad, though it is hard to believe she can spell ""nuclear physicist,"" let alone be one. But she is totally overshadowed by Sophie Marceau as poor little rich girl Elektra King. Having been kidnapped by terrorists, who then apparently kill her father, she is the damsel in distress Bond comes to protect. But he little realizes that she is more than even he bargained for. Worth 8 points, because it leads to ....Bond Villain: The Bond films have never been great for unexpected plot twists, so having the audacity to make the Bond Girl not just a villain, but the criminal mastermind is a real kick. We assume that Elektra is under the spell of the terrorist Renard, but it ultimately proves otherwise. Elektra seems to have two fatal flaws however, she overestimates her feminine allure and underestimates James' willingness to use his licence to kill. 9 points.Bond Baddies: As the film's nominal villain, Robert Carlyle's Renard is rather banal, but as a mere henchman he is a bit more colorful. His quirk is a bullet lodged in his brain which inexplicably makes him immune to feeling pain -- which should be a detriment, not an asset. Somewhat more entertaining and comical is Robbie Coltrane's Valentin Zukovsky, returning from GOLDENEYE. The duplicitous ex-Soviet agent keeps us guessing throughout whether he is friend or foe. 7 points.Sinister Plot: Recycling the plot of GOLDFINGER, the dastardly villains hope to increase the value of their oil by using a nuclear explosion to contaminate their competitors' pipeline route -- killing a few million innocent people along the way. It is not as original as the filmmakers pretend, but a proved premise nonetheless. 7 points.Production values: Slick and colorful, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is certainly an admirable addition to the series. It's only major disappointment is Brosnan's faltering enthusiasm for the role. 7 points.Bonus Points: It's a fond farewell to Desmond Llewelyn's ""Q."" He makes an elegant departure, and his subsequent death brings to an end the continuity that marked the first 19 films in the series. But, happily, he introduced a replacement in the form of John Cleese as ""R;"" his Pythonian sense of humor is certainly welcome -- and desperately needed. 5 points for the passing of the torch.Summary: It is an interesting evolution for the Bond Girl: from hapless victim to cunning sex object to skilled professional to nefarious foe. For all of his lustful talents as a womanizer, Bond in his various incarnations has always had an uneasy relationship with women, an odd mixture of distrust, contempt and desire. Bond women -- feminist objections aside -- have usually been something more than mere sex objects and, considering the chosen profession, Bond's attitude toward them is understandable. Other than the desire, he views men the same way, with distrust and contempt. In a way, he has viewed women more honestly than feminists: as something to be enjoyed, but not underestimated. Elektra King was a long time coming -- no pun intended.Bond-o-meter Rating: 69 points out of 100.",The World Is Not Enough
129,PyrolyticCarbon,Standard Bond film with some new character changes.,6,7 February 2000,"This standard Bond flick seems to be continuing the slow move toward set pieces separated by weak storyline, although in this film two things stood out, and they weren't attached to Denise Richards! The latest Bond baddie is deliciously evil, yet even he seems to be mislead and all too human, despite his superhuman qualities. Bond himself is meaner than normal, showing a harder edge brought about by his loyalty, and quite possibly affection, towards M. The storyline is stock, with the ante upped on the stunts, set pieces and one liners, with more personal involvement from M and an spooky appearance from Q, it's a must for all Bond fans and a good evenings entertainment for non-fans. Let's hope the next Bond film emphasises more on Bonds' hard edge and character development only touched on here.",The World Is Not Enough
130,michaelarmer,A Shag is Not Enough,8,6 April 2020,"The third Brosnan 007 is a bit up on his second and almost as good as Goldeneye, The acting and action are great, direction good, good pace, good photography, music not great, Title song a bit poor and the end one worse. Most of the locations are authentic, bettering other recent films, but still some faked, some of the Azerbaijan and Istanbul scenes are filmed in the French Alps, Spain and Wales! And the underwater scenes in the Bahamas again.Brosnan is good again as Bond, he has done all three well, Robert Carlyle is excellent as Renard, a cracking actor and performance, Robbie Coltrane as Zukovsky and Michael Kitchen as Tanner return to give it a boost. All the rest are very good, Q (Desmond Llewellyn) retires in this, Desmond died just after the film was released; he was speeding in his Bentley and hit another car on the other side of the road, Bond Style. John Cleese was his replacement as R. But again many of the cast are playing characters of other nationalities which is not good,Bond Themes:- Casino Scene, Helicopters and Ski-ing, many of the old themes are not used these days, but we still have the Live action intro, Silhouette titles, and Title song. Cars:- just a BMW Z8 (tool racer). Henchmen:- none really for a change however you might call Mr Bullion (Bull) a Henchman but he didn't do much, or even Elektra (Sophie Marceau) as a Henchwoman, sort of, but not a proper one.
Bond Girls:- The first woman in the film, in the intro, is the most beautiful, Maria Grazia Cucinotta of Italy, but she kllls herself. The first 'Bond Girl' is No. 58 Molly Warmflash (Serena Scott-Thomas - she could have been called Warmbush?) the one who gives Bond the all-clear but not good looking, then he shags Elektra King (no.59) played by Sophie Marceau of France, who plays an excellent baddie girl, she is beautiful but with a bad attitude, Bond kills her later, then at the end he shags Dr Christmas Jones (no.60) played by Denise Richards (USA) who has a great body but a bit of a boyish face.Anyhow it's got a few minor problems, but really minor, it is almost as good as Goldeneye, which I gave a 9, I want to give it 8.5 but I can't so it will have to be 8.",The World Is Not Enough

134,TheHonestCritic,"In this case, the world may not be enough, but this film definitely exceeds those expectations!",10,3 January 2021,"""The World Is Not Enough"" (1999), here's an interesting story on how I first got into this movie. When I was a child, I used to play ""The World Is Not Enough"" video game. I remember playing it all the time. As a matter of fact, some of my favorite video games were James Bond related! The more I got into the video game, the more I wanted to see the film itself. Sure enough, it didn't disappoint in the slightest. To this day, I rank ""The World Is Not Enough"" as my third all-time favorite Bond movie of the entire franchise. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is, a billionaire named Sir Robert King is killed by a terrorist named Renard. Bond injures his shoulder during his pursuit of the assassin who attacked MI6. Still hurt, he tricks his way into the mission regardless. His assignment is to protect King's daughter, Elektra, who has taken over her father's oil business. However, during Bond's mission, he uncovers a major nuclear threat looming on the horizon. Then from there, it's non-stop action, tension and little bits of comedy are added in as well. It keeps you guessing what's going to happen next. Plus, there's a huge twist in the movie that I won't reveal here for those who may not have seen the film yet. But, it's a real shocking twist that really adds a lot of heavy stakes for the climax. All of the acting is superb from all of the actors and actresses. But, the shining stars have got to be Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. He is my second favorite Bond actor, below Sean Connery. The other standout performances, for me, come from Sophie Marceau as Elektra, Judi Dench as M, Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky, Robert Carlyle as Renard, etc. Every actor and actress does an exceptional job with their respectable characters. The chemistry between each character is nothing short of impeccable. Now, I know a lot of people have mixed feelings about Denise Richards' performance as Doctor Christmas Jones. But, in my opinion, she did a great job with her character and her performance doesn't hurt the film at all. Plus, she and Brosnan have great chemistry on-screen. Another thing, some of the best performances come from an actor or actress that may not necessarily look the part. In that case, it results in an interesting character. That's a rare art form in the world of cinema. When you look at Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist, you wouldn't suspect it. That just adds to the expression, ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" Every other actor and actress does an excellent job as well! All of the sets/locations are fantastic and give this film a stunning atmosphere. That's one thing that most of the Bond films showcase, beautiful sets/locations and this movie is no exception of that. All of the special effects are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack by David Arnold is phenomenal and sets the tone perfectly. David Arnold has written a lot of great film scores, and this is one of his absolute best ones. ""The World Is Not Enough"" is nothing short of stellar. It's my third all-time favorite Bond movie. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this movie, go see it today.

136,mnpollio,A slight misstep,6,2 April 2007,"After a soaring success with Tomorrow Never Dies, the series suffers a slight misstep with this uneven entry.Bond: Pierce Brosnan is so comfortable in the role now that it is pointless to complain. He is no Connery, but he ranks higher than his other predecessors and has definitively proved that he is a worthy addition to the actors who have played the role.The villain: The film spends much time building up Robert Carlyle's assassin Renaud, who we are told due to an injury is unable to feel pain. It is all for naught as Carlyle is surprisingly unmenacing and not especially interesting once he takes the screen. More of the problem rests with the writing rather than the performance, as Carlyle does manage to be the only villain in recent memory to elicit some form of audience sympathy in the latter act.The women: Sophie Marceau is the epitome of everything a Bond woman should be. Classy, elegant, sexy, enigmatic and complex - her Elektra is one of the more fascinating Bond characters. By contrast, someone in central casting must have been having a hoot when hiring the light years beyond ludicrous Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, a brilliant nuclear physicist. Not only is she entirely too young for the role, but the buxom Richards becomes an increasingly unintentional source of laughter as she struggles with her lines and poses prettily in her tank top and shorts.The film opens with a protracted slam-bang action sequence, but none of the further action scenes equal it - leaving the film with an oddly anti-climactic feel. The plot twists and turns around, but most will see a two-thirds act bombshell coming from a mile away. Judi Dench has much more screen time as M, but I feel she should have been made more proactive rather than the relatively passive onlooker she wrote here. The late Desmond Llewelyn makes a bittersweet swan song as Q. Not a total misfire - the film has enough interesting elements to distinguish it - but not a success. Garbage provide this entry's dismal title track.",The World Is Not Enough

It had the emotional depth of a Popeye cartoon, at least I believed Popeye liked Olive. The original Bond movies had lots of Babes and love scenes but they never seemed as stupidly sappy. Must be the background music that is telling you what you're to feel in the scene.  Special effects were good, not great, lots of running away from flaming blasts, typical.  Denise Richards was good as the babe but totally unbelievable as someone with intelligence.  Predictable lightweight Bond movie.  Stuff blowed up real good.",The World Is Not Enough

Inside the bad we have a terrible Denise Richards who can barely stammer her dialogues and who does not shine at the height of the rest of the cast. There are several things that are unclear: the insistence on presenting a female protagonism that does not respond to the Bond tradition: here Judy Dench is a weak M ready to do anything blinded by her guilt complex, we have Sophie Marceu (very beautiful) who seems like a thing but it is quite another and carries the essence of the plot on its back and I can continue like this with the useless nuclear physics of Richards. It is incredible that the most attractive thing about this film is the pulse of the director and the charm of Brosnan but that compared to the original films where the Bond canon is established, this film hardly stands up. It entertains but does not honor the character's previous history.",The World Is Not Enough
140,fimimix,..what a pretty little movie...,5,3 June 2006,"How many decades ago did I see a James Bond film? I don't even remember if I saw ""Diamonds are Forever"". Oh, I've been aware they are still being made - as one commentator wrote, ""plastic surgery"".......and it's due for Pierce Brosnan before the next episode. Will he be in it, you reckon, or will they find some OTHER dark-haired, handsome male to make the men feel all empowered? As you can tell, I am not a James Bond fan. BUT - I did like all the pretty colors of the explosions - and thought the cinematography for the skiing sequence was great. I'm STILL trying to figure-out what the part with all the fires and hot coals was about. Only to show that one of the characters didn't feel pain? Can't give any opinions about any of the actors/actresses, as they were all new to me except La Dench. WOW ! Was I surprised to see her in there. She must make a mint for that role, because she's totally wasted. And, I need someone to explain to me how that little skiff with the rocket-powered engine kept right on scooting down London's streets, but no wheels were visible.The most impressive characteristic of the entire film is the many suits that Mr. Bond goes-through. Has it ever been explained how he affords them ? - never has any luggage ! I guess he has them stashed all around the world, huh? Am I to understand ""the pipeline"" had never been used to pump oil from way over there to way over here? So clean inside, but then I guess you really need to use your imagination for Bond films. I tried! Laughed a lot, anyway.........most admit I had to read some other commentaries to get even a smidgeon of what the plot was about; was there one? Some wrote about protecting a girl. The automated ""smart-car"" was pretty cool, but that cutter hanging from the 'copter was stretching it a bit much - however did they get it from country-to-country without it getting shot-down ? Oh - I forget this IS James Bond and you don't ask any questions.As I've written about other movies, it's just entertainment and I WAS entertained - still laughing. You see, I didn't actually buy this DVD - although the colors in it are fabulous - I got it as a bonus from a credit-card. So, it being free and funny, I guess I lucked-up.

The film actually tries to create something meaningful, it tries to be compelling and different and it tries to have an interested gimmick villain.It's a shame that it falls rather short given the effort. The film stands out for its many ups and downs, but is not as compelling as Brosnan's GoldenEye even by a long-shot. The extremely long pre-credits sequence comes off as more excessive than anything else.Also, I felt the ethnic flair of this instalment was more derailing than interesting. Compared to the utter bore that was Tomorrow Never Dies, this one makes the effort of trying to be different, but gets blown flat by the studio's attempts to compete with other big budget action films.I'm not saying peril isn't necessary for a Bond-film, quite the contrary. It's just that there happens to be a fine line between necessary and excessive.",The World Is Not Enough
142,general-melchett,A brilliant Bond.,8,2 January 2007,"The World is not Enough is another high-octane, action-packed addition to the James Bond legacy. It is just your average Bond, with lots of big explosions, nasty villains, cunning plans and pretty ladies, but at least it is enjoyable, and the menacing Renard keeps everything nice and evil on the villains' front. The bullet through his head and his rather rough haircut and face tell us from the start that he is going to be a nasty piece of work, but in the case of Elektra King, we, like Bond, are easily deceived. It is predictable, with Bond having sorted out everything in the end, the villains all dead and a nice explosive action sequence to round everything off, but who ever complained about that? Bond isn't meant to die after all - he's meant to keep coming back for more. The opening scenes in the Swiss bank are very interesting - another great escape is made by Bond. The opening 15 minutes are all action, and the Millennium Dome chase sequences are truly unmissable - did you see that huge gun that blew everything up? Spiffing. The traditional Bond formula is - thrilling opening, a new case, lots of action, lots of romance, lots of villains, all villains dead at the end and Bond having a very happy ending with some beautiful woman, and The World is not Enough is no different. However, if you are happy to basically watch this knowing it is no different to the formula, then The World is not Enough shall provide you with a brilliant fast-paced ride. 8/10",The World Is Not Enough

146,varghesejunior,Like other Bond films - thrilling,7,23 July 2014,"The world is not enough is a typical Pierce Brosnan Bond thriller and has all the characteristics of it predecessors, with an added touch of all the ingredients that make a bond film The film's plot revolves around the assassination of billionaire Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard, and Bond's subsequent assignment to protect King's daughter Elektra, who had previously been held for ransom by Renard. During his assignment, Bond soon sees that things are not what they seem like, and he unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul.Quite a bit of action, a fan of which I am, with great dialogues and special effects. This film has 3 bond girls, not long lived, and of course, as predictable, Bond does not marry any of them.At times the acting seems juvenilish, compared to the latest Bond films, but nevertheless the movie is a delight to watch. I also think some part is not explained, like why does M hide something in a clock when she is captured...All in all, worth a watch",The World Is Not Enough
147,rhinocerosfive-1,Twenty-one Way Up,8,28 March 2008,"Michael Apted is probably the closest thing to a marquee director a Bond film has ever had. He's the biggest reason this one bucks so many of the bad trends set by most of its predecessors while simultaneously maximizing the clichés that have made the series so beloved. WORLD is worlds above any other Pierce Brosnan entry, stronger than all Roger Moore efforts but THE SPY WHO LOVED ME; it surely surpasses the unfortunately mishandled Timothy Dalton vehicles, and dare I say it defeats most - not all - of the Sean Connery attempts? I dare. (I leave out George Lazenby because I think ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is one of the best; also David Niven because his isn't a Bond movie, not really; also Daniel Craig, because his one version to date sucked, through no fault of his own.) WORLD has what many Bond movies and most Bond books lack: a giddy, relentless pace. From the thrill-a-second pre-credit boat chase, Bond doesn't stop having sex, playing with dangerous toys, and disarming hydrogen bombs... except of course to ski. What's more, WORLD's James Bond has what nearly every movie 007 fails to inherit from the pulp character that spawned him: brutality. Shooting the woman he loves in the heart is maybe my favorite example of why this man has a license to kill. The reason is that he will.Bizarrely, the movie's strongest actor is its weakest link : Robert Carlyle, so terrifying as Begbie, is less impressive as Renard, the only Bond villain advertised as already dead. Unfortunately, Carlyle plays him that way. He's a little flat, a little pat, certainly no Gert Frobe; but then neither was Gert Frobe. At least Renard gets one great line: ""A man tires of being executed."" To compensate for a lack of villainous flair, we are offered an exploding MI6, a fat Russian drowning in caviar, a 70 mph no-helmet bailout from an exploding pipeline luge, a rapacious Swiss banker complete with Holocaust remittance jokes, flying BMW-splitting hedge trimmers, a VMF-surplus nuclear submarine, a Bond beauty who acts as well as she fills an evening gown, a Bond ten times more likely to shoot you than to tell a joke, and glory of hoked-up glories, Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist in hot pants. It just doesn't get any more Bond than that.",The World Is Not Enough
148,jcholguin,The movie was a sad epitaph for Q,3,6 May 2001,"This movie should have been a joyful experience for all in that Q was going into retirement. As we all know now, sadly Desmond Llewelyn was killed after making the movie. The whole movie, from Pierce Brosnan to the villains seem to just be reading lines. Maybe Pierce has grown tired of Bond and very evident are signs of age on his face. Rememberable villains to gadgets have been a mainstay of the whole series but did not leave a lasting impression in this film.  The only memory I will have of this film is the final time we see Q descending and leaving us with a glimpse of a hero drifting into the sunset. Goodbye Q and thanks for the memories.",The World Is Not Enough
149,David_Frames,Enough?,7,30 March 2005,"The World is Not Enough presents some difficulty for someone attempting to prove the proposition that the series has had its day. You can see the dilemma. How can this entry be so much more enjoyable than the last while simultaneously being as derivative of other instalments? What separates TWINE as we're all loath to call it, from its predecessor is that it stands on the other side of that fine line that segregates total self-parody from a fresh reworking of old material. The shift in tone may be slight and the film itself only a notch more concerned with the mechanism of a story and slightly meatier drama but it's enough to make it watchable and entertaining as opposed to cringe worthy. Credit for this should probably go to Michael Apted whose injects the whole enterprise with a bit of gravitas and character. There's not THAT much to chew here in that respect but it makes a critical difference. If the film is more assured and less pantomime than before then it still has problems in the script department. This is still a story culled from the series back catalogue. Renard, the villain of the week is largely wasted after an intriguing introduction that promises much then falls back onto familiar ground. Pervis and Wade could have run with the idea of a villain who can't feel pain and is close to death and so arguably more dangerous but revert to type and employ it as a mere gimmick. You also have to wonder whether it was necessary for Renard to look SO much like Blofeld from You Only Live Twice and if this is symptomatic of a general failure of imagination that plagues the film somewhat. One scene that should be singled out is Q's farewell which highlights what the Bond producers need to get away from, particularly in light of this movie's follow up. It makes the mistake of the basic confusion between two things - audience expectation and the established world of the characters. An uninitiated audience may imagine that Bond and Q have a relationship akin to teacher and student/Father and Son but anyone watching the movies regularly rather than casually over the years knows this to be cine-bowel content. Q is a civil servant who, and I hope your paying attention, does NOT make gadgets himself, he presents them to field operatives and is part of a wider division that R and D's equipment. This is made clear throughout the series and viewers should note the difference in tone between Q's scenes before the 1989 hiatus and afterwards in which the character as constructed in the audience imagination supplanted the character as written up to that point. Its a bit of post-modern reinvention typical of Pervis and Wade. Q bows out talking about the tenets of wisdom he's passed on to Bond and the gadgets he's particularly proud of. Lovely for the fans but utter nonsense. If TWINE has problems its in reconciling this fan boy fluff with the stories more serious pretencions. Its sometimes an uneasy alliance that doesn't allow the material to gel. That said, overall TWINE is entertaining stuff - a great opening sequence, good title (always important), some nice visual flourishes and a real groaner of a closing line that makes you laugh like you did at the end of Roger Moore's outings. A confusing entry then, as it pulls back from the precipice of being total fluff without really filling you with confidence that the series is recovering. There was a feeling here that if Brosan's Bonds kept moving in the direction of more considered plotting, better characterisation and less recycling that the next one may be really rather good. Unfortunately team Bond did the opposite and made TWINE the exception rather than the rule of Brosnan's period in the role. The most well rounded of his era.",The World Is Not Enough

152,MF210,Worth Buying(or seeing) just for the Opening Scene,8,5 March 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****.Spoilers The opening scene of The World is Not Enough is brilliant. It is easily the best opening of any Bond film I have ever seen. Bond escapes from a Bank in Spain, goes on a wild and crazy boat ride through the Thames River(chasing a villain of course), and then hangs from a hot air baloon and falls. Then comes the theme song. My words may not make it sound exciting but it cannot be described, it must be seen. If you saw it on the big screen like I did, than you experienced something awesome. The theme song, which I think is one of the best, only adds to the greatness. So how does the rest of the film hold up? It holds up well but its not quite brilliant. Yes, the rest of the action scenes are (for the most part) expertly executed. I was also entertained from start to finish. However, the film is a bit uneven too. For the most part, the score was excellent. However, there were times when the score sounded like soap opera music(especially during the sex scene between Bond and Elektra). Also, the final action scene was disappointing. Bond getting away was the only satisfaction. Pierce Brosnan is in top form. He was a little rough around the edges in Goldeneye but those disappeared in Tomorrow Never Dies and there not in evidence here either. He is the 2nd best Bond(behind only Sean Connery). Sophie Marceau is completely belieable as Elektra. Denise Richards is not as successful. She is not a good actress and her performance is terrible. Robert Carlyle is effective as the villain, but he will not go down as one of the most memorable Bond films. Robbie Coltrane is delightful as Zukovsky.
The World is Not Enough does not add up to a brilliant Bond Film but it is an accomplished one in its own right. It is worth seeing if only for the opening scene. It may not be on the same level as From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, but there is no doubt that it is a worthwhile Bond film.",The World Is Not Enough

There is, as usual beautiful scenery, fairly corny dialogue a fairly nasty villain and unbelievable stunts- but what more could you expect? Unfortunately the Bond girls, in particular Dr Christmas Jones is totally unbelievable in her role as a nuclear/ rocket scientist, which is fairly disappointing - where is Michelle Yeoh when you need her? Pierce, is great as Bond as usual, but the best performances really come from ""M"" and ""Q"". This film is as action packed as they possibly could have made it, with some of the best physical stunts I've seen in a while, but its mindless entertainment at best- even though it is thoroughly enjoyable.",The World Is Not Enough
154,carologletree,"A Strong Bond Film, and Easily the Most Serious of the Brosnan Era",8,9 January 2016,"This is another satisfying Bond adventure that delivers what many people expect from a Bond film and even a few new things as well.Pierce Brosnan gives possibly his best performance in this film. He shows a real intensity and really seems to be deeply invested in the mission. Elektra King, the bad Bond girl, played by Sophie Marceau, is beautiful and alluring and Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones, while not anything too notable, isn't as bad as everyone says.I really enjoyed Renard, played by Robert Carlyle. He is one of the most creepy and sinister Bond villains since Blofeld, in my opinion. However, the insensitivity to pain thing is admittedly pretty lame.I like that this film is a return to the style of films like ""From Russia With Love"" and ""License To Kill"" in that it has realism in the story and characters. Robbie Coltrain's Valentine Zukovski from ""Goldeneye"" returns as an ally to Bond, and Judi Dench's M had a bigger role than usual.This film is remembered for the fantastic boat chase through the Thames River in the pre-credit sequence; arguably the best boat chase in the entire series. There are other great action scenes as well, such as the helicopter battle at the docks and the climax in the submarine. David Arnold's music score really adds to it.This film is also remembered for this being Desmond Lewelyn's last appearance as Q. He died in a car crash shortly after the release of this film. R.I.P. Desmond Lewelyn.I think this film is just slightly better than ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" The last Bond film of the 20th Century, this film brings us to the new millennium in style.RATING: B+",The World Is Not Enough
155,Ibuk,Below average,5,19 June 2008,"I went to see it in the cinema when it first came out and I was pretty impressed. Looking back on it now it is a mediocre Bond movie which suffers from a bad plot and lack of decent villains. It starts off magnificently, the opening sequence was simply breathtaking but it all goes downhill from there. Denise Richards as a Bond villain was good to look at but nothing more, a bit like Halle Berry as Jinx. Robert Caryle was poor as Renard whilst Sophie Marceau was damn sexy but made a poor Bond villianess. To make matters worse there is that old chestnut involving Bond and the Bond girl being caught in a comprising position by M. Unfortunately Bond fans know that the worst was yet to come in the form of DAD. TWINE is a forgettable entry in the long running franchise and one I would like to forget.",The World Is Not Enough
156,LuboLarsson,Average,6,13 July 2003,"I think Pierce Brosnan is a great 007, but I think he's made two great Bond films and two... well not so great Bond films. Goldeneye and Die Another Day are two top class 007 flicks, but I think Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough are not two of the better films in the series. In fact this one just might be my least favourite in over 40 years of James Bond Movies. It just seems to going through the motions, Denise Richards was very poor in this film, although she does at least look great. I was very excited when I heard Robert Carlyle was going to be one of the baddies but he was wasted in the role just like Christopher Walken was in A View To A Kill, the Bond producers get a great actor to play a villain but don't give him anything to play with, I suppose he wasn't as bad as the god awful villain in the previous film. John Cleese makes an unfunny appearance as R, and follows it up with an unfunny appearance as Q in Die Another Day. At least I got to see Robbie Coltrane getting killed though! he's an actor I can't stand, I hated his ""Cracker"" TV series. This film had the longest pre credits sequence in the whole series and it feels like the longest when you watch it, why couldn't they get 007 to blow up the Millenium Dome? That would have cheered me up. Thank goodness Die Another Day was great when it appeared 3 years after this.",The World Is Not Enough

That's the stage Pierce Brosnan is at.  Still, it's fun imagining him as Bond (James Bond) and even more fun imagining a nuclear scientist who looks like Denise Richards.  (It could happen.)  Plus there are lots and lots of explosions and lethal gadgets.  It's hard to get too curmudgeonly about such a movie: if you didn't know what you were getting into when you bought the ticket, you need to get out more.  It has some respectably tense moments, and the FX are okay.  (This movie is a good litmus test for the sincerity of your feminist feelings, btw.

159,extravaluejotter,Another Brosnan Classic,7,11 December 2006,"From its Wham-Bang opening action sequence to its tacky double-entendre ending, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is a vintage Bond formula. Indy diva Shirley Manson belts out a classic theme song, Robert Carlisle makes a reliably unpleasant villain and the Bond Girl slots are amply filled by sultry Sophie Marceau and buxom-but-slightly-wooden Denise Richards. Judi Dench's 'M' gets rather more to do than usual and Samantha Bond makes the most of Moneypenny's opportunities to take the micky out of her favourite '00' agent. Robbie Coltrane makes a welcome return to the franchise and D&B maestro Goldie is good value as a bling-encrusted henchman.Pierce Brosnan clearly has fun with the clichés that are now part of his role and the rest of the cast goes along with the wild ride engineered by screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Fierstein. Director Michael Apted and his team show their flair for drama as well as action and the whole mad farrago hardly seems to stop for breath.The late Desmond Llewelyn made his final appearance as 'Q' in this movie and it's a touching cameo from a seasoned Bond veteran. Llewelyn had to appear in some creaky old guff during the wilderness years of the franchise (late Roger Moore through poor old miscast Timothy Dalton) so it's good to know that he was able to bow out with Bond back on form.Don't even think about the plot because you've seen it so many times in previous Bond films. There are a couple of neat little twists in ""TWINE"" but in the main this is pure high-octane 007, chilled to perfection and served straight up in a tall glass.",The World Is Not Enough
160,refinedsugar,Solid Effort,7,17 February 2000,"I saw ""The World Is Not Enough"" in it's opening weekend and what can I say? I, like many men, enjoy the Bond flicks. This being the latest, I was pretty satisfied leaving as the credits started to roll. It felt for a lack of a word ... stronger ... overall than the last entry (Tomorrow Never Dies). As usual, Pierce Brosnan is in full form turning in a satisfying performance and the supporting cast is effective especially Robert Carlyle. Many people don't understand or appreciate how much a good villain can elevate a film, but especially a Bond one. It amps up the game.With the time and money invested in such a franchise, it goes without saying the direction and writing in the modern era of Bonds film is above board. The same goes for the visuals. Special effects, action sequences. Of course, no graphic violence and scenes revolving around the infamous ""Bond girls"" remain steamy and suggestive by name or otherwise, but not revealing (as they've always been) retaining a certain level of class. A good watch for Bond fans although it pulls no punches. It's slick, glossy, but not particularly revolutionary. It hasn't surpassed Goldeneye in my eye either. The first and best of the Pierce Brosnan / Bond era.",The World Is Not Enough
161,gtc83,"Eh, it's okay.",5,27 December 2005,"I have very mixed feelings about this one.First, the characters. Although Brosnan brings the usual style and class to the role of Bond, he's just not a human being. He's more of a super hero who is never in any real danger because he's probably bullet proof. He can fly as well. He can fall from 100 feet in the air and only suffer a bruised shoulder. Maybe if he were dropped from 1,000 feet, he'd get an actual sprain. He's got no genuine humor, not even the slightest hint of awkwardness - ever - he's just way too polished and slick. Then there's Judi Dench as M. - Utterly deplorable. A worse casting decision couldn't possibly have been made for that role. Which brings us to Denise Richards. I liked her in several other movies, but here she manages to be the worst Bond girl ever. Her natural tendency towards conceited bitchiness, coupled with what seems like plain stupidity, just doesn't cut it. And she's a nuclear physicist? That's truly laughable. She's a dopey teenager with big hooters. To be fair, I'm certainly not complaining about the hooters! Then there's John Cleese as the new Q, or R. One would think he could have been quite clever in the role, but such is not the case. The bad guy with a bullet lodged in his brain hardly deserves mentioning.On the other hand, Sophie Marceau as Elektra King is simply wonderful, possessing all the conflicting motivations that makes a person a human being - something everyone else is so noticeably lacking.Then there's the action. Some is good, like the fight in the underground nuclear weapons storage bunker. The attack of the flying snowmobiles is alright as well. So too was the pipeline scene. However, the boat chase at the beginning is truly boring, like something out of a Batman movie, complete with the Batboat jumping out of the Batcave. The whole thing on the submarine at the end is boring as well. It's just not directed in such a way as to have any style, any possibility of our heroes meeting with failure, nor any actual excitement. They're just going through the motions. The attack of the saw blade wielding helicopters on the caviar factory is a waste of time as well; so obviously just an excuse for yet more special effects. It serves no purpose whatsoever.In conclusion, you've got one or two good characters, a few good action sequences, and a vaguely interesting plot. It's surrounded by a lot of other crummy characters, boring over-the-top action sequences, and pointless plot cul-de-sacs. So overall it's watchable and rather entertaining, just not nearly as good as it could have been had it been made specifically for adults instead of trying to appeal to the short-attention-span teenage market as well.",The World Is Not Enough
162,TheFilmGuy1,Not as Good As Goldeneye,7,19 September 2014,"""I thought Christmas only comes once a year.""Oh grow up 007... But that is a hilarious pun. The World Is Not Enough isn't amazing, but I think it has enough bits and pieces that are good for me to enjoy it. The storyline is has interesting elements wrapped in your typical ""nuclear weapon was stolen"" story. There's a oil pipeline and an oil tycoon that are involved that help make a possibly unoriginal plot become a bit more interesting. Also, the villain isn't your typical villain, and it actually kind of reminds me of how Bane was in the Dark Knight Rises, in the sense that there is actually two villains one of which is under the influence and charm of the other.There are some fun action sequences, like the blade helicopter attack at the warehouse, or the Thames chase, but other sequences like the ski chase just felt a little bit lacking. I think that's overall what this movie feel like. Just a bit lacking.Brosnan does a good job of playing Bond, as usual. We get a good performance from Robert Carlyle which works well. Sophie Marceau did good too, but there's something I just personally didn't like about her, but I think that might be just me. Denise Richards... is meh. A lot of people absolute hate her in this, and I think she's just kinda weak. She's pretty and looks good in the role, but overall doesn't deliver the kind of character she could have been.The World Is Not Enough is certainly no Goldeneye, but it is enjoyable in it's own ways.

At MI6 headquarters the money blows up, killing its owner, while Bond pursues the killer along the Thames and she ends up blowing herself up. This is by far the series longest pre-title sequence and it is a great one. It is a bit too long, but it actually has a connection to the main story and the Thames based action is truly fantastic.Theme Song: Garbage provide an enjoyably atmospheric and seductive theme. It has a great main melody, while the electronic elements mixed with the orchestra allow it to standout. Shirley Eaton's gloomy vocal performance has the classic Bond sound as well.Plot: Bond is sent to protect oil heiress Elektra King after her father is killed as she builds a pipeline across the East. Bond finds out that Renard, a terrorist who can't feel pain due to a head injury, has plants to detonate a nuclear bomb that involve Elektra. This is a very interesting story for a Bond film to tackle, with the themes of terrorism and revenge being used effectively. It all plays out in a very serious manner and there is a real sense of tension building up throughout. It all flows surprisingly well, as there is a danger and a humane tone that so many Bond films sorely miss.James Bond: Pierce Brosnan is brilliant in an edgy and vulnerable turn as Bond. His likable charm and suave persona are still here, but his Bond feels more ruthless and emotional here. This is all fantastic as we get a look into Bond's emotional state and he actually acts like he may be in danger. Brosnan really nails some tough scenes and he looks great too.Bond Girls: Denise Richards is easily the weakest aspect as Christmas Jones. Looking good is all she has going for her. She doesn't know how to show emotions properly, her delivery is extremely wooden and trying to sell her as a nuclear scientist is beyond unbelievable.Villains: Elektra is basically a Bond girl/Villain hybrid and she is wonderful, easily one of the series best and most interesting characters. You never know her true intentions, she has a good backstory and her motivations are complicated. Sophie Marceau is simply excellent. She plays both good and bad perfectly, looks incredible and is so believable in the more emotional scenes. Robert Carlyle does a solid job as Renard even if he is underused. He fills the role with a subtle creepiness, has a sinister look and gives the character an understandable coldness that works well.Support: Robbie Coltrane makes a welcomed return as Zukovsky, who's now Bond's ally, bringing some much needed humour to the film. Judi Dench is excellent as her role as M increases. Desmond Llewelyn gets a wonderful sent-off in his final Q performance, his final scene is quite touching.Action: The action is pretty solid. We get a ski chase which is enjoyable and a fight inside a missile base that nicely intense. Bond racing through the pipeline to stop a nuclear bomb is goofy but still entertaining, as is Bond having to avoid a helicopter with a razorblade extension. I like how in most cases the action connects to the story. The climax is a weak however as Bond's confrontation with Renard is suitably rough, but it lacks tension and excitement.Score: David Arnold's score is superb. It features some fantastic moodier pieces than previously that fit in perfectly, whilst the up- tempo compositions are fun of energy. He pretty much strikes the perfect balance between soft and aggressive, with many memorable arrangements.Production Values: Michael Apted does a solid if unspectacular directing job here. I actually think the plainer and less slick style suits the tone of the film, with so many scenes of dialogue and intense action it works rather well. The writing is a strong point. Nearly every character is well fleshed out and they have motivations that are believable, both villains are given plausible reasons for their actions and even Bond is written like someone conflicted. The editing for the most part is very good too, only a few parts of the film become boring and it all flows along nicely. The stunt work is impressive, although it's a little too obviously stunt doubles in certain scenes. The locations are excellent yet again, using Eastern Europe as the backdrop gives the film a feel of both danger and exoticness.Conclusion: The World Is Not Enough is usually seen as a boring and confusing entry, but it is far from that. It is one of the most interestingly written and real of all the Bond films, it is a surprisingly sombre and vicious film at times which might be what puts many off. Brosnan is excellent in a more grounded performance, Sophie Marceau's Elektra is just superb, the action is as enjoyable as ever, the dialogue is good and I love how the film uses its gritty themes of love and vengeance. In fairness Christmas Jones is dreadful, most of the visuals aren't that inventive and the climax is poor, but change these elements and you have a really impressive film here. In many ways this feels like Bond at its realist, but without completely forgetting to entertain.",The World Is Not Enough
164,gws-2,A Near Miss,6,23 July 2001,"Despite high production values and much that is interesting, this movie was a failure in my estimation.  Denise Richards won a well deserved Razzie for the worst performance in a supporting role (she plays a nuclear scientist who looks and like a 20-something model and sounds like a valley girl).  The talented Judi Dench, who plays M, is trapped in the wrong part in the wrong movie for the wrong reasons.  The movie is far too long and has some flat places.  Nevertheless, Pierce Brosnan gives a good performance as Bond, as does Sophie Marceau as the femme fatale.  This film is decent, despite the fact that it could have been a lot better.  6 out of 10.",The World Is Not Enough
165,Kakueke,Bond woman is Bond,5,19 October 2001,"One of my least favorite Bond movies, largely because it is not a movie about Bond, but the Bond woman. Sort of reminds me of Michael Keaton in Batman II, altho there it was vis a vis the villains, not a sidekick.  She seems to beat up more people at a time in each fight than Bruce Lee did in an entire movie.  I know there will sometimes be fighting more than one person at a time in a Bond movie, but I prefer Sean Connery's one-on-one fights rather than this absurd stuff.  Pierce Brosnan is too stiff as Bond, and just does not work overall.  He is no compelling Bond persona and is not convincing.  There is lots of action, as always, but not a really menacing villain.  Still worth seeing, as are all Bonds.",The World Is Not Enough
166,movieman-200,This World is Quite Enough for Anyone Who Remembers What Bond Used To Be,7,12 June 2005,"The World Is Not Enough (1999) is an impressive film mired in problematic story telling  at least insofar as a Bond film goes. Rules are rules, and the rules of a Bond film say that the villain will always be male, that the Bond girl will usually be scantily clad, and that James Bond is the hero of the day. What occurs in this film then is a subversion of these time honored elements that have made the series such a huge success. Bond (Pierce Brosnon) is not the elevated hero, but a hapless accomplice to the diabolical machinations of Elektra King (Sophie Marceau). Seems several years earlier, Elektra was kidnapped by a rogue nationalist, Renard (Robert Carlyle). During that tenure, Elektra developed a romantic yen for her captor.The first half of the story is riddled with interesting vignettes and exciting chase sequences that hark back to the very best in Bond tradition. But the latter half  in which the full wrath of Elektra is exposed - plays more like a melodrama steeped in elements of the Greek revenge tragedy. Through it all, Bond seems to be along for the ride. He is first made Elektra's complicit dupe, then the second string guy on the side to savvy Bond girl, Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), who always seems to know more about what's going on than Bond does, and finally; made the victim of torture by Elektra. Michael Apted's direction keeps the pace fast moving, perhaps enough to make one forget what a Bond film really should be. The chase sequences, to be sure, are visceral, but lack any memorable moments to place them among the best in the Bond canon. The absence of any scantily clad Bondian vixens throughout this excursion is sadly missed.The MGM/UA anamorphic widescreen DVD is absolutely stunning. Fidelity and color saturation is absolutely first rate with solid blacks, pristine whites and excellent rendering of fine details, even during the darkest scenes. There is an absence of film grain and digital grit for a presentation that is smooth on the eyes. Sonically, this Bond flick packs a wallop with lots of directional effects and explosions to rattle your bass. The one shortcoming this DVD has is its sudden lack of extra features. An all too brief making of, audio commentary and theatrical trailer is all we get.",The World Is Not Enough
167,Starbuck-13,The best Bond in years - with the best cast!,9,13 December 1999,"What a splendid adventure this new Bond movie is! I really did not expect very much, considering the fact that the James Bond character is kind of an anarchronism today. But the filmmakers succeeded in giving us a joy ride through the genres - with James Bond no longer being a secret agent, but more of a super-hero!The spectacular start sequence with the wild motorboat chase on River Thamse really pulled me into the action - from than on it was unimportant that the story is totally chaotic and often just impossible to follow!What really blew me of was the fantastic cast - especially the best Bond girls ever, the incredibly breathtaking Sophie Marceau and hot Denise ""Lara Croft"" Richards. The approach to cast more famous actresses as Bond girls worked out - not only did they look nice, but their roles were very vivid as well. All in all a terrific action movie - a whole lot of fun if you don't need an intelligent story to enjoy a movie...",The World Is Not Enough
168,jaredpahl,The World Is Indeed Enough In This Spit-Polished And Solidly Entertaining Take On The Bond Formula,8,11 July 2017,"The 19th James Bond Adventure, and the 3rd starring Pierce Brosnan as 007, The World Is Not Enough finds a comfortable balance between all the familiar Bond elements. The locations are exotic, the girls are beautiful, the gadgets are cool, and the action is a lot of fun. At this point in the franchise, both the producers, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, and Bond himself, Pierce Brosnan, had settled into a nice rhythm, and The World Is Not Enough shows all of them at their most assured. This is a confident piece of Bond-flavored entertainment, and for someone who loves the popcorn action side of 007, The World Is Not Enough is one of my favorite Bonds of them all.The story of Bond 19 is much like the story of Bonds 1 through 18. A madman wants a nuclear bomb, Bond is sent to stop him, excitement ensues. The script from Robert Wade and Neal Purvis does exactly what you would hope a Bond script would do. It sticks to the tried-and-true formula while adding its own spin to the various elements. The villain of this story is quintessential Bond; A terrorist named Renard (Robert Carlyle) whose gimmick is that he has a bullet lodged in his brain that renders him stronger than the average man and unable to feel pain. As far as gimmicks go, that's a darn good one. The script also gives an interesting twist to the traditional Bond Girl role. While Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) gets the typical spunky ally part, Sophie Marceau's Elektra King has a much juicer role as an oil heiress who we find out has much bigger plans than just bedding Mr. Bond. Her role is a nice change of pace for the franchise, allowing for a more personal bend to the plot, and ample opportunity for Brosnan and Marceau to do some real acting.Brosnan is more than up to the task in his 3rd go-round as James Bond. He's supremely comfortable in the role, and he sharpens the suaveness and danger of the character a notch further than his previous two movies. This is his best performance as Bond, and I think with this movie, he solidifies himself as the best of the post- Connery Bonds. Plus, he looks great in a suit. The supporting cast is great as well. Carlyle and Marceau strike just the right note as the villains, and Robbie Coltrane and Denise Richards provide ample humor and eye candy. Which one provides which is up to you, I suppose. After all, Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist is pretty funny.The biggest strength of The World Is Not Enough is not in its plot, or even the cheeky, innuendo-laced dialogue peppered throughout, but in its action scenes, which come early and often. Director Michael Apted gives us a couple of really thrilling stunt sequences including a ski chase, a shootout in an underground weapons facility, and a nifty little finale aboard a submarine. The best action scene, however, comes before the titles even start. The boat chase on the River Thames is just flat-out spectacular. Like the rest of the action in The World Is Not Enough, its imaginatively staged and clearly shot. However, the Thames scene has a real punch, a Bondian flair that the rest of the movie never quite matches. I think the film really could have used a big, standout action sequence in the middle of the film, just to bolster a middle section that sags compared to the great opening and closing action scenes, but on the whole, Apted does very well maintaining an inventive sense of fun. There's nothing revolutionary here, but the stunts and shootouts are about as entertaining as they could be.The World Is Not Enough goes down smooth. It's a comfortable and confident Bond movie with good performances all-around and more than enough of the classic Bond elements to satisfy any 007 fan. The word to describe Bond 19 is ""solid"". For me, the best Bond movies are not the ones that defy the Bond formula, but the ones that embrace it. The World Is Not Enough sticks to what makes Bond, Bond, and it does it all well. Polished, vibrant, and entertaining throughout, The World Is Not Enough is classic James Bond.78/100",The World Is Not Enough

170,Blade_Le_Flambeur,Nowhere near as good as the first two Brosnman films,6,2 April 2003,"This movie is dissapointing. Very dissapointing. After two very well Bond films, Pierce mucked up badly. The acting is sour, the action scenes are dull and tasteless, and the characters are poorly represented. The plot was interesting, but screwed badly, and the only really redemming feature(s) about the film was a) the great starting chase, b) The performance of Electra, and c) the character development. The villain, who had a lot going for his character, wasn't acted out well enough. He had the ability to survive anything, but he just didn't seem well written enough. And Denise Richards was terrible here, she has no talent. This review is short, I know, but there isn't much else I can say. 6/10",The World Is Not Enough
171,Zoooma,Lacks depth and kind of uninteresting,8,16 October 2014,"Pierce Brosnan's third turn as James Bond and again another modern day Bond movie that I am only seeing for the second time and for the first time since seeing it in the theaters! (Unlike Connery & Moore Bond movies which I've seen 3 to 6 or 7 times each!) The story is lacking here. The main villain uninteresting. He had very little depth. Bond Girl Sophie Marceau also. And then there's Denise Richards. Just a terrible casting choice. Additionally where was the Bond Theme? It was not as prevalent as in the previous movie. The score here also subpar. But as we enter the 21st Century, the action scenes seem to get better. I am more and more impressed with Brosnan as 007. He was bent on revenge which took him to a slightly darker place, not as dark as Timothy Dalton's Bond, but up off the cheeky goofyness Roger Moore brought to the character while maintaining the cool Connery exterior. He is really possibly becoming my favorite Bond. Overall not a spectacular unbelievably awesome movie but still worth seeing again!7.4 / 10 stars--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener",The World Is Not Enough
172,Dar Star,The worst Bond movie ever,8,29 November 1999,"Having seen each Bond movie a hundred times, I feel I'm well qualified to pass judgement on where this film fits in the history of this series...At the bottom.  This  was not a spy movie, which is what Bond is supposed to be about.  It was just a mindless shoot-em-up which are a dime a dozen these days.  Bond has always done extraordinary things in the movies, but he was never superhuman.  In this film he dodges massive explosions by running away 10 feet from ground-zero, can breath underwater for like ten minutes, etc, etc.  From the excellent Goldeneye, the last 2 007 capers have gotten progressively worse.  Still it's a Bond and I'll give it 5 out of 10 stars.",The World Is Not Enough
173,rjsf96,Frequently Thrilling and Preposterous At the Same Time,7,29 October 2015,"If you want a feel for how conflicted The World Is Not Enough is then just take a look at the cast, writing and acting. It is not the most consistent Bond film and yet if you are willing for a daft, fun and fast ride it delivers on these fronts, just don't expect it to be believable by any accounts.Bond is tasked with protecting Elektra King whose father died in a tragic accident; his heritage and legacy transfers to Elektra who becomes in charge of a powerful oil company. Meanwhile, Elektra's former kidnapper the deadly Renard makes another appearance and Bond must stop him from hatching his nuclear plot.Possibly containing the longest and most spectacularly entertaining opening; The World Is Not Enough undoubtedly knows how to wow its audience. We don't catch our breath until this sequence is over, fifteen minutes in. The action is swift and the stunt team gives their best shot for Pierce Brosnan's third outing as Bond. I would pick The World Is Not Enough as a showcase for Brosnan's remarkable talent. This guy knows how to play Bond; in fact he was born to play the role! With off the scale charm and sophistication Brosnan owns every moment, sly quip, gadget, kill and girl that he claims for himself.It's admittedly disappointing when of all the people to play a Bond girl Denise Richards steps in after an hour to ruin all the fun. You'll laugh when I say this. She is a nuclear physicist. I'm not lying! There is some compensation in the fact that she is dazzlingly pretty, but all the good looks in the world cannot undo dreadful acting. Just try not to laugh when she says ""Are you here for a reason or are you just hoping for a glimmer?"" Who even says that? Well Denise Richards does in The World Is Not Enough.Still to counteract Denise Richards as Christmas Jones we have Sophie Marceau. She somehow manages to bring a sense of realism to this stupendously unrealistic film. As Elektra King her performance is nuanced and granted enough depth to make her feel like a three dimensional character. Add Robert Carlyle to the cast as the dastardly evil Renard. Who considers Bond a mere mortal to himself and we have a terrific cast, minus Denise Richards of course. Renard even gets a kick out of taunting Bond about Elektra ""how does it feel to know that I broke her in for you?"" It's ultra-satisfying when Bond manages to outwit him in the end.The World Is Not Enough is a conflicted film that would rank as one of Bond's best outings if not for the presence of Denise Richards. Still as Bond films go The World Is Not Enough is one of the most preposterous, witty and knuckle clenching of them all. You cannot deny that Brosnan is Bond, James Bond.",The World Is Not Enough

175,eamon-hennedy,Brosnan's Finest Bond.,10,28 October 2003,"After a great start with Goldeneye and the hugely enjoyable Tomorrow Never Dies, Brosnan's run as Bond hits the jackpot with this fantastic action film that is undeniably one of the best James Bond films ever made. It has everything. It has some of the finest action sequences the series has ever thrown up (the pre-credit sequence is to die for), two classic villains in the shape of Reynard and Elektra (they even have Bond baddie names) and what is a surprisingly good little story. Sure it's not Tolstoy or Shakespere, but the plot is very effective and offers up many twists and turns, but as well as that the script is very daring for a 007 movie. First of all the pre-title sequence ends in disaster. The man Bond is trying to save winds up blown to pieces and to further add insult to injury, the usually indestructible secret agent winds up seriously injured ending up with his arm in a cast after the fantastically stylish credit sequence. Even better is that the injury becomes his weakness for the rest of the film and the writers even have him fall in love, a relationship that leads to a denouement more akin to the Dalton era.That's what I love about Brosnan, though. He brings many of the qualities of the previous Bond's to his own he is virtually perfect, not only giving Connery a run for his money, but at times surpassing him. We have the smoothness of Connory, the humor of Moore and the darkness of Brosnan. There's none of George Lazenby, but we should all be thankful for that. Another plus point is that we have more of an ensemble feel for TWINE, which leads to the villains being more than just the usual ""I must destroy the world"" stereotypes. Sure Robert Carlyle's Renard may seem like a typical Bond villain (he is unable to register pain due to a bullet in his head), but by playing him as a man in love who welcomes death at the end is a masterstroke and one handled fantastically by director Apted, doing a fine job here. While Denise Richards may not be the best Bond girl acting wise, looks wise she is perfect, with the wet t-shirt moments at the end being a welcome distraction. Kudos too to bringing back Robbie Coltrane. Shame he's killed off as I thought he would make a welcome regular supporting player to the rest of the cast.To sum up, The World Is Not Enough is classic Bond. The Thames chase at the star will be unbeatable and the script is very strong.
You could say it left me shaken and stirred.",The World Is Not Enough
176,Joejoesan,Bond looks better than his girls,5,10 November 1999,"To tell you the truth, I did not expect a lot from this movie. I liked GoldenEye, but I thought that Tomorrow never dies was a complete miss. With Robert Carlysle on board this third Pierce Brosnan James Bond movie looked very promising. Boy, was I wrong.The first hour is very entertaining, though. James Bond is assigned to investigate the murder of Robert King, a rich industrial whose company King Industries looks for oil in the Black Sea. There is reason to believe that the assassin will also eliminate his daughter Electra (Sophie Marceau), who's now the woman in charge. Bond falls in love with her (really!), but cannot disregard his feeling that something is wrong. Enter the bad guy. Robert Carlysle is bald in this one. His character Renard survived an assassination attempt by agent 006, but still has a bullet in his head. As a result, he's immune to pain. His introduction is great: a little man appearing out of nowhere in a dark forest.Okay, the game is set. Bond has a wonderful load of one-liners during the first half (often with a sexual undertone). There's a lot of action (a speedboat chase on the Thames ending on top of the Millennium Dome) and Robert Carlysle looks a great opponent. And there's also this new element: Bond really looks in love when he falls for Electra. But is she to be trusted?The second half of the film is very disappointing. Robert Carlysle hardly has any screen time and Bond ally Denise Richardson is just another irritating Barbie doll. Her boobs look great, though. Only Sophie Marceau has her moments. Still, this Bond movie is much better than the previous one and I predict it will be a great hit all over the world. I think Pierce Brosnan is at its best and, surprisingly, he looks better than the Bond girls. I doubt I will go to the cinema to watch Bond number 20 in the future. A new Indiana Jones adventure is more my style.",The World Is Not Enough
177,WilsonLau,Very Exciting!,9,23 November 1999,"This movie was great! Non stop action! I think this is the best Bond movie in years. Pierce Brosnan does a very good job in this film. Timothy Dalton was the worst James Bond ever, I mean he doesn't even look British to start. Plus he was just plain bad. I didn't like Brosnan's first Bond film, Goldeneye but this one more then makes up for it. Lots of the usual Bond charm and wit combined with a lot of cool gizmos and gadgets and not to mention the beautiful Bond girls. This movie has it all. Pierce Brosnan is very convincing and I'd have to put him up to the second spot in terms of whom is the best Bond. He'd be under Connery of course.",The World Is Not Enough
178,clivey6,Suffers on the small screen,7,18 April 2002,"A marked improvement on the barely-acceptable GoldenEye and Tomorrow Never Dies, TWINE does at least work as a proper action movie. Pierce Brosnan is more energised, the villains more interesting and credible and the dialogue far cleverer. The pre-credits sequence alone features more memorable set-pieces than all of Tomorrow Never Dies. When the Bond theme kicks in, it hits the spot whereas in recent films it seemed a bit incongruous.Director Michael Apted is unashamed about making a Bond film and this one has a bite and authority that's been missing of late.However, on television The World Is Not Enough reveals faults that were somehow overlooked on the big screen. A lack of colour is evident throughout, with a palette made up of beige, stone and light blue. The enjoyment of the film's narrative is based on what-happens-next and once you know the twist it just isn't as gripping. On the small screen, sheer entertainment and visual thrills are what you want and The World Is Not Enough's emotional melodrama just doesn't cut it. The best Bonds for TV viewing have a light-hearted feel: Goldfinger, Diamonds are Forever and Live and Let Die being prime examples.Little things to notice: Robert Carlyle's psychotic villain resembles a morose soccer hooligan, upset at his team's relegation. The French Sophie Marceau seems very leaden, and has a downbeat delivery. So does Brosnan, bizarrely, with slightly stiff body language around Marceau (no, I don't mean the bedroom scenes!) How come the Q boat doesn't ever quite catch up with the larger, slower craft in the pre-credits? Despite the ambition of this opening sequence, none of the later action is worth holding out for.Yep, there is a made-for-TV feel to The World Is Not Enough on the small screen. In fact, none of the Brosnan movies compete with the spectacle of the Connery-Moore years, which is a shame as it's repeat viewing that keeps the Bond franchise going strong.Still, at least Michael Apted uses suspension of disbelief rather than gritty realism to carry the audience. That's how it's done.",The World Is Not Enough
179,MadBadMovieman,James Bond forever!,8,2 December 1999,"Yet another great Bond Movie.  Pierce does a great job even doing the cliche's and innuendos.  More beautiful Bond women, both Good and Bad and exciting and intense.  The special effects were awesome.  The High speed jet boat was unstoppable on land, sea, air or asphalt.  The BMW as always looked great.  Too bad it was a victim of one of the baddest Helicopters ever sent out for a ""Trim Job"".  The plot was not really new but the twists and subplots helped give it some new life.  Knowing Bond could dish it out at the end was tough but deserved.

And yes, there are worse Bond films than those.The film seemed a little too hard pressed and little too rushed to set it all up. Brosnan played a fine 007, and he was set up with a great cast(Denise Richards makes for excellent Bond Girl fodder, but not as a nuclear physicist), but the story just didn't hold together. Even cool points such as Q's replacement, Zukovski's return and the echo back to 'Univeral Exports' just weren't enough to lift the story in softer places.The disappointment of the Brosnan era, it's still not as bad as 'Man with the Golden Gun' or 'Diamonds are Forever'... so grab the popcorn, and yes, bathroom breaks are allowed.",The World Is Not Enough
181,tpaladino,Incredibly Competent And Classic Bond,8,10 March 2012,"I've always looked at the Brosnan period as the last gasp of the Bond franchise before the reboot, with little appeal and even fewer fresh ideas. By the end of the Roger Moore era it seemed that Bond had been sucked dry (no pun intended). He became more caricature than hero, dependent on gadgets and gimmicks, and bore little resemblance to the original source material. But at least Roger Moore still had the Cold War as a backdrop; a cultural touchpoint that all could relate to, and an always-ripe source of intrigue and character motivation for both hero and villain alike. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, this all went away, and with it much of Bond's raison d'etre. This, unfortunately, was the world that Bronsan had to inhabit; a very different geopolitical reality AND a character that was becoming stale anyway. Over the course of his tenure, the films did suffer on both.'The World Is Not Enough', however, is the shining exception. It is a remarkably well crafted film, with excellent plot development, colorful and deep characters, and a tremendous amount of style. It is every bit a true James Bond movie, in the very best sense of the term; never ridiculous or cartoonish, always interesting and smart. Brosnan did a fantastic job in the role, and proved that he most certainly was not the problem with the franchise; had the writing and production for his other films matched this one, he'd be remembered as one of the best actors to ever play Bond. It's not entirely without flaws, but honestly it's a fantastic and under appreciated film. Worth seeing for sure.",The World Is Not Enough
182,Mario64,A Good Bond Film,7,28 July 2001,"I'm kind of surprised at all the negative comments this movie is getting. This is not the best Bond film or even best bond film of recent times (Tomorrow Never Dies was the best Bond Film of the 90's), but I still liked it. It did make a mistake in having it's best action scene, the boat chase, at the begining because none of the other scenes can compare. Still I found it to be whity and entertaining. It's one of the more original Bond films I've seen in a while (helecopters with spinning blades on the bottom, who would of thought). This movie does have a little too many explosions but what the hell, it's fun. This movie also has Pierc Brosnan's best Bond performance yet. Not as good as Tomorrow Never Dies but better than Goldeneye. I give it a 7 out of 10.",The World Is Not Enough
183,Blackace,This Movie Was Not Enough,7,30 November 1999,"The first half off The World Is Not Enough was absolutely spectacular. Unfortunately the second half of the movie was slow and the ending was definitely forgettable. I'm not saying that I didn't like this new Bond movie, cause it was decent, but it didn't match up to the first 2 Bond movies starring Pierce Brosnan. Here are my likes and dislikes.1) The open sequence with the incredible boat stunts. Every Bond movie has a great opening to start the movie and get the audience into the action. I love it. 2) Sophia Marceau: What a great actress this sultry French woman is. She was one of the best reasons to see this film. Not only is she gorgeous, but she can act and shows great emotion. 3) More screen time for Judi Dench. Another great actress who has definitely earn additional exposer. She's wonderful as ""M"" 4) The ski chase scene. Another exciting choreographed action scene that will leave you breathless. Of course skiing has been done way too many tim es in Bond movies. 5) John Cleese as ""R"", who will probably replace ""Q"" in the upcoming Bond movies. Having John C is essential for the humor between ""R"" and ""007"". ""Q"" has done a great job in the past, but he's getting old now.Stuff I disliked. 1) Another incredibly lame plot. No originality. What did this plot have to do with the World Not Being Enough? Nothing at all. The villian wasn't even after the world. No wonder the title was changed about 10 times. 2) The second half of the film dragged on forever with little or no action at all. Boring!! 3) The lacklusted ending. I didn't feel on the edge of my seat watching the ending. I was hoping then would get out of the sub and star a nice chase scene. Never happened. 4) Robert Carlyle as Renard. Even though I thought he did a great acting job, I never felt that he was all that threatening to me. I'll blame it on the script and not the actor. 5) Denise Richards' terrible acting performance. She was much better in Wild Things. Thankfully she didn't show up until halfway in the film. Didn't think Bond should have bedded her either. Some traditions should be broken. 6) The terrible use of the new improved BMW car. This vehicle seemed better then the last one, but was never utilized. I was hoping for another car chase scene, instead we got helicopters chasing Bond and Christmas around a dock. 7) All the action scenes were shown in the trailers. I hate that s**t!!Overall, the movie is worth seeing at least once. Just don't expect it to be better then Goldeneye or Tomorrow Never Dies.",The World Is Not Enough
184,freewillyfan,The World is not Enough,6,1 November 2019,The World is not Enough is the third Pierce Brosnan Bond film. It's entertaining but not a great film. Brosnan is good as Bond and some of the action sequences are quite good. I really enjoyed the opening scene. The villain was alright. I persona wasn't a fan the idea that there is a bullet in his head. It didn't feel that it added anything interesting. I found the plot mediocre as well. But for just watch an action movie it has some entertainment value.5.6/10,The World Is Not Enough
185,Philaura,Why Can't They Find a Descent James Bond?,2,10 July 2000,"Man, it should be a simple thing to come up with a sexy charismatic leading man for a film.  Maybe I'm missing the point.  Perhaps James Bond is reknowned for the way he delivers a subtley suggestive line to beautiful woman like a totally disconnected cold fish.  There was no energy or chemistry like there used to be with Sean Connery nor has been since. - Outrageous  special effects - a handsome, daring, agile hunk  of a man coupled with gorgeous, temptresses exuding sexual electricity that keeps you at the edge of your seat -  What a great concept for a movie series - how hard can it be?

187,Funky A,The best Brosnan Bond movie.,7,29 January 2000,"Goldeneye was bad, TND was horrible but The World Is Not Enough was okay! It is not one of the best Bond films but still, it's almost nearly as good as some of the old Bonds! Robert Carlyle was pretty good, Sophie Marceau was surprising, Denise Richards was not a very convincing nuclear technician(but she had other qualities...) and, most important, Pierce Brosnan finally had a chance to be a real James Bond, not is usual Rambo style ""secret agent"". Garbage did a good job with the theme song(as did Sheryl Crow). Its an okay Bond, and a huge leap away from the last 3 movies. This is not one of the best Bonds, but its so much better than the last 3 that I will give it 68%!!!",The World Is Not Enough
188,punctate,another great James Bond movie,9,27 November 1999,The latest film in the James Bond series is the best of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond flicks yet. They have changed Bond they have made him the way he used to be before Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies. Q is retiring so he is training a replacement named R played by John Cleese from the Monty Phon franchise. Elektra and her dying lover Renard wish to blowup part of the world for reasons I won't mention. James Bond teams up with the beautiful Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) who is an expert in nuclear physics. M is developed more in this film we get to different side of her. Money Penny is the same as she always was. Delivers all the action and sex we come to except from the James Bond series. The opening teasers have been getting longer and longer but that has aloud them to give us more insight into the story. James Bond will return it says so in the ending credits I wonder if it land on the same year as Austin Powers 3 does again.,The World Is Not Enough
189,TimBoHannon,Can't live up to the usual high standards,6,22 September 2003,"I wanted to love this film, believe me. I wanted to embrace it and like it as much as Pierce Brosnan's first two Bond movies, which were nothing short of spectacular. I remember all the anticipation leading up to opening night back in 1999. I thought this was going to be great. Then the day came, the film played, the credits rolled, and for the first time since I began to watch these films, I was disappointed.Granted, there are other duds in the history of the long-running franchise, as conceivably would be in any that reaches twenty installments. ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" ""Live and Let Die,"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" are some examples. ""The World is Not Enough,"" while still earning a recommendation, lacks the magic carried from ""The Living Daylights"" to ""Tomorrow Never Dies.""At first I felt I was not being completely fair, that maybe my expectations were too high after ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" one of the best constructed and most exciting action films ever made. In fact, ""License to Kill"" and ""GoldenEye"" before it were also top five efforts. The more I analyzed it, however, the more I realized that the problem did not lie with my point of view, but with the movie itself. It is not without its successes, but its shortcomings overshadow them.Bond feels responsible for the death of oil tycoon Robert King (David Calder) after unwittingly delivering the murder weapon. After initially placing Bond on injured reserve, M (the always reliable Judi Dench), assigns him to protect King's daughter Elektra (Sophie Marceau). Mi-6 suspects that Renard (Robert Carlyle) a terrorist ""whose only goal is chaos,"" is responsible for King's murder and will target Elektra next. Thanks to 009, Renard has brain-imbedded bullet nullifies pain, but will eventually kill him. There is great potential there, but it is only exploited three times: when Renard holds a ""scolding"" rock, when he is shot in the arm, and when he punches porcelain furniture during sex. When he is shot, he takes notice, but should not since he has no sense of touch.The positives are many. Pierce Brosnan gives a tremendous performance once again. He is now playing James Bond with great ease, and he uses his brand of Bond ruthlessness more than usual. The special effects are pristine, and the same can be said the stunts coordinated by the legendary Vic Armstrong. The action is mostly enjoyable, except for the underachieving Istanbul climax. There are strong supporting performances and it is nice to see Robbie Coltrane reprise Valentin Zukovsky, whom he played in ""GoldenEye."" David Arnold, my favorite composer, turns in the best score in the series. It ranges from beautiful, as Bond skis down a mountain slope with Elektra, to tense, as Bond and a companion shoot down the inside of a pipe at 65 miles-per-hour, to emotional, when Bond sees a computer reel of Elektra crying and reaches out as if to wipe her tear. Desmond Llewelyn arrives for one last time as the legendary and beloved gadget master Q.""The World is Not Enough"" easily contains the longest pre-credits opener in the series, including boat chase on the Thames that is the highlight of the movie. One could argue that it is too long for its own good, but the problem lies even before that. Prior to the chase, a good deal of plot is covered using Backwards Storytelling, a tactic where the filmmakers know the whole story, and create the scenes backwards from there. The problem is that the audience does not know the story yet, so the references are too overwhelming to remember. The rest of the plot builds on them, but the poor structure leaves a shaky foundation.The plot does not unwind smoothly in the first hour. The action does not fit in with the ebb and flow of a movie, seeming to be added in because too much time had passed without an explosion. Somewhere in the mix we meet ""Dr."" Christmas Jones (fluffy-girl Denise Richards), a nuclear physicist in shorts. I remember shaking my head when I first saw her on screen. Richards is hotter than the Afghan sun, but taking her seriously requires effort.However, the film's biggest problem is the character moments that director Michael Apted was so staunch about. Most of them involve Elektra and her vulnerable side. All too often they occur in bed, where Elektra has this annoying habit of handling ice cubes like a child testing a new sensation. There is one particularly repulsive sex-scene involving Elektra and the ugly Renard. It ends with Elektra whispering ""Remember, pleasure,"" as if it were an advertisement for promiscuity. Raunchiness in Bond movies is not normally a problem, but in this case it distracts and detracts. Had Apted toned this down, the film would immensely improve.Then there are the characters themselves. Of course we like Bond and Valentin, and Judi Dench is always great as M, but the poorly planned villains do not meet standard. Making Elektra draw our sympathy is a good idea at first, but the feeling falls apart when her true colors are shown. Her whole life is a cruel vendetta, so she deserves hate, not sympathy. The same applies to Renard. Apted at times tries to create pathos because of his death sentence, yet Renard is so despicable, we cannot possibly garner a thimble-full of commiseration for him.Should the film be seen anyway? Possibly, some good action, acting, and the great soundtrack provide enough enjoyment; just don't expect it to be anywhere near the quality of its predecessors. I considered withholding a recommendation because it nearly topples under the weight of its many mistakes. It will thrill you early, disappoint, recover, and then bury itself with its poor finale. Don't say I didn't warn you.",The World Is Not Enough
190,raymond_chandler,A Refund Is Not Enough,2,4 August 2001,"I was raised on James Bond. Starting with ""Goldfinger"", I see each one of the films as they are released. I saw ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" in re-releases. I would have to rate ""The World..."" as one of the worst, almost as bad as the deplorable ""Moonraker"". At its best, the Bond formula provides numerous spectacular action scenes, gorgeous women, exotic locations, and, most importantly, villains who are truly a threat and nearly Bond's equal. Renard wants to be a classic Bond villain, but I pitied him more than I feared him. ***Possible Spoiler*** Elektra simply is not scary. And Christmas - aaargh! Denise Richards rates MAYBE Bond Girl #3 status, the one who usually gets it on with James once, and then is killed the next day by the bad guys. NO WAY she ends up with him at the end. ***End Spoiler***The problem appears to be that Brosnan is Bond Lite. He does not exude the ruthlessness and smarts of Dalton or Connery, and so the other characters need to be scaled down to not show him up. Even so, this movie suffers more from its own stupidity. I do not expect realism from Bond, but I do expect it to play by its own rules. Why make a big deal of the injured shoulder, when the only trace of it later is an occasional wince? Bond is never hampered by it at all. The final scene with Elektra is just sadistic, not compelling. The best Bond movies make him a human-scale hero, where his ultimate victory is inevitable, but he has to struggle along the way. Ignore this mess. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" is much better.",The World Is Not Enough
191,robhingston,Powerful and strong,7,20 July 2019,"Not the greatest bond movie but definitely slightly above average for a bond movie,
It's action packed enough and the storyline does make sense to a certain point however it falls apart near the end of the movie",The World Is Not Enough
192,Robinson2511,"Complicated, isn't always bad, people!",8,20 December 2015,"Yes, it's true, I really like 'the World is not Enough'. While it does have a complicated story, I've never found that a bad thing. James Bond has always had some level of complexity in it's plots, and while 'the World is not Enough' is very hard to follow at points, I think that if you look deep into it, you'll see a very entertaining, almost surreal plot that will jump at you from out of nowhere.As for the characters, I feel they're interesting enough, Elektra has a cool dark presence which fits well the bad guy of the story, and Sophie Marceau plays it off beautifully. But the big problem of this film to lot of people is Denise Richards, who plays this film's main Bond girl, Dr. Christmas Jones. I feel this is bad casting, putting Denise Richards in the role of a nuclear scientist, but she does what she can with the cheesy lines she is given, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.One of the things that really grabbed me about this film is it's amazing action scenes which may just be the best of the franchise, and no, I've not forgotten Bond being pushed out of a plane in Moonraker or fighting Zorin on the Eiffel Tower in A View to a Kill, I'd happily take the boat chase or the helicopter saw scene anyday.Brosnan makes a good performance as Bond, but even three films in he's still not reaching the standards set by Sean Connery and Roger Moore, and not forgetting Timothy Dalton.Despite it's complicated plot and somewhat forced dialogue, 'the World is not Enough' marks one of Brosnan's best Bond films, an awesome plot when you can see it clearly, cool characters, nice acting, and not forgetting the brilliant action scenes. It's still not my all time favourite no, give me 'the Spy who Loved Me' or 'the Living Daylights' anyday.",The World Is Not Enough
193,cartesianthought,It had good ideas but the execution was of mixed results.,6,22 December 2015,"I'm happy that The World Is Not Enough decided to tweak the Bond formula rather than go with the tried and true. I like how the story is complex, with thriller elements, and with twists. I appreciate that it has a different kind of villain.There's a conflict of tone. Brosnan goes for a dark intimidating performance while writers went for a goofy script. And there's Denise Richards (ugh...). It's over the top, filled with chainsaws, heavy machinery and bullets. It has kind of an industrial feel to it. It could've used a different director but when all's said and done, the good outweighs the bad.",The World Is Not Enough

196,MovieJunkie1976,I'd settle for a good film...,4,26 February 2015,"**Warning Spoiler Information Inside**After the continued success of the Post cold war formulae that was felt in Goldeneye (1995) and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), the franchise quickly moved forward releasing The World is not Enough (1999).Bond is on assignment recovering funds from a botched kidnapping extortion scheme in Spain.After the money is recovered it explodes at MI6 HQ ,killing one of M's personal friends. 007 is held at distance by M However eventually finds his way onto the case.After so many movies , and the simplification of the Bond schema you would think no one could ever get it this wrong. Not so. This chapter of the bond saga is rivaled only by 1974's ""The Man with the Golden Gun"". The script is a jumbled mess focusing at times on the interpersonal so much you lose track of the storyline. Then there is the incredibly lame tie in sequence, with bond girl Christmas Jones (Denise Richards).The emotion of the character Renard (Robert Carlyle) is enough justification for a nap. To be clear , just as with Golden Gun, the Director (Micheal Apted) and actors can only work with the material at hand , and the writing here is a complete fail.On a personal note I did rather enjoy Robbie Coltrane in this film.This Film also marked the departure of Desmond Llewelyn (Q) from the franchise. he passed shortly after it's completion. John Cleese picked to be his successor fit well with the character who so often is the victim of Bond's field antics.Not Good.Two Stars(of 5.)",The World Is Not Enough
197,Rhino Rover,Best of Brosnan Yet,8,7 December 1999,"I went and saw ""The World is Not Enough"" today and was hoping that I wasn't going to be disappointed. I wasn't. The opening scene before the title of the movie was even shown, brought the audience to the edge of their seats and promised the best was yet to come.For fear of spoiling the movie, I will keep my plot summary relatively short and general. After a disastrous mission by Bond (Pierce Brosnan), he is taken off the active duty roster and told to rest up his injuries. Being the stubborn and persistent agent that he is, he ""maneuvers"" his way back into active duty to continue investigating the botched mission. Bond's new assignment entails the protecting of a beautiful young woman, Elektra King (Sophie Marceau), who's father had recently died in Bond's previous mission. And since we are talking about James Bond, as you can guess, a romantic involvement ensues. The story becomes more complicated as we discover that the young woman is thought to be the next victim of the killer who murdered her father. I'll leave the rest of the story for you to see.James Bond has gone through many changes but I hope Pierce Brosnan is here to stay as the legendary British spy. He brings a charm and style that we haven't seen since Sean Connery's portrayal of James Bond. One of the biggest plus' of this Bond movie is the recruiting of director, Michael Apted (Gorillas in the Mist). Unlike some of the past director's, Apted is a character director and as such spent some time focusing on Bond's character. The audience is given a chance to see some of the grayer areas of James Bond and this allows the audience to see a more well rounded character. I have always found in the past movies that the Bond character was too black or white and that we never really got a good idea of what Bond's thoughts or feelings were. Apted was able to provide us with a bit of a better insight in this movie.For the most part, the rest of the cast performed very well. Sophie Marceau was very good as Elektra King and I found Robbie Coltrane as the big (no pun intended) casino/caviar boss an absolute scene stealer. We are also introduced to a new peripheral character, ""R"" (John Cleese). He is ""Q's"" (Desmond Llewelyn) new assistant and foreshadows the changing of the techno-gadget guard. Sadly to say, I think that this may be the last movie that we will see Llewelyn in. As for Cleese, he was absolutely hilarious in his very brief debut and I believe he will become a staple character in the James Bond series. It was too bad he didn't have a larger role in this movie. The one actor that I didn't like was Denise Richards. I found her acting to be quite forced and at times just terrible. Her character was probably necessary to the story but they could have chosen a better person to play the role (Saffron Burrows perhaps??). The last Bond movie used Terri Hatcher in it and quite frankly neither Richards nor Hatcher have the international feel that a Bond movie demands.I have to say that the action sequences were unbelievable! They were fast paced and quite visually stunning, although some of them were a bit hard to believe. But then again, it wouldn't be a Bond movie if we didn't have some logic defying stunts.Overall, this was a very entertaining movie. It's a little bit long but well worth seeing.",The World Is Not Enough

I especially liked the ski chase - I suppose it was thought as an hommage to ""On her majesty´s secret service"" starring George Lazenby, the one-time 007. Once again, Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job. As ever he doesn´t takes himself too serious and that´s good. And Robert Carlyle is the best villain in a long time. ""Kill me - I´ll die anyway"" he said to 007. What a cool phrase! It made me remember the great scene from ""Goldfinger"", when Sean Connery said to Gerd Fröbe: ""Do you expect me to talk?"" - ""No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"" Remember it? That´s pure 007-cult! I´ve heard that Brosnan will only return once again. One thing is sure: I will miss him. I´m excited who will be the next James Bond - I think Ralph Fiennes would be a great candidate! We´ll see... But I also felt a little melancholic when I watched it. It was because of ""Q""-actor Desmond Llewelyn. He died in a car accident in December 1999, just a few weeks after the movie was released.

Robert Carlyle is one of the more creepier JB villains to come out in a long time, and the action was superb, especially the opening sequence. It's too bad that John Cleese's character wasn't expanded more though.The only drawback was the silly Denise Richards character when she's first introduced (I couldn't help but snicker at the outfit she wore under her uniform, and what's a lone American scientist doing in some remote part of the world?) but she comes off well in the climax.Overall, not the best movie of the year, but it's up there.

202,Theflyace,Bond Month #19: One that is much better the second time around,7,23 October 2013,"Before I review the film, I was influenced to write my Bond series by watching the online reviews of Calvin Dyson. He is very smart about what makes a good Bond film, that sometimes my view changed about some of the Bond films I never particularly cared for. Now I do present my own opinions on these films, but a few times he has changed my mind. Nowhere did this occur the most than The World is Not Enough. I watched it once when I was a kid, but never really cared or remembered it. Its actually good from what I remember.The plot of this film involves Bond protecting the daughter of recently assassinated oil tycoon Robert King, Electra, from a sick dude known as Renard. He discovers thought that she was the one behind her father's assassination and plans to drive up her fortune by creating a nuclear meltdown to destroy a rival pipeline. M actually gets something more to do than be the king (or queen in Judi Dench's case) of exposition and nothing more. She gets captured and must face a mistake that Elektra hasn't forgotten This, with the exception of Denise Richards, is the second-best acted Bond film of the Brosnan era, extremely close to GoldenEye. Pierce gives his last real hurrah as Bond. He is humorous, but becomes angry and betrayed by Elektra, to the point when he kills her in clod blood, he could really care less.Elektra, who goes from being an innocent heiress to a really sinister and hateful villain, but she is gorgeously and brilliantly played by Sophie Marceau (who scored another hit a few years earlier with Braveheart) Renard is also something of an enigma in the canon, as I forgot what he really was, but when I rediscovered him, he was cool. He has a bullet lodged in his brain that is slowly killing him, but makes him impervious to pain. He does comes of as a sick twisted, deranged lunatic, but he is not really prone to bad lines or over the top acting. I can buy him as a villain, but not on my top ten.But there is one serious flaw in an otherwise near-masterpiece this film is. Denise Richards. Oh producers, WHY???? She has no shred of talent, no convincing character traits, and above all, she is annoying. Her name is Christmas Jones, because I think they just wanted to make jokes about it. Are we really supposed to take DENISE RICHARDS as a NUCLEAR AUTHROTY/PHYSICIST? So yeah, she really is awful.Other than that, this film is very well developed and executed. We have new writer,s with Bruce Fierstein's last involvement, in Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. Both have crafted a really good story, and would become the best writers of Bond in recent years. FOr me it was much better the second time around, and worth a watch for those who either didn't get it the first time, or haven't seen it at all.Brosnan would now close with one of those films that is controversial in the Bond fandom, Die Another Day.",The World Is Not Enough

This film made little sense, the acting was mailed in (although the lead villain, Renard, was much ado about nothing), and the gadgets and chase/action scenes are almost lifeless. Sadly, Brosnan does not come off well here, either.  Frankly, what the series needs is a return to fundamentals - strong plot, few gadgets, BELIEVABLE women (Denise Richards is extremely attractive, but her acting...UGH!), and a sense of the struggles (Bond's internal one and those of the other central characters and their respective ""organizations"") that Fleming wrote into the novels.  I've seen every Bond film except the last Roger Moore effort (I just couldn't take it anymore), and the producers need to really think about where they're going.  They've got a good Bond, cash, technical advancements that are mind-boggling, plenty of girls if they need them...this product should be MUCH better.

Ah, and this had to of been the most engrossing Bond plot I have ever watched on screen.  Strings were pulled and discoveries were made throughout the movie.  Everything went right in this one, and I believe that Brosnan has just came very close to what Connery had accomplished.  I waited a dreary eight months to see this movie, ever since I heard of it's release date and title name.  This movie paid it all off.  Outstanding action, acting, and Bond elements that did, and always will, make the best Bond movies.  This is something only true Bond fans can tell, and I can tell it very clearly in this one.  The only thing I was disappointed to see is Q's mysterious leave in this movie. Could this be the end of old Q?  He has been with Bond since the beginning, and it would be devastating to see him leave.  Lets hope he'll hang in there.  Bond has came through with a vengeance for the millennium year 2000, and I give it a big, very enthusiastic, 007 out of 007.",The World Is Not Enough
206,rupak_speaking,Brosnan's Best Performance as Bond,7,29 January 2018,"I hear that Brosnan's Bond flicks are not regarded among the best of Bonds, but I don't find much wrong with this one. It is probably his best performance in four of his Avtars if not his best Bond movie (would rate GoldenEye as so). The villain though said to be getting stronger in his terminal days, there is not much of a duel with Bond and does not inspire awe, but who steals the show is Sophie Marceau there. She certainly got a far meatier role than Denise Richards and made full use of it. The action sequences were creative and overall it did quite well in my books. 6.5-7/10. This one does not disappoint.",The World Is Not Enough
207,The Spectacular Spider-Man,"...but it is such a perfect place to start, my love",7,5 October 2008,"As a reaction to the complaints about Tomorrow Never Dies (too much action, not enough plot), EON hired respected director Michael Apted to add more characterisation and drama. He absolutely does that. The central Bond/Elektra dynamic make this far more of a personal story than the usual 007 flick. Unfortunately, Apted's complete lack of experience with action makes this movie as lopsided as Tomorrow Never Dies, just in the opposite way.Action scenes are generally very weak, slowly paced, badly choreographed and lacking geography. The battle in the missile silo and the opening boat chase are the only decent set-pieces. The buzz-saw helicopter attack on Zukovsky's factory is really rather poor, and the final fist fight with Renard is pathetic. This came out in 1999, the year we saw the Jedi fighting Darth Maul, and The Matrix. In that context it's awful.But with regards to the storyline, Apted adds a lot. The central story of Elektra, the victim being the ultimate villain, is well-played and surprising. Sophie Marceau is a standout, as is Robert Carlyle as Renard. The latter really engages the audiences sympathy as a man who has lost the ability to feel anything. Bond becomes more involved with the storyline and becomes more vulnerable, and this is perhaps Brosnan's best performance in the role. Look for his reaction when Elektra asks him how he survives.The movie is full of the awful double-entendres that plagued the Brosnan years. The cinematography is bland, the locations are rarely attractive. I'd also question the costume design (Brosnan's outfit during the climax is horrible). A scene where Zukovsky flees from CGI rotor blades and lands in a pool of caviar matches the worst excesses of Lucas Jar-Jar Binks slapstick. Denise Richards is a ludicrous nuclear physicist but is perfectly passable as a Bond movie nuclear physicist. It's laughable that almost every shot of her during the finale are at chest level.Though the action is weak, the movie is dramatic and exciting, especially from the half way point onwards. Two of the greatest villains in the series, and one of the best plots, ultimately make this a winner, albeit a qualified one.",The World Is Not Enough
208,lethalweapon,"Great movie, but just an average 'Bond Movie'",7,3 January 2003,"The movie is really 'not enough' as a Bond flick. I had dismissed it at first, when I saw it two years ago, but after watching the 20th Bond Movie, ""Die Another Day"", I saw it in a new light.The 19th installment of the Bond genre deviated from the Bond theme in a few key respects. They may not offend the casual movie goer, but could pull a few nerves of the dedicated Bond fan. I must stress here that this is an excellent and absolutely incredible film... just not better than an 'average' Bond movie.M is directly involved. M is supposed to be impartial in all matters. M is supposed to be the decision maker and a good one at that. And 007 never really undermines M. Even when his own judgenment call defies that of M, he silently absorbs M's decision.And Bond is always assigned to save the world. Although he ends up doing just that, his initial assignment is to 'protect Ms. King'. Unacceptable.And a nuclear physicist of Denise Richard's youth, figure, bad acting and animation...please!Brosnan gives a good performance, and I rate him the second best Bond, second only to Connery. And don't give me that cra* about ""You people prefer Connery cuz you saw him in your teens"" and stuff. I'm 22, and though I find Brosnan's movies to be better due to better VFX and better acting by supporting cast, I maintain that Connery was the best. Hell, He IS Bond. You just have to time orient yourself before you watch his movies and allow for the lack of VFX and all. He IS the best. Brosnan comes close. And personally, I think his best Bond movie was ""Tomorrow Never Dies""Getting back on track, on the whole, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is pretty good.Sophie Marceau gives a wonderful performance, the Bond dialogs still has it's charm, Brosnan gives his share of good acting, and that always helps. Desmond Llewelyn's (Q) final performance went without a hitch, as it usually does. The title sequence is spellbinding. The story base is good. Robert Carlisle easily bags the credit for a magnificent portrayal of the villain, although I confess that the underlying theme behind the villain, Renard is too far fetched for words.. A living corpse with the slowest moving bullet in the world, killing off all senses in his body before ultimately completing the execution in a span of a couple of years!!! Really? Utter nonsense... But you know what? I love it. And topped with interesting gadgets, fitting punchlines, tolerable puns, and good direction moves it up to be an average Bond movie.And don't let's forget the theme music from garbage... And the animation during the title sequences were spectacular. Certainly the best to date. Compare with the non traditional opening credits of ""Die Another Day"", and the myth that the opening credits sequence gets better with each Bond movie, gets shattered.Hoping for better Bond movies, I remainJoy, Hamish Joy",The World Is Not Enough
209,Dilip,Perhaps my favorite James Bond movie!,9,19 December 1999,"James Bond at his best!  This was one of the best of all the Bond films I've seen.  The plot was interesting, the action very exciting, the special effects well done, and James his typical unflappable and impeccably dressed self.  I can't imagine anybody interested in this genre not loving this film.  An added personal plus for me was Judi Dench playing the role of 'M' - I love the PBS comedy ""As Time Goes By"" with her as the co-star.

211,DaRick89,"Better upon the third viewing, but still no more than decent, really",6,10 June 2009,"My opinion of The World is Not Enough has varied over the years. When I was 10, I loved it, despite the dull middle part. When I was somewhat older, I watched it again and found it to be mediocre, with long stretches of tedium in between the pyrotechnics, with Pierce Brosnan the only one to really make an impression (my Casino Royale review had a few unkind words to say about it). I've watched it again. I do think it is a little better than mediocre. Although there are some sizable dull periods, the middle part is somewhat more interesting than I remember (as the true nature of Sophie Marceau's character is gradually revealed). The ending is clichéd, the quality of the acting is inconsistent and I still maintain that the movie adheres to the 'Bond plot structure', only to not as detrimental an effect as I remembered.Well, I must say that, no matter when I viewed it, the beginning was always spectacular and, IMO, the best part of the film. Not only does Bond get himself into an altercation within the first few minutes of the film, but after an assassination takes place, Bond pulls out all of the stops in chasing down his killer, including firing torpedoes, going underwater, travelling on the roads...in a rocket-powered boat, no less! The middle part, like I said, does drag for long periods, but there are a few isolated spots of excitement, like when Bond goes and kills one of Renard's top henchmen. The development of Elektra King's character in this part, given what she would become, is also interesting. She appears to be a damsel-in-distress, but as Bond analyses her actions and intentions, her demeanour gradually changes and the facade begins to slip.The fight scenes at the end are entertaining. Given the adherence to the Bond plot structure, this is to be expected. Not much more can be said.The acting was uneven. Renard (Robert Carlyle) was not amongst the best Bond villains, but he was creepy enough, I guess. Coltrane, from GoldenEye, is OK, whilst Sophie Marceau was actually pretty good. She is, IMO, beautiful and she certainly turned on the sex quotient effectively. Indeed, the scene with her and Brosnan when he was tied to a garrote was compulsive viewing. As for Brosnan, he makes for a fine 007, making his character seem suave and self-assured without looking like a knob. Judi Dench too, was actually better than I remembered - she was more fluid and inventive (witness her using an old battery clock at the end) and less stereotypical. Denise Richards, unfortunately, is both a terrible casting choice and unconvincing as a nuclear scientist (I mean, come on...).Ultimately, The World is Not Enough is a decent film. It's no classic - to me, it's just another Bond film. However, it's still worth seeing once (or maybe more if you're a Bond buff).3/5 stars",The World Is Not Enough
212,Dkish,Its the best Bond in ten years.,8,21 November 1999,"The World is Not Enough By Dean Kish	Pierce Brosnan's third outing as James Bond and a slew of controversy if it will be his last. 	Feeling responsible for the death of a British oil tycoon and a friend, who died in an explosion in MI6 headquarters, James Bond takes position as bodyguard to the tycoon's daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau), who has a mysterious past and hidden agenda. 	In recent weeks, Brosnan has gone on record saying he wants more revealing and sexier love scenes in Bond and he would love to see Bond killed off. He has also said he wouldn't mind leaving Bond behind. Are these the greatest things to be saying upon the opening of the film? 	It would be such a shame when he finally seems to be playing Bond right and having a script that finally wants us to see more Bond. After the dismal `Tomorrow Never Dies' I was wondering how the franchise was going to rebound. 	In the two past Brosnan/Bond films, we had superficial scripts which never had any depth. The stunts and deliveries were setup like other action films of the times but none really addressed why Bond is Bond. The last two were just basically action films with Pierce Brosnan. 	I guess the next question to ask is who or what is Bond? And why that element makes a good Bond film. A superior Bond film is always in the script and the intrigue associated with a spy. In the latest film the script always has two levels going on coupled with a pain within Bond himself. These play off each other as the perpetual hero shows the signs of being human. In the past 5 Bond films they have been trying to make him more human and it really isn't till this one that they seem to have located the angle they sought. Betrayed, injured, and scorned are just some of the emotions I haven't seen in Bond in years. And that's exactly why this one works and why its the best Bond in ten years. 	With this revelation, director Michael Apted's action sequences and locales seem to be fleshed out and in the highest of Bond form. Apted pushes the envelope with a great Bond finale which pivots Bond and the villain dueling in a submarine spiraling towards the bottom of the ocean. This sequence is true Bond and reminds me a lot of the great climaxes of the 80's pictures.	Within the cast is the always brilliant Sophie Marceau who's innocent but brutal Elektra is going to be a fondly remembered Bond girl. Wasted is 2nd Bond girl Denise Richards who seems to be quite out of her element and made me thinking that these two could be father and daughter instead of lovers. Richards looks like a teen and is supposed to be a `Lara Croft type nuclear expert'? Rounding out the rest of the cast is `the man who can feel no pain' Renard played deviously by Robert Carlyle. Carlyle reminded me a lot of Sean Bean's 006 in `Goldeneye'. 	With this entry into the Bond vault I hope Brosnan comes back for at least two or three more. Connery and Moore did over six each why can't Brosnan. So here is to the continuation of the franchise. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",The World Is Not Enough
213,Servo-11,The worst yet (with only one redeeming feature),2,22 October 2001,"OK, Moonraker stunk.  It was really bad.  This was worse.  Wow, thought I'd never say it!Bond is a dead horse and how many times can you beat it?  The days of Connery, Moore and Dalton are over, sadly.  Now we have Remington Bond walking stiffly around and tossing off the double entendres that, far from funny, are just sleazy.  They were fine in the 60s and 70s, but lines like ""I thought Christmas only comes once a year"" are just pathetic.  Connery's ""collars and cuffs"" line in Diamonds Are Forever is much more classy (relatively).  The action sequences are getting more laughable than thrilling.  I was 10 minutes away from the end of Tomorrow Never Dies before I had to shut it off -- it was so bad.But it's not Pierce Brosnan or the screenwriters who are to blame for the mess the Bond franchise is in.  Blame the writers for From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and The Spy Who Loved Me for setting the bar too high.  And blame the fans who demand more fantastic gadgets and stunts with every new series entry.  It's a sad thing when the parodies of a genre make more money than the serious ones (like Austin Powers).But this movie wasn't all bad.  I give it a 2 for Robert Carlyle, or what we saw of him.  WHERE WAS HE??????  You hardly saw him and he was the only thing in this movie that I liked.  This was a Bond villain who wasn't consummate evil.  He had feelings (emotional, if not physical) and he deserved more character development.  **Possible spoiler*** An interesting dynamic in his relationship with Elektra was who manipulated who.  In the end, he was certainly the more sympathetic character. *END SPOILER*  It was just awful to sit through 2 hours and 10 minutes and keep waiting for him to appear on the screen, only to see Denise Richards once more play the smart scientisty Bond girl in her Lara Croft costume.  That's an idea....Why not put put La Jolie in a Bond movie?  That might take the sag out of the series!I think it's a good idea of get Brosnan out of the series.  I haven't enjoyed a single Bond movie that he's done.  Give me Connery, Dalton, Moore and even Lazenby.  And more villains like Carlyle.  And give them more screen time while you're at it!!!!!!  I honestly can't remember a villain that you saw so little of.  At least you eventually saw Blofeld after all the mystery was built up and he was a compelling villain.  Renard is dead and gone. :,(  I guess I'll just take solace in my Hamish Macbeth tapes, The Full Monty and Plunkett and Maclean.",The World Is Not Enough
214,nealklein,This Movie Was Not Enough,5,18 May 2000,"I have been a Bond aficionado since I was 9 years old. I try my best to be as objective as possible when it comes to reviewing a movie on its own merits. But I have to take a stand with this film. ""The World Is Not Enough"" (or TWINE for short) is a disappointing addition to the Bond series.And it's not for lack of trying. Oh, it has the obligatory boat chase, ski chase, nuclear bombs, beautiful women, deranged villains, and lots of shooting at bad guys. It has the M confrontation scene and the Q-with-his-gadgets scene. It even has Robbie Coltrane's character from ""Goldeneye"". But that is just not enough.The locations are, for lack of a better word, ugly. Except possibly for the snowy mountains, I don't know any place in TWINE that will pique one's interest in travelling. If that's just an attempt at realism, it fails. Even ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" made Hamburg look interesting.If you're one of those who is a stickler for detail, you will spot the continuity errors in the boat chase at the beginning. You will howl at some of the plot holes. (What would make someone fear Renard enough to commit suicide when he seems more like a two-bit hood who's dying anyway? Who *was* Dr. Christmas Jones working for? etc.)But if you are willing to just have fun, you will probably still notice the slack pacing in the ski chase, the mediocrity of Robert Carlysle's Renard, and the flat directing of some of the more interesting actors from Great Britain. And the ending has almost no punch at all. This movie has bad directing and poor writing, and it's painful to experience at times.And then, there's Denise Richards. My word, is she awful! She is undeniably beautiful, but thoroughly unbelievable as a nuclear physicist. She's almost as bad as Tanya Roberts in ""A View to a Kill"" without a hint of sophistication or respectability. (Contrast her with Michelle Yeoh or Maud Adams.)I cannot give this film a great vote of confidence. Rent ""The Saint"" instead. And if anyone cares for Ian Fleming and James Bond, please retire the character with dignity, or give him a movie worth his stature.",The World Is Not Enough
215,Wwmbrd,One of the better Modern Bonds,7,20 September 2021,"The World Is Not Enough is low-key one of the better modern Bond films, and definitely the second best of the Brosnan era, behind Goldeneye. The plot, about anarchists working with Russia to destabilize the global oil supply in order to pump up profits and market share of a competing firm (they also worked a nuclear plotline in, to good effect), is something that could have been ripped from the headlines then (1999/Y2K), but seems nearly prescient now, given Russia's near-undoing of the fabric of OPEC in February of 2020.Brosnan is suave and slick as ever in his third Bond outing, but The same cannot be said of Denise Richards, who plays the 25 year old nuclear physicist, Christmas Jones (Doctor, she would remind you). Forgetting the fact that her character does nothing of substance with actual nuclear anything, she spouts a bit of expository dialogue about the ramifications of playing with nuclear fire, and that's really about it. Rounding out the trash we have Robert Carlyle as Renard, the leadhead anarchist who feels no pain after being shot point blank to the noggin previous to the opening of the film. His Russian accent is absolutely laughable and he just gives up on it about halfway through In favor of his native Scottish. Think Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker's Dracula. He's blank, expressionless, and oddly ""even"" to be someone as fiery as an anarchist who's plotting nuclear doom- and honestly a detractor from the film as the tritagonist. I guess they just needed someone to fill the ""obvious bad"" role. Carlyle wasn't bad in his main role in trainspotting, but he left the acting at home when he showed up for duty here.The real star of the movie is Sophie Marceau as Elektra King, oil baroness of the aforementioned oil-in-question. Brosnan Bond films had some of the stronger Bond Girl characters in them, from Natalia and Xenia in Goldeneye to Wai Lin in Tomorrow Never Dies, (I'm trying my best to forget Halle Berry and Madonna in Die Another Day) but Elektra King takes the cake. She's a young woman who's both a successful businessperson as well as an aggressively sexual individual who views sex as more of a tool to get what she wants rather, than harbor illusions of love (much like Bond himself). She elaborates in an early scene that once she figured out how to get men to do what she wanted, it was easy for her- and that the only real challenge was in global politics with her oil. Heady, but very ""Bond"". It's just refreshing to see a female character in Bond who is a dangerous matchup for him in multiple ways- emotionally, psychologically, and sexually: typically things Bond uses to his advantage in the series- they get turned on him here.All in all, a solid Bond outing, especially after the disappointing Tomorrow Never Dies. Shame, though, that Die Another Day would follow. It's even worse than the joke that concludes this film about having ""Christmas in Turkey"". *slide whistle*7.25/10.",The World Is Not Enough
216,nutsy,"THE BEST BOND FILM SINCE ""THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS""",10,2 November 2003,"Why? Because the three Bond movies made in between THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH have had nothing in the way of original elements. This Bond movie plays with structure and format. The pre-credits sequence is packed with plot and action, satisfying in both departments. Bond is less gadget dependent here, making him more like a real spy (or the pre-GOLDFINGER Bond). There is a dark edge on Bond's character, and the set-up is utterly sweet.SPOILERS FOLLOWThe twist (something modern movies do too much) is that the girl, Sophie Marceau, is the real villain of the piece. And the cool part is that James Bond fell genuinely in love with her, protecting her. Brosnan and Marceau share one of the best love scenes in the series. She drops the tell-tale line ""what's the point of living if you don't feel alive?"", which henchman Carlyle later repeats. Robert Carlyle does a wonderful turn as the henchman who can't feel anything. One can't really say his character is well developed, but what is done with him is great. The way he disposes of them both is a wonderful change after the dull character treatments in the last two films. The fact that it acknowledges character at all brings it on par with THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS (which was the best since THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, which was great). The characters don't reach the level of THE THIRD MAN, but they manage.Our beloved Q, Desmond Llewelyn (who'd been in the series since FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE) makes his exit after introducing the beloved John Cleese as his replacement. Sadly similar honors were never given to Bernard Lee as M or Lois Maxwell as Money Penny (let's face it, Samantha Bond just sucks). At least this time the replacement is someone good.Then there's the film's most advertised flaw: Denise Richards. Yes, I know nuclear scientist are not hot young babes. Yes, I know the girl couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. Yes, I know the named Christmas Jones is stupid. She stinks, but she's the only smudge on an otherwise spotless 007 flick. Who cares? Bond movies always have something like this. DR. NO featured some terrible acting. No one has ever been named Pussy Galore. Jill St. John did an awful job in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Tanya Roberts did even worse in A VIEW TO A KILL. This is no big deal. Denise Richards sucks and her character was an irritating extra, but she isn't the first and she doesn't ruin the film.THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is a very good ride and a very good Bond film. The title links back to ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (the best movie in the series). It beats the living tar out of TOMORROW NEVER DIES, GOLDENEYE, and DIE ANOTHER DAY, making it Brosnan's best. The conflict between love and duty is clearer than ever, giving 007 an edge that should be played on. Apted proves to be a better Bond director than a director of drama (this easily tops GORILLAS IN THE MIST). The elements brought in, like fresh texture, and the collapsed soviet union, make it comparable to the better parts of THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. This is a winner. Just remember that the bimbo is eye-candy and Bond is the one to listen to.",The World Is Not Enough
217,jmoney-2,"A strong script that provides more romance, seduction, betrayal, psychological tension and espionage intrigue than we've seen in any of the recent Bonds.",9,21 November 1999,"Pierce Brosnan is three for three.  Since helping to revive the James Bond series four years ago, Brosnan has not only become my favorite 007 (for me he combines the best elements of both Sean Connery and Roger Moore), he's also starred in three of the best Bond films.  ""The World Is Not Enough"" is a bit of a departure from Brosnan's first two outings and but is still destined to be a 007 classic.The 19th installment in the series is not as visually slick as ""GoldenEye"", nor does it have the non-stop John Woo-style action of ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".  But it makes up for it with a strong script that provides more romance, seduction, betrayal, psychological tension and espionage intrigue than we've seen in any of the recent Bonds.  This time out the mood is darker and more serious.  But the outlandishness of the Bond universe is still in effect.  As for the action scenes -- there are more than enough of them to satisfy Bond fans.  The highlight is probably a chase down a ski slope with Bond and a woman pursued by bad guys in para-gliders.  ""The World Is Not Enough"" also features one of the most excruciating torture scenes in any Bond film.  It's worthy of Ian Fleming.  The script also contains some of the funnier double entendres in the series -- the last line is a killer.",The World Is Not Enough
218,stiv-7,The best Bond in years.,8,30 November 1999,"I caught this one on opening night, and it is still with me, which is really saying something for an action film. Bond is back with a vengeance, and Michael Apted's masterful direction of what could have easily been another routine entry in the series raises it to the same classic status as Goldfinger. I was initially annoyed at the prospect of Pierce Brosnan as Bond, but he seems to have slipped quite comfortably into the role, and holds his own with such acting luminaries as Dame Judi Dench,Robert Carlyle, and the always interesting Robbie Coltrane. I appreciated the depth given to the stereotypical Bond girls this round, particularly Sophie Marceau, who is one of the great finds of this decade. I'm definitely going to see this one again, and waiting with baited breath for the next one. One last note: love the casting of John Cleese, but for those who haven't seen the film, I won't spoil the surprise.",The World Is Not Enough
219,Castor-5,The best bond in a long time,10,19 November 1999,"I've grown up with the James Bond series.  My brothers were always watching them when I was as young as 5 (now 18) and thanks to that, it made me become a fan just like them.  My favorites are The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Goldfinger, and Licence to Kill.  The World Is Not Enough will most likely be up there on possibly one of the best bonds, easily on the top 7.As we all know, Sean Connery is the best Bond.  He set the standard, said the one-liners first, got the women first, got the gadgets first, did the stunts first, etc.  Following him were George Lazenby (honestly not that bad, but far from Connery), Roger Moore (much different from Connery, but one of the best), Timothy Dalton (didn't have the looks but definatly had the role down cold), and now Pierce Brosnan.  After seeing Goldeneye I figured ""damn, he really does looks like Bond.""  Then Tomorrow Never Dies he was more comfortable with the role but of course, the film lacked in many ways.  But after The World Is Not Enough, he not only has the part down perfectly but he's the best Bond since Connery.The way I look at it every Bond film is truly a good film.  Some lack quite a bit like Moonraker or A View To A Kill where as they either get to corny or try to do to much.  You always are thrilled when you are watching the Bond films, however.  But From Russia With Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service had very suspenseful plots that added the tension that was needed to make them great Bond films.  This tension lies in The World Is Not Enough thanks to a strong plot and stronger acting.  The ones I liked best were for there own reasons.  On Her Majesty's Secret Service because it was very suspenseful and dramatic ending.  For Your Eyes Only because it had the best action sequences of the series.  The World Is Not Enough has both these aspects that make an excellent Bond film.  It's sad to see Q leave, but it's great to see that Bond is back on track.",The World Is Not Enough
220,daved-3,"Same old Bond, but better",7,28 November 1999,"I think with this outing Brosnan establishes that he is (gasp) the best Bond ever (Connerey's great, but he's helped by the fact he had better scripts to work with).  In the first scene he establishes a facet of Bond that's been lost since Roger Moore took over--that Bond is dangerous and quite unaffected by killing people.  Marceau is a great Bond woman, the action scenes are well done by director Apted, the script does what Bond scripts are supposed to do (by my count Bond only does three impossible things, far less than any Bond film since Moore took over), and to my amazement, even mis-cast Denise Richards acquits herself well.  There's a great villain in Renard, but he is underused which is a shame; after so many so-so bad guys I wished they'd done more with an interesting one who is not simply a meglo-maniac.  They seem to have run out of ideas for the car (which meets a quick end), but the addition of Cleese as ""R"" should help.  I hope Brosnan makes at least one more appearance as Bond.",The World Is Not Enough
221,sataft-2,THE TIME IS NOW AT HAND TO GIVE UP ON BOND!,4,24 May 2000,"Let me state for the record that Pierce Brosnan's acting talent gets better with age.  In this film, his portrayal of the title character, James Bond, is superb. (No, he's not Sean Connery, but then is anyone?) And once again, as in all of his Bond performances, Brosnan has chosen to define the character in his own style.  Clearly, this professional choice was a wise one and should be highly applauded.  I also found the prologue tribute to the late Desmond Llewelyn (Q) to be touching and tasteful: an outstanding farewell to a wonderful master character actor, whose exit from the role had been planned for the next film in the series, only to be usurped by a tragic and untimely demise.  Let me also state that I could find no fault with the excellent and credible acting of Robert Carlyle as the sinister Renard, the latest Bond villian.  But it should be noted that what made the previous Bond villains so memorable was that, indeed, they did have emotions: be as they were, selfish, quite sinister and, for the most part, down-right nasty. However, a villain whose main attraction is his inability to feel pain, or any other physical sensation, holds no real appeal that is translatable to the viewing audience. Bond fans will always remember Goldfinger and Emelio Largo.  I seriously doubt if any will remember Renard.  As for the film itself, I am sorry to report I found, not necessarily predictable, but nevertheless, boring.  Unless that is, you happen to be a computer 'techie' and or combined demolition enthusiast. It is about time that someone informed the film industry that several hundred pounds of explosives does not constitute a good and palatable script.  Nor would it hurt them to study the 'Indiana Jones"" films to get a handle on the art of action pacing and plot.  Needless to say, one should never trip over or be buried by the other as is so frequently evident in this production: blink and you've missed something.  I might also add, in 'real life' I am a scientist, and even I had difficulty keeping track of the quasi-scientific, mumbo -jumbo plot (which by the way was full of technical holes big enough to drive a truck full of explosives through).  The dialogue, or what passed for such, was atrocious. And, to add insult to injury, the females chosen as co-stars (with the notaable exception of the magnificent Dame Judi Dench as M) were deplorable as actresses  and or sex objects.  Finally, the film itself was far too long.  Even in a cut down version from an original 140 minutes to the released 128 minutes, I couldn't wait for it to end.  All in all, I think its fair to say Mr.Bond has had a damn good run.  Let him now, like Q, pass away in quiet timely dignity.",The World Is Not Enough
222,shamsee,One of the Most Exhilarating Bond Movies,7,17 May 2000,"Missed it in theater, so just so is yesterday on video. If it was so Exhilarating on video, then I can only imagine how great it would have been on Big Screen. Brosnan is the best without any question. Without him, our beloved hero 007 would not have survived 90s. Brosnan has class and sophistication of previous Bonds, but a cool demeanor and personality suited for action today. Anyone else, and the action would seem cheap and mindless. Brosnan delivers it in cool and calculated way, as if their is a lot of thought behind it.Michael Apted has created a very enjoyable movie, with mind blowing fast pace action. You can feel the blood rushing through your veins. It is just too bad that he made few obvious blunders, that will keep this movie from being classified as a classic. The choice of both women was wrong. Sophie Marceu doesn't seem evil enough, or confident enough, or sexy enough, like the bad girl from ""Golden Eye"". She seems like a chick from Beverly Hills 90210, trying to play the bad cold blooded girl. However, compared to Denise Richards playing a Nuclear Physicist, Sophie gave an  Oscar winning performance. I mean what was Apted thinking or not thinking? I guess we are beyond the days of just having bimbos, and have progressed to the age where bimbos play nuclear scientists! The scene where she is first introduced, where she is getting out of her scientist suit, is just one of the cheapest ploy to present eye candy that I have ever seen. Also, the characters of 'M' and 'Christmas Jones', do not make any significant contribution in helping Bond. Its almost like the director wanted to make them useful, and was thinking about it, but just forgot about them in the end, and next thing you know the movie was complete. The villain 'Renard' was also not given enough chance to establish an identity. He talked too much and that took away  the mystery of his character. The guy who played bad guy on ""Gladiator"", J. Phoenix, showed what bad character is supposed to be.Other than that, the movie was awesome. The final action sequence kicked butt! One thing that was missing was the Villain's personal assistant, the big bad killer, that Bond always has to fight, and is always mismatched but wins because he is smarter, and then gets to the the Villain in chief.The last line was perfect. I look forward to Bond's return.",The World Is Not Enough
223,MundaneNoodle,entertaining but...,7,22 May 2000,"Hey the formula still works after forty years! Ok...can we all agree that Denise Richards was a miscast, and can't act to save her life? Tattoo from Fantasy Island would have made a more convincing nuclear physicist. She looks good in a wet t-shirt and daisy duke shorts, but that's about all! *Spoilers ahead*... The action sequence with the helicopter and the tree blade on the dock was a bit long and ridiculous. I am also disappointed that Robbie Coltrane's character was killed off, just as he was getting interesting in the series. As well, a sad farewell to Q, he was the greatest, although John Cleese should fill his shoes quite nicely. I also wish the Renard character had shown a bit more ""Dr. evil"" personality. Oh well, it's still a very exciting movie, and worth a rental. Pierce Brosnan is way ahead of Roger Moore and light years ahead of Timothy Dalton.",The World Is Not Enough
224,sutcal,James Bond..the 19th installment and much of a muchness really,7,16 July 2001,"I have always been an avid James Bond Fan from my younger years so I I haven't quite figured out why the movie did not appeal to me as much.  It has the ladies, the action, the totally unrealistic plot like any other Bond movie..Brosnan is a good Bond (but not in the class of Connery or Moore). Maybe that's it.  Modern technology makes the Bond stunts not as stand outish as they used to be.Maybe its the female M...or John Cleese coming into the fray as the ""replacement Q"".  Or maybe, just maybe after 19 Bond movies the novelty has worn off.That said this is still a good Bond movie as far as Bond movies go, and the James Bond in this movie is a little more ruthless and callous in nature (watch to see as he doesn't always have to kill in this movie but does).For those of you that watch this movie, don't expect a Bond classic, but it is one of the better Bond movies of recent times.",The World Is Not Enough
225,rutherfordh-81993,Terribly Underrated,7,14 July 2021,"The World Is Not Enough is ranked as one of the weakest of any of the Bond films, but it does have many positives. The action is very strong in this one, like the caviar factory and the ski chase. Pierce Brosnan is joined by two very good actors to be the villains, and are some of the vest in the franchise. The locations are good, and it gives the films a different dimension, particularly in terms of the role of M. It is badly underrated, and is a great film, but just has some issues in the actual story.",The World Is Not Enough

227,sterlinrivera-2000,Outrageously Fun,9,5 February 2020,"The World is Not Enough is a Bond film that I forgot how highly awesome it is. I use to really like this one, but now I love it and is easily one of my favorite Bond films.The film is where after a oil tycoon, Robert King (David Calder) gets murdered, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) has the assignment to protect his daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau). Bond then becomes suspicious of her motives as she plans to take down an oil heiress with a anarchist, Renard (Robert Carlyle). Bond then teams up with the beautiful nuclear psychist, Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) and together they battle against time to stop this terrorist plan.After rewatching this film, I really liked it alot. I would say it is probably just as awesome as Tomorrow Never Dies. The action was mind blowing and spectacular, the story was very unique and they took their time making it well developed, and the acting was very great from everyone in this one. Pierce Brosnan did such an outstanding job yet again as Bond, and I loved Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle as the villans. They played their parts perfectly, and Denise Richards was awesome as the Bond girl, Christmas Jones.All in all, The World is Not Enough went from being a really solid film to being one of the best Bond films ever after rewatching it.",The World Is Not Enough
228,cartman_1337,The worst Bond-film ever!,3,25 April 2000,"This is the worst Bond-movie ever! I just can't get what everyone finds so entertaining about this movie. The opening sequence is the only good sequence in the movie, after that it's just downhill - straight to damnation.The opening credits are the dullest and silliest ever. And the plot throughout the whole movie lacks confidence, credibility and suspense. We've seen it all before.The badguy is the silliest and less credible ever. And the chicks are too stupid too. Whatever happened to the vicious badguys from the early films. The badguys now are just nerds and badguy wanna-be's. You're not worried about Bond's safety at any point, as you were before. This movie doesn't work as anything...GoldenEye was terrible, Tomorrow Never Dies worse, but this is the lowest a Bond movie can sink (I hope), I don't find anything good to say about the film, except that there was a tiny tiny feel of entertainment and good old Bond-thrill in the opening sequence.2/10 - 2 because of the opening sequence. 1's are reserved for the films actually worse than this one, such as Lost In Space and The Postman...",The World Is Not Enough
229,tonynworah,Bond is Back,7,9 August 2010,"After the dismal Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough came with a vengeance. I've always been a fan of Bond, James Bond. TND was disappointing. The plot was ugh...,But TWINE restored the franchise in my view. Whenever, I hear negative critics about the film, I actually go, did these guys really watch the film? First, the pre credits opening is one of the best I've ever seen. It ranks right up there with The Spy Who Loved Me, The Living Daylights, Thunderball, Octopussy. But the strenght in TWINE was that the pre credit sequence had a strong relationship with the main movie.Judi Dench as usual gives her riveting performance as M, sometimes eclipsing even the indomitable Bernard Lee. Here, she was given a more active part as she actually was compelled to go into the active field with Bond. One of the best moves by the Bond producers post Pierce Brosnan was to retain her as M.I hope she still appears in more Bond movies.The surprise here was Sophie Marcue who is the main villain, the first for a woman (that is if you discount the chilling Rosa Klebb of From Russia With Love). The woman is breathlessly beautiful. I could see why Bond would fall in love with her even though he does not hesitate to kill her.Why she has not yet become a major star is what I don't understand.Supporting roles by John Cleese, and the Russian broker(Can't remember his name) were top notch. The sad exit of Desmond Llelywn was one of the most endearing parts of the movie. He is one of the most enduring characters in the Bond Franchis and always had a semi confrontational but ultimately loyal relationship with 007. I nearly cried when he left the movie.Elektra's henchman Renard was diabolically played by the British actor of The Full Monthy.His screen presence was chillingly felt. The only drawback was that he was underutilized,a serious minus for the film.Another serious minus was Denise who played the heroine,Dr. Christmas Jones,a nuclear scientist. Her acting like Halle Berry's embarrassing one liners made me cringe.Then there is Bond himself.Our saviour.Pierce Brosnan has shown that he is capable of carrying the legend of Bond on his shoulders. Forget the appalling TND and Die Another Day. The screen writers were obviously sleep walking when writing the scripts. It would have been great if Brosnan had bowed of the Bond movies with TWINE instead of the DAD.The action sequences apart from the lackluster snow scene were worthy of Bond. My best snow scenes in the Bond movies have always been in this order, OHMSS,TSWLM,FYEO,AVTAK,TLD.TWINE snow scene just lacked a lot of energy.I won't be surprised if that was the last scene that was shot and by then the crew was already tired.Still, TWINE is one of Brosnan's better Bond outings. And a solid ride of entertainment.",The World Is Not Enough
230,axopnk,Good James Bond,7,7 September 2005,"I just got done watching The World is Not Enough, and i have to say it's a pretty good James Bond. I wouldn't give it a 8-10 score range like Golden Eye but it definitely held it's own. Sophie and Pierce did excellent jobs in the characters as well as their dialogue. It was also a surprise to have Sophie as a villain and also to be this James bond first women villain type. It was also interesting to see how James ""dealt"" with her at the end, i have to admit i didn't see that coming. Renard was OK as a villain, but his condition didn't really make him more powerful, it seems that the writers could have done much better job with his type of condition. Finally Denise Richards was pretty much horrible. Her lines that just point out the obvious and her high pitch voice was grade c. The director or casting should have expected to get this type of quality from a Grade C at best B actress. If they wanted to give the audience something like that then they should have her do something like WILD THINGS. The movie could have done fine without her. She seems to have no real purpose in the movie, especially the question of why the hell was she helping to make a nuclear bomb? Second question is why change her mind all of a sudden? To make it worse is you can really see the quality of actress talent between Sophie and Denise. Having them both in the same movie is like having Harrison Ford and Ben Afleck on the same screen. Luckily there's not to many plot holes in this movie. Overall though this movie is one of the better James Bond types but don't expect it to be on the same level as Golden eye.",The World Is Not Enough
231,Dante Hicks,Okay I Suppose,6,10 June 2000,"Half-decent Bond vehicle which has all the usual gadgets, explosives and attractive women but which fails to be either particularly interesting or well put together. Often feeling like two films it impresses with it's action scenes but is let down by it's lack of a good couple of baddies. Robert Carlyle simply is not on screen long enough to be effective in his role and the immense fear everyone holds him in isn't at all understandable. Sophie Marceau at least gets a chance to show off her tremendous range of accents (Is it English? French? Russian? Who knows!)and that'll hold her in good stead but I can't help but feel that after Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies this is quite a tame effort in comparison.",The World Is Not Enough
232,Starks,Now this is the Bond I remember...,8,22 November 1999,"I saw TWINE this weekend and was very pleased.  This is probably as close as Brosnan and Co. will get to replicating the great Bond films of the Connery era. Most of the previous comments get into the film, so I will not duplicate their work.  But I will tell what I liked about TWINE and a couple of the things I didn't like.What I liked: 1. WOMEN - This has really been at the core of the Bond series.  This is why 99 percent of the guys who see Bond go.  And TWINE has plenty of them from beginning to end.  And this Bond lets Brosnan have fun with them with witty interplay and sexual double entendres. There are some classic Bond lines that will give Mike Meyers plenty of material for his next Austin Powers movie. Sophie Marceau was excellent and I thought Denise Richards held her own (memo to critics: who cares if Denise is unbelievable as a nuclear physicist - she looked fantastic) 2. OPENING SEQUENCE - One of the best Bond opening sequences.  Words cannot describe the opening chase scene.  This alone was worth the 9 bucks I spent to see it 3. GADGETS - Some good believable stuff.  The BMW was amazing although I wish we could have seen it in action a little more. Good addition of John CLeese as R, his dialoque with Bond was very funny. 4. STORY/DIALOGUE - A pretty good story.  Considering the world is running out of evil communist dictators, the Bond script writers have done the best that they can (it's better than the evil media baron of the last film). Nice to see M involved in the story although I wish they had given her something more to do.  Finally Bond had some of his wittiest dialogue to date. 5. DIRECTOR - This was a good looking movie that moved along at  a nice brisk pace.  The locales were pretty cool and the stunt photography was fantastic.Now what I didn't like: 1. EVIL BAD GUY - Maybe I've been spoiled by Austin Powers but I go to a Bond film to cheer for the bad guy (Goldfinger, etc).  The bad guys in this film weren't really that bad.  Even the guy who felt no pain was pretty lame. And the henchmen were boring to.  We need a new TopJob or Jaws Please!! 2. CASINO SCENE - It was great having a Bond casino scene but I thought this one was a bit wasted.  In the next Bond let's get James in the casino playing a few hands of something. 3. EVIL SCHEME - I thought the evil scheme wasn't clearly laid out and the stakes weren't high enough.  You never really felt like the world was in danger.So there is my critique. Overall an great Bond film with a few problems that don't get in the way of it being very entertaining. Definitely check it out.",The World Is Not Enough

Not the best Bond ever but definately worth watching if u are Bond fan. It felt a bit different, the opening sequence was really different, it actually had to do with the movie, it was a long opener as well. But that didn't seem to bother me, Brosnon was good as usual in this one, Elektra King was a good villian for a woman, and well Robert Caryle could've been better. He wasn't evil enough. As for the Bond girl in this one, she hardly meant anything to the movie, she didn't even have to be in it, M had more of an involvement and I actually liked that, something different for a change. Overall the movie was definately worth the wait, and I thought was worth seeing but nothing to make a huge thing about.",The World Is Not Enough

238,prudhoeboy,Theme Song Almost Enough,10,23 October 2021,"This movie checks the boxes for a top rating in an almost formulaic way - title, theme song, plot and action; character performances, etc. The title is sufficiently ponderous to get you thinking about how it relates to the movie and we wait in anticipation when it quoted in the movie. Movie dialogue would have us believe, tongue in cheek, that it nothing more than a silly, sentimental Bond family logo but it obviously refers to Elektra's oversized ambitions to control the oil market from the east. No mimes in this one. The theme song, performed by the real-life band Garage, is where the movie really racks up points though. The song is by far the best of the Brosnan era and one of the best of the franchise. I would put it in the top 5. Garage also put out a Bond-like video of the tune starring their lead singer Shirley Manson, who can really belt it out. It's a stellar performance that brings the house down so recommend watching the video before the movie to really get in the mood.As for the villains, pretty much of the same quality as GoldenEye - quite good. Many action sequences with location shots etc. The car was a bit boring and there was little car action in the movie. As for the Bond girl, Denise Richards worked quite well I thought. The fact that she didn't match the stereotype most would expect for a nuclear physicist actually made it more interesting and she worked well with Brosnan. I'm struck by the consistency in the performances of Brosnan as Bond. This was very stabilizing for the franchise given the hiatus after Dalton and the ups and downs of vacuous 80s era Bond movies. Too bad they didn't do one in 2001 because he was getting noticeably older by the time Die Another Day came out. A little bit ironic too given the real world terrorism in that year. Sometimes reality really does get in the way of a good movie.",The World Is Not Enough
239,Eelco_1977,Ok Bondfilm!,6,12 December 1999,"This was a movie I really wanted to see this year (next to Star Wars of course). It turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. Action, beautiful women, a good storyline and a lot of new and interesting locations, it was all in this Bondmovie. On the other hand, I wasn't really impressed about the badguy and badgirl. They had a pretty well designed plan but not as ridiculous or even more world-threatening than Hugo Drax' (""Moonraker"") or Blofeld's. Pierce Brosnan as James Bond was excellent as well as Judi Dench as ""M"" and Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky. Denise Richards as Christmas Jones was a bit underused, I think it would have been better if we had seen a bit more of her. I further think that Desmond Llewelyn should quit playing ""Q"" because he's now really too old. He'll probably quit because John Cleese plays Desmond's assistant ""R"", but we'll see that in the next bondfilm. The biggest disappointment was the film's pace. Especially the last thirty minutes could have been squeezed in ten to fifteen minutes. Overall the film is a bit on the slow side. Another big disappointment was how Renard came to his end. This was just too obvious and too undramatic. In other bondfilms (not all of them)you didn't really see the ending of a bondfilm's villain coming and a lot of those endings were far more dramatic and original than this one. One of the scenes I think wasn't really necessary, was the one with the torcherchair, absolutely unnecessary! When I look at all of the three bondmovies with Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, I think ""Goldeneye"" is still the best and most solid of the three. My all-time favourate bondfilm still is ""Goldfinger"" and second is ""Goldeneye"". So overall, an ok bondmovie!",The World Is Not Enough
240,tomasg-69814,Improvement Since Last.,6,27 February 2016,"A truly shake-up since ""...dies"", this was. A lot more dedicated Pierce Brosnan, some more interesting story, and better casting. (Except the annoying Denise Richards, who does it better on a photo shoot than as an actress.) A female shape named Christmas Jones can't be taken seriously....Solid story, besides the usual greed theme that always is the temptation for villains in 007 movies. (A woman deceives her own family for total control and absolute power over the family business.) The excellent Judy Dench got a little more space, which is very welcomed, and the supporting actors are mostly well picked for the job in hand. Some good action scenes on snow, and an action-packed ending with thrilling moments.When I first watched this movie on a theater in the 90's, I left quite relieved, thinking they were back on track with the Bond movies. This 19th movie adventure of one James Bond moved me in some good way, never to know there was a sadly bad 21st century opening for 007 to come...Pierce Brosnans last show delighted many, not me. With the cards now already on the table, this should have been the last chapter of James Bond Mk. V.But the producers did want to spoil the whole thing, and raze it in a very strange way.",The World Is Not Enough
241,louiss,Its not Enough,6,22 November 1999,"While I was sitting in the theater awaiting the start of TWINE I started talking to a little boy perhaps 8 or 9 and told him that I saw my first James Bond film when I was 7 "" actually I was 6 "" and I began to recall my first Bond film experience which was Goldfinger in late 1964. The boy was astonished at my remark and asked which I proffered the older or newer ones ? I quickly replied the older ones and my viewing of TWINE greatly reinforced my opinion.  In fairness to the producers the objective reality is how many times can you create the same product and consistently make it good !? When Goldfinger was released there was nothing remotely close to compare with it. It was fresh dazzling fantastic entertainment. Like the mustang in the automotive world there was no competition.  So after 37 years 19 EON productions and a few others, spin-offs & spoofs perhaps we should be a little forgiving and accept what we still get from a Bond film good fun entertainment most often still better than anything else out these days but as a life long Bond fanatic I say no ! I want more I waited two long years and I still hope and yearn for at least one great Bond film. To start with the pre-credit sequence is getting to be far more exciting than the lackluster climaxes and TWINE has one of the weakest of the series. I was also wondering what happened to the 1 or 2 great fights we used to see that seemed to have slowly vanished and are completely non existent in this film !? I also long for the great Ken Adam sets that gave the films a visual look that separated them from anything else. The most glaring omission is where is the sadistic henchman that Bond must dispose of before killing the lead villain !? Most film critics site that this like most others follow the same formula of all Bond films I strongly disagree. The formula has changed or perhaps they're just mixing different ingredients. The formula I want has elaborate sets, great fights and a rousing climax. TWINE also has more dramatic scenes than I have ever seen in a Bond film and they seemed awkward and out of place. I was most annoyed by Q's exit. The introduction of his replacement was obvious and a good choice but his decent from Q Branch made me feel like they were lowering him into a tomb for burial. I cannot complain about Pierce Brosnan who is a terrific James Bond and Judi Dench equally excellent as M but Pierce who is beginning to show some age is only committed to one more film and I hate to see his talent wasted as we all know how difficult it will be to find a good replacement. Most of the action sequences are satisfying my favorite being the helicopter raid on Zukovsky's hideout and the exterior shots for the ski chase look fabulous but they don't have the fury or pace of some of the better action pieces in the past  . The Bond girls include a good acting so so looking Sophie Marcuea as Electra a laughable Denise Richards as scientist Christmas Jones who is a knockout unfortunately Maria Grazia Cucinotta the most awesome looking woman in a Bond film in years is killed off in the pre-credit sequence. Robert Carlyle is an adequate villain but again the absence of a menacing henchman is inexcusable. As far as gadgets they don't make or break a Bond film for me but I did love his glasses. One big positive was the return of David Arnold whose score is nothing memorable but his consistent Bond themes throughout help ease the absence of the irreplaceable John Barry. TWINE is not bad but its not one of the better Bonds either and now I must wait another 2 years hoping that the next one will bring back the excitement of the past.........",The World Is Not Enough

I mean just how many more times can we get away with this character?  Well, if the next film stacks up as well as this then bring 'em on now.The World Is Not Enough is the usual Bond cliches but bigger and better than ever before.  Brosnan is THE man when it comes to Bond, no doubt about it. He takes the toughness of Connery and the humour of Moore, ignores dreary Dalton and puts it into this modern day superhero.Whilst the film is in danger at times of becoming Carry On Spying, the action is just so flipping fantastic that you don't really care.  Gimme 100% entertainment from Mr Bond anyday and i'll be happy.  That's what this is.

245,BuddyBoy1961,At least it made a lot of money,7,12 July 2000,"Pierce Brosnan returns in his third outing as Bond, James Bond, and it's obvious he's growing more comfortable in the role each time. That's the good news. Aside from the laconic ease and distinctive stamp Brosnan has placed on his performances as 007, this entry in the nearly 30-year-old series does little to enhance the legendary character beyond updating the periphery with different locales (in this case, eastern Europe) and gadgets a bit more farfetched within today's context than they were during the 60s (as evidenced by a holographic projector a bit more suited to the 23rd than late 20th century). This time out, Michael Apted handles the reins and, apart from the usual competently designed and executed stuntwork (including a splendid boat chase along the Thames), little drama is in evidence. Carlyle plays a subtly icy terrorist (all too briefly, as it turns out), Dench is stalwart as Bond's frequently disapproving 'M', and Marceau offers a admirably nuanced turn as James' inscrutable love interest, Elektra King. But whatever thespianic points they score for the home team, many more are lost by the woefully inadequate Denise Richards, here doing her best (or is it worst?) Malibu Barbie-nuclear physicist imitation. With each successive bi-annual visit from the world's greatest secret agent, one always hopes that ""this one"" will top them all, that this will be the chapter that has as many killer script ideas as killer villains (e.g., ""Goldfinger"", ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", ""Octopussy"").

246,d-apergis,falls flat on its face,6,1 January 2010,"A Bond movie which admirably aspires to insert the 'neo-noir' concept into the Bond genre and ultimately falls flat on its face thanks to an ultra-convoluted plot that is not as interesting as it sets out to be, an over-appliance of technological idiom that regularly leaves the audience baffled, and a couple of inadequate villains who provoke more pity than dread. Director Apted's technique of never deviating from the storyboards doesn't give the film enough air to 'breathe', often rendering it suffocatingly uninvolving. Consequently, the film gets its greater impact during the interactions between Bond-Elektra-Renard and sleepwalks through its action sequences. Brosnan, on the other hand, overdoes the smooth to not always good effect: talking to ladies in the silky sexed-up voice is absolutely fine but talking to Q in that same manner is probably not such a good idea. As a whole, though not successful, this has to be respected for its ambitions and an admittedly spectacular pre-credits sequence.",The World Is Not Enough
247,iam-1,Typical Bond; a heck of a good ride,8,18 January 2000,"Let's face it, no one goes to a James Bond film to have an intellectually stimulating evening.  You go for the thrills, the humour, and the sexy outfits.  This fits in all counts.As is usual, some evil person is out to destroy the world.  Also as usual, Bond is sent to stop him.  Along the way, Bond meets interesting women, and gets in and out of trouble.  No surprise here. But this is fun, none the less.  New things here are the introduction of R, played by John Cleese, Q's assistant who is more funny and witty than Bond himself (believe it or not) and could be considered more interesting than Q was (may he rest in peace). Also, M (Dame Judi Dench) gets far more involved in the events than any supervisor has ever been before, and this works really well.All in all, a damn fine time and a really good outing.  See it on the biggest screen you can.",The World Is Not Enough
248,JWLJN,Wow! What A Movie!,10,27 November 1999,"I went into this movie not knowing what to expect.  I'm not as familiar with the previous Brosnan Bonds as I am some of the rest, however this blew me away.  The flow of the movie and dividing between action and slower scenes was perfect.  Judi Dench, Robbie Coltrane, Sophie Marceau and the lovely Denise Richards all put in great performances.  A perfectly blended movie with action, comedy, romance and intrigue.  Worth seeing twice.  Surprisingly great title song by Garbage, as well.",The World Is Not Enough
249,Robert-132,"Not bad, but something missing...",7,6 December 1999,"This latest Bond outing is certainly filled with its fair share of action, humour, and beautiful women.  Brosnan is comfortably fitting into his role at last, and manages to demonstrate a suitable combination of charm and menace at all the correct times.However, there is something missing.  It is almost as though the film lacks some of the vital energy that made romps like Tomorrow Never Dies, The Living Daylights, For Your Eyes Only and Thunderball so fun.  For that matter, this film is almost as weak as Goldeneye (which spent more time trying to work out what it was and how to be politically correct than it spent actually being a Bond film).  Right from the beginning, parts of the movie seem as though they have been put in because they should be there, rather than because they belong there.  For example, the entertaining boat chase at the very beginning is preceded by a very short scene in Spain that only serves to put the timing of the opening credits off.Although many of the characters are extremely interesting (look for Sophie Marceau as the most complicated Bond girl ever), the film somehow seems overlong, a problem that most of the earlier films never suffered.All in all, an entertaining movie, but still, something vital is missing in this one.  3.5/5.",The World Is Not Enough
250,Aleona,Great Introduction,7,26 July 2000,"This may sound unbelievable, but The World Is Not Enough was my introduction to James Bond and I couldn't ask for a better one. The graphics, the music, the stunts, the suspense and the classic Bond was all in the movie.Of course, there was no deep, moving plot, but what can one expect? This is a pure action/thriller type of a movie. James Bond has become a genre of its own and it is something American cinema can be proud of. Oh and the song by Garbage was an excellent addition to the movie. Interesting idea that people's names are only one letters, well the names of the ""good guys"".If you want a mindless, pretty thriller, this movie is definitely for you.",The World Is Not Enough

After Licence to Kill, I find the Bond movies completley changed....this one was good,actually! I'm not going to tell the plot (read another review for that) but this movie is worth seeing, especially if you like Action movies and another 007 show, ""For You Eyes Only"". The guy who played ""Renard"" did a great performance and so did John Cleese.(the guy who played ""R"" and also played Monty Python) I can't wait till another 007 comes to theater, and I hope they will have a different actor,this time,as Bond!!!!",The World Is Not Enough

You had a nice big budget. SPEND IT!2) Why do the characters have stupid names?

We see very little of him. Why?5) Can someone prove to me that Denise Richard's character is called ""Christmas Jones"" for reasons other than for a stupid pun at the end of the film?6) In certain scenes why does the sound effects so obviously not match up to the action.

253,ADAM-53,Third time lucky for Brosnan,10,28 November 1999,"Bond is back in action  finally! After the lacklustre TND' and the truly awful GoldenEye' Pierce Brosnan has at last put his own stamp on the character, as opposed to looking like a cut-price Roger Moore attempting to impersonate a cut-price Sean Connery. Director Michael Apted has rightly eschewed the flash-bang-bonk style of Martin Campbell and the I can't think of anything, so let's have a fight here' approach of Roger Spottiswoode. What emerges is a more thoughtful Bond pic, in the style of the greatest entries in the series, such as From Russia', OHMSS', For Your Eyes Only', Living Daylights' and Licence to Kill'. What TWINE' has in common with these is fully-rounded characters and a plot that makes basic sense. In GoldenEye', Sean Bean had the scarred face, so had to be the villain, while in TND' potentially interesting characters such as Paris Carver and Dr Kaufman were killed off almost as soon as they'd appeared. Not here. Sophie Marceau is the most fully developed Bond woman since Diana Rigg and, while Denise Richards's character isn't developed in the same thoughful way, she has a vulnerability reminiscent of some of the better Bond heroines (Tania in From Russia'). Brosnan has matured, put on weight and has developed some of Timothy Dalton's burnt-out assassin approach to the role. Once or twice there are death-defying' leaps more reminiscent of the Bond is indestructible' approach that ruins the Connery films for me, but 2nd unit director Vic Armstrong (a series veteran in a variety of roles and fight arranger extraordinary) ensures his action sequences are in keeping with the humanity of this new Bond. If Brosnan has still not quite captured the humanity and fears of the Fleming Bond, he's probably come as close as modern audiences will allow the screen Bond to go. This is a pity as Fleming's Bond is so much more interesting than the screen version (Dalton, Lazenby and some parts of Moore's characterisation aside). As M, Judi Dench has a larger than average role and is very convincing, while the supporting players (Colin Samson, Michael Kitchen, Samantha Bond and John Cleese) are all up to par. It will be particularly interesting to see how the Bond, Tanner, Robinson, R relationships may develop in future. For the villains, they are mostly an expendable lot, and they are expended violently and often. Cutting down the Rambo-style shootouts that wrecked TND' would have been a good idea given the character-driven approach, but never mind, maybe next time. As villain in chief, Robert Carlyle is excellent (even if his accent isn't consistent throughout the film) and the final confrontation between him and Bond is worthy of anything in Fleming's canon. Meanwhile, Robbie Coltrane gives an excellent reprise of his GoldenEye' role, Zurkovsky. With a little creative effort on somebody's part, Coltrane could become the new Sydney Greenstreet. Let's hope Apted decides to do the next Bond instead of 49 Up', for he has made the most interesting contribution to the series since John Glen left the series a decade ago.",The World Is Not Enough
254,Mookie-21,"Its Bond, sure, BUT DAMMIT ITS GREAT!",7,24 November 1999,"So I've just returned from the latest Bond film, The World is Not Enough. I gotta say, it was great. Not on Goldeneye level, but it was great. it was great because the action was excellent, and the tense moments were ACTUALLY TENSE. i was amazed. Also, the disarming of the bomb on the speeding car thing was one of the best in recent memory in terms of just plain excitement. Ok, as I said, it wasn't perfect. A few good examples:Some terrible dialogue{Bond films tend to be written pretty well, but much of the dialogue here sucked. Bond films usually are better then most action films. This really wasn't}. Denise Richards, while absolutely gorgeous and sexy, was terrible. She spoke like she was checking over the script. She sucked. Sophie Marceau is a beautie, and she managed to give her role much more feeling. I really thought this film did much{well, rather attempted much} to try and create more character development, but thats not as necessary in a bond film. We know what to expect, and altering it isn't on our dance card. But,its a nice idea, but isn't always well done. Another point. Aside from the 20 minute chase, the first hour was almost a bore. The skiing scene really was plain boring, and offered very little in terms of excitement. However, it was again, a attempt at character development and built up that, although wasn't 100% effective, was a nice attempt. and Q's departure-NO GOOD! Now the good. Pierce Brosnan:the best Bond since Connery left the act. He's terrific. The last hour:terrific action, especially Valetine's factory shoot out. The women:Beautiful, but only one could act. M:Judi Dench was excellent, and GIVEN a ton of more screentime just to prove she's as great of an actress as people say she is. JUST THE FACT THAT ITS BOND HELPED!The middle range: The villain:Reinard, played by Robert Carlyle, wasn't much of a villain. He seemed somewhat uncomfortable doing the part, and it takes a long while to see him as the villain, but that could be because he bursts onto the scene so aprubtly. He just kinda showed up. John Cleese:The new gadget guy. I'm not sure how that's gonna work.Overall, A great Brosnan film, nearly as good as Goldeneye, and better then tomorrow never dies *** 1/2 out of ****",The World Is Not Enough
255,spinin,The bad defeats the good!,6,29 November 1999,"""Goldeneye"" was an interesting return of the famous agent and the first Bond film I got to see in the theaters. Brosnan's first was not exceptional. ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" showed improvement with a more colorful Bond-type story. ""The World is not Enough,"" however, does absolutely nothing.First of all, the opening sequence seemed way too long. There's action, then a pause, then an explosion, finally a lengthy chase. For a moment I forgot that the opening credits had not been shown yet. Second of all, the movie follows the Bond formulas too closely and it just appears to jump into them. Bond is hurt. Bond needs a to pass a medical exam. Bond sleeps with the doctor. Finally, it is just a series of disappointments stringed together. The one thing that stands out in TWINE is that absolutely nothing stands out. A villain with a bullet in his head that eliminates his feeling of pain - an excellent idea for a bond villain. This is barely even developed. In fact, Renard (the villain) hardly appears as a powerful character at all. He seems to have very little control over what is going on, and his handicap is never really used. Judi Dench's portrayal of M is useless in a Bond film. It's just another way of killing the sexist elements present in previous films in the series. She's just an old grandma that gets duped, kidnapped, and spends most of her time trapped. What kind of a Secret Service boss is that. Although, the idea of getting M more involved in the situation is interesting, it looks pathetic here. Get rid of the female M, please!There are several other small disappointments. The action sequences are too elaborate and emit little excitement. There should be more thrill and pure tension just from the situation Bond is in (The rock climb in ""For Your Eyes Only"", the plane fight in ""The Living Daylights""). Action scenes in TWINE just move from one to another with little intrigue. Some of the best stunts in Bond films have been done on skis. There is nothing interesting about Bond's 5 minute snow ride in this flick. And the conclusion to the film proceeds with little drama and ingenuity. Additionally, the series of one-liners along the way are some of the worst ever, with only a couple at the end standing out. And the appearance of the title in a conversation is ridiculous. It's as if the filmmakers are trying to make unnecessary sense of the title in one line.Not everything is awful though. The acting is some of the best yet in the Brosnan era, especially Sophie Marceu. Brosnan himself is quite good. The film is very stylish and is set in beautiful and colorful locations. There are some good scenes like the one in the casino. Although she's a poor actress, Denise Richards is hot. After all, this is how some of the past women in the series were as well. Not every woman needs to be an independent 90s role model. While there are a series of disappointments, TWINE is still better than most action movies out there and is not the worst Bond film. I disliked some of the action sequences, but other ones lived up to the Bond genre.Overall, I wish more was done with this film. I am a huge fan of Bond films and I would always defend any careless elements, but this time I could not. Anything that can be annoying in a Bond film just jumped out at me here. I could not ignore my feelings. Brosnan is a good Bond and I hope he will make an improvement in the next film. A return to the colder, smarter, and more stylish Bonds like ""For Your Eyes Only"" (my favorite bond; a great job by Roger Moore following the disappointing ""Moonraker"") would be welcome. I thought I would never do this to a Bond film, after all they represent the best action/adventure movies out there. Overall, I give it a 6 out of 10. Most of the points go to the acting, the settings, the decent plot, and the appealing Denise Richards. The other elements were just too annoying to ignore.",The World Is Not Enough
256,chancey-23,Tomorrow Never Dies all over again,6,15 July 2012,"The World is Not Enough. Let's start with the title. It seems like an alternate title to Tomorrow Never Dies, in a way. But yes, I know the connection between this film and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. And when I think about that as well, these two films are connected as well. Like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Bond's mission is almost hidden, there's snow, helicopters, and something of a bitter-sweet ending. Then again, On Her Majesty's Secret Service was a good film, and The World is Not Enough isn't as good. Problems, well, the villain does the same thing over and over again: proves he can't be hurt. Smashing his hand, holding hot coals. The Bond girl/girls aren't all that interesting, and the inclusion of Hagrid seems unnecessary. But the action scenes are entertaining, as is the whole opening sequence, and the subplot of M being captured is a new twist, but of course they do nothing with it. So it's OK, but nothing near special.",The World Is Not Enough
257,MondoMirth,The World is NOT Enough,5,2 January 2020,"This Bond is more emotional in this film than in the other pierce Brosnan films, doesn't fit the script for his cool collected persona. The humor isn't laced into the film so it flows with the rest of the script, it more cuts into what's supposed to be a more serious plot laced with serious characters that don't gel well with the assault of over the top corny action. The villains are so hard to understand because their's not enough time or background given to either of them, all I can say is that ones evil and the others in love.",The World Is Not Enough
258,BrohmaBull007,The Best of Brosnan,8,26 January 2006,"by far this is Brosnsan's greatest movie as bond. I like the action packed beginning sequence as well as a storyline that tied it all together. I feel this movie is terribly underrated. Brosnan is IMO the Best Bond behind Connery. I enjoyed the famous bond lines such as ""Shaken not Stirred"" and ""Bond, James Bond."" The glasses were a nice touch to the film. I also enjoyed the storyline between Bond and Elektra as I felt it was a storyline with depth. Glad to see Llewelyn Retire on a good note as well.the only bad parts were Dr. Christmas Jones and a bad guy scheme that we've seen before.but overall its a very good bond film 9/10",The World Is Not Enough
259,C.S.Wood,Brosnan IS Bond,9,19 November 1999,"America was in need of a great actioner (since many didn't turn out to see The Messenger, which is my 2nd favorite movie, I might add) and they got what they were looking for. ""GoldenEye"" and ""License To Kill"" were my two favorite Bond movies, with Brosnan still my favorite Bond (scream all you want, Connery wasn't this good). I thought ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" fell short, in both villain and action scenes (except for that car chase, which they could've loaned to GoldenEye and made it perfect).I see many similarities in TWINE that were in GoldenEye, i.e. Valentin, a female weapons specialist, a female bad guy, etc. And I'm not sure which one was better. Martin Campbell has more style, but Apt knows how to do better action scenes. And then there's the villain. 006 had a person agenda with Bond, Reinard had a cool character twist (""I sent 009 to kill Rienard-- he put a bullet in his head-- the bullet's still there"") and then there's Elektra, toying with Bond's emotions, giving that innocent bright piercing-sweet smile. Who could kill her after she flashes you one of those?The only thing I found wrong was Q's sudden disappearance from the film, and the title. I originally liked ""Pressure Point,"" given the extend of Bond's injury. But in the end, this was a great action film-- a tie for the Best Bond yet.",The World Is Not Enough
260,mdnrules,"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" still wins",6,26 November 1999,"Tomorrow Never Dies still wins by a hair, in my opinion.  Sure, in TWINE, the boat chases and ski shots were great, but nothing new, and the plot, which at first, seems simple, turns puzzely.  The lead song ""The World Is Not Enough"" was WEAK compared to the awesome ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" song, which I still remember by heart. 
This movie had a lot of the Bond aspects of it, but it didn't FEEL fresh. When I see this on the shelves for DVD at the mall a year from now, I will pause, turn it over, shrug, and move on.",The World Is Not Enough
261,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,A near miss (SPOILERS),6,13 March 2005,"With ""GoldenEye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" being huge hits, producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli decided that they would try a more realistic and character-driven piece for their next film, ""The World Is Not Enough"". Hired to direct the movie was Michael Apted, who they hoped could merge a complicated story with action and deep character. While two aspects more or less worked, the action never quite gels with the rest of the film and what we get as a final payoff isn't as interesting as the beginning sets it up to be.""The World Is Not Enough"" gets off to a fantastic start, this much is almost unanimous. Even though it's the longest, this fifteen-minute section of the movie is expertly handled and edited, probably being the best pre-title scene out of the whole series. After escaping from a Spanish bank, Bond (played again by Pierce Brosnan) brings in a briefcase full of money belonging to Sir Robert King, an oil magnate. Unfortunately, the money is booby-trapped and King is killed in an explosion at MI6's HQ.This leads Bond on a wild boat chase on the Thames that ends in a surprising plot twist. Then we're treated to the best Bond title song in a long time, performed by Garbage. After that, well... Not to say that the rest of the movie isn't as good, but it's not as fun. While we get a fresh and unique plot device introduced into the world of Bond, oil, it's used as just that: a plot device (to be fair, most films in the series have the same problem).The action scenes in TWINE are easily the biggest cracks in the movie. Aside from the thrilling start, they suffer with the problem of not being as interesting as they probably were on paper. The ski chase is the most glaring example of this. And though they add to the plot for the most part, they seem superfluous. Take the attack on the caviar factory. Couldn't the bad guys just have sent normal assassins instead of those unwieldy helicopters?Making up for the lackluster action are the characters and overall plot. Elekra King, the daughter of Sir Robert, is one of the best developed people in the series, and Sophie Marceau plays her with the right mix of seductive innocence and toughness. She's made even better when we find out that she's in fact the villain and has been playing everyone to just nuke Istanbul and receive a massive oil monopoly. Judi Dench's M gets involved in the action, and because she's been in the past two movies and shows some genuine competence, I can say that she is a great boss.Returning from ""GoldenEye"" is Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Zukovsky, being even better here than in his previous appearance. He gets the best lines of the film and helps the plot in numerous ways. His final fate is touching and we have the sense of really getting to know this man who's always stood on the line of an ally and villain. Then there's Brosnan, who gives a good, but not quite great, performance as 007. This version of Bond is fairly dark and conflicted, and the actor gets into that side pretty good, even though some scenes could've done with a retake, like when he confronts Elektra in Baku. He still gets one of the best scenes of all the movies, where he kills a woman in cold blood.Two performers struggle a bit, though. Robert Carlyle as terrorist Renard doesn't grab the audience's attention the way Marceau does, and the character manages to fade into the background after it's revealed who's behind everything, even though he still gets a few good scenes. The other Bond Girl, Denise Richards, isn't as awful as most people say she is. She gives in a fair effort as Christmas Jones, an inferior character when compared to Elektra, and her being a nuclear physicist doesn't score high on the believability charts.There are a few miscellaneous comments: David Arnold's music isn't as good as it was for ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", being a bit too techno in some scenes, but he still scores a few decent cues. The plot is refreshingly realistic, probably being the deepest of Brosnan's four films, and it still manages to be suitably complex. A nice nod to Fleming's novels comes from the title, which is Bond's family motto. A final touch comes from John Cleese as R, Q's assistant. This would be Desmond Llewelyn's last Bond film, and he's as great here as he was in ""From Russia With Love"". Cleese is actually more of a distraction and doesn't come close to Llewelyn when he takes over the role.Overall, ""The World Is Not Enough"", despite the best of intentions, just misses the mark and falls into the ""average"" category, when it could've been much more. The hard-edged thriller is sometimes unsuccessfully merged with more light-hearted gags, but I'll recommend the film if you can overlook the lesser aspects. At the very least, it's better than what comes after it. 6.5/10",The World Is Not Enough

They also have some excellent actors, including the elegantly beautiful Sophie Marceau, who plays Electra King, and Denise Richards, who plays Christmas Jones. These two, and Judi Dench who plays M, really carry the movie, and more than make up for Brosnan's merely competent 'by-the-numbers' acting.This film is well worthwhile watching, and will probably make you want to see Richards and Marceau in some of their other films as well. And while you're at the video store getting them, you'll also need to pick up Sean Connery's Bond movies as well, to restore your faith in James Bond!",The World Is Not Enough
265,asdodge,A Very Slick Bond Film,8,18 December 2008,"The third installment of Brosnan as Bond is a very fine movie, with a good story with plenty of plot twists to keep one on one's toes. Brosnan is probably at his most comfortable as Bond in this picture.The story starts with the assassination of an oil executive who is close friends with M and others in MI6. Bond is assigned to protect the murder exec's daughter, Elektra (played by Sophie King). Elektra has already previously been the victim of a kidnap and ransom plot, held by the notorious international terrorist, Renard (played by Robert Carlysle). Renard is known for his inability to feel pain because of nervous damage from wounds he has received in his crimes.Bond must unravel the plot against Elektra, and in his work uncovers a nuclear plot to destroy a major oil line, which just happens to be owned by Elektra King. Bond gets assistance from several characters, including Valery Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane- reprising his role as the ex-KGB agent from ""GoldenEye""), and Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards- in a stretch) as a CIA nuclear physicist. Richards is weak in her role and once again, the Bond movies go for boobs over brains in the least believable role in the movie. John Cleese is introduced as the new Q, taking over for Desmond Llewelyn (who is also in the movie).As stated, the story line is solid and the script is consistent, with some surprises that really make the story stand out. The espionage work is there along with the action and drama, really making this movie stand out for Brosnan. After ""GoldenEye,"" this is his best Bond movie. The only drawbacks are that the film is a little dry at times, the humor forced, and many performances range from poor to stilted (Richards, Carlyle, and even Marceau do not challenge as top supporting cast for a Bond Movie here). Also, there are a few too many scientific bits of misinformation-regarding nerve-damage and radiation that weaken the story a bit.The story and the work of Brosnan carry this from a potentially average to a very good film. Sadly, Brosnan seemed to alternate good Bond flicks (GoldenEye, The World is Not Enough), with bad ones (Tomorrow Never Dies, Die Another Day).",The World Is Not Enough
266,theonewithallthecontacts,I really don't understand all the hate?,7,11 November 2012,"After GoldenEye came Tomorrow Never Dies, and after Tomorrow Never Dies came The World is not Enough! Now GoldenEye was and still is a masterpiece, and Tomorrow Never Dies was not as good, but slightly more entertaining in a way! So is The World is not Enough better than it's predecessor's? Short answer... No. However I still found this movie to be very entertaining and engaging! I liked it very much actually, and I still do! I hear a lot of complaining concerning that this film is bland, slow and boring. To comment on these three complaints: this film has got exactly what the other Bond films had. Cool action sequences, beautiful Bond babes, over the top gadgets, memorable villains and sharp humor. How can that result in this movie being called bland and boring? It's a Bond movie for Christs sake?! It is slow at times, but the plot is so actually interesting and engaging that is actually suits the movie best. This may sound a bit dumb, but i'm not gonna pretend that I understands what going on in the long opening sequence. I'm just gonna say that it contains assassinations, explosions, a boat chase, plot and talking!I actually thought Michael Apted did a decent job with the direction in this movie! Seemed as though he was committed to the project! The sound and cinematography is also very well done!Pierce Brosnan is James Bond once again! I've always liked Pierce in the role as Bond and I still do when I watch this film. However is seems like sometimes he is a bit bored, but that's probably just me. Sophie Marceau as Elektra King is very interesting! The audience is let along to believe that she is the main Bond babe, but really she is the main villain! An interesting little plot twist, that Die Another Day sure as hell duplicated! Other than that Marceau is a beautiful woman, a wonderful actress and has very good charisma! She is one of the best things about this movie! When I was a little kid I always thought that Robert Carlyle as Victor ""Renard"" Zokas was scary as hell! I saw him as the most challenging villain for Pierce Brosnan's bond at least! My point is that I still like his acting and I still think he is a memorable Bond villain/henchman. Denise Richards as Christmas Jones sucks. She is gorgeous, but her acting is bad, her character is boring and unlike to Marceau she has no chemistry with Brosnan. Judi Dench as M is still good and Robbie Coltrane makes a return appearance as Valentin Zukovsky. However the thing I want to talk most about here is Desmond Llewelyn with his final appearance as Q. After 17 Bond films... One of the best things about this movie is the scene where we last see Q! Always brings a tear to my eye. Q was and will always be the first and best Q ever! Most people won't agree with my review, but you know what... Right now, I've got no better things to do, than to share my thoughts on this film. If you're a hardcore Bond-fan like me, then watch it. You'll either love it, or think it's a decent Bond film (I don't think you'll love it, however). I think it's a decent Bond film, and a worthy entry to the series.7/10",The World Is Not Enough

The script, however, is extremely poor. the actors did what they could with the script given them. I think this was a time that Hollywood thought people just wanted to see explosions and no plot or dialogue. I would not even classify this as an action movie. It it just a bunch of explosions with very poor dialogue which has no meaning in their words. I actually had to stop watching and fast forward only to find out that the same thing was going on one and a half hours into the movie. If you like just explosions, this is the movie for you.

268,Aldo-9,The Best Brosnan Bond film.,10,2 September 2000,"After seeing TND, I was seriously considering not seeing this one, but since it was a Bond film, and I'm a Bond fan, I saw it.Warning, My analysis may contain some Spoilers.It is simply put, the best Bond film since Licence to Kill. I love the direction Pierce is taking the character, Bond is supposed to be a cold blooded assassain. The pre-credits sequence does go on a bit long, but its pure Bond all the way. After falling from the ballon Bond actaully hurts himself, and this affects him throughout the rest of the film(a nice touch). Many people complain about Renard and his lack of screentime, that would be a valid argument, IF HE WAS THE VILLIAN! Elecktra King is the villain and the first female villian the Bond series has had.Now heres what I did'nt like:Even after slowing the pace down from the last one, the film still feels a bit rushed. Bond never takes the time to eat food, or gamble.
The series still has'nt retained that travelogue feel either, the last film to achieve that was FYEO way back in '81.Now if the producers can keep this up and really try with the next film, I think Bond 20, released in 2003(yes, we have to wait a bit longer for the next one) is going to be a really groundbreaking film. Thanks to this one, I can look forward to the next one with the knowledge that Bond is going back to its roots.",The World Is Not Enough
269,Malifer,"Bad, Real Bad",1,21 November 1999,"I like bond films and think Pierce Brosnan does well in the role, but number 19 just isn't worth a dime. Brosnan, Marceau, and Carlyle are good if you overlook a few badly written lines, but what casting director in their right mind would hire the girl whose past great work has been a bad rendition of Starship Troopers, a slutty thriller, and a black comedy about beauty pagents. Denise Richards is cancer of this film not matter how much you sink into the film she spews forth some ridiculus badly acted line, i.e. ""or do you want a glimmer"". It is easy to see that she was not hired for her acting skills, but her fake assets. Come on Hollywood both Famke Janseson and Michelle Yeoh were both beautiful and good actresses don't insult the audience. Then in the story her character stays with Bond because she'll be in trouble if she doesn't get back the nuclear warhead. She is a freakin' scientist why is she held accountable if terrorists shoot up her government lab steal a nuke and kill bunches of people. I think that the government would be in trouble not Christmas Jones. The whole movie is just a vehicle for stupid sexual jokes. This movie gets a D-.",The World Is Not Enough
270,nickkulstadis,"Middling Bond adventure heavy on action and quips, light on plot and substance",5,29 October 2021,"The World Is Not Enough is an average Bond movie. It's somewhat better than Tomorrow Never Dies as the action scenes are more remarkable and fun and the humor is handled better but much like Tomorrow Never Dies the plot is too thin and takes too much of a back seat to the storyline and it quickly devolves into being by the numbers after the first 40 minutes. The villains are somewhat better this time around but are still not up to the par of the better villains of the series like Auric Goldfinger, Francisco Scaramanga, Alec Trevelyan and Raul Silva. World is fun as an action movie but as a Bond movie it leaves you feeling empty. Goldeneye still remains the high water mark of the Brosnan era as it did a better job balancing the story with the action and did better balancing the humor with the serious aspect of the story.",The World Is Not Enough
271,crawfrordboon,"Brosnan's second best, after Goldeneye",7,9 November 2003,"Notwithstanding any future effort that sees Pierce Brosnan, back in the role of Bond, The World Is Not Enough is a fairly accurate picture of how the James Bond series has panned out since 1995. Simply, in the finest traditions of the series, set since 1962. This, the nineteenth official film, features some original and unique locations, an excellent female lead in Sophie Marceau, and an amusing re-appearance from the Robbie Coltrane ally Valentin Zuckovsky, who made a real difference to Goldeneye.Other plus points include the lack of Joe Don Baker, who really out lasted his welcome in Tomorrow Never Dies, a fine send-off for Q, spectacular chase sequences on the River Thames and on a snowy mountainside, some dirty but funny humour, and best of all the climax in a sinking nuclear-powered submarine in the straights of Istanbul. Brosnan by now is synonymous with the role of James Bond and plays the role well, probably his best all round personal effort to date.It has its bad points too - the villain Renard is handled fairly uncomfortably by the normally reliable Robert Carlyle, the henchmen are devoid of any memorable characteristics, and the nuclear physiscist in hot pants, Denise Richards, aka Dr Christmas Jones, is an outrageous and somewhat ridiculous inclusion.
Brosnan himself carries on from where he left off in Tomorrow Never Dies, that is to say, as if this is Terminator 2, not a Bond film. Thankfully though, the machine gun battles and huge explosions are not a permenant feature of the film, whose plot high points include Bond getting injured by falling onto the Millenium Dome, M being captured, a great pipeline seqeunce where Bond and Jones are on a cart chasing a plutonium bomb, and MI6 headquarters turning into the frontline after some terrorist action!There's a great cameo from British DJ Goldie as a villain, the only interesting one apart from the brilliant Marceau, and there are enough unique elements, like the helicopter-powered forrestry blades, a bad guy who can feel no pain, and a major Hollywood movie being set in Kazaksthan, Azerbiejhan (sp?), and the Caspian Sea, to make it another memorable entry into the series. The gadgets are present but not overused, and this solid 1999 effort really feels like a great way to Bond to sign off the Twentieth Century.The only minor complaint would be the pre-credits sequence was too long, perhaps the titles should have been brought forward to fit in between the Bilboa Bank scene and the MI6-Thames sequence.
Once again, top marks 007.",The World Is Not Enough
272,Pelagia,A Cut Above the Rest.,8,22 November 1999,"Director Apted has crafted an excellent movie. Present here that was lacking in the previous 2 Brosnan Bond movies is an element of psychological depth. Pain is the cold shadow that lurks behind each of the characters involved, including the antagonists. Attachment, dedication, love are jewels that are dangled in front of the mind's eye, only to be pulled away by derision, back-stabbing, evil schemes, and greed. With so many hearts broken and lives shattered, it would not be a long shot to label the movie as a tragedy. ""World"" provides the intense action, crude comedy, and scenic locations to suffice the average movie goer but its extra element of emotional anxiety will charm the more dedicated fan into perhaps a second viewing.Flaws:One-liners: many are not funny, and the old ""Bond. James Bond."" is passe. ""Shaken, not stirred"" makes me roll my eyes.Closing scene: too superficial and upbeat for this dark, moody film.Denise Richards: her lines are delivered horribly. Serves no purpose other than for eye candy. Little is revealed about her character, or past.Maria Grazia Cucinotta: ah! Her screen time is too short! I was praying that she would come back in the film, but she never did.Overall, a cut above the rest. Enjoy. 8 out of 10.",The World Is Not Enough
273,rejoefrankel,"Bond film a mixed bag, with stronger characters, weaker action.",8,26 November 1999,"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, is a mixed bag as far as Bond films go....in many ways it is a cut above other entries in the series.  Brosnan is better than ever as Bond, this time adding darker shades to his portrayal of the legendary agent.  Fans expecting the thrill a minute action sequences of the last two films (GOLDENEYE, TOMORROW NEVER DIES) may find this Bond disappointing.  Director Michael Apted (The Coal Miner's Daughter, Thunderheart), takes a low key approach to the material ensuring that the characters are fleshed out more than is customary for this franchise.  This doesn't mean that Brosnan's third outing is lacking in excitement, the opening sequence is among the most gleefully inventive set-pieces of the series!  Other scenes also deliver, high octane thrills....but the recurring emphasis on character sometimes clashes awkwardly with these more Bondian moments.  This is the most interesting and ambitious Bond film in years, although it does not succeed on all accounts. Robert Carlyle makes an impressive villain but is not given enough screen time to really make the most of the role.  Sophie Marceau is appealing in the role of the millionaire oil heiress who Bond is sent to protect...The only real weak link is Denise Richards cast as a NUCLEAR SCIENTIST!?.....As beautiful as she is, she seems out of her element here with a performance that comes across awkward and embarassing in contrast with the sophistication of the rest of the cast. Still the movie is a lot of fun, and worth the price of admission....if only to hear that final line of dialogue.",The World Is Not Enough
274,Sabriane,"Has its moments, but not enough",4,8 January 2007,"The most frustrating thing about this third Pierce Brosnan outing is that it does a few things right, starting with the lead performance. Brosnan was always a charming presence, but here he also dispenses with the smarmy smugness which marred his performance in the first Bond film for me and seems comfortable and assured in his role. There's a nice sense of jaded world-weariness to his Bond in this film. Sophie Marceau is another highlight as a seemingly ""good"" Bond girl who turns out to be an arch-villain of the film in a nice twist. Her Elektra is a pretty complicated character as far as Bond girls go and the sensual Marceau makes a great femme fatale, seemingly vulnerable but all steel inside, smart and manipulative to the nth degree. One only wishes that these two characters appeared in a better movie.""The World is not Enough"" is not it. The film starts off nicely with a spectacular boat chase down the river Thames, completely over-the-top in the best Bond tradition but great fun to watch (unfortunately it also serves to highlight just how tedious and robotic the action scenes are in the second half of the film). Sadly, the first alarm bell came as soon as John Cleese's ""R"" bumbling character appeared on the scene. I love John Cleese but his slapstick turn here is just plain embarrassing.Robbie Coltrane is ultimately wasted in the reprisal of his role as Valentin Zukovsky; Robert Carlyle is equally disappointing as Renard, the villain who cannot feel pain courtesy of the bullet imbedded in his brain. He is not intimidating or scary or memorable and his fights with Brosnan have an unintentional comic effect to them because Carlyle just looks so damn puny. And wouldn't you think that the screenwriters would try and do something interesting and creative with a villain who is immune to pain other than showing him pick up a red-hot rock in one scene? Nothing however prepared me for the sheer godawfulness of Denise Richards as Dr Christmas Jones, the least believable nuclear scientist in the history of motion pictures. Apparently Miss Richards won a Golden Razzie for her stint here and all I can say is that she thoroughly deserves it. Her character was like a black hole sucking the lifeforce out of the movie whenever she showed up on the screen. Worst of all, she didn't even have the grace to put on the sort of entertainingly bad performance you could enjoy watching. She's bad, and she's Dull.The plot is so ho-hum and unmemorable I have problems recalling the details. Something about the oil, nuclear device, and the city blowing up if Bond doesn't act quickly enough... oops I'm snoring already.In the end, this film I think has roughly the same problem as ""Goldeneye"" did. It tries to have it both ways: have silly puns, campy over-the-top characters and slapstick comedy on one hand while at the same time trying to inject some serious drama and human emotion into the proceedings. Which unfortunately doesn't work at all and results in a picture whose mood swings erratically all over the place. One minute, Brosnan's Bond caresses the face of a woman he's just shot in a chillingly cold-blooded fashion, in a moment of clear anguish. A few minutes later, he's cheerfully smooching Denise Richards's bimbo scientist and cracking awful tacky puns about ""Christmas in Turkey"". But where ""Goldeneye"" at least had a decent story and a great cast of supporting characters, ""The World is not Enough"" is just mediocre in almost every way.",The World Is Not Enough
275,spottedreptile,Bond ad nauseum. . . (minor spoilers),5,3 January 2000,"Makes Bond #20 sound rather depressing. . .This latest offering from the Bond franchise doesn't bring anything new or fresh to take the suave spy into the next millenium. Rather, it just rehashes old ground, again. The formula is so well known by now that most of the action sequences fail to raise any excitement any more, at least anywhere near the levels of Goldeneye, the best of the Pierce Brosnan enterprises. There are the innumerable hair-raising races against time, spectacular chases in some form of locomotion (every time these get better and better  the boat chase is brilliantly executed), wildly improbable Bond girls (Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist), and James once more biting off a whole lot more than he can chew. You'd think he'd learn.The defence of Bond films it that nobody takes it seriously, of course it's formula, but it's just good ol' escapist fun. But even escapist fun gets boring if it's played without variation. The plot is not too far-fetched for 007:  oil tycoon gets murdered at MI5 headquarters, daughter and heiress is supposedly next in line, James has to protect her and help get her new pipeline built before the bad guys blow it up. James gets help along the way from M, who rather uncharacteristically puts sentiment over common sense, and the aforementioned Richards.There is a twist, but it's fairly predictable, and the worst fault of the film, like many of its genre, is that it fails to present any convincing or complex characters. None of the supporting cast show any depth, or make you care about their motives, and why they act the way they do. Oh for another Xenia Onatopp. If you're going to do The Villain, then go for it.
Denise Richards is so out of place it's not even funny. She evidently thought so too, because she puts no effort at all into her role. John Cleese takes over from Q and demonstrates potential as R. The saving grace is Judi Dench as always, showing vulnerability and humanity in a tough profession for a woman. Pierce Brosnan is, well, Pierce Brosnan. That was probably quite adequate for 007 ten years ago, but if he wants to make it into the next century, Barbara Broccoli et al really need to do some reinventing on a major scale.Other than that the film is well photographed and the special effects are, as usual, special. But by the end of the film, I didn't really care who got shot or blown up. As long as the movie finished.",The World Is Not Enough
276,riddler_1138-3,One of the best Bond outings EVER!,9,22 November 1999,"The World has never been enough for James Bond.  Being British myself, I have to say that this was one of the most exciting Bond adventures and ranks right up there with `From Russia with Love' and `GoldenEye'.  Pierce Brosnan is by far one of the greatest of the Bond's.  He portrays the role with such dignity that fans sometimes forget about Connery and Moore.  This was a great victory for Brosnan and also along the way, a similar victory for Robert Carlyle and goddess, Sophia Marceau (One of the best Bond ladies of ALL TIME!)Although I do miss some of the great one-liners of the past Bond films, I did enjoy John Cleese and the gentleman who played `Q' (I never can spell his name correctly).  Dame Judi Dench is fantastic in her role again as `M' and I must say this before I end. Denise Richards....Please don't do another film like this again!Out of 10...............9/10.

Okay, you know what you're going to get with a newer Bond film. Here's my take on what worked and didn't: The boat chase and ski chase scenes are expertly done and work. Sophie Marceau's exquisite beauty is a definite plus. The radar sunglasses scene is cool. It was good to see John Cleese in the film, but his role wasn't written to fulfill it's full promise. Also, in my opinion, Q (or Cleese in the future, I suppose) need to do the usual ""fill Bond in the gadgets"" scene before they are used. During those scenes you can try and predict and anticipate exactly when each gadget will be used. The BMW M3 was screaming for a chase scene with gadget play that we didn't get. A big minus for me. Robbie Coltrane is a great actor but he wasn't convincing as a Russian crime kingpin. The biggest minus? Denise Richards. I don't want to be cruel, and she's certainly pretty, but that was a laughable performance and is a candidate the miscasting hall of shame. The movie overall is not bad, but nothing special.

280,mcfische,The darkest Bond; Brosnan's best,6,18 October 2003,"Contains spoilersTHE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH was the 19th Bond film, and the final one produced in the 20th century. Pierce Brosnan returned in his third outing as James Bond, acclaimed dramatic director Michael Apted took his place behind the cameras, and Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were assigned to write the screenplay. After two very Connery-esque outings as Bond, one of which was not a Bond film, Brosnan has a chance to be in the most Fleming-esque Bond since LTK...even if he must continue to be the next Sean Connery. TWINE is easily the greatest of Brosnan's four 007 films as of yet and the fourth greatest of all the Bond films, surpassed only by ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, LICENCE TO KILL, and THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.The film has a very unique cinematic look to it that no other Bond has had; it is the darkest of all the films. The locations are exotic but very real; you would never guess that the nuclear site or the Maiden's Tower were sets at Pinewood studios. Almost every character is given incredible detail, humanity, and in some cases, pity. This was Brosnan's best outing as Bond, and despite he keeps being confined to a Connery style Bond and doesn't quite handle his few Dalton moments, he does a fantastic job. M for once is given a major role in the storyline, and Judi Dench excels in these scenes. Tanner, Moneypenny, and Robinson all return doing a fantastic job. A new character, Q's assistant ""R,"" is hilarious. And Desmond Llewelyn gives his final outing as Q. The final moments that 007 and Q have together are wonderfully written and acted. Llewelyn was the longest lasting member of the original team of writers, actors, directors, and producers on the Bond film and his untimely demise in a car accident following this film was truly upsetting. Ms, Moneypennys, and Bonds can come and go, but for some reason, there can be only one Q. RIP Desmond, and thanks for all the memories.For the first time ever in a Bond film, a woman is the main villain. Elektra King is one of the most complex, ambitious, and truly evil of all the Bond villains and may very well be the best of them, if not the best of the women; that honor still goes to Bond's wife Tracy (a comment by Elektra makes reference to her). Kidnapped by the terrorist Renard, her father and M had no choice but to refuse to pay her ransom due to policy. So Elektra seduced her captor. She made him fall madly in love with her. He allowed her to escape, and she damaged herself when Renard couldn't bring himself to do it. Deceiving everyone, she had her own father, oil tycoon Sir Robert King, murdered by a bomb exploded in MI6 headquarters. Elektra has a great power over men, especially womanizers like 007. She deceives him as well, and by the time he figures it out, Elektra captures M, buys a nuclear submarine, and arranges to cause a nuclear holocaust to gain control over the world through the oil market. Her evil nature and deceiving all that cared about her makes her a truly nasty character, and when Bond kills her in cold blood, it's hard to surpess a cheer. Her lover, Renard, is definately the most human of all Bond's villains. With an excellent actor in the role, Renard attracts a great deal of pity. With Alec Trevelyan of GOLDENEYE, you felt sympathy for him, but the fact he was also doing this to get rich lowered the abbility for the audience to feel sorry for him. Renard, however, is doing all his actions due to blind love. Seduced and used by the woman he captured and held for ransom, Renard has a bullet in his head killing off his senses, so far making it impossible for him to feel pain or anything else. This frustrates him greatly as he cannot be a good lover to Elektra. This character's blind love for Elektra (he's willing to commit suicide so she can make millions) and the fact that, to her, Renard was merely another employee and tool, makes it hard not to pity this poor, deceived, blinded man. Even Bond seems to pity him; before Elektra's scheme is thwarted and Renard is killed, the two share sympathetic smiles.As the darkest, most dramatic, and most intense of all the Bond films, there is a great need for comic relief, and it comes in good supply without ruining the tone of the film. Valentine Zukovsky of GOLDENEYE returns with a much more friendly attitude towards Bond. Prior to Bond' involvement, he arranges to get her a nuclear submarine, commanded by his nephew Nikolai, for $1,000,000. He is unaware of the purpose, of M's kidnapping, or that Elektra is working with Renard. When Bond informs him (and when Elektra kills his nephew and destroys his caviar factory), Zukovsky joins Bond, and his final act before being killed by Elektra is to save Bond's life. Both 007 and the audience feel grief for his death, as he is one of the most amusing and charming characters ever to appear in a Bond film. Zukovsky's traitorous henchman Bull, played by Goldie, is another amusing character. The final comic dose, ""R,"" bumbles his way through demonstrating all of Bond's gadgets, all the while being insulted by Q.The film's title, ""The World Is Not Enough,"" is the Bond family motto, as revealed in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. The previously mentioned reference to Tracy and the ski chase pay homage to that film. Despite the excellent story and characters, there are problems with this film. Bond hardly uses his car. Zukovsky should not have been killed. And the Bond woman in this film, Dr. Christmas Jones, is the only character that is poory written. A typical bland Bond girl, she is too young to be an expert in nuclear physics and is rather unconvincingly portrayed. She serves no point to the story at all and is merely added in so that Bond can bed a woman at the end (does anyone else grow tired of this ending?). And once again, as good as this film was, it is truly disappointing they could not let Brosnan for once play the Dalton/Fleming-type Bond he has been wanting to do ever since he took the role.With 8 out of 10 stars, this is Brosnan's greatest contribution to the series. This film is so great because it is the only Brosnan Bond film to have the feel of a Cubby Broccoli 007 film, and that is something special.",The World Is Not Enough

I also give the movie one star for excellent casting, and the last star goes to the actors who did a pretty good job. But this movies' real problem lies in the fact that it has no story. It's the weakest script ever in a Bond movie, and they have tried to put too much into it. Instead of making a movie, they've tried to create one long action-sequence. Guess what: IT DOESN'T WORK!!! You never get one overall feel in this movie. It's all small bits of fun, and they haven't even tried to make it fit together. This movie is more a showreel of all the previous Bond movies, than a movie in itself. If you want to see it (and you do, if you love Bond) enjoy John Cleese, Robert Carlyle, Pierce Brosnan and Denise Richards' wet t-shirt. Also enjoy all the references to the other Bond flicks...

You can quote me on this: ""She's a female Keanu Reeves!""Just imagine a plot involving a big explosion, and lots of suspense-less firefights where Bond effortlessly dodges bullets while hanging out in one of the omnipresent fuel dumps that litter the movie. There, you've seen it all.",The World Is Not Enough
289,frostyfrog,The World Is Not Enough,5,21 April 2020,"The World Is Not Enough is a film directed by Michael Apted that stars Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Judi Dench and Denise Richard's and tells the story of James Bond not only trying to protect a woman from her former kidnapper, a terrorist who can't feel pain but also trying to stop that same man from unleashing his nuclear plot on the world. I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't looking forward to this film because I have heard that each of the Bond films in the Pierce Brosnan era got progressively worse as they went on and ""Die Another Day"", which I know I still have to review on here and this kinda spoils my review but I need to put this out there, is a dumpster fire. Plus while Tomorrow Never Dies isn't a terrible film per say, I was certainly recovering from the over-the-top campiness and loudness it offered. In a sense, I was surprised with ""The World Is Not Enough"" because, while those bond tropes were still present, it was much darker than both of it's predecessors offering a plot more personal to both Bond and M than before. The plot centers around Elektra King who is close with M and Bond being hunted down by a man who at one point kidnapped her. This plot without going into too much detail features Bond getting betrayed and tortured, M winding up as a captive and a look at something I don't see discussed in film very much. It also included Bond killing somebody right in front of M which actually for the first time since GoldenEye made me feel something genuine for the characters. It was refreshing to see some of the more serious aspects of this series I usually saw in the Daniel Craig films in this film. However the campy elements are still there and while the one-liners, womanizing, gadgets and over the top characters are toned down, they're still here and that often conflicts with the tone. For instance you'll go from watching Bond narrowly avoiding death and quickly slipping out a one-liner to watching another near death experience this time featuring harm done to the characters and actual fear and sadness on display. It was jarring at times to say the least. Would you like to know something else that was jarring? Denise Richard's performances as a nuclear physicist was and that is honestly the nicest word I can use to describe it. It was very clear that Richard's had no idea what she was saying when some of the more scientific aspects of the script were in play and her acting bounced back and forth between looking like a stone wall and underselling her lines to overdoing her emotion with that same stone emotionless face. Pierce Brosnan and Judi Dench both continued their excellence as per the norm in this film. I liked seeing Brosnan's bond struggle with injury and his emotions needing toyed with for a change, something you never truly saw in ""GoldenEye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". I also enjoyed seeing Judi Dench try being resourceful without the help of MI-6 for a change. The villain of this film, Renard, in all honesty wasn't the main attraction from the side of antagonsim. That comes from another character and aside from a few campy over the top elements, he really wasn't too notable. Sophie Marceau was pretty decent as Elektra King who I'll have no trouble remembering from this film, although some of her lines and acting in the film were over-the-top for sure. Aside from the ludicrous jet-ski sequence and saw sequences, the action and tone were toned back down to Bonds stealth based aspects, something I've always enjoyed in his films. In particular the opening sequence in the bank was very well done and the fight sequence in the villa in the water was good as well. When it comes to the action my major issue was the final confrontation between Bond and Renard being absolutely terrible. The audio was dubbed pretty badly and the punches felt as if they had no impact at all. It was blatantly obvious that they had a lot of issues filming this sequence. The music was pretty good though and in all honesty this film has my favorite opening bond song of the four Brosnan films. Although ""Die Another Day"" by Madonna is more iconic than ""Beethoven's Fifth"" so that may be debatable. I hope you guys can understand my sarcasm. ""The World Is Not Enough"" in my eyes definitely understood and implemented more of the good elements of the Bond films than ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" like it's seriousness and focus on the more personal side of Bond and M, stealth and understated action sequences. However it still doesn't reach the heights of ""GoldenEye"" due to a jarring tone, flat villain, over-the-top bond tropes and a horrible performance and poorly staged ending so it'll have to settle for being the second best within the four Brosnan Bond Films for me.",The World Is Not Enough
290,catalog,Best of the Brosnan Bonds,7,22 November 1999,"The World is Not Enough is the 19th installment of the James Bond series. Any wonder that the series is getting a little stale?  That said, I wasn't disappointed after seeing this movie.Does it rely on the old Bond formula?  Absolutely.  But although it doesn't break any new ground, it is entertaining nonetheless.  Things blow up real good, nuclear physicists end up being beautiful women, more things blow up real good, Bond saves the world.Unfortunately, the movie's best sequence is its first.  The explosion at the MI6 headquarters and the subsequent boat chase down the Thames is rousing. The rest of the movie tries hard to keep the pace but never really succeeds. The ending is also rather abrupt, and Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist is stretching it, even for a Bond picture.Fans of Bond will not be disappointed by this movie, but people looking for something other than exotic (and well done) stunt sequences should look elsewhere.",The World Is Not Enough
291,TechnicallyTwisted,"Bond, Dull Bond",4,26 November 1999,"Call me crazy but I wasn't that impressed with this latest installment in the James Bond series.  I thought the plot was pedestrian, the action scenes dull, and the 2 Bond women delivered  completely inept performances.  Well Sophie Marceau was o.k but Denise Richards was really bad.  The only thing worth watching when she was on screen was when she was in a tank-top or wet t-shirt.  The villain played by Robert Carlyle was underused and one of the only things that managed to save it was John Cleese, for the brief time he was on the screen.  I know a lot of people who think this is the best Bond ever but everyone says that about something that is new.  If I were you I'd wait for the video because there are so many other good films to see before going to this one.  Here's hoping the Bond franchise dies.  But this one is making a bundle so tough luck for that hope!",The World Is Not Enough

294,palaste,One of the best Bond films ever. Plenty of action and intrigue.,9,25 May 2000,"After the okayish ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", I thought that the quality of Bond films had stabilised. I was wrong, this new Bond movie is better than both of its predecessors put together! At first, the storyline of an oil crisis might not sound that interesting, compared to what Bond has faced before, but once you get to know the characters (especially the dynamic Elektra King), there's more than enough to keep you hooked for the whole movie. This Bond movie has the best plot, casting and special effects since ""Goldeneye"". Unlike many other movies, this didn't leave me just waiting for the sequel, this was fun enough by itself. Certainly a must for every Bond enthusiast.",The World Is Not Enough
295,eronavbj,"Promising, but",4,31 December 2003,"A good plot, as far as Bond films go, and I do think Pierce is thebest Bond since Sean, but the action (violence) gets downrightcorny and overdone, which I assume is what sells today. LetBond's charisma and the plot carry the film and leave the specialeffects more in the background  perhaps it will then seem morelike a movie and less like an Xbox game. Some of the stuntswere well, damn silly! I guess I expected more from the series at this point. Can't theyhire a decent writer for these films anymore?",The World Is Not Enough
296,gregopego12,Believability,4,11 July 2005,"I have always been a huge Bond fan. I don't think there is any way to rate the Bond Actors. Connery's movies had a consistent writer--Maibaum--(might've even written for Lazenby and Moore) and could use more of Flemming's source material. The writers and directors make up Bond's movie world, not the actors. This isn't the only uneven Bond film; Roger Moore's episodes suffer the most. And, ask yourself, is Denise Richards worse than Grace Jones? Sophie Marceau has her own problems; her character belongs in a Spanish soap opera. My rating of 4 is in comparison to other Bond movies (10 going to Goldfinger; 1 going to Die Another Day). In one word, this movie is frustrating. There are many great elements for a Bond story here, but they are messed up by the wrong kind of action elements (later half of the movie). Bond becomes Rambo--shooting two guns without cover, then he outruns explosions (more than one), then he is attacked by a helicopter with a giant saw/weed whacker. I can't help wondering if that saw device even exists--that is too distracting (and I can accept Bond driving around Paris in half a Renault (AVtoaK), because it was a throwaway gag, not a significant plot device). If EON Productions still exists, they should stop using the over-the-top action set pieces (enough with outrunning fireballs). I'd like to see them make Casino Royale. It also wouldn't hurt to have Bond rescued by his friends in the C.I.A.; this has always been a part of the Bond universe.",The World Is Not Enough
297,fkarsten,"Too long, too unlikely and too complicated",6,12 January 2000,"Yawn, yawn. Glad it was all over in the end. Where's the suspense in this one? More stunts, action and sexual jokes than ever. But this time, like often, more is not better. Watch Denise Richards as the most unlikely, terrific looking, below 25 years old nuclear scientist in the most unlikely place on earth. On the positive side though , she has a nice pair. Of shoes.",The World Is Not Enough
298,paulmg,One of the best and most complex Bonds,7,19 November 1999,"There's a lot to like about this Bond. Brosnan has finally grown comfortably into the role. And his is one of the best turns of the series. Bond isn't a superman here. He's mortal. He feels pain. Often.Also showing her stuff is Sophie Marceau as heiress Elektra King. She easily stands apart from most Bond girls, ranking among the most memorable, alongside Honore Blackman, Diana Rigg and, more recently, Michelle Yeoh. Her chemistry with Brosnan is palpable, and the developing relationship between the two during the film is entirely believable (a rarity for a Bond film).The only real weak link is Christmas Jones, portrayed by Denise Richards. She is fine in the part, but the character itself is entirely wasted. She's given little more to do than stand around and look like Denise Richards. It would have been nice if she could have come in handy by the end of the film, but there's very little that she does that Bond could not have done for himself. After all, he has deactivated bombs before (Octopussy).However, the plot is a real knockout. It's not your typical point-and-shoot Bond plot, where he somehow seems to miraculously know who the bad guy is right out of the gate. Instead, he finds he has his work cut out for him, as well as a surprise or two in store along the way; not only for him, but for the audience as well.The opening sequence is also a stunner. It's probably the longest opening sequence in the franchise history: a chase covering air, land, and sea. Unfortunately, the rest of the film never manages to reach the same level of intensity in its action, but there is real character development to be had, a sacrifice I, for one, was more than glad to make.If you're at all inclined towards seeing this film, I highly recommend it.",The World Is Not Enough
299,Dierk,"Great movie, minor flaws",9,10 January 2000,"Well, it is not that hard to rate this James Bond better than its four predecessors: it's fast paced but takes its time. It actually developes plot, story and character. You really find acting in the film -- lots of acting, from Judi Dench through Robert Carlyle, Sophie Marceau up to Pierce Brosnan. The script has some good (and some not so good) jokes; some jokes concerning Q became stale if not quite cynical after his death in a car accident. At some points you find even tragedy in the movie, last time seen in the unlucky but good OHMSS. Another interesting thing, the movie has direction! Michael Apted was the the best decision for many a year (including Martin Campbell, who is not that bad, but was a bit to heavily counting on fast paced comic book action), he directs not just one action scene after another but takes interest in the characters. Now for the flaws: they are minor because the flawed scenes are still enjoyable. One is the neither very funny nor suspenseful action sequence in the caviar factory. Rather bad looking. And then, can anybody tell me what Goldies role was meant to be? The only good thing about it is a nice joke in the casino ... but they are doing nothing with him. To end on a happy note, the film looks good (does anybody remember the ridiculous closing sequence of Tomorrow Never Dies, in the pool?) and has all the typical ingredients of the Fleming novels and the early films.",The World Is Not Enough
300,DRomm,Why isn't Bond deaf?,7,8 January 2000,"TWINE is a movie made to formula, but its a time-tested formula and it works.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that the movie takes no chances and so offers very little that's new to a Bond fan but more of the same.  Worse, it seems to have abandoned all the Fun Stuff that is necessary to build to Potential Armageddon.  Instead of long suspenseful segments on a train or underwater, we're subjected to explosion after explosion after explosion.  Bond movies have always required a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, but its easier to accept that Bond can walk after torture than it is to accept that he can still hear after the big booms constantly around him.Q Makes a nice exit and Cleese will be a good R, and it was great to see M get in on the action.  But the plot made less sense than usual (there are other pipelines, other oil fields) and the final sex jokes were way overdone.  Mostly, you're left with the flash and sound of explosions ringing in your eyes are you leave the theater.In the middle of the Bond pack of movies, but you think they could do a bit better with all the experience they have.  The best Bond movies have combined subtlety with the over-the-top heroics.  But 'subtle' is not to formula, alas.",The World Is Not Enough
301,00Mike26,Bad.,5,6 August 2000,"I've just read a comment claiming that this is the best of the last twelve years! This is one of the worst of the entire 40 years.While for once the plot is actually quite well thought through, the execution of the film is apalling in almost all departments.Robert Carlyle actually manages to be bad- I never thought that was possible. Using a character who can feel no pain could have led to all sorts of interesting situations, instead he holds a hot rock for a bit- oooh!Denise Richards continues her campaign for the prize of worst actress of all time (see Starship Troopers, Wild Things).The script is appalling, the first ten minutes is nothing but a collection of witless one-liners.Pierce Brosnan has definitely outstayed his welcome after a decent debut and a reasonable follow-up. It's time to give the most sought after male role in the film industry to somebody who can act (clue- furrowing the brow does not equal acting).Sophie Marceau is a redeeming feature, her performance is excellent, though the scene in Istanbul between her and 'Renard' is slightly tortuous, lacking the chemistry it sorely needed, though I guess that could be put down to the rather bland nature of 'Renard'.Robbie Coltrane breathes life into the film at the right time, and Goldie is quite funny towards the end, but these are small things that went right in an otherwise wrong film.",The World Is Not Enough
302,Rick-174,The best Bond movie for a long time,7,5 December 1999,"I am possibly unusual amongst Bond fans in having actually read all of Ian Fleming's original 007 books. I have to say that this is probably the best Bond film since _Live and Let Die_. The plot is 'sensible' i.e. not farcical. Brosnan is I think the closest Bond to the books of them all. Connery may have been good ... but a Scot as James Bond? No way I'm afraid. Brosnan is a very, very, good James Bond. The opening sequence in London is something of a first - very impressive, especially if you happen to be British! To see them chasing outside the Houses of Parliament and then wind up at the Millenium Dome is terrific.What makes this film rather special is stupendous performances by the villains as well. Carlyle is really chilling - especially when he tells M she will die: really nasty. As for Sophie Marceau - wow the nastiest Bond girl I have ever seen. Oh, and by the way, that must be the best closing line to any Bond film!This is a cracking Bond movie.",The World Is Not Enough

304,born-giantsfan,I don't understand the 9+ star reviews on here,3,2 September 2014,"I really don't understand the large number of 9 and 10 star reviews here on IMDb for this movie. Having seen all of the bond films multiple times, this one may not be the worst, but it certainly is not the best.After seeing this several times, my opinion has not changed. I (and many others) found the writing to be some of the most immature and juvenile of bond series of movies. The acting was spotty and the casting ill fated. The action scenes (outside the well done opening sequence) are poorly choreographed and cheesy looking. The male villain was ... tame and not very threatening. It just didn't do too much except deliver lots of action - poorly done action, but lots of it.The shining part of the movie is Sophia Marceau playing the sexy victim/villain. she shines in the movie, and plays all the facets of her part well - childlike victim, sexual plaything, sexual predator, conniving bitch, and slightly insane maniacal killer. I do give Brosnan some credit, this is probably his best Bond film, but he was never right for the role. Denise Richards was in no way convincing as a scientist of any kind, let alone a nuclear physicist. No-one bought her in that role. Her acting was terrible and her wardrobe didn't help - walking around in a tank top and shorts almost the whole movie. I enjoyed the view but wasn't seeing the character - only her well displayed body.A few of the many many examples of poor writing and directing:the banter from Christmas and Elektra about the other woman was ridiculous. I know women swoon for Bond, but as soon as Christmas sees Elektra she makes a comment about Bond sleeping with her. And it was the same the other way around. Here are two smart and powerful women (one who was clearly just using Bond) and they suddenly get all jealous at the sight of another beautiful woman? Totally out of character and poorly written.the list of ""goofs"" in this film must be the longest of any Bond film – this shows a very poor job of directing, writing, and editing. Continuity was very poor in many of the scenes. Yes there was lots going on, but that is no excuse for the switching of guns, body directions, and clothing, as well as injuries disappearing or moving, objects in rooms moving, and many other mistakes that are throughout the movie.the fight scene in the sub near the end was the ultimate in bad directing and choreography. When Renard knees Bond hurting him badly, his knee obviously goes next to Bond not into him. Throughout the movie punches and kicks clearly miss the target yet Renard is somehow knocked out briefly and Bond is later writhing in pain. And when they are choking each other with hands at the neck, they basically have a conversation  while being choked.The scenes of the fight at the caviar factory and it being being destroyed  where do you start. None of it looked remotely realistic. The helicopters carrying saws cutting through everything, while a cool idea, just looked so hokey. The way the buildings were cut, the way the car was cut in two, the saw chasing Brosnan down a pier, etc, etc. Every part of the scene was poorly done and looked silly. I know there is a comedic factor to these movies, but this belonged in the Peter Sellers spoof, not a real Bond movie.I could go on and talk about all the scenes where Brosnans stunt double is clearly identified, other examples of really bad writing, and the horrible plot, but you get the idea.There is a reason why: Denise Richards got the Razzies award that year - for Worst Supporting Actress. Rotten Tomatoes ranked this #21 of the 25 Bond Movies (right behind Die Another Day and Tomorrow Never Dies - two other Brosnan Bond movies) Both Rolling Stone and BuzzFeed rank it #20 out of 25 Entertainment Weekly named Denise Richards the worst Bond girl of all time in 2008 (even worse than Tanya Robers in A View To A Kill) and EW ranked this the worst bond movie of all time (but that was before Quantum of Solace and Die Another Day which is now ranks lower).I will say one more thing though, when M is captured and locked in the cell. I expected her to pull something out of her broach or a hairpin that she would use. I mean come-on, she runs the whole organization and she had nothing to work with and couldn't even pull a clock into the cell?",The World Is Not Enough
305,Flyer-6,Each Bond movie seems to get worse,1,27 November 1999,"Maybe I'm just getting older, but it seems like each Bond flick is getting worse than the last one.  I think they just add up the total tonnage of the explosives that they use, and if it's more than the last film they figure they've got a winner and go with it.  The plot lines are so thin that it is ridiculous and the characters are so super-human that there is no tension that harm could come to them.  I went with a group of 5 and not one person would rate this movie above '2'; one 30-something woman said she had a hard time staying awake except for the explosions.The new female 'M' (I think she has been in the last 2 movies) is about as convincing in the role as my grandmother would be. When the bad guys threatened to kill her I cheered hoping we might get a stronger actress.I sure would like to see a Bond flick that was actually a 'spy' movie rather than just a gadget/explosion exposition. How about some real suspense instead of invincible success?",The World Is Not Enough
306,lyre,Illogical and sloppy,5,25 December 1999,"The World is Not Enough has its good parts and its bad parts. Unfortunately, the good are few and the bad are many.Let's start with the good. The opening title sequence is visually beautiful, with liquid ripple effects, girls, seamless blends of 3d animation and people.Brosnan also gives it a good try, although he has little to work with. French B-movie queen Sophie Marceau does quite a good job. And you get to see Desmond Llewelyn in his final role as Q.But the film is sloppy and doesn't add up at all.The opening boat chase scene, for example, has Bond acting so reckless that it's a miracle dozens of innocent bystanders aren't killed. Bond might take risks, but he isn't stupid, and wouldn't do things that would be almost certain to kill bystanders, unless he was saving the world and had to sacrifice a few. But in this chase, he's just trying to catch a suspect. Illogical.Then there's a ski chase scene, supposedly taking place on a pristine mountain in the middle of nowhere, but in a great many shots, you can see that people have been skiing all over the slopes, and the treads of grooming machines are visible everywhere. Sloppy.Then there's the lack of bothering to check fundamental facts. Denise Richards, in a stunningly bad and completely non-believable turn as nuclear physicist Dr. Christmas Jones, keeps handling plutonium, keeping it in her backpack, and says that weapons-grade plutonium is safe, but tritium is dangerous.In fact, as anyone with the slightest knowledge of the subject knows, tritium is relatively safe and the tiniest particle of plutonium is basically guaranteed to kill. Carrying around six kilograms of plutonium for a few minutes is also guaranteed to bring death from radiation sickness within a few hours.Yes, there's action, but the film is a sloppy piece of work, constructed by people who appear to be just doing their job, with no passion and little creativity.",The World Is Not Enough
307,Joe-290,James Bond is back and just like never before!,7,26 November 1999,"The world is not enough is the greatest Bond film out of the last 3. It totally chews up Goldeneye and definitely Tomorrow never dies. It has everything. It is fast, funny and furious. There is a great sense of humour. Probably the funniest Bond movie of all. It is extremely sexually explicit and sexually active. It is more sexual than any other Bond movie and really points in the direction of the novels. This film has everything you can want in a film. Humour, sex, violence, romance, action, suspense, tension, adventure and drama. There is more acting in this film. The sets are the most exotic and beautiful locations to enter a 007 film in years.Many sad and interested things commence. Shocking actions and it has absolute suspense. It is ultimate Bond. It starts off with action and then procrastination sets in but this procrastination is not boring as it is showing great acting and letting you know the amazing, original and complex story-line and plot. The actions scene are the best I've seen and of course like usual the James Bond films show again they are the greatest action films ever. Starting off witha stunt that most action movies end with.Bond wears glamorous clothes and so does Sophie. The bedrooms and houses and casino are all beautifully designed and the villains are the most vicious yet. The makers of this film really learned how bad 'Tomorrow never dies' was so they really made up for it with this. The boat chase was excellent, nothing like it has ever entered movies before. This filmalso has the largest set ever made in the history of film. The gadgets are good. The girls are sexy. The scenery is beautiful. It is total glmaour. Absolutley glamorous and is a true Bond film. It is really made up with the special Bond formula.The first scenes in the opening sequence is the longest opening ever for 007 with a toal 15 minutes until you hear garbage lash out with their sentual song of the title. The music score is great with terrific suspense and a great sense of action. Brilliant.It is a fabulous movie which everyone should watch. It is for everyone. Wondeful fun which suddenly turns to roughness and toughness. Insanity from the bad guy makes the film a lot better than the last. An awful cruel and ugly character. It is tremendous.Underwater scenes, skiing scenes, action scenes with helicopters and piles and piles of bullets. Many girls brighten up the screen and now Bond has x-ray glasses. Its bond nad beyond. New ideas and very differnet to all the other Bond films. It really stand out as a great film, not just when it comes to Bond films but with all types of films. Bond is the best. No one can match him. The world is not enough and you cant get enough excitement out of you after seeing it.I give this film 10 out of 10. It is just phenomonal. wow!, the only vocab you'll encounter after it. Look out for the disastrous incident with the BMW Z8. One to definitely watch. Dont miss it. It is ten times better than Star Wars and a lot more intelligent too. It is amazing. I just cant stop saying how amazing it is and this will happen to you too. The fun and aventure and excitment and feeling of action will stay for a long time. Dont just watch it once but watch it twice or three times. Its the best action Bond film ever. It is just like never before. James Bond is back and I cant wait till he is back again in 2 years time.",The World Is Not Enough
308,panduh,Snoozefest. Unoriginal action scenes. Forgettable characters,4,20 November 1999,"Boy was this movie boring.After watching this Pierce Brosnan snoozer, I thought back to ""From Russia with Love"", ""Goldfinger"" and even Moore's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and remembered such memorable characters as Red Grant, Pussy Galore, Odd Job, and Jaws. This movie has nothing close.The new villain, Renard, whose description, though quite menacing, (he's an anarchist who feels no pain!) is actually a huge dud, not unlike Darth Maul. He is not particularly scary, nor evil, nor intelligent, nor strong, nor villainous.  Hell, I didn't feel an ounce of suspense in this movie at all. He gets no dialogue, has minimal interaction with Bond and lacks any of the diabolical traits possessed by Dr.No, Goldfinger or Blofeld.  We do, however, get the return of Valentin Zukovsky, performed with zest by Robbie Coltrane.  He brings a sense of life and personality to a film that so sorely needs it.  It is unfortunate that his role was not more substantial. He was the only redeeming feature.Although I was a big proponent of Pierce Brosnan getting the role, back in the Timothy Dalton days, I have been horribly dissatisfied with his performance as 007.  I don't know if its the writers fault or what, but he is awfully boring.  He lacks the charm and personality that both Connery and Moore possessed in spades (though I felt Moore was a tad goofy as well). Brosnan, while certainly very handsome, suave and debonair, is *not* charming in this role!  I don't know what the deal is, because he was excellent as Remington Steele, but as Bond he is like a talking corpse. Michelle Yeoh was a god-send in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" because she added a sense of excitement and originality to the series with her astounding fight scenes. Her humorous banter with James Bond (especially when Bond tries to put the moves on her) was very refreshing and brought personality to the film. But there is a total lack of it in this latest film.  It feels like your standard, plain-jane secret-agent film, with actually very *little* espionage!!The action scenes were also very ho-hum.  The best action scene in the whole movie was a high-speed boat chase scene involving a VERY cool futuristic speedboat.  However, this scene occurs in the introduction leading to the opening credit, and from then on it is all downhill.  We get a downhill ski chase that is so frightfully unoriginal.  If anybody wants to see a truly exciting, funny and original ski-chase sequence, check out Jackie Chan's ""First Strike"", where he ends up falling in a lake (hilarious).  The ski-chase in the Bond film is par for the course.  No excitement, no suspense, no humor...  The rest of the movie drags on with no action whatsoever for about an hour.  We get a couple of scenes where James Bond manages to outrun fiery explosions (anyone else tired of that defiance of physics?) and has to dodge a tree-trimming helicopter.  Not too exciting...I also got the feeling that they were trying to work Judi Dench into the film more, because of her recently vaulted status after winning Best Supporting Actress last year.  The problem was, her role was pathetic! She looked like she was acting in her very first movie for christ-sakes, what happened to the performer who played a delightfully delicious Queen Elizabeth in last years ""Shakespeare in Love""? I guess she didn't show up for work...Finally, what happened to Bonds cool gadgets? Except for the cool speed boat, we get very little high tech wizardry.  A pair of x-ray specs, a credit card lockpick, and man-sized beach ball is all we get.  Even the new Z-8 seems frightfully humdrum.  It doesn't do anything, except drive! yuk.All in all, a very average, plain, forgettable movie with a wooden performance by Brosnan and company and some tedious dialogue.  Catch it on bargain matinee...",The World Is Not Enough
309,CptPtnia,One of the Best,9,21 November 1999,"This was a great movie from start to finish.  From the opening teaser sequence to the conclusion, the action and intrigue were nonstop.
TWINE had all of the elements that make the Bond series great...a great storyline, beautiful locales, beautiful women, and a lot of action at a pace so you don't notice the anomalies in the plot.  This one also was the first Bond movie in a long time to add an air of mystery and true espionage to the plot (is Elektra a badguy or not?).  And the revenge factor, with M's personal vendetta made it very intriguing, given her line in Goldeneye to not make it personal.The teaser scene, as long as it was, was so packed with action that you actually forget that the credits haven't run yet, and that is just a prelude to the action to come.  For my money, this was the best pre-credit teaser in the entire Bond series.Sure Denise Richards is a stretch as a nuclear scientist, but you must remember that this is the Bond universe, where women in powerful positions actually look this good.  Sophie Marceau was stunning as Elektra, and the other women gave us our fill of eye candy.And if this is Q's swan song, a solid replacement has been found.  Cleese and Llewellen have both said Q will be back, but at the age of 85, they had to prepare for the inevitable.  His departure was full of class.
Overall a fantastic addition to the series.  I'd say one of the 5 best, but let it sink in first.  I'm likely to end up thinking  so regardless...",The World Is Not Enough
310,Sithlord-20,A Subpar Entry in the Bond Canon,6,21 November 1999,"Unlike many, I have enjoyed Pierce Brosnan as Bond.  He appears to have more fun with the role than any of his predecessors since Connery.  But ""The World is Not Enough"" was a disappointment.  It lacked the creativity of Brosnan's two previous efforts, and instead pieces together action sequences from other Bond films.  We get souped-up versions of the boat chase from ""From Russia With Love,"" the skiing scene from ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" and the old we've-got-to-deactivate-the-bomb gimmick from ""Goldfinger,"" and ""A View to a Kill,"" amongst others.Both ""Goldeneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" had wonderfully grandiose villains intent on striking fear in the hearts of everyone on earth.  But the bad guys in ""T.W.I.N.E."" are rendered impotent by their lack of ambition.  So while Robert Carlyle gives a chillingly malefic performance as Renard, it is wasted in a film which felt more like a Timothy Dalton Bond flick than the two brilliant throwbacks to the heyday of Sean Connery that Brosnan previously made.",The World Is Not Enough
311,David Mills,Third Bond of Pierce turns to be his best so far,7,12 December 1999,"Goldfinger (Conneries third) , The Spy Who Loved Me (Moores third) and now The World Is Not Enough (Brosnans third) are probably the best Bonds ever.The opening scene of TWINE is absolutely a great one as are some of the typical Bond jokes. The story is more dramatized then in the last movies which serves Judi Dench as 'M'. The screenplay allows her to demonstrate that she is a fine actress. Sophie Marceau is an excellent villain although Xenia 'Famke Jansen' Onatopp was more exciting.I don't know what to think of Denise Richards, but she is more a Bond girl of the early seventies: gorgeous but not very interesting.David Arnold proofs to be a great successor of John Barry. His score is superb, especially the music of the opening scene (put the CD in your car turn up the volume up and you easily drive 100 miles an hour without noticing). If you are a real Bond addict his CD with Bond covers performed by various artists is worth buying, listen also to the music of the movie Stargate: excellent!)Pierce Brosnan finally became Bond. I'm a real Connery fan but Pierce plays the role perfectly in balance. He is determined and violent, but also tender and funny. Chances are that he will be the best Bond ever.There are some rather nice details in TWINE as well. In one sequence in Castle Thane you can see the late 'M' Bernard Lee on a painting hanging on the wall. Desmond Llewelyn has his (final?) goodbye after 17 Bond movies and is replaced by John Cleese. I do want to know were Bond buys his eyeglasses for with those the world is enough to me.",The World Is Not Enough
312,Cathz,The World Is Not Enough... but 19 Bonds are,6,13 May 2000,"It's quite amazing that more Bond films are still being made after almost 40 years, and if you watch 'The World Is Not Enough' you can see that they have indeed overdone it all.  Every joke and every action-piece - however spectacular - is nothing new.  We've seen it all before, and done just as well if not better.No disrespect to Pierce Brosnan though, who in my opinion gives his best performance as 007 yet, and also Sophie Marceau, who makes a perfect villainess.  I can't say the same for Denise Richards however - a believable Lara Croft, yes, but nuclear scientist??  Still, the late Desmond Llewelyn as 'Q' has made a fine last performance, and I think the films will lose something without his memorable presence.Overall, this film is very watchable for pure entertainment value, but I hope the Bond producers will consider calling it a day before they ruin what was, in the beginning, a great phenomenon.",The World Is Not Enough
313,frodofan00,A disgrace to all Bond films.,3,26 December 2002,"This movie was, by far, the worst Bond movie I've seen. The acting was bad, the plot was horrible, there were almost NO GADGETS, and the cast definitely needed some work - Denise Richards...a nuclear scientist?? I had a laugh over that (In fact, there were only a handful of people I enjoyed watching.)  What else can I say? It's worth renting for the sole purpose to say that you've seen it.",The World Is Not Enough
314,Sowerplave,Just manages to be an alright movie - 6/10,6,16 February 2021,"This Bond movie is something of a mixed bag. It manages to have some of the most engaging and well motivated characters in the franchise's history, and some of the least engaging and motivating characters in the franchise's history. This movie also offers an exciting variation of environments and the variations of these.What stops this from being a bad movie is Elektra King. All the compellations from preventing this movie to not be particularly good came from her.It just manages to be an alright movie. Not a classic by any means, but not a flop either.6/10",The World Is Not Enough
315,pbbuffyhugs,Brosnans Best Bond Film,10,5 March 2006,"Has there ever been a more beautiful baddie in a Bond film than Sophie Marceau? (maybe Luciana Paluzzi in 'Thunderball' to answer my own question) This woman is GORGEOUS and one of the series best characters. Pierce Brosnan gets better with each movie and out of his four this is probably the best. The pre-credit sequence, the longest in the films history is worth the entrance fee alone, an amazing chase along the river Thames it is simply stunning and should really only be viewed on a big screen. This sequence is what Bond is all about, outrageously over the top excitement that kicks the film off to a cracking start, in fact I'd go as far as saying this is the best pre-credit beginning of all the Bond films. The story actually makes sense as well for once - no real plot twists (except Electra) and all the action is there for a reason, not just as spectacle. Judi Dench gets her best outing in this, proving herself capable of getting out of tight situations and it's nice to see Robbie Coltrane again (the caviar factory scene being another highlight). The humour is kept in check and doesn't descend into parody like some in the series ('Diamonds Are Forever' for example) but when Bond says 'Q isn't going to like this' when his car gets sliced in half is one of the funniest moments in any of the films. Speaking of Q this is Desmond LLewelyns last Bond movie, he died shortly after and the film is dedicated to him. All in all this is as good as any of Connerys films and the best since 'The Spy Who Loved Me' with good all round performances from all involved although Denise Richards was obviously picked more for her looks than acting ability. A worthy addition to the series this is my 6th favourite 007 film.",The World Is Not Enough
316,rux-2,...this space is not enough...,9,19 November 1999,"well, here we are....the number 19th Bond movie. And it was a shock !!! The opening it takes you like a storm... by surprise and totaly unexpected. The action starts to build up from minute one and about 15 min. later you realize that you haven`t even seen the opening credits. Now, there was a little turn off....the opening music. I, personaly would have fast forward it. I`m not sure about the 2nd turn off, but i believe, it happens around the middle of the movie. Too much sensless yapping... As for the cast....you have to see them to apreciate their role. What can i say? Everybody is this movie did a great job. I will definitly add this movie to my 007 collection, when will became avaiable. For me, this movie did 9 out of 10.",The World Is Not Enough
317,Morpheus-76,Typical Bond-movie,6,7 December 1999,"I expected nothing when I went to see this movie, and quite frankly, got nothing. It was just like all the other Bond-movies, with (almost) no surprises. Although it had a promising line-up of actors (Coltrane, Carlyle and Cleese) and goodlooking women (Richards and Marceau) they were almost completely wasted: Carlyle and Cleese got too little screentime and Richards had crap dialogue (and didn´t get to show off her body too much). Surprisingly, Marceau is the one who gets to have fun with her character, especially towards the end. This, and the little character development there is, is the saving grace which saves this movie from being a flop. An average movie.",The World Is Not Enough
318,chrisf-uk,Kill this series now !,2,18 November 2001,"I'll keep this review short, because I don' t think this bland homogenized mess of a movie deserves more.The casting is just plain bad : Not one of the bad guys is convincing for a SECOND and, sorry, but Brosnan simply doesn't convince me in the lead role. His bland, blow-dried good looks put me more in mind of an car salesman than a ruthless assassin.Pretty much every major stunt and set-piece is utterly, utterly ludicrously over the top. I'd heard great things about the opening boat chase, but it came off as thoroughly unbelievable and derivative. Things get worse : the ski chase is extremely tedious (how on EARTH can you mess up a Bond ski scene so badly?), and the sequence with the helicopters/rotary saws at the harbour is just plain childish.I grew up with the Roger Moore movies, and for me he epitomizes what Bond is all about : class, wit and sly cunning. TWINE is nothing more than 'made for TV' style rubbish. *Please* don't waste your time and money on this...",The World Is Not Enough
319,Dudles,19th time Lucky...,9,27 November 1999,"I personally think this is the best of the James Bonds.  Brosnan is rapidly laying a claim to be the best ever Bond, although I suspect people old enough to have seen the Connery films in the cinema might disagree with me.The rest of the cast are all great choices, although Denise Richards struggles a little at first and it's always nice to see female characters who actually have character.It manages to balance action and actual story perfectly and particular mention goes to John Cleese who will make a superb replacement Q when Desmond Llewelyn finally calls it a day.",The World Is Not Enough
320,spunky-17,"Thrilling, but lacking a bit",8,19 December 1999,"This new Bond movie, The World is Not Enough, had an action-packed beginning, but kind of lagged in some places.  Denise Richards, Bond's love interest/rocket scientist, had the incredible body of a Bond girl, but didn't have the brains of a rocket scientist.  Although this was a step up from the old movies, where women didn't have brains at all, it could be better.  Some of the gadgets were also cool, but the new BMW didn't even compare to the Tomorrow Never Dies car.  John Cleese was a good addition as R, but I was sad to see Q go.

321,Koeling,Bond films get dumber and dumber.,2,17 July 2000,Brosnan Bond-films are getting weaker and weaker every time. I loved Goldeneye. Tomorrow never dies was okay but not very good. The world is not enough is the most dumbist bondfilm ever made. There were to many explosions. The ski-scene where james on ski's takes on about 4 snowmobiles was to funny and stupid. The explosion in the pipe......? There was one bom in the pipe moving and when the pipe blew up there were 2 explosions. Robbie Coltrane was very funny. To bad he died in the film.,The World Is Not Enough
322,co010c6650,Zzzzzzzzzz,2,16 November 2006,"Unbearably tedious, muddled, instantly forgettable Bond 'thriller' that tries hard to introduce a deeper, darker, more emotionally flawed hero to the audience but at the expense of narrative cohesion and entertainment value. Right from the start things weren't looking too promising as it's not very often I find myself sensing boredom setting in with a film before the opening credits have appeared but that is certainly the case here thanks to an interminable boat chase sequence that, unusually for a Bond outing, contains a prelude to the subsequent plot but unfortunately very little in the way of entertainment. Plus points ? Coltrane, Marceau (Although her character, similarly to Tiffany Case in 'Diamonds Are Forever', does get progressively sillier) and the fact that this is marginally less awful than the truly ghastly 'Die Another Day'. Negative ? A disjointed, utterly tedious screenplay, a feeble villain who posed about as much threat as The Hooded Claw, mind-numbing 'action' sequences and the less said about Ms Richards, the better.

324,Bond-33,Definately in the top 5 Bond films,9,22 November 1999,"The World Is Not Enough is an excellent movie.  Pierce Brosnan seems to have perfected his role and Denise Richards is gourgeous (and believable) as nuclear weapons expert Dr. Christmas Jones.  Robert Carlyle was perfect as the terrorist Renard.The opening boat chase, the para-hawk/ski chase, and the nuclear silo scenes were amazing.  There are plenty of gadgets, suprising plot twists, and of course, Bond says his two most famous lines...""Bond, James Bond"" ...""Vodka martini shaken not stirred"" All in all I gave it a 9 as there were a few small plot holes, and I would have changed the ending.

327,NancyBoy,Not worth seeing,3,14 January 2000,"I entered my local movie theater with very high expectations.  A couple of my friends had seen this movie and declared that it was the best James Bond movie since the days of Connery.  THEY WERE WRONG!!!!  I was very disappointed.  The quips were forced and very cheesy.  The gadgets were pitiful, any ""super"" boat that takes ten minutes to take out a cabin cruiser is good for nothing.  The two bond girls although quite aesthetically pleasing acted their perspective roles terribly.  Sophie Marceau may be a good actress, but she was supposed to be the daughter of a British lord and she has such a thick French accent.  It seemed at times that she might be trying to fake a British accent but this just slurred her lines and made the character worse.  The villain was utterly ridiculous.  Oh my goodness.... he has a bullet in his head... well, whoopty-doo I am just petrified!  His accent was also pretty stupid.  Valentine, who was quite believable in Goldeneye came off as some sort of chump.  He utterly hated Bond and suddenly he is his ally? I don't think so.  This movie represented the first time I was steered wrong by an Internet Movie Database Rating.  I think that most of the people who wrote reviews for this movie accidently walked into the theater where ""Fight Club"" was showing and wrote their reviews based on that beautiful movie thinking it was ""The World is not enough"".

Without Ian Flemming's storywriting, this movie failed to leave the runway.  Its action scenes were recycled, Pierce Brosnan's 007 was unremarkable, and the plot and acting were simply uninteresting.  Though later Bond films have never been especially noted for their plot and character development, they have always been rescued by sfx, 007's ""toys,"" and beautiful women.  Unfortunately, all we are rewarded with is some sort of armored miniboat and a pretty car that only costs a lot more than mine! Don't misunderstand me -- the women certainly are beautiful, but they do not fit their roles.  Sophie Marceau simply does not possess the edge, while Denise Richards lacks the on-screen persona of a scientist to allow me to disregard my disbelief even for a moment!

329,orocolorado,This cost 135 million dollars?????,1,27 February 2007,This is a really lousy Bond. Is it because the daughter Broccoli is the producer? It was far inferior to the previous one in the sequence Goldeneye the last one produced by her father. The story is full of flaws apparently written by someone who knows nothing about the world. A good example is the casino scene where is it? Azerbajin? Lots of wealthy token blacks there. Elektra saves a church and becomes a heroine in a Moslem country? The action scenes look so fake and the props so bad...after the pipe line blows up Christmas and Bond are crawling around the crater filled with a couple trees that were obviously cut down cleanly with a saw. Heavy water is dangerous but not plutonium?? The whole story was so inaccurate and stupid it hardly deserves analysis. I finally started to fast forward it. God awful. If the daughter is responsible I hope she improves. I have my doubts based on this piece of garbage. Wikipedia says this movie cost 135 million. Where did the money go? Certainly not the writers or prop makers. Why didn't they hire someone who knew something about geography or science to advise the writer?,The World Is Not Enough

The story really didn't go anywhere, nor did it interest me from the start! I feel bad for Denise, her role in this pathetic movie really dampened a promising looking career. Her acting wasn't exactly AMAZING, but it topped Brosnan's hands down.What really got me was the fact that Brosnan's stunt double probably had more time on screen than he did! I know a lot of the scenes were dangerous and etc, but he could have grown some balls and done one or two scenes himself (like Daniel Craig).God, I've said more than enough.

That may explain some of the pacing problems that the films exhibits at times. The action sequences are extremely well done and choreographed but there are some lulls when the dialogue sequences get started.The main things this film suffers from is a weak villian, and Denise Richards. After watching this it's clear she didn't get hired for acting ability (which she doesn't possess).Granted, she fills a tank top and daisy dukes quite nicely but she just seems out of place among such an otherwise stellar cast.While not as well done as Goldeneye, this film definitely puts the series back on course after the lackluster and highly derivative Tomorrow Never Dies.rating:8",The World Is Not Enough

As this movie is already spoiled, nothing I write here can further spoil it.)This movie insults anyone's intelligence (even some of the more sophisticated domestic animals might feel insulted). If this were a stupid little agent thriller from the UK of the 1960s I wouldn't mind. But come on, this is a BOND MOVIE and it was made in 1999. Brosnan must really really have been in need of money very badly not to refuse such an idiotic script. Or maybe he just didn't read it Maybe no-one did. Sounds strangely plausible to me. Maybe it was written by a random generator. There is no definite prove, yet it is very likely that said random generator was also used to select cast and role-names.Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist?

That's like say, putting Mr. Bean into a Bond movie... Oh wait, he was in a Bond movie.Elektra.

Then he opens another hatch, steps into the reactor room and prevents a nuclear meltdown by pushing the fuel rods back into the reactor. With his bare hands. Poor Mr. Random Generator, how could he possibly know that those rods are hot, very very hot and very very radioactive?Did I mention that I hate silly movies?The only thing that saves this movie from me giving it a 0 is that IMDB's rating system won't allow it.

334,SeriouslyMike,Grim. Gritty. Great.,9,6 April 2005,"James Bond can still kick ass if you don't give him his toys. And he damn does. I think it's the best of the series, as it's dark and quite realistic for a James Bond movie. The ""superspy"" is forced to act quickly, hide in shadows and think fast. Doesn't have his miraculous gadgetry (apart from the warehouse scene, when he uses the hidden Stinger to take out the helicopter), so the plot is automatically less cheesy. The pipeline chase and finale might be over the top, but apart from that, the film is well made. We even see M herself recalling old operative tricks.The actors play their parts well, even Goldie (who's a DJ, not a professional actor) isn't bad as Zukovski's clumsy aide. Anyway, when you have Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau and Judi Dench, they simply can't screw up.Action is well-balanced too, as some directors tend to go overboard and blow stuff up through 3/4 of the film (John Woo, anyone?). Even the villain isn't THAT cliché - ""I'm gonna die anyway, so I'll better do it with a bang."" I don't recall many movies with a plot like that.9/10.

335,Metamorf,Action aplenty!,9,28 November 1999,"Although this third outing for Brosnan's Bond lacks the flamboyant villains, fiesty femme fatales, and really good one-liners of old, it more than makes up for it with it's amazing action sequences.It easily has as many narrow escapes as Indiana Jones and as many explosions as John Woo.I must add that Carlyle's portrayal of Renard, the villain who feels no pain, is probably one of the coldest characters I have seen on film.  John Cleese is definitely a superb successor to 'Q', but Denise Richards' ridiculously named character ""Dr Christmas Jones"" is a bit of a liability.But Hey, it's a Bond film -- 9/10",The World Is Not Enough
336,Shingle,It's Bond... again!,8,11 December 1999,"Well it's Bond! He's back again for a 19th instalment of the same usual set of gags, gadgets, girls and guns! Can the world not get enough of this already?Not that anyone really needs to know the story for a Bond film as it's usually just an excuse for lots of action! But you might end up enjoying it more if you knew what was going on. So for all it's worth, here you go. Bond races out to protect Elektra King (Marceau, playing a very different kind of Bond girl!), the daughter of a recently assassinated oil tycoon. She's under threat as she tries to complete a set of pipelines, so she's obviously going to need some protection (NO, not that type of protection!). The threat comes from Renard (Carlyle) who plays a unique villain who can't feel any pain after having a bullet lodged in his brain. As Bond gets closer to catching him a few truths are revealed! We quickly discover that things aren't going to be as easy as they look! But then again it's a Bond film so they never are!Along the way Bond teams up with nuclear physicist Christmas (Richards) Jones (what a name!) who manages to help him diffuse bombs! Very handy as together they end up having to stop Renard from blowing half the world up!The film starts off with one of the longest opening pre-credits sequences for a Bond film! It's also one of the best which begins with an out of the ordinary escape from a building, includes a thrilling boat chase around London and ends with an obvious explosion!It's nice to see the return of some characters. Judi Dench as 'M', Desmond Llewelyn as gadget master 'Q' and especially Robbie Coltrane reprising his same role from 'Goldeneye' as ex-KGB agent 'Valentin'. John Cleese as 'R' (Q's replacement in the gadget department!) tries his best by adding some extra humour to Bond but doesn't quite get there.The film shows Bond at his best! Brosnan really is on top form as one of the best Bonds! There's also enough action, stunts and big bangs that light up the screen! Also lighting up the screen are the Bond girls who are now strong, sexy and intelligent rather then silly and stupid. It's a better change, as we now don't always have bimbos who are always in danger and in need of help!The only downside about the film would have to be that it's just the same old formula all over again. Something's wrong, bring in Bond, add in nasty villain, mix a few explosions here and there and in the end Bond saves the day and gets the girl! So you can see that the film is quite predictable from start to finish but nevertheless it's a formula that works! 'The World Is Not Enough' does have all the usuals that you'd expect (right down to the Martini's, cars and bad one liners!) but just about everything has been cranked up to churn out something good from the old formula!It's smart and stylish just as James Bond should be and in the end it's really very good!Rating - 8 out of 10",The World Is Not Enough
337,delahoc,"Another great Bond, and a big elephant stamp to Pierce Brosnan",8,6 December 1999,"I've been a big Bond fan since I saw my first Connery Bond (I think it was Goldfinger). To me, there have always been several elements that make a Bond film work, and they must be perfectly balanced to make the film work. These include action (top chase scenes or action scenes are a must), humour (but laconic, and without falling into the traps of so many other films), villains (and other characters) you love to hate, and above all a believable Bond. The girls are secondary as window dressing, but important if their characters are well developed (character is king).This one has them all, and in the best balance for a while.The opening chase is brilliant, classic Bond. A nifty gadget, top speed, unbelievable stunts and a hero to cheer. The rest of the action sequences struggle to keep up with it - the ski chase is okay for a little while, but goes just a little long - though the chopper chase and gun fight on the docks is excellent.The humour is finely balanced, with Brosnan once again showing his perfect timing. He is as laconic and self-effacing a Bond as one could hope for. As much as I like John Cleese (I'm a Python and Fawlty Towers fan from way back) I fear that his inclusion in the cast as the probable successor to Q may swing the pendulum too far toward satire. I'd watch that one with caution if I were the producers.Elektra fills two roles wonderfully - a classic Bond girl with haunting, sultry good looks, and a calculating, heartless villain. Hers is a great addition to the story. Christmas Jones was a nothing character, and the movie would not have missed her being written out. It seems that Bond must sleep with someone at the end of the film, The name seems merely an excuse for the film's last line - straight out of Benny Hill.Brosnan is Bond. He has given the role a life and a depth that it has missed for many, many years. For my money, Connery is still the best Bond, but Brosnan is so close behind him as to be a real threat. Lazenby, Moore, and Dalton are so far behind these two as to be completely out of the race. Brosnan has kept the charm and the cool of the other Bonds, and given him the humour and the cold killer-instinct that he lost when Connery left. Dalton tried to bring that back but failed. Moore relied too heavily on the charm and the humour, and Lazenby just failed.The look on Brosnan's face during the opening scene in the banker's office when he displays his repulsion at those that tried to kill him, gives Bond a new depth. Brosnan is brilliant again.Oh, and where can I get a pair of those x-ray glasses????",The World Is Not Enough
338,zulu934,The best Pierce Brosnan Bond yet!,7,8 December 1999,"This is first Bond film that I have truly enjoyed since the days of Roger Moore. The last Bond Flick was so bad I could not stomach watching it to the end.  What an awful plot!!!  This film really has an involving story which is accented by the action scenes, rather then the other way around. Pierce Brosnan seems to be maturing well into the role.  While Denise Richards is the featured Bond Girl; Sophie Marceau is the one you remember long after the movie ends. (It takes more then cookie cutter beautiful features to create a sexy character) Robert Carylye of ""The Full Monty"" and ""Ravenous"" looks to be on the verge of stardom.  His character was not the usual one dimensional villain we see if Bond films ( or lampooned in Austin Powers movies). In summary, this is a very entertaining Bond movie from beginning to end.  I hope the producers continue along the same vein in future Bond efforts.",The World Is Not Enough
339,stephengward,Don't you just love James Bond!,1,2 April 2000,"The nineteenth 'official' 007 opus sees Bond leaving the twentieth century in style. After so many adventures the audience more than knows what to expect. With this in mind, it still baffles me when people complain about the tiredness and sameness the series lapses into. A simple fact should be noted here, a review stating that a Bond movie is unoriginal ain't a review in the first place!!  Unoriginality is part of the series' charm and the audience does not take kindly to major changes to the proceedings. 'The world is not enough' is a great action movie in its own right. A superb pre-title sequence takes place on the river Thames in London - death defying stunts reign supreme. Bond movies are the benchmark for cinematic action. The contribution the series gives the industry in this field is immeasurable. Well where's the review of the movie I hear you ask! If you've seen one then you have the blueprint for many. Here Bond is sent to protect 'Elektra King' a wealthy heiress to an oil empire. En route he encounters various baddies who have their own vested interested in Ms King, primarily 'Renard' played by Robert Carlyle is top of this list. Sadly the film marks Desmond Llewelyn's last appearance as 'Q'. Ironically in this film 'Q' is all set to retire and is provide with an assistant - 'R'. Therefore future generations will deem this as the way 'Q' is written out of the series. However, tragically Mr. Llewelyn was killed in a car crash not long after the film had been released, - he will be missed greatly. The Brosnan era has returned 007 to the forefront of cinemagoing audiences. Both Pierce and his alter ego are a success. Future predictions, the aforementioned actor will stay with the franchise until 2007 thus clocking up seven bond films, after which some other actor will take over for a few movies but won't be accepted in the role, following this a long-term replacement is found, thus the cycle continues. In short, Bond movies are just like diamonds - they are forever!",The World Is Not Enough
340,laxy56,avoid this one,5,25 February 2003,"One of the worst Bond movies overall. One thing good about it is Carlile as Renard, he's simply great as the main villain. The bad girl is OK too, Richards is quite pathetic as the Bond girl though. The rest of the movie is really bad.The story is poorly presented and is not really believable either, probably it could work (its not like realism is required from Bond movies), but the details just totally kill it.If you want to see a really good Brosnan movie, watch Tomorrow never dies.",The World Is Not Enough
341,pdmb,TWINE - Least inspiring Bond movie,5,5 January 2006,"It's not that The World is Not Enough is a bad movie (none of them are), but it just doesn't inspire me the way the others do. I have them all on video and tend to watch them reasonably regularly but after having watched this one once, I've no desire to see it again because it's just too bland. Sure, Sophie Marceau is gorgeous, and, as good an actor as Robert Carlyle is, his villain doesn't have the charisma of a Scaramanga, or Blofeld.Anyone else feel the same?p.s. I also think Tim Dalton as possibly the most authentic Bond so you might want to treat my opinions with care. p.p.s. Can't wait for Daniel Craig as Bond (particularly with the AMV8 Vantage). Maybe they can dispense with the over the top special effects for a decade or two. This plea comes after having witnessed the ZX81-style CGI effects of Brosnan windsurfing on Die Another Day, Oh Per-lease!!",The World Is Not Enough

This is a fun ride, and, alongside Tomorrow Never Dies, helps to prove that Pierce Brosnan is excellently cast as Bond.
For all those reviewers saying that the Bond franchise is getting old, that Bond's attitudes are out of place in the (nearly) 21st century, and that the series needs a huge makeover if it intends to survive, I say ""BAH.""

343,mel-138,00-Disappointment,7,26 November 1999,"One of the most anticipated movies of the year has become the most manipulative movie of the year. Pierce Brosnan is back as 007 in TWINE. He looks comfortable for the third round, but I wasn't. The film opens in Bilbao, Spain. Our hero is making a deal that invovles an oil tycoon and a bunch of rich scum. After this, it leads to a boring boat chase. When viewing this facist stunt sequence, I thought the movie was going to get better. Oh boy! Was I wrong. Trying to critique this movie wasn't hard. It's not as lurid as 'Goldeneye', but its no 'Tomorrow Never Dies'. The only merits this film has are the pipeline sequence and Sophie Marceau. Denise Richards, the second to worst Bond girl in history. **1/2",The World Is Not Enough
344,MikeT-9,"""Enough"" Is Too Much",6,6 December 1999,"Maybe it was because I was a kid when I first saw them, but the Bond films of old never seemed quite this outlandishly stupid. OK - there have always been gadgets (some ingenious, some not) and the stunts have always been a big part of the series' attraction, but come on! The opening scene, while lengthy, fast paced and exciting, is so ludicrously overdone that it plays like a parody of itself. Leslie Nielsen would seem more at home in this scene than James Bond.I guess they tried to inject some ""reality"" into the mix by making Bond ""injured"" the entire film with a dislocated collar bone (typical injury after falling a hundred feet or so). Unfortunately, this serves to make every stunt seem all the more preposterous. It really isn't necessary, and shouldn't have been part of the story. On the plus side, Brosnan makes a great Bond. He has intensity when he needs it, and can pour on the charm too. I still like Roger Moore the best, but Brosnan is really good. Too bad he couldn't have gotten the role 14 years ago when it was initially offered to him.I can't tell if this is better or worse than TND, but this ranks somewhere on a par with ""License To Kill"" or ""Live And Let Die"" - some good scenes, but overall a forgettable entry.And bring back the old music!",The World Is Not Enough
345,tcuthbertson,One of the best Bonds ever.,8,28 November 1999,"With The World Is Not Enough, Pierce Brosnan has fully developed the character of James Bond from merely the hedonistic character he has been in the past, to a thinking and feeling James Bond that responds to the pain in the situations that face him, and actually finds something other than physical gratification in the some of the gorgeous women that he beds.  As with all James Bond movies, this is a formula movie, but the formula works very well and I am glad that they have stuck with it.  The action scenes are spectacular, and they are softened by more-funny-than-usual comedy.  Changed too is the way in which women are portrayed within the movie.  As villains, they are powerful not merely for their sexual appeal (which they have a lot of), and they get their due treatment from Bond just as all of the male villains of the past.  Bond's love interests are also becoming less helpless and more intelligent and assertive. Also, the appearance of John Cleese adds depth to the comedy and it appears that we may expect to see him in further productions. All in all, this could be one of the best James Bond movies ever.  With so many good ones, it is hard to have a favorite.",The World Is Not Enough
346,AllThumbs-1,"Heavy action, Light fluffy plot",3,3 December 1999,"Very typical Bond-film.  In fact, I think I've seen some of those very same action scenes in previous films.

347,kevinwu109,Could have been an ACTION Masterpiece,8,23 July 2000,"I want to say that my favorite 007 film was GoldenEye for its exotic landscapes, great special effects, cool toys, sinister villain, and HOT bond Girls.This film could have surpassed it for its plot twists and its character development. Even Judi Dench was out and about rather than behind a desk. But they casted DENISe RIchards, who couldnt act a slight bit. You won't mistake her for a true thespian, but she was much better in Wild Things. She made the plot almost silly.The villain was also very weird. His diminuitive size and his ugliness made this film unpleasant. Bond films are supposed to be about a world of class, sophistication, urbanity and beauty, and this universal rule applies not only to BOND and his GIRLS but also to the villains, sets, etc. If i want ugly, weird, uncool villains, I'd watch the Batman series.
It's a shame. It could have been a 9 but because of Denise Richards and Robert Carlyle, it's only an enjoyable 7/10. Still an improvement over Tomorrow Never Dies. =)I pray that the next Bond continues along this line with character development, plot twists without sacrificing the action. They should also bring back old characters like Wade, and Natalia from GoldenEye. Bond forever",The World Is Not Enough
348,K_Molen,Otherwise good Bond movie ruined by bad one-liners and Denise Richard,3,23 May 2000,"I realize that part of what makes a Bond movie a Bond movie are the tongue-in-cheek one-liners, but in this particular outing the one-liners are too many and too corny. With one notable exception; (BEGIN SPOILER) When Bond cracks 'See you at the lodge' and then grins smugly after having tricked one of the snow-mobile type vehicles to drive right over a ledge. The one-liner in itself is pretty standard, what makes this my favourite part of the movie is Bond's 'what-the-f***' facial expression when the bad guy transforms his vehicle into a para-hawk and attacks Bond yet again. Priceless. (END SPOILER)Now... what about Denise Richards? I don't know why, but when I saw 'Starship Troopers' and 'Wild Things,' both in which she starred, I didn't realize what bad an actress she is. Perhaps she just got lucky, perhaps in those films she had a part that was closer to her own personality... Whatever the reason, in 'The World is Not Enough' the poor girl couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. My main complaint with her is the way she says her lines. There's no gusto, there's not emotions. It's almost as if she didn't memorize them, but is only reading them off of a monitor hid out of the audience view.The bottom line is: If you like Bond and can stand many, many corny one-liners and extremely bad acting from Ms. Richards (you can catch better performances in day-time soaps) you'll probably enjoy this movie. It certainly has a twisted villain and enough action, gadgets, pretty girls (while Denise Richards can't act, she's certainly easy on the eyes) and nice scenery to pass as a Bond flick.",The World Is Not Enough
349,neilclough,Just a Bloody Good James Bond Film,9,24 November 2020,"This is a very good James Bond film, which are not meant to be taken too seriously. Lots of action and two very attractive Bond girls. Reasonable story line, which was very prescient in 1999.",The World Is Not Enough
350,TTaipale,A film to watch if you like Bond-movies,7,21 February 2002,"Every Bond-movie is a product of its era. In the 1980´s Bond was fighting against the KGB agents and madmen trying to destroy the world with various mass destruction weapons. The Bond of the new millenium fights against the multimillionairs who have strange ideas of how to rule the world. In this film Bond´s enemy is Renard (played by the great Robert Carlyle). Like in every other Bond-film the enemy has some sort of physical uniqueness. In this one Renard is unable to feel physical pain. Renard has killed Sir Robert King, the British oil tycoon and the next target is his daughter Elektra. Bond´s job is to protect her from Renard and of course to eliminate him. I consider myself as a Bond-fan. I practially grew up watching these films and I have to say that although Sean Connery is by far the best Bond ever, Brosnan suits in the role of James Bond really well. His performance is again solid in this movie. Other great performances are done by Judie Dench as M, Robert Carlyle as Renard and John Cleese as R. Somehow Denise Richards is ok but not really believable scientist. I am not sure but I believe that John Cleese will get a bigger part in the future Bond-movies because of the death of Desmond Llewelyn. I will miss him in the upcoming movies since he was really one of the icons of these movies. All in all, The World Is Not Enough is good Bond-movie but it still lacks that certain something. 7/10",The World Is Not Enough

I rented this on VHS and thought it would make a good rainy day movie but I believe it would be good for all occasions. I never have been a huge Pierce Brosnan fan but he did a bang up job in this one. Roger Moore or Sean Conery have always been my 007 but Pierce pulled this one off with flying colors. The plot involves money hungry oilers and a crazed maniac that is bent on revenge on everyone. And of course there is a nuclear warhead involved in there somewhere. Although it is a stereotypical Bond movie the special effects and gadgets from Q make the movie a spectacular array of FX fun. My wife watched it with me and she is not a Bond fan and she liked it from start to finish. This movie was excessively cool.,The World Is Not Enough
353,NS_writings,"Classic Bond, with a twist",9,27 May 2021,"Many things can be said of 'The World Is Not Enough'. Despite the pacing is a little bit slow, the film has a beautiful cinematography and editing, and a sublime soundtrack by David Arnold that mixes melancholy with Eastern European sounds and techno influences for the action scenes, besides featuring one of the greatest main title songs written for the series, performed by Garbage and with clever instrumental interpolations in the score.But TWINE is also a very important film in the series. From this point on, with the hiring of screenwriters like Neal Purvis & Robert Wade, the film series would start to take elements from the Ian Fleming novels, particularly 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' (Bond's motto makes the title, and Elektra is a deconstruction of Tracy Bond in many aspects). Also, by hiring the late Michael Apted, the tendency of bringing drama directors began: Lee Tamahori, Marc Forster, Sam Mendes, Cary Joji Fukunaga. The women had much more prominent roles, particularly Judi Dench's M. The main plot steams directly out of a character's past and many times, the job in hand is more professional than personal. We feel sorry for the villain, we know he has feelings, that he's about to die, and -in the end- he's doing what he's doing just for love more than power or revenge.Just compare these points and see how much of this formula, Barbara Broccoli's idea of a Bond film, was repeated in 'Die Another Day' and the Daniel Craig era, notably 'Skyfall' which takes many point plots of this film. TWINE is attacked by modern film bluffs because it never leaves the Bond formula, beginning and ending as a Bond film should. It introduced these changes Mrs Broccoli wanted, but it still remained inside the boundaries of what a Bond film is.It's classic Bond, with a twist.",The World Is Not Enough
354,chelb,"Another great Bond film, 9 of 10",9,30 December 2001,"This was the 21st of 22 Bond films (counting 2 unofficial films and one currently in production).  This was the 3rd Bond movie in which Pierce Brosnan played James Bond and he is the 5th actor to do so.  This was the best Bond movie in years and I give it a 9 out of 10 rating as near excellent. The teaser involved Bond fighting thugs and escaping with a suitcase of cash by jumping and using a rope tied to an unconscious thug to escape a building in Bilbao, Spain.  Later, this suitcase of cash explodes at British intelligence headquarters killing a good friend of M's.  The cash was rigged to explode.  This is the last movie with Desmond Llewellyn as Q.  Except for the two unofficial Bond films he was in all of them except for the first one, Dr. No and also one in the 70's, Live and Let Die, when the producers made the mistake of not writing him in because they wanted to reduce the gadget idea.  They got so many complaints that they quickly asked him back to be in all the Bond films after that.  John Cleese, of Monty Python and Silverado, is in this one as his aide, R, and will be a hilarious and supremely appropriate replacement for Q.  The VHS of this film has a video tribute to Mr. Llewellyn. Bond is sent to the Baku oil region of Azerbaijan near the Caspian Sea and north of Iran to look after the killed man's, Mr. King, daughter.  He goes on adventures into Khazakstan and rescues the American physicist, Dr. Christmas Jones and briefly battles the evil Renard who is a terrorist with a bullet embedded in his head from 009.  This wound makes him resistant to pain.  Valentin Zukovsky, an ex-KGB agent and current entrepreneur, courtesy of Reagan's ending of the Cold War, makes his second appearance in a Bond film as a fairweather friend to Bond and he helps Bond.  Robbie Coltrane give a great performance as him but without the great lines of his first appearance in Goldeneye.  Renard and others (I will not spoil anything) steal plutonium to blow up a pipeline and a city and Bond must stop them. The villains in the picture are great and I give them a 10.  Q is great in his last appearance in a Bond film.  Brosnan is great as usual.  The plot is very exciting and nervewracking and thoughtful and well written and I give that a 9.  The effects are great but there is too much machine gun play as usual so I give effects a 9.  Chicago area born actress Denise Richards is a beautiful and sensitive female lead and has a great figure.  Paris area born actress Sophie Marceau is also beautiful and it is interesting to compare their two personalities when you first get to know them.  It is a contrast in American straightforwardness, sass, and forthrightedness versus European sensuality, femininity, grace, and sulking.  It is really a wonderful comparison of women of two cultures, at least before some things go awry later in the film.  The lead song was not that good and I give it a 6 of 10.  The soundtrack was good and I give it a 7 of 10.  This was the first Bond movie to end with the James Bond Theme and not a song.  Overall, the movie maintained a high level of excitement, spontenaity, creativity, and freshness and was a near excellent 9 out of 10.  That is my rating for this movie and I recommend you see it.",The World Is Not Enough
355,RasAlBane,Underrated great Bond adventure,8,7 January 2015,"To begin with I'm not going to argue about Denise Richards because we all know she wasn't right for the role, but she doesn't have a lot of screen time or even bother me that much. And definitely not enough to ruin the movie heck The World Is Not Enough. We have a great and thrilling pre credit sequence that is also tide with what is about to come. A great boat chase along the river. It kicks the film of to a great start. The introduction that the villain gets is great, he doesn't arrive until 40 minutes in and its done nicely to build up for the character. Elektra and Bond have a great chemistry that gives this movie so much for the ending of their relationship, or more even the ending that she gets. And when Bond finds out that she is truly on the wrong team was nicely done. It was also good to see Robbie Coltrane re praise his role in the movie, he had more to do here than in Goldeneye and that was appreciated as was John Cleese cameo. Bottom line is this is such a well told story that makes sense and with some great performances from all the main cast except for yes i don't have to say it. This movie is very under appreciated, it certainly belongs among the best in the series. Some people complain that there is to little action but the action is there for a reason this time! we don't need more. People have also commented on that it has little to do with Bond, heck we see who Bond really is in this film. How cold he is when he kills of Electra.. its one of the best scenes in the history of the franchise. Bond has had the enough and the world even is not enough.. he even said it himself. Elektra King is a very strong character in this film how she fell in love with her kidnapper and is angry with her father for not doing more to get her back, M even gets tied more in to the plot than in other films except Skyfall and gets kidnapped and i that was interesting.",The World Is Not Enough

Pierce Brosnan do an excellent personification of Bond; is perfect because he can be irresistible to woman and also a great killer.....simply brilliant.

358,Ronos,One of the series strongest entries,9,26 November 2000,"Since my favorite entries in this film series often differ with critics and film scholars, I don't expect them to concur with my assertion that TWINE is one of the strongest entries in the long running 007 film series. I like Pierce Brosnan's Bond. He's been able to finally get rid of the whole invincible superman motif that has plagued the franchise since Moonraker while preserving Bond's mystique. Instead of trying to top Connery and Moore, he's able to marry both their strengths with his own style. Though I have long thought that the producers should let John Woo and other Hong Kong directors take a crack at the franchise, dramatic director/photographer Michael Apted does a surprisingly good job here. In addition to being abld to bring out the best in his actors, Apted's background in photography comes in handy during the action scenes, making up for his lack of experience in the genre. The film also has a great score, too. If we can't have John Barry back, then David Arnold, who also scored Tomorrow Never Dies, is the next best thing. The film also benefits by the casting of Robert Carlyle as the villain Renard. Instead of the pun-spewing lunatic we would likely get in a non-Bond actioner, Carlyle channels cinema's greatest madman: Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. There are visual similarities between Renard and Kurtz as well, though Carlyle is obviously a lot slimmer. And the early scene that gives us background info on Renard is remiscient of the briefing on Kurtz at the beginning of AN. As for the women, Sophie Marceau is wonderful as Elektra King. She is able to do something most of us wish we could do, she takes whatever she wants and does it in a way so that people think she's a real nice person. Alot of people have complained about Denise Richards, but she does fine here considering that she had two roles to fill: not only was she the ""good girl"", but she also had to take the position filled by Jack Wade in the two previous films. However, when they called her Dr. Jones I couldn't help but think of Bond's famous stateside counterpart. Tomb Raider fans will notice the outfit she wears at the nuclear facility is very Lara Croft, who by the way would be an ass kicking Bond girl. Lastly, this film makes a great encomium to Desmond Llwelyn, who tragically died in an auto accident weeks after this release.All in all, Pierce Brosan's best Bond film, at least until John Woo directs him.",The World Is Not Enough
359,bigmike-4,The best Bond film in years...,7,27 November 1999,"TWINE has received mixed reviews from the press, so I was a bit skeptical after being let down by the previous Bond films. But, as always, I went in with an open mind.What I saw surprised me. Quite simply, this is the best Bond film since License To Kill. We see a Bond that is a bit more raw and gritty. Sure, we've got all the great gadgets that we've come to know and love.. but all aspects of the film are first rate, resulting in a great action/adventure film.As far as the actors go, I'll sum it up quickly: Pierce Brosnan is at his best, Denise Richards isn't nearly as bad as people make her out to be, Sophie Marceau is PERFECT as the villianess, Robert Carlyle is the best Bond villian in years (although not nearly as good as Goldfinger or Sanchez), and the MI6 gang live up to standards.One nice addition that I really got a kick out of is Q's (Desmond Llewelyn) replacement, R, played by John Cleese. I can't wait to see him in future installments of the Bond franchise. :)All in all, TWINE is well done and, as I said before, the best Bond in years.

360,Bad PR,Not enough is right.,6,4 June 2000,"James Bond used to be cool. Watching the Pierce Brosnan episodes reminds me of the invasion of the body snatchers- He looks like James Bond. He talks like James Bond. He even likes the same drink as James Bond... But this is just not the 007 I've grown to know and love. T.W.I.N.E. was just another vacant, forgettable action movie with lots of guns and 'splosions. I honestly didn't care about anything that happened in the movie, or if any of the characters lived or died. (Except for valentin -he was cool.)

Dench is so wonderful in other films, but her M was written rather dim. Her character got some action, but was not developed well enough. John Cleese's talent was completely wasted.I figured out the bad girl/daughter as soon as she was introduced, why didn't M? This one issue is just one symptom of the poor writing in this Bond. The sexual innuendos, historically silly, were no longer clever, they were just crude.The female cast was one of the worst ever. I've heard Ms. Richards and Ms. Marceau have better performances in other films.  Ms. Richards looks barely out of High School and is not convincing as a PhD senior scientist. The writers did neither of the women favors with their insipid dialogue.  If Dr. Jones did not want jokes about her name, why not just use Dr. Jones or Chris?Casting people should take a clue from the other Brosnan film last year, Thomas Crown Affair, and cast more mature women in some roles.By the way, what brain trust thought they should kill off the Russian, a great repeating character?A real let down after the previous Bond film.",The World Is Not Enough
362,hartje,"Solid, but not remarkable",6,19 November 1999,"Date Viewed: 11/19/99After having unwittingly aided in the murder of one of M's acquaintances, James Bond is sent to protect the victim's daughter, Elektra (Sophie Marceau) from suffering the same fate.I believe this was a solid Bond film but, as with any of them these days, there were a few areas where it fell a bit short. First, it was ridiculously easy to figure out the plot ""twist"" very early in the movie. I'm not used to figuring out things before Bond does.
Second, I'm not really sure what the diabolical plot was supposed to accomplish beyond making gobs of money and satisfying an ego. Maybe you can't save the world from nuclear destruction at the hands of SPECTRE every other year, though. I will say this film has a better story than the ridiculous ""greedy media baron"" story of ""Tomorrow Never Dies.""
To be honest, I think the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter because I really can't remember huge chunks of it. Even while watching, I would sometimes notice that Bond and nuclear bombshell Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) were in a tight situation and for the life of me I couldn't remember how they got into it.Richards (""Starship Troopers,"" ""Wild Things"") is another story. She is very attractive and that fact is flaunted in every outfit she appears in. Facially, she has character, and her body displays what I call the ""hard curves"" of the 90s. Her acting is coming along. As for Marceau, I never really did find her that likeable, although she was sort of a throwback to women the early Roger Moore Bond films. I give it a 50/50 chance we find out she used to be a man.Now for the good. Richards was thoroughly pleasing to look at. Sometimes it was to distraction and I missed a couple of explosions, but it beat having to look at Teri Hatcher. The performances were solid, with Judi Dench having a larger role as M, and Q introducing his replacement (played by John Cleese) who Bond nicknames ""R.""The opening action sequence probably ranks among the best of the Bond films, the credits were classic and the title track was performed very well by Garbage. The locales were in that alphabet soup region of the Mediterranean that most people really aren't that familiar with, but Bond did find time t o both escape on snow skis AND hit the casino.The supporting players performed admirably, although the henchmen aren't as interesting or fleshed out as in the past.Overall, I feel a little like a dinosaur in that I find the modernization of James Bond films to have sacrificed a little of their lustre. Evil, insane, wannabe dictators have been exchanged for corporate CEOs; the Bond women not only fly the helicopter but almost become equal partners in the hair-raising situations. Maybe I'd like to go back to the days where the female's tactical usefulness consisted of her secreting the solex cassette down the back of her bikini bottoms while Bond creates a distraction.
This was a solid James Bond film ... not as good as ""Goldeneye,"" but definitely better than ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" Brosnan again delivers the goods and Richards adds a freshness that would, frankly, be nice to see in future Bond films. I'm just not sure the stories are good enough for Brosnan to really break out as the best Bond since Sean Connery. I believe he is, but a little more story work would make these films nearly as memorable as Connery's.And, in the name of all that is good and just, bring back the hollowed-out volcano lairs. - AJH",The World Is Not Enough
363,erthnvesl,Brosnan Finds a Home Between Fire and Ice,8,22 November 1999,"After Roger Moore left the 007 franchise, MGM approached Pierce Brosnan for the role in The Living Daylights.  Brosnan could not get out of his Remington Steele contract and they went with Timothy Dalton instead.  The franchise has been trying to find itself ever since.  When Brosnan finally came aboard for Goldeneye, the film was dark and bereft of a central plot. Tomorrow Never Dies went in the opposite direction, featuring more gadgets and explosions than we've seen in a long time, with cardboard supporting roles and no development for the Bond character either. Bond splits the difference with The World Is Not Enough, and returns to the genuine mix of action, intrigue and character that made classic Bond so memorable.  Brosnan is going a long way in crafting Bond in his image, mixing the intensity of Dalton with the carefree panache of Roger Moore to find a consumate image we've not seen since Sean Connery.  Sophie Marceau is the blueprint Bond girl, equal parts sexiness, elegance and at the same time both fiercely independent and a slave to Bond's charm.  Desmond Llewelyn makes his likely last appearance as Q, and introduces his up-and-comer John Cleese.  Judi Dench shines as M, and has a larger and deeper role in this film than Ms of the past.  The plot moves along smoothly, the action scenes are intense, the actors are smashing, and the characters are (mostly) well-developed.  The climax, with Bond and Dr. No #19 fighting aboard a sinking submarine, is vintage Bond. Now the downside.  First of all, MORE Q!  You can never have too much Q, and his appearance in this particular film is painfully short for a swan song.  Robert Carlyle's character is well set-up, both in his complex character and in the standard exotic debilitating injury, but like many Bond fans, I miss SPECTRE-type villains for whom the world is TRULY not enough. He's good, but he's no Goldfinger.  The central premise in general, control of oil flow through south central Asia, falls a little short of worldwide domination, though admittedly it's better than domination of the TV rankings.  Denise Richards is ENTIRELY forgettable as Dr. Christmas Jones, which I find a doubly ironic name, not only for the obvious Christmas puns that emerge, but also that Sean Connery did a half dozen Bond films, then went on to play a Dr. Jones of his own (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). She is one of the hottest Bond chicks ever but absolutely unbelievable as a nuclear physicist.  Her character is flat and exudes little real intelligence, and she is followed through the film by her companion Captain Obvious.  Case in point, as Dr. Jones and Bond work feverishly to defuse a nuclear bomb, Bond notes that the screwheads on the warhead have been stripped.  Her reply, ""Someone's been tampering with the bomb.""  REALLY?!? Those screws didn't strip themselves?!?  I guess it DOES take a nuclear scientist to figure these things out.  Also, the action sequences are all drawn out interminably, particularly the warehouse scene.  We all like chases and explosions, but the director didn't seem to be content until every conceivable prop had been blown up, which seems to take up to ten minutes in certain instances. All this aside, this is one of the best Bond films to come down the pipe in a LONG time.  That delicate balance of action and story works nicely, the characters are outstanding, ESPECIALLY Bond and M, but I give credit to Elektra and Renard for doing a great job with what they were given. Brosnan himself finds that happy medium between cold-hearted agent, fiery lover and a boyish charm that masks the scars from years of pain and loss that are etched into his face.  A home between fire and ice.",The World Is Not Enough
364,eb_redbaron,the best bond in recent years,9,24 August 2000,"thanks to great actress sophie marceau (and the moving portrait of robert carlyle) this is one of the best bond installments of the last decade. here the villain has an emotional depht, resulting from a traumatic past. this automatically results in 007 also having to deal with deeper emotions himself than in most of his outings. the only drawback is the part of the science-bimbo which only enhances the contrast between an intelligent woman´s part and the traditional one in bond movies.",The World Is Not Enough
365,westernbuff,Good but not Brosnan's best,6,11 June 2008,"No way is it better than Goldeneye, but it is light years ahead of Tomorrow Never Dies and Die Another Day. I liked the theme song. Opening scenes were a bit long, though the part with Bond leaping onto the rope dangling from the hot air balloon is spectacular. The actors who played Renard and Elecktra (sorry I can't remember their names right now) are very good. Especially Renard. Who is more intimidating than a man who feels no pain? Valentin Zukovsky had some great lines (to Dr. Jones, ""Who are you? And how did you get in? Let me call Security, and congratulate them!"" and to Bond, ""Why do I have a feeling I'm not carrying enough insurance?""). MoneyPenny had some great lines toward the beginning too. This is not a weak script folks. If there are any weak parts it is weak acting. I don't know why so many people are tough on Denise Richards. I loved her in this one. So shes not convincing as a nuclear physicsist.....so what? since when did Bond girls have to be smart all the time, and when did smarts come before looks for them in the series? If you are going for technicalities or serious subjects, this is not for you, go watch In The Line Of Fire or Dances With Wolves.Parts I didn't like included where Bond and the others are talking in Scotland about Renard. Again I find it not to be a weak script, no, it is weak acting, particularly by M. Also the one-liners get a little tiring like at the end with the scene of Bond and Christmas.Not a bad film,especially after watching the entry before and after it.",The World Is Not Enough
366,veronicapranjic,Brilliant...almost.,7,4 May 2015,"Michael Apted was chosen as a man who would direct a Bond movie because they wanted to add more complexity and emotion to Bond. Did the succeed? The answer is almost. This movie,in many ways seems to be similar to On Her Majesty's Secret Service-a movie where Bond marries. they both feature skii chase sequence,TWINE opens in swiss bankar's office and there is a similar scene in OHMSS as well. This movies also gets its title from OHMSS-Bond family motto ""The World is Not Enough"" was first mentioned in that movie. But most of all they feature a relationship that is more genuine than usual. the are many similarities between Tracy and Elektra-both are excellent on skiis and seem to be strong women while deep down they are vulnerable and insecure. Of course-we think that of Elektra before we find out she is in fact a villain. It's a great twist-heck,a brilliant one. Elektra for my money is an absolute best character that ever graced the series. At first we see her as a strong young woman who has the opinion that ""there is no point in living if you can't feel alive"". But when she gets traped she goes through a panic attack. Bond starts to sense she is a remarkable person but a badly damaged one. The story hints thay her and Bond are attracted because they are both wounded. Bond hids it under his boyish charms. We actually see more dimensions of Bond in this one. At its best moments movie shows Bond caught up between his duty to protect the heiress and his own growing attraction. The love scene is for my money the best one there ever was. The screen just cracks with energy every time Sophie and Brosnan are together. Apted commented on the love scene:""There are no light quips and puns. This is the real deal."" Bond seems to be quite tender with Elektra. At one point I got the impression he wants to cuddle. He genuely wants to know how Elektra survived the kidnapping. He seems to be affected by the story. When she asks him what does he do to survive he answers:""I take pleasure-in great beauty"" this was first and foremost a compliment for Elektra at that point but Bond takes great pleasure from beauty of life- luxury. He escapes the sense of danger that way. It's a wonderful line spoken during a wonderful scene. Aside that we have a great pre-title sequence and opening in swiss bankar's office. Bond is cool,highly skilled professional with sophistication and charisma that just needs to be admired. Brosnan is brilliant. So the first hour is fantastic. but then the problem comes. Denise Richards as nuclear scientist. Named Christmas simply so they could make a pun at the end. A huge huge mistake. Even though Bond is supposed to be hurt deeply by the revelation that Elektra is more than she seems the ending simply undercuts any truly emotional and complexed feeling. I beg Apted to explain himself. It's like he wanted to do something different but he wasn't smart enough to make the ending right- Bond actually being affected by it all. Just like her name implies Elektra's death should in one hand be a tragedy. Her behaviour was a product of things she went through. It seems if she received proper help and care she wouldn't got the point she came. Even M seems to acknowledge that much when Renard says how Elektra is worth fifty of him. Elektra is an incredible character-truly unique and truly fascinating. She is so sure Bond wouldn't kill her because he would miss her. But Bond does kill her-in cold blood commenting:""I never miss"" it's a stunning scene and the moment after that is like that as well. Bond comes closer and touches her face like her mourns over her. M vitneses it and Judi Dench is incredible. But Christmas Jones and the ending undercut any sense that Bond truly cared or was affected by her even though earlier in the film and in the last moment between Bond and Elektra it seems that way. The ending is in Roger Moore style- Bond being caught with a girl and doing a pun.Michael Apted needs to explain this tonal mismatch. A shame because for my money this could have been THE VERY BEST Bond movie ever. That's right. For performances-Brosnan IS Bond,Sophie is incredible and Judi Dench is great- as always.Denise on the other hand is awful. There is absolutely no other room for any other Bond girl aside Elektra in this movie and the presence of a supposedly brilliant nuclear scientist who wanders around in hot pants showing her tattoos is one fatal mistake-it could only be described like that. and the torture scene was brilliant. ""You should have killed me when you had the chance-but you couldn't not me not the woman you loved."" But the movie provides a secondary designated Bond girl...Apted...I am waiting for an explanation.",The World Is Not Enough
367,McWoop,The WORST Bond film I have ever seen... and I've seen License to Kill...,1,4 February 2000,"Oh boy, where oh where to begin?  First off... the she-assassin in the opening sequence... she was awesome, then she died.  She took her terrible secret to the grave.  I think she's the only one that knew why anyone would want to be in such a horrible, horrible movie, and now she's dead. Secondly, Christmas Jones.  Denise Richards is beautiful, she was great in Drop Dead Gorgeous, but in TWINE, she proves that you do need to actually act to be a Bond girl, a decent one that you don't yell at in the middle of the auditorium wishing she would get blown up...  You can't just show up on the set, say ""I'm a Bond Girl! Do my make up and now tell me how far you want me to bend over in my tubetop and short-shorts!!!  Oh yeah, do I have any lines today?""  A good Bond girl is, well... not Christmas Jones.  I don't know if it was the character of Christmas or the acting of Denise which sucked.  I doubt it's only her dialogue that blows.  Third, the dialogue/witty puns/stupid, stupid jokes.  There were too many to get into... I thought the innuendos in Bond movies were supposed to be intelligent, obscure... not blatantly obvious and focused on like a US spy satelite focuses on Mararet Thatcher naked on a cold day.  They were too obvious, is what I am trying to say... just look at the memorable quotes for this movie and you'll get a sense of what I am talking about...  FOURTH... A WASTE OF ANOTHER FABULOUS VILLAIN AND ACTOR... Robert Carlyle plays Renard, and as the trailer gets us all excited about... he's got a bullet lodged in the part of the brain which, as we learned from The Waterboy, is responsible for our aggressive behavior, and at the same time, Renard can't feel anything.  Now, after watching the trailer, one would expect to see an incredible fight between Bond and Renard, with Bond repeatedly like, stabbing, shooting, punching, crotch-kicking, something... but, we get nothing.  Renard gets some glass stuck in his hand and doesn't realize it...wow.  NEAT.  I could drink a bunch of vodka and do the same damn thing. This aspect was one of the most disappointing, almost embarrasing... I have never been so upset.     Now, the only saving grace in the movie, beside John Cleese and the farewell to Q, is Sophie Marceau... she's attractive... Yay.  There's at least fifty or so attractive women in the world.  AT LEAST. Why her?  Oh, she's French.  At least she's not Canadian. Don't see this one.  Rent Goldeneye, or, my personal favorite, Octopussy.",The World Is Not Enough
368,Daniel Johnson,We've all had enough.,5,1 December 1999,"After high hopes this turns out to be a big let down. The main problem with The World is not enough is the action sequences are very poor. The boat chase at the beginning is bond at its best but the following action scenes fail to deliver. The action scenes were never built up and as a result lost any tension and surprisingly never generated any excitement (apart from the opening sequence). As for the end sequence well it really was tiresome and not dramatic or exciting one little bit. Its a shame the opening scene couldn't have been the climax to the film.On other fronts the actual story holds up quite well and this is coupled with good performances from Marceau, Robert Carlyle and Judi Dench. Brosnan is making the bond role his own, he looks smooth but looks as though he can beat the living daylights (pardon the pun) out of anyone. But it can't be denied there is something missing from TWINE. Perhaps after a few weeks when the so called real bond fans have calmed down a little bit they will realise TWINE is just average.Goldeneye still remains Brosnans best bond as it was more playful with some classic bond scenes such as the bungee jump and the tank chase. I don't know if its just me but its about time the bond franchise was given a real overhaul from top to bottom.By the end of TWINE it was starting to get a little tiresome and the sight of Denise Richards trying to act was embarrassing to say the least, lets just say her two best friends must have won her the role. The next bond should be given to a younger director and maybe the resulting film will seem a little more fresh. Overall 5/10.",The World Is Not Enough
369,forsaken999,WOW!!!,10,25 November 1999,"I just got out of The World is Not Enough and I only had one problem with it, Denise Richards.  When I first heard a year ago that they wanted to cast the two-timing babe of Starship Troopers for this role I thought, nah, never. But they did!  Leaving the fact that she cannot act out of this, she is not a Bond girl!  Bond girls are supposed to have charme!!  Something like Sophie Marceau has, now there was a Bond girl.  As for the rest of the film, it was what I call a holy cow movie (for lack of using words my mother wouldn't want to see), otherwise said, I spent the whole movie saying ""Holy cow!!!"", ""Holy cow!!!"" at all the action sequences.  An avid Bond fan I can truly say that this is one of the best because only now, with current pyrotechnic technologie could these Bond action scenes be filmed.  Like the explosive debut which was like it's own movie.  The story was not as good as Goldeneye (006 betraying Bond because he is a Lienz-Cossack) but the action was a lot more fast paced.  As for the bad guy, Renard (fox in french, which no one could pronounce right, not even Sophie Marceau who is French) was excellent but not as good as Trevelyan, someone who forcefully was better than Bond because he was at MI6 longer (006) so the perfect bad guy. Pierce Brosnan just plain did another excellent job with this movie, like Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies and though alot don't agree, he is the best Bond, being more naturally sophisticated, suave and debonaire than Sean Connery (whom I like second best).  I just don't how they'll top this.",The World Is Not Enough
370,pap25,Heartfelt Bond movie,9,30 July 2012,"It's nice to revisit this end of the millennium spectacular blockbuster made in an age when actual humor, chemistry among cast and romance in movies weren't as maligned as they are today and were actually appreciated.After complaints of how formulaic the franchise had become and the less than impressive reception of Tomorrow never dies, the Bond franchise once again ran the risk of remaining stuck in the past and to look plain ridiculous at a time when movies like the Matrix, the Sixth Sense and the Blair Witch Project explored new ground and wowed audiences all over the world, a deeper Bond movie seemed demanded.The fascinatingly titled ""The World is not Enough"" expands on the Bond formula. It's amazing to see action taking place in London for a change and see M -How dared they waste such a class act like Judi Dench in Goldeneye and Tomorrow never dies- Q and the rest of MI6 being more involved not only for the sake of it, like it could have easily been done but actually play an integral part of a convincing story which can be felt wasn't just pulled up someone's ass but actually was worked on and taken time with for it is congruent and pays great attention to detail. The film is further enhanced by exotic, beautiful locations and a mesmerizing score. It's had such an impact, and raised the bar to such heights that M has played a consistently big role in every Bond movie since.This film requires several viewings to comprehend and appreciate. I could write the many reasons why this film is underrated but it's best when discovered personally for it is a really moving experience. Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle are mesmerizing. Pierce Brosnan is effortlessly flawless and smoothly effective and is given the chance to show Bond's vulnerable side which he does perfectly and subtly. Robbie Coltrane, Goldie, Samantha Bond and Q provide great comic relief and Denise Richards is just there as eye candy and appears way late in the movie so I personally did not mind her, Pierce Brosnan seems to have guided her and prevented her from being an even bigger disaster. The writers only fault was not expanding her character or even helping poor Denise for she was given cringe inducing dialogue and by far the worst lines in the movie. I honestly believe she could have pulled it off if she had been older.This was a risky and thought provoking bond movie not the bland Casino Royale.",The World Is Not Enough

Pity the producers thought so. Innuendo was made for Bond; Bond was not made for innuendo. Casting Cleese is a mistake. the comedic element is again given centre stage rather being kept in the wings, so to speak.Brosnan does try his hardest, and this is to be cummendid. Coltrane as Zukovsky is excellent. However, Denise Richard's acting leaves much to be desired. she and Marceau who is miscast - sink the film. Unfortunately her Frenchiness is all too evident plus she has very littl chemistry with Carlyle - who isn't bad as the villain but is under-written which detracts badly and adds t the film's incoherence. A very promising start though Maria Grazia Cucinotta is all too fleeting- pity, she'd'v' lifted the film no end I daresay. But the bathos overtakes... the action sequences are more set pieces rather than augmenting the overall plot - which is little existent. This picture doesn't care for the viewer much, I mean taking them to exotic sunny locations that ooze with espionagy atmosphere (I must ask did someone forget that JB is a actually a 'spy'?)

Let's hope this is a good portent for future James Bond films in the new century.Pierce Brosnan is FANTASTIC as James Bond and this is now more his character than Sean Connery's, but it will be such a shame if he gives up playing the character after one more film. Nice to see M with such a good part, and although by no means awful, the only weaker elements were Denise Roberts and Robert Carlyle, but neither was THAT bad, just sidelined to the shadows by the performances of Brosnan, Dench and obviously Marceau.Definetly in my Top.3 James Bond films, maybe even No.1 or No.2.Go and watch the film now if you haven't !!!",The World Is Not Enough

Sure, there are the usual action sequences, but they don't come on in a non-stop burst as Tomorrow Never Dies; nor are the sequences as creative.The villains are not as sinister, and the overall ambience of the movie is not as intense. Seems to me also, that if you can't feel pain, then damage to the medulla oblongata would likely be so severe as to make sex highly difficult/meaningless. The theme song is uninspired and uninspiring. Even the incidental music doesn't stand out.Overall, a watchable 007 movie, but not something that will make me watch it again or wait in agony for the DVD release.",The World Is Not Enough
376,marsh-9,This movie was dull and boring,1,1 December 1999,"This movie was very difficult for me to sit through.  I am sorry, but the action shots were very inferior.What was so great about the Sean Connery James Bond movies is that you could escape into a lush film, european atmosphere, many scenes of around the world which took you far far away in a glamorous venue.  This movie did not have any of those attributes except for two rooms with nice decor.  That was it for me.The backdrop for the nuclear laboratory was the tunnel that went under the water that was built several years ago.  Everyone had already seen it.  I could not believe that was the best they could do on this movie.The movie was excruciatingly long with the same old comebacks from the almost gone James Bond in a pinch.  There was the same old ticking away of the bomb with ever so unrealistic situations.  At least with Sean Connery's unbelievable ""get-aways"", you accepted them with delight because of the scenery, cinematography, and Sean's wonderful sense of humor (only because he really was gorgeous).Please do not waste your time on this movie.

377,alexthomas28,"Poor,poor entry in the Bond franchise....",5,26 June 2002,"This has got to be the worst Bond film ever made. I agree, the film had a good plot unlike the ridiculous plot in Tomorrow never Dies, but the plot was completely wasted by poor direction,tongue in cheek acting,poor music,poor locations and extremely depressing set peices which were very badly lit. The whole movie was dark in some way or the other....I agree the plot was a bit dark and Electra was quite complex.Look at the locations in Thunderball,Goldfinger,Moonraker,The spy who loved me,Octopussy,Tomorrow never dies and you will understand what I am talking about.The mood is never depressing in a Bond movie,but this movie was extremely depressing. Badly lit set peices seem to be the norm in this movie.Take for instance the mine set,the pier climax, the submarine docking set in Instanbul and we see that it is nowhere near the sets like You only live twice,Goldeneye,The spy who loved me or Moonraker. Fans except a flamboyant Bond and not the Bond that pierce Brosnan plays in TWINE. He never sees to be relaxed and is always searching for the right words to say,yet Pierce Brosnan seems to have settled down in the role and is quite impressive at times. David Arnold's music in Tomorrow never Dies was very impressive and reminded fans of the John Barry era,but David Arnold's decision to go in for electronics in TWINE ,instead of the truly original jazzy James bond style is very poor and wasteful.A very poor effort by David Arnold in TWINE and he must have lost a lot of fans with TWINE.Hope he goes back to the John Barry roots again if he is offered to compose the next James Bond movie. Except for the very,very good boat chase on the thames and the title song, the movie is a utter waste of time.Most of my friends were dozing after the first half an hour.I havent seen anyone doing that in a Bond movie at all. I hope the producers get it right the next time around and dont disappoint Bond fans.In my view,TWINE is a wasted effort on a good script and is the worst Bond movie ever made.",The World Is Not Enough

Not only is robery carlyle embarassing as the villain, judi dench is once again playing M as somebody who doesn't like violence and is irritatingly frightened to let Bond do his job. Although Bond is not always believable, Denise Richards is ridiculously unplausable.

379,mhendrickx,Brosnan's best performance as 007,7,10 December 2015,"Where to begin? First of all, the casting for this Bond film was absolutely top draw. Add to that the exciting action scenes, and we can say this is a Bond movie that was hard to beat for the follow up (and in my opinion Die another day didn't do better than The world is not enough).Although not everybody will agree, I think Sophie Marceau did a fantastic job as Electra. In my opinion she's been one of the most interesting characters in a Bond movie till now. Also Robert Carlyle, although short lived, plays an excellent Bond villain. Both believable and sympathetic. Last but not least: Robbie Coltrane did a very, very good job again as he performed Valentin Zukovsky for the second time.The opening scene in this Bond film is, in my opinion, one of the best opening scenes in a Bond film ever. Certainly, the next few Bond films that came after The world is not enough couldn't quite match with this fantastic piece of the film. This also shows that director Michael Apted has the skills for dealing with these parts of a movie, and it goes along with an excellent soundtrack.As mentioned in the title, it was Brosnan's best Bond film, and the film itself remains (untill today) one of the most loved films amongst the hardcore Bond fans.",The World Is Not Enough

Don't get me wrong, I am a Bond fan.  And I did enjoy the film.  But it really seemed that The World is Not Enough was just a string of silly situations that Bond has been through before.There were some clever plot points.  And LOTS of potential.  In Tomorrow Never Dies we saw Pierce Brosnan add some depth to Bond.  We saw Bond switch from killing machine to regretful human to killing machine.  With 007 and M both operating out of revenge, this film had even greater potential to dig into the psychology of our favorite secret agent.But it didn't.  Instead it put Bond on skis or in a boat that can't stay in the water, begging me to ask, ""Haven't I seen this before?""",The World Is Not Enough
382,StephenC,A pleasant surprise,10,20 November 1999,"I'll admit that after watching the disastrously lame ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", and hearing the same list of responsible parties on tap to write and direct this next installment of the Bond series, I wasn't expecting much.  But as it drew closer to release, the previews looked decent, so I decided I'd probably go see it anyway.  Also, I was pressured by a total Bond freak friend of mine :)  So we watched it on opening night.  Suffice it to say, it was a pleasant surprise.This movie wastes no time getting into the action (it takes roughly one minute for it to start, and goes on for about another 10 minutes, all this before the opening credits).  It holds this momentum quite well.  The story, unlike its predecessor TND, is at least quasi-believable and quite well done, and unravels in near-perfect fashion. > It definitely competes with the quality of the early Bonds (although it would lose, it still would compete :)  I won't spoil the plot this time around (like my review of TND did), because this time I don't have anything to complain about.  They did a pretty good job.There are a few lulls in the action, and the plot does seem to lose its way a little when it hits these points, but it recovers quickly.  Action fans won't be disappointed.  The stunts and action scenes are particularly good in this one.  The more dramatic scenes still hold onto enough coherence to keep things flowing (unlike TND, which I don't believe ever had a flow). But the focus is still on action, which isn't my favorite angle for a Bond film, but it works well here.Finally, we have a Bond worthy of the precedent set by Sean Connery.  In his third appearance as Bond, Pierce Brosnan performs extremely well and has finally settled into the role, giving an excellent delivery and performance. All the other acting is excellent as well, just as in the other two Brosnan Bond films (yes, even TND had good acting even with bad plot), although I do agree with several others here that Denise Richards seems to have been contrivedly thrown in merely to increase the film's T&A factor.  But at least she's fun to look at.  Excellent performances by everyone else. Monty Python veteran John Cleese has but a brief role in this film, but his few lines are absolutely hilarious.  I can't want to see more of him as the successor to ""Q"", as this film hinted he would be entering this role.  And of course, all the MI6 usuals are right on target.  ""M"" sports a particularly crucial plot point in this film, and Judi Dench delivers it well.Also in a repeat command performance is composer David Arnold, who has fully surpassed the excellence of his previous Bond score to TND.  I bought the soundtrack immediately after watching the movie.  It is nothing less than perfection, featuring another excellent blend of orchestra and synth that we first heard on the TND soundtrack.  Only the vintage Bond scores from John Barry surpass this.  The opening score (co-written and performed by Garbage) is also very good, once again homaging back to the Bond themes of old.  No shortages in the music department for this film.All in all, I think the penance for ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" has been paid in full, if not overpaid.  This is definitely a good film that shouldn't disappoint.",The World Is Not Enough

384,Ian Mc,007's Confident return to form,8,28 November 1999,"The World is Not Enough (Bond 19) is a classy thriller, and a worthy addition to the canon of Bond. Pierce Brosnan has never looked more comfortable as the British Government's most famous agent - dangerous, dashing and deadly.  In this installment Bond deals with the murky world of International terrorism and the Oil industry. Assigned to look after the daughter of a wealthy heiress, Sophie Marceau, he gets more than he bargained for.Robert Carlyle, one of the UK's rising stars, gives us the menacing Renard - a  terrorist with an invulnerability to pain and a chip on his shoulder. Robbie Coltrane also returns as Valentin Zubotsky, the ex-KGB agent who tangled with 007 in 'Goldeneye'. With a guest role from Judi Dench as M, alongside Samantha Bond, Michael Kitchen, Colin Salmon, John Cleese and the fantastic Desmond Llewelyn as Q, the writers have built a great support team around Brosnan's Bond - and this is as it should be, Bond was never a man to work alone.Locations take us all over, but the best sequences for me were on snow and water.  The Ski sequence with Marceau and Brosnan was stunning, and the pre-credits chase from Vauxhall Cross (London's real MI6 HQ) up the river Thames to the Millennium Dome was classic Bond - pacy, death-defying and keep me on the edge of my seat.The writer's showed their knowledge of the character, with details of Bond's world coming through - and the title, as 007 says, is the Bond family Motto! They make a subtle mix of humour and action, yet also find room to give Bond a darker edge and some vulnerability.  Of course 007 could not get through without the women and the bad puns, and both are in evidence with Marceau, Maria Grazia Cucinotta, Denise Richards as a nuclear bomb expert (really!) and Serena Scott-Thomas as a MI6's Doctor with an impressive bedside manner!Music duties again from David Arnold were again well executed and the title song is a belter from Grungy loop experts Garbage.Director Michael Apted has provided a stylish film, perhaps one of the best looking Bond's in some years.

Strong performances, a classic Bond formula, a not-so-indestructible Bond actually showing emotion-even YELLING (something I don't think Bond's ever done in any other movie), a villain with a Bondian gimmick (but not a cliche, two-domensional mastermind), plus two of the most beautiful women in the Bond saga (Denise Richards and Sophie Marceau-WOW!)!!

388,Coyote-37,"Great in parts, but hollow as a whole",7,24 January 2000,"After seeing this film and pondering over it for a few weeks, I can't help but think that it could have been so much more. TWINE is a bond film constucted of superb parts but lacking as a whole. Robert Caryle as the baddie had his many fans across UK and the rest of the world salivating at the prospect of that most talented of young British actors turning his hand towards Bond villany. Especially once the extremely imaginative and potentially thrilling character details became known. But where was he in this film? Yes he had all the glorious menacing presance we had hoped for, but he hardly appeared in the film, the role of head bad 'guy' being given to the entirely unconvincing and unimmpressive Sophie Marcau. Denise Richards made a suitably beautiful Bond girl, but her role in the film was unclear. After the escape from the missile silo, she had no reason to tag along with Bond, in fact her presence was absurd as 007 is supposed to be a top secret agent. And OK, the romance in Bond films is rarely convincing, but this one just seemed to spring from nowhere, just to have the out of place Roger Moore style ending. The action sequences were uninspiring, with the obvious exception of the blistering pre-credits scenes. Bonds car seemed to be made of wood and the climatic battle was hardly on the scale of the best Bond films, not even that of recent Bond films. The locations used were also rather dull and uninteresting, again with the exception of the Greenwich scenes. We've seen the world through Bond films a thousand times, and I think it's about time we brought him home and saw some more scenes in good old Blighty for a change. And I DON'T mean that ridiculous picture postcard Scotland that belongs in a crass Hollywood production rather than British venture such as Bond. The real shame is that there were some great elements. The boat chase and Carlyle's bad guy have already been mentioned, but putting M in the field was also a very successful idea, as was the return of Robbie Coltrane. Goldie was great as the sniveling henchman and it was good to see so many black actors appearing in major roles. Finally, the sad departure of the late Desmond Llewellyn was well handled and Brosnan is still acting a great 007. Nonetheless, after all that waiting, I can't help thinking that this film could have been so much better.",The World Is Not Enough
389,Transient,Interesting and Entertaining.,8,18 February 2000,"James Bonds 2000 entry is certainly an interesting and entertaining film. The acting is moderately good, with a surprisingly well done Villian in Renard, and Judi Dench is also good as M, providing a nice detour from the toughasnails guys we seem to get lots of in the Bond series.The story is pretty simplistic, more thrown together and piped out than really done cleverly and well. The actors do a nice job of pacing it out, though, and even with his ridiculous accent, Robbie Coltrane made me laugh a little. But this movie is heading away from what Bond should be even more than Tomorrow Never Dies did. Its a bit of a bummer, when you look at it. Its more of a Dr.No than a From Russia With Love, or Thunderball (my favourite Bond).Perhaps without Albert R. Brocolli heading the team the 007 series is beginning to become too much of a 90's action series than a true International Spy series. His gadgets, while cool, are a little over the top... too coincidental and contrived, I remember that we used to watch Q spout out some of the weird and wonderful things, such as the keychain in 'The Living Daylights' and we'd see them used in really neat ways. Now its all Laser Guided this, and EMP protected that.I'm not old, far from it, so excuse me if this sounds like Nostalgia. But I really liked Sean Connery as Bond, he was dangerous, edgy, and flawed. Brosnan is little more than a cardboard cutout Bond, like the interchangeable and generic roles we always see Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Sylvester Stallone in.All in all, I liken this movie to Batman Forever, it was good and fun to watch. There was plenty of excitement and thrills, but the original lead characters were better and the plot just doesn't hold up to historical criticism.",The World Is Not Enough
390,BigYellowBiohazard,"007 proving his, and our, tirelessness",9,3 December 2000,"Admittedly, I was not expecting a bad production in the latest addition to the continuing Bond saga. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were signed to write the screenplay, and I had heard of their successes with 'Plunkett And Macleane' (also starring, coincidentially, Robert Carlyle). Though in many eyes Brosnan is not THE James Bond, his irrepressable style and charisma in Bonds 17 and 18 proved to me that Eon had not taken a backward step. Bond's primary mission seems to be to move with the times, and he certainly does not fail here (this did not appear to be the case with 'License To Kill', it seems to me).Traditionally, the major villain in a Bond Movie will have aspirations of world domination - we are not spared even here, albeit on a lesser scale. Carlyle makes one of the most genuinely powerful, even frightening villains of the series, portraying his martyr Renard's anger and frustration with understated skill. His fantastically life-threatening injury makes the character increasingly maddened, made only more so by the sexual frustration with his lover Elektra, played with flair by French actress Sophie Marceau. Elektra is the first real female villain across the entire series, and works incredibly well. Bond is instantly seduced by her, unaware of her underlying intentions, and the moment when he kills her is both refreshing and shocking, to see 007 shoot his former lover in cold blood. The brilliant Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane) has been resurrected from GoldenEye, a courageous yet expert move. The hefty Russian is given a fairly abrupt exit, however, as Elektra forbids him any further life to prevent him from saving Bond from her garrote chair (The question is, however, whether this will be the last of him. I wonder not). Every scene is electric, with superb performances from all (most).Bond enters the millennium with a very large explosion...I, for one, will be sorry to see Pierce go.",The World Is Not Enough

394,paul_oates,Flat action sequences let this film down,6,14 October 2002,"The third entry for Pierce Brosnan in the Bond canon is certainly an improvement over Tomorrow Never Dies (1997). Michael Apted as director brings  much more depth to the characters than usual for a Bond flick. M in particular is much more developed and film benefits from it. However where the film falls apart is with the action sequences. Which is a shame as original and well directed action is one of the things we have come to expect from Bond since Goldfinger (1964) started the transition from away from the suspense and drama of From Russia, With Love. Michael Apted is not an action director, and because of this the producers seem to have made the huge mistake of passing the direction of the action to Vic Armstrong. Armstrong, who has been a stuntman on the Bond movies for many years, has made the transition to director, and not successfully. The action is well conceived and the stunts are in places fabulous but the direction is so lame and flat that the sequences come across as dull and uninspired. The ski chase (which Bond movies usually do well) is boring (is that a Blue run Bond is skiing down?) and both the sequences on the Thames and in Zukovsky's Caviar factory are overlong and lacking any originality.Which is shame. With well conceived action this film could easily be one of the best Bond's. Instead it comes across as uneven and frankly, boring.",The World Is Not Enough

398,Andrew-39,One of the best yet,9,1 December 1999,"Definitely Brosnan's best outing as Bond, and probably the best Bond film since the Connery era. TWINE has all the hallmark Bond characteristics (superb action setpieces, wild locations, silly one-liners) but stands out for its unusually thoughtful treatment of its major characters and their relationships. This makes for a surprisingly rich experience, a far cry from the rollercoaster ride that was ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".The regular cast are as excellent as ever, Brosnan looking ever more comfortable in the part. The previously under-utilised Judi Dench has a much bigger role here, a pleasure to watch. We may have seen Desmond Llewellyn's swansong as Q, with the brilliant John Cleese obviously being groomed as his replacement. It will be sad to see Q go, but he is 85, after all. Robbie Coltrane makes a welcome return as Zukovsky from GoldenEye.Sophie Marceau as Elektra King is about as sexy, seductive and downright evil as Bond bad girls get. Unfortunately, Bond's sidekick Denise Richards is average at best. She looks okay in a Lara Croft sort of way, but she lacks credibility as a nuclear physicist and comes across as a bit of a bimbo. She is the film's only real flaw; I longed for the return of Michelle Yeoh. TWINE is less frenetic and much better paced than TND, less humourous but more complete.

The directing was awful, the story line was not believable for a moment.  Sure it had a couple of nice scenes (which we've all seen before), like the ski chase and the boat chase.  Denise Richards is about as dumb a nuclear physicist as you can cast.  The other french chic isn't so hot either.  This movie seems like a string of action sequences tied together with a shoestring of a plot.  This Renard character is not sooo evil, not even scary, yet this chic in the hot air balloon is so scared of him that she kills herself.  Bond's car is unremarkable,  hey if it's made out of titanium, then how come that chopper's steel blades sliced through it like a knife in hot butter?  That little speedboat is laughable too.  You really expect us to believe it can go underwater... how about making a boat with an enclosed cockpit so Bond doesn't have to get wet underwater?

Roger Moore was his most dangerous in ""For Your Eyes Only"" and it helped that movie become the best of the Moore Bonds.  The best Bonds always combine danger, action, and off the cuff humor.  ""The World Is Not Enough"" delivers in each of these areas. Michael Apted's direction is tight, balanced, and really well paced.  The action sequences do not dominate the picture, but when they're on, they really deliver!  David Arnold's music score echoes the golden days of John Barry, and Pierce Brosnan delivers his best Bond yet!  Sophie Marceau really shines as Electra King.  Her performance is mature and alluring.  Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist. . .OK, it's a Bond movie, not a David Lean film.  Actually I think people have been a little hard on her performance.

The performances were all good except for Denise Richards, who wasn't really bad, per se, just not believable as a nuclear physicist.  I mean come on, I'd buy Woody Allen as a heavy weight boxing champ before I've believe Richards as a scientist.  Its a small quibble really though because Bond films have never exactly been known for believability.  Speaking of believability, the only other major problem I have with this movie is that the method that the baddies plan on blowing up Instanbul with is not only unbelievable, its downright impossible.

Even the opening credits were amazing with the oil in water effect and Shirley Manson of Garbage singing the title song. The only thing that was off was Denise Richards, Although she is beautiful enough to be a bond girl, she just cant act. Bond girls are supposed to be as intelligent as they are beautiful and she could definitely not pass off the part of a nuclear scientist.",The World Is Not Enough
405,Mike-969,Luckily License to Kill Was Worse,2,6 December 1999,"Let's start with what was good about this movie: the theme song by Garbage, the opening action scene and Pierce Brosnan.  Besides these three elements, this movie ranks as one of the worst Bond films.  Anyone with even average intelligence could predict the entire plot line within the first 15 minutes of this movie.  Bond movies are supposed to be simply entertaining, not some cinematic masterpiece.  However, even entertaining movies have to make sense and have ""decent"" actors/actresses.  This Bond film recycles old Bond action scenes, makes them completely unbelievable and ridiculous, and then packages all this in an inane story line that has been done a thousand times.  First, the action scenes are absolutely over the top.  We have the skiing and boat action sequences reminiscent of other Bond films, just more outlandish.  We have the action scenes that don't make sense.  The helicopter with the rotating blades for cutting down large trees in a forest is an example.  However, last time I went to Istanbul, Turkey, I didn't see any forest within the city limits. But, maybe I wasn't looking hard enough.  Then, we have ""M"", who can't even manage to reach out and grab an electric clock off a stool a few feet away. She is the mastermind/boss of James Bond, but literally, couldn't make a cup of coffee if required. Without giving anything away, this must be the worst ending yet for a Bond film.  Although the film would like to directly lift the ending of Hunt for Red October, this ending is much worse and just falls flat.  Besides the action scenes, the acting, except for Pierce Brosnan, is poor.  I loved Denise Richards in Wild Things and even, thought her acting was passable.  However, in this film, it is atrocious.  She's playing a scientist who can barely pronounce scientific words.  Most of the time, she simply stands by James Bond and says nothing.  Smart move by the producers! When she does speak, you (as did the audience in my theater) just bursts out in laughter because she is SO SO BAD.  Her character's name was obviously chosen to set up the final sexual double entendre at the movie's end. Sophie Marceau is not much better either.  And, the primary villain is some sorry figure not worthy of a low-rated ""B"" movie.  The only decent character was Rob Coltrane, the Russian figure from previous Bonds.  Finally, although I usually love the sexual innuendo found in James Bond films, I was amazed at the sheer number of such innuendos.  Nearly every word uttered by Pierce Brosnan is a sexual innuendo.  Even in near death experiences, James Bond cares less about saving himself from harm than ""trying to get his groove on.""  The writers have practically turned him into a sexual predator.  I am no prude, but this dialogue was getting ridiculous.  My advice: wait for video!",The World Is Not Enough
406,acsjacks,Trailing away from Connery,6,24 November 1999,"This was not a disappointment. TWINE was, however, not as good as they, meaning Bond films, get. Pierce Brosnan gives a simple performance to a movie with a simple plot where he sleeps with everyone and the blowing up of buildings takes up half the movie. What happened to the Connery days? Goldfinger, Moonraker, even most Roger Moore performances topped this. In fact, Goldeneye, Brosnans freshman Bond appearance was much better executed.

The story this time is interesting,especcially the character Electra King,wonderfully played by French actress Sophie Marceau, is very well written.But off course you are not going to see a Bond-movie for the story,you expect to see great action scenes, stunts,evil villains,beautiful locations and great humour.And all the things I mentioned above were presented very well in this Bond-film.The action scenes in the oil-pipes, on the mountains of Kazachstan and especially on the Thames in London were very spectacular.Robert Carlyle is convincing as a villain who don't feel any pain.The locations were very exotic and the scenes in Istanbul gave me a nostalgic feeling to 'From Russia with Love.'But the most important thing in a Bond-movie is the actor who plays it.And Brosnan did it very well. He's agressive,he has got a sense of humour and he really looks like the gentleman Bond is supposed to be. But in some scenes we see Brosnan also in a more vulnerable position. So I think Brosnan is after Connery the best Bond-actor.My conclusion is that 'The World is not Enough' is a great Bond-movie with all the elements that make this series,after almost 38 years,still one of the greatest movie experiences of the year.",The World Is Not Enough

But where Tomorrow Never Dies does not claim to be more than an action movie (and, in my opinion, succeeds quite effectively), this one pretends it has a story (oh well...) and characters (does anybody believe Elektra's motives? Or the M-in-a-cage scene?). Christmas Jones? Oh well, I can accept her as a tongue-in-cheek caricature of Bond Girls that were, and acting was not why Denise Richards was hired. John Cleese was a disappointment for me. It's not his fault, but I do not think Q's successor (if any) should be portrayed as a bumbling idiot. Valentin Zukovsky was more believable in GoldenEye (still one of my favorite Bond movies, anyway). As others pointed out rightly, the action is simply misplaced in some cases, so the whole thing comes out too incoherent to make me really like it.

I mean well there's a difference between bond using his gun to much, and not having one at all, like he did in Moon raker. although I do quite enjoy bond, a lot and I never got that sick of this film, although the gadgets were not used a lot, mainly referring to his car which only last one minute, before it was teared apart by a helicopter blade. they must have ran out of ideas when the cold war ended, but the war on terror should give a new direction in the bond franchise. sometimes I wonder whether also run out of names for the bond girls, mainly referring to the nuclear weapons scientist, 'Dr Chrismas Jones'- the silliest name I have ever heard for a bond chick. although it may not be the best bond ever made, it is still highly enjoyable, so you had might as well give this a try. 7/10",The World Is Not Enough

NO. Although the role would finally go to Joseph Wiseman, Lee would go on to play Scaramanga in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN. Lee was in a position to know about James Bond and his opinion of Bond actors is well worth noting. He was quoted as saying, ""In my opinion - and I think I know as much if not more about Bond than anyone, particularly about the characters on whom {Ian Fleming} told me Bond was based - Pierce Brosnan was by far the best and closest to the character.""Personally, I always felt that Brosnan's voice, physique, and temperament were much too lightweight for Bond to suit my taste. Although, his interpretation of the Bond character is essentially accurate, he seems miscast. In THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, Brosnan works very hard and he is better than in his first two outings as Bond. However, my problem is that I can still see the work at every turn. Laurence Olivier advised actors that, ""The audience should never see your limits."" Brosnan reaches his limits frequently as Bond, and lacks a real sense of ease. In the last result, his acting seems manufactured.Admittedly, seeing Sean Connery in the early Bond films, beginning with DR. NO in its original release, was a huge influence. Obviously, Christopher Lee is in an almost unique position to have a very well informed opinion. With respect to Christopher Lee, from a an objective point of view I must demure on this point. Based on reading all of Fleming's work several times, as well as biographical material on the author, I feel strongly that Timothy Dalton was far and away the closest interpretation of Ian Fleming's James Bond.Feel free to disagree.",The World Is Not Enough

This film delve's into the emotional arch even further than the films before it, with strong female leads, and a complicated plot that keeps you guessing right along with Bond himself. This film, along with Pierce's other fantastic Bond films, romance you into the lifestyle of the most dangerous spy out there. Bond must use his wits, and uncover the truth behind what's happening in what could very well be the Best of the Brosnan era. (though Goldeneye is the perfect bond film) From exhilarating chases, to lush settings, this film packs a punch, as well as a more thought provoking experience than one might not be accustomed to when watching Bond films. Most people complain about Denise Richards, but honestly, she does a great job and is the eye candy one should expect when watching a bond movie.

I thought this film was exceptional as far as the Bond films go. It had an interesting storyline, the action pieces were exciting and I found the different characters interesting too. I thought Pierce Brosnan shined as Bond, and in my opinion, this was his best Bond film. I also liked Sophie Marceau as bad girl Elektra King, although it's a shame she gets killed off at the end. Like Sophie Marceau, Denise Richards was well cast to play Christmas Jones (great name!) as she is good looking and had a good character to play. The film had the best opening to any Bond film with the explosion at MI6 and then the boat chase that follows. The only bad things about this film were that the plot gets a little confusing at times and I didn't like Bond's Z8 getting chopped in half.",The World Is Not Enough
418,Tenzin-3,This movie is more than enough!,3,8 December 1999,"It's pretty obvious that the makers of this film are pandering to teenage boys, one of the largest groups of potential ticket buyers according to demographics. The problem is it's too obvious! From the wooden performance of buxom bombshell Denise Richards to the huge holes in the plot-big enough to drive 007s BMW through-these  movies are beginning to look more and more like cartoons . Never mind that the plot is totally unrealistic and ridiculous. After all, this is supposed to be mindless, escapist entertainment. But how about a little verisimilitude just to keep us from total disbelief!Case in point-don't read further if you don't want a couple of  plot points ruined, not that it would really make any difference to your enjoyment of the film! OK, here is the scenario: our perpetually suave spy beds one of the leading ladies in the first half of the film. As he should and as we expect. This is the beautiful Electra King who turns out to be one of the baddies later on in the film. James supposedly makes love to this woman. I say supposedly because of what entails in the second half of the film. Now don't you think that the world's greatest spy/lover might touch his conquest's face during their lovemaking? And if he did so, don't you think that his hand might graze her ear; in fact, is it too much to imagine that he might nibble on her ear or at least whisper sweet nothings into it?Well, apparently not-at least from the filmmaker's viewpoint. We learn in the second half of the film, when we get to see her evil side, that Electra has self-mutilated herself by cutting off part of her ear. She shows this to Bond as if for the first time, brushing her hair away from her face to reveal it. Now, if Bond hasn't discovered this already, I dare say that he's not living up to his image of the prototypical lothario! But I blame this on the filmmaker's and not on poor James who is just a pawn in this teenage game of commercialism.Second case in point-this one really makes me laugh. Bond is on a sub. There is mention of the depth at 100 feet. That's when the sub takes a nosedive and plunges straight down. Taking a conservative guess at the speed of the sub, maybe 20 knots or so, and the duration of the scene, I would say that when they hit bottom they would have to be at about 700 or 800 feet. Not only is that deeper than any scuba diver has ever been (as of 1995 the record was 437 feet) but coming up to the surface-in a real world scenario-entails lots of stops along the way to equalize the pressure to keep one from dying or at the very least getting the bends.But for our fearless Bond, along with his buxom sidekick-now in her very wet t-shirt (teenage boys take note-the women all wear bras in this film) swim to the surface holding their breath, seeming hardly winded when they reach the surface! I'm sorry, this point alone was too much for me to swallow. And I'm no professional diver either but I do know that if they came up to the surface from that depth as quickly as they did they would explode-literally!Here's the last reason I gave this movie a three. In keeping with the Bond tradition there is much casual violence, mostly aimed at the bad guys ofcourse, and the obligatory suggestiveness of the beautiful women without really showing much of anything. This last point wouldn't haven't bothered me at all when I was a teenager myself but now that I'm pushing 40 it bothers me. And the reason it bothers me is that they have managed to bring down the rating of the film to PG-13. Maybe they've been that way for awhile but I just noticed. And I can't help reflecting on the fact that they can show all that violence, granted-without the blood and guts-but violence nonetheless, and it is verboten with that rating to show even a woman's nipple through a wet t-shirt much less a bare breast. There's something disturbing about that..not the lack of nudity but the permissive, matter-of-fact violence.So, if you want to see yet another Bond movie with the same old formulaic plot, the same old cliches and no new surprises, you'll love this film.",The World Is Not Enough

I think its amazing that Bond can drive a boat through an open market and restaurant without killing anyone.  And where do they get the bad guys from?  They can't aim a gun to save their lives. Robert Carlyle did a good job as Renard.  I was just disapointed with his character, they could have done a lot more.John Cleese, R,  was a welcome addition to M16 headquarters.  I hope he will become a regular character in the future.  He and Desmond Llewelyn play well off each other in this one.The bond girls were great.  Sophie Carlyle gave a great performance as Elektra King.  Christmas Jones, played by Denise Richards, was fantastic. Whoever thought a nuclear physicist could look so good.In summary if you like the James Bond series you will like this movie.

423,KeyserSoze007,They Finally Got it!,10,21 November 1999,"As a die hard fan and analyst of the James Bond Series, I was a little anxious entering the theatre for TWINE.  Goldeneye was not a bad flick, but was hardly worthy of the 007 series.  Tomorrow Never Dies was better, but no better than anything that Roger Moore had done.  As a Bond purist, I expected nothing less than Connery-like greatness. I believe that Brosnan is the best selection for Bond, but in Goldeneye and TND, he was still getting accustomed to the part. I noticed during the precredit sequence that this was going to be a spectacular Bond film.  The always-action Bond that characterised Goldeneye and some of the Dalton films (of which I think very little) had been replaced by the suave, gentleman spy present in the previous episodes. Brosnan finally got the part down, and the writers have finally reverted to Old-School James Bond.  Aside from Brosnan, the rest of the cast is also perfect.  The assassin at the beginning, in the speedboat, is perfectly reminiscient of Fiona Volpe from Thunderball.  Sophie Marceau is definitely the best 'Bond girl' since Barbara Bach in The Spy who Loved Me.  Robert Carlyle is perfectly cast, though a mite underused.  Denise Richards isn't much for acting, but sure is fun to look at.  Even the new Moneypenny has the act down perfectly. This film can proudly stand in the halls of the Bond of the sixties.  It is a perfect combination of Thunderball and The Man with the Golden Gun, with a little bit of Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me on the side.",The World Is Not Enough

James Bond becomes the body guard of Elektra King, who is like the leader of Azerbaijain (my favorite country name) after she is kidnapped and her father gets killed. Should this movie have had no SFX or no Denise Richards, it would have been a hopeless flop. However, it did have lots of acting and SFX. Lots of guns, explosions, and whatnot. And, of course, it had Denise Richards.Denise Richards is the perfect woman, I believe. Look out for the ""wet shirt"" sequence because it's one to remember.This movie is a good one to see but you needn't worry about ""missing something"" with the plot.

Judi Dench, John Cleese, and [drawing a blank--the guy from Trainspotting & Full Monty] seemed half baked.Redeeming factors were that Sophie Marceau was absolutely beautiful, and the beginning of the movie is slick and fun--especially the sequence before the credits.

After 2 films where the ""Bond girl"" had a relatively substantive role, especially in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", we're firmly back to Stacy Sutton.  The only purpose for Denise Richards' character is to have large breasts and wear tight T-shirts.  (I guess we should be happy she has more dialog than ""James! James!"") Oh yeah, her T-shirt even gets wet in a scene.  This film features an almost tragic Bond villian!  That's fine for a serious film, but this is Bond. Goldfinger Renard is not.

It has good characters and a story that doesn't immediately reveal itself. However, I felt there was too much emphasis on sex in this movie. I felt the directors did everything they could ""get away with"" and still keep a PG rating, and this isn't necessary to please Bond fans. Nobody goes to see a James Bond film for the sex. In their favor, however, the script wasn't riddled with profanity, which is rare today.Okay, so James Bond has always been a sex symbol. But when was the last time he slept with 3 women in a single movie? And it wasn't the usual kissing, some movement under covers and then an ""Oh, James!"" either. They had significant focus on the time spent with bed with Elektra, which I felt was totally unnecessary.

Brosnan play the scene perfectly and the grief and anger within Bond is perfectly displayed on Brosnan's face. He is definitely at his best as Bond.Sophie Marceau is also brilliant. She is truly showing herself as a brilliant actress. Her portrayal of Elektra King will leave you believing that she truly is the victim. She will truly impress anyone watching the movie and she works brilliantly with all those on screen with her, especially Brosnan.Denise Richards lacks something. Her character was never fully developed which lets down Brosnan's scenes with her.The other actors (Robert Carlyle, Dame Judi Dench) are tops as well. They all play out their parts to an excellent level, especially Dench who has a very large part in the movie.The concept of the movie is excellent.

However, it has so many awesome elements that make it, in my opinion, one of the better Bond flicks out there. Firstly, the villain (or villains) in the movie have an evil plot that is not a world-domination plot, but about oil, which I found to be clever. Pierce Brosnan's performance in this one is equally as good as in GoldenEye, particularly in the scene where he kills Elektra: ""I never miss."" Pure awesomeness. Judi Dench as M is at her best in this one, with the subplot about her guilt over Elektra's kidnapping. As for the Bond girls, Elektra is obviously the better one in the movie, but Denise Richards isn't completely terrible. I know, I know, people hate her performance in the movie, but the reason why I don't mind her so much is simply because this is the only movie I've ever seen her in.

436,Trevelyan006,A Modern Classic!,10,14 August 2002,"In the Bond series, each actor that has stayed on for three or more films, has had number three be one of their best entries. For Connery it was Goldfinger, Moore and The Spy Who Loved Me. Brosnan (like Connery) had his best entry, GoldenEye, before number three. And with GoldenEye being the first Bond I ever saw, it was near impossible to top it in my opinion. But with TWINE's bold plot twists and great character insight, it in the end was hard to say. What makes TWINE so good, well it is not just an action adventure, it has a great spy plot with a thriller emoitional subplot. It affects how 007 treats his mission and what he does in it. Brosnan in my opinion IS James Bond, and while has been the best since GoldenEye, he really perfects his portryal in TWINE. Brosnan really sinks into the role here, blending all the Bond elements required to give a perfect perfromance as Bond. And with a great supporting cast, including the series first female villian, this movie is one of the best. And while Densie Richards (soo hot!!) and the way the plot is twisted around slightly drops it from Dethroning GoldenEye as the best Bond film, this is a true modern classic and a film that once agian continues the Brosnan Bond tradition of excellence!",The World Is Not Enough
437,98nurdinm,Spoilers,7,15 July 2004,"Warning! There may be some spoilers in this review.There is a good scene in 'On Her Majesty's Secreet Service' where Bond is at a University. His Coat of Arms is revealed, and the family motto 'The World Is Not Enough'.In this film, Bond quotes it in front of the villaness of the piece, Elektra King. This is a very welcome nod to the earlier Bond films.Brosnan has, quite honestly, never looked better as Bond than in this film. He mixes the tough action-hero with the tragic, broken figure remarkably well, and also provides us with a few sly laughs.The plot is quite good, with the twist unexpected and quite surprising. Although the Bond series has had it's share of femme fatales and bitchy sidekicks, it's never really had a female villain-of-the-piece (or should that be villainess?) Sophie Marceau is very beautiful, and yet very ice-cold, making her character wonderfully unlikeble.Robert Carlyle is also good as the number two of the plot, Renard. the concept of the 'bullet in the head' is well though out and a nice character twist, though the love scenes between him and Elektra make us pity him in some ways, and turn him into quite a soppy baddie.It's nice to see Robbie Coltrane appearing again, but a little annoying at his death. He would have made a good recurring character.Judi Dench reprises her role of M well, but I cannot write a review of this film without a nod to a evry special person in the Bond films franchise.This is Desmond Llewellyn's last appearance before he died, and it is rather poignant and a little ironic that Q is also thinking of retiring in this film. John Cleese is rather funny as the bumbling apprentice, but the films will never seem the same again without the original Q.There is one major problem with this film - Deniese blinkin' Richards! All right, so she's this really attractive woman who looks great in a tight top and shorts, but honestly! This woman could win the Wooden Spoon award for Wooden Acting! Apart from that, the film is a good entry!7/10",The World Is Not Enough
438,paldredge,The World is Not Enough,5,3 November 2005,"As I rank all of the 007 films from my least favorite to #1 favorite, this one comes in at #18. I was very excited to see this film. And it is a rather good one. The opening pretitle sequence is probably Brosnans best. The title song by Garbage is also the best Brosnan receives in my opinion. Brosnan has seemed to settle into the character rather well by now. Being a Dalton fan I was upset that Brosnan was taking over, but by this time I was used to him, and he does a nice job. There is a very nice twist when Elekra King played by Sophie Marceau is revealed to be a bad guy, which I didn't see coming. And Robert Carlyle is great as the villain Renard. He has a bullet lodged in his head which is slowly killing him, yet makes him feel no pain. Excellent idea! So why do I not rank this film a little higher? After I had just seen it for the first time I would have. But after viewing it several times since it first came out, some of the problems with it became more apparent. A good friend of mine said it best, ""it's like they were trying to throw in every signature element and action scene of the Bond films, and it just doesn't come off as all that original."" Carlyle is great but way under used. They could have taken his character so much further. And Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones was ridiculous. In other roles I have seen her in she has faired OK, but her performance in this was awful. One person can't ruin a movie, but she truly puts a damper on everything. And then the big finale is sort of a let down. I like, and frankly expect, the biggest and best action to be saved for last. But the end climax just didn't have a lot of the spark that the opening did.So The World is Not Enough is a good film, as all 007 movies are good to me. But not as good as it could have been.

Still, there's a choppiness that keeps this from being a truly great movie, but lets face it, this is James Bond movie, not a top film of all time candidate.  For those who care, there is a little, but less than usual, of the famous Bond sexual entendre, and most of the women are easily the equal of the men, perhaps the first time that a Bond movie has been quite this egalitarian.

440,DiverBen,A Low Point in Bond History,5,20 November 1999,"""TWINE"" was definitely a disappointment.  Yes, it has great effects, great action, and great gadgets, but certain elements of the movie were just off. The normally sharp and wry Bond quips are too-cute and a bit more over the line than the norm, and there were so many one-liners that by the end the audience that I was a part of were groaning (note the final line of the movie).  The ""good"" Bond girl was overly one-dimensioned (but very much ""3D"").  It was very much a Bond movie, even innovative in the villain department (who was the worst bad ""guy"" in the film?), but the parts they messed with made this a disappointment, with GoldenEye and TND being super movies.  Go see it, but keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy the blank-minded laughs and cool action/effects.",The World Is Not Enough
441,LJ Kong,What A Performance By Pierce Brosnan!,9,26 November 1999,"I Just came home from seeing TWINE After seeing Live Wire i thought Brosnan just wasn't an acting person but he sure proved me wrong here. Bringing emotion and character to Bond that nobody else could. And the Russian accent worked perfectly. The supporting cast was great. M, with an extended role was just astounding. Sophie Marceau stole the show and Robert Carlyle proved himself a worthy actor. But what about Robbie Coltrane, reprising the role of Valentine Zukovsky. He was absolutely brilliant The only problem, Why the hell did they cast Denise Richards ? She just ruined the whole thing. Overall a good Bond. Good complicated plot. Sure it isn't the best Bond but hey, it's sure up there. Shaken, not stirred... 9/10",The World Is Not Enough
442,Al-148,One of the better Bond films,8,20 November 1999,"This is one of the better Bond films and certainly the best with Pierce Brosnan in the lead.  The plot, typically, is secondary to the action. Sophie Marceau plays a delicious villainous but Denise Richards, however beautiful, won't win any acting awards. The one low point of the film perhaps is her scenes.  Nevertheless, the rest of the cast, including a short cameo by John Cleese add up to make this a very enjoyable film for Bond fans everywhere.",The World Is Not Enough

Renard was not the best villain, but if it's one thing the current Brosnan Bond needs, it's a worthy villain with a good motivation to rule the world, or some other interesting goal.

Dame Judi Dench, Mr. Pierce Brosnan, Robert Carlyle, Sophie Marceau... all these good actors and actresses... not to mention a well experienced supporting crew... what had to happen to create such a horrid finished product?The movie had no drive.  Bond seemed to be lacking his self-collected coolness.  The stunt work was anticlimactic.  The FX were horrible, simply horrible.  All things being equal, I feel the answer lies in the writing. If you note, the writers' credits are very long.  Too many cooks spoiling the soup.  The dialogue was vapid.  The scenes all past the opening are empty.  Plausibility is tossed out the window-- even to the extent of making some of the stunts seem ludicrous.  Half of the dialogue serves as narration for the action-- which gets frustrating in about 5 minutes.  Why do we want to be TOLD exactly what we see the actors doing?  I found myself yelling, ""Don't SAY it,just shut up and DO it.""Go see it just to say you did, but if you are a classic Bond fan you will truly hate this movie.  Let's hope they do better on the next one.",The World Is Not Enough

Loaded with gadgets and gizmos, beautiful women and excessive innuendo, ""The World Is Not Enough"" is 100% Bond, and 100% fun.There are a couple of puns that rate high on the ""groaner' scale, and the pseudo-science of the last scene requires a pretty big stretch of the techno-imagination.

The only complaint with Robert Carlyle is that he is not in the film enough.  Robbie Coltraine is also brilliant (once you get used to his Russian accent).The highlight of the film has to be the corniest joke ever right at the end but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't watched it yet.I can't wait for this film to come out on DVD....,The World Is Not Enough

449,boubou-3,Bond strikes back!,10,2 January 2000,"After TND's deception, Bond is back for one of the best opus of the series since the Sean Connery Era. Brosnan is at the top, as dashing as ever, Marceau as Elektra is a very good surprise, Q is as good as ever. Morover, the film is very funny due to John Cleese as R and there are a lot more innuendos than in TND and in GoldenEye (the final sentence is the best one). The gadgets are all very impressive, from the Q-boat (in one of the most thrilling pre-generic of the series) to the X-glasses (I want the same!!) and, of course, the BMW Z8. Weak points: the scenario is very complex and I had to see the film 3 times to wholly understand it, Denise Richards as Christmas Jones is an absolute bimbo (Bond says she's a 'turkey'...). But these are very minor parts. I'll only have four words : go and see it!",The World Is Not Enough
450,Lee Depkin,"Looks great, less filling",6,19 November 1999,"This is the latest incarnation of Agent 007, starring Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  Rounding out the female leads are Sophie Marceau as Elektra King and Denise Richards as Christmas Jones.  In recent years the themes of these thrillers seem to have downsized goals.  It used to be nothing less than world domination, but we've gone from that to merely controlling the world's news (Tomorrow Never Dies) to this one's plot for domination of Asia's oil supply.  After an assassination at MI6 headquarters, Bond becomes involved with the beautiful heiress of a British oil tycoon.  The convoluted plot leads to far-flung locations throughout Europe and the former Soviet Republics.I always look forward to the latest James Bond film and the excitement and escapism it provides.  However, recent Bond installments have left me feeling only half-satisfied, and this one falls into that category.  They are all entertaining, to be sure, full of non-stop action and special effects.  But as each one tries to top its predecessor it falls further down the credibility scale, especially in the affronts to basic science and physics.  I hate it when they get the science all wrong.  I know that these films require a suspension of disbelief, but there are limits to what I am comfortable with.  If you can get past these issues, and I suspect most viewers will, there is a good bit to like about this film.  There is Desmond Llewelyn as Q, the witty and sarcastic gadget guru in the organization.  We never get enough of him.  Joining him in a cameo is his bumbling replacement, R, played by former Python trouper John Cleese.  But for me the real surprise here was the increased on-screen presence of Judi Dench as M, Bond's boss.  She shows a human weakness and vulnerability beneath her cold and business-like demeanor.  Brosnan seems to be maturing comfortably in the role of Agent 007, and we finally have a worthy successor to Connery.  We also get to explore exotic locations, though I suspect Bond secretly has in his possession a teleporter device to whisk him throughout his domain quickly enough to participate in all the action.  Sophie Marceau gave a good performance as Elektra, but Denise Richards' Dr. Jones was not at all credible as a nuclear physicist.My summation of this film would be `Looks great, less filling'.  So it gets a lukewarm recommendation of 6 out of 10.  Most others will find it quite satisfying.",The World Is Not Enough
451,sps112,"Nothing New, but who cares?",8,19 November 1999,"""The World is Not Enough"" blazes no new trails in the Bond series, but who cares?  Seriously, in an attempts to be objective I would give it three stars on a four star system, or maybe 7.5 on the imdb rating.  In other words, it was good but not excellent, but since I like Bond movies so much I may end up seeing it again.  Bond music is great as usual, and as I am a Garbage fan, I like the new theme song a lot.  Sophie Marceau was great, but Denise Richards just seemed like she belongs in TV instead of the ""real"" movies.  How old is Desmond Llewellen?  100?  If you're a Bond fan I think you'll like it, though it's not one of his best in my opinion.  However, if I see it again, which is very possible, my opinion my change.  I get sorta tired of the one-liners, but Brosnan is a great Bond.  If you've heard about the boat chase, it's fantastic.",The World Is Not Enough

Reeks of commercialism but does suffer too much for it. Not as good as Goldeneye but better than TND. Robert Carlisle is an excellent villain. John Cleese will make a superb 'R'. Judie Dench gets better with every movie. Can't wait 'til the next one. Hope Pearce Brosnan hangs on to the role for a bit longer.

453,Criz-3,Spend your money on a pre 90's video tape - not the theatre.,6,22 November 1999,"This film simply shows the lack of Albert R. Broccoli's kin to follow in his impressive footsteps.  The plot is weakly held together by half-handed dialogue and is incredibly confusing to those outside of the oil-shipping industry.  Since this was supposed to be an equivalent film to previous Bond films, we see four saving graces in this film:1) Key performances by talented actors (Judi Dench, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Pierce Brosnan) in that order.2) Great Stunts and special effects. (Which have always been a staple of Bond films past)3) Always welcome throwbacks to previous films. (Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Bond vs. MoneyPenny, ""Bond. James Bond."", etc.)4) A good pre-opening-credit warm-up. (Practically a good movie short in itself)Of the many faults this film thrust into viewers' eyes, the most prevalent was the use of Denise Richards as eye candy. Her scenes were obviously cut in post-production to give more dialogue to Sophie Marceau in an effort to draw attention away from her mispronunciations and forced Russian.  Both of which destroyed any small belief her character was college-educated or even knew simple Russian phrases.  Impotent super-villains left a bad impression as well.  They haven't been too smart in the past, granted, but they weren't discovered this easily or defeated by such small means either.I hope better writing and better casting will make the next installation worth seeing.",The World Is Not Enough

New Bonds only come out once every couple of years and I'm there to see them! I must admit, I even watch the Roger Moore installments every time they come on TV - so I'm hooked. For me, World is Not Enough was enough. It has all the right Bondisms in all the right places. The plot was a bit thin, but it was also more plausible than some in the series. The gadgets were good and not too unbelievable (where can I get a set of those glasses?). A couple of years from now when I've watched this one 75 times, I'll think about where it rates in the Bond series. In the meantime, I'll see this one again before it leaves the theatres and will probably buy it when it hits the video stores.

It is only my loyalty to Connery that prevents me from looking at them as equals. What I really liked about ""The World Is Not Enough"" was that more of Ian Flemings Bond was brought back, as demonstrated by his matter of fact, cold blooded dispatch of Elektra. We sometimes forget that while Fleming's 007 is charming, witty and extremely intelligent, he is in fact one each cold blooded killer.This is a great bond film with great stunts and great acting, even the weakest actors (Ms. Richards) are good. Ms. Marceau on the other hand deserves an academy award nod for sure and John Cleese is a great pick for the future Q, I for one hope he comes back. Pierce Brosnan seems to really like being Bond and I hope continues to have fun with it and he stays for a very very long run. It took a long time to find a true replacement for Sean Connery and his name is Brosnan, Pierce Brosnan, 007 for sure.",The World Is Not Enough

Hell, I had trouble. Ah well... plenty of explosions to distract the kids, and way too much bad bad dialogue to distract the rest of us.  Is it just me or is Pierce Brosnan morphing into Roger Moore?  It won't help. Sorry to repeat the biggest cliche of them all but, yes... there'll only ever be one real movie Bond and I don't even have to say his name. Mind you...

The first time i thought it was rather disappointing and dull but the second time...it was total entertainment.After 19 outings James Bond hasnt lost it yet. This has the normal action, gadgets, locations, villains, and girls. Pierce Brosnan is probably the best actor to play 007 (along with Connery and Moore).There are people who say that oy its the same stuff everytime and its never going to change. Well theyre right but James Bond will never change. We will always want to hear him say Bond James Bond again and again...so face it 007 will be the same forever.I enjoyed this film very much. Its better then Goldeneye but not as good as Tomorrow Never Dies. There are problems with the film. For one the villain Renard is great concept but is so underwritten that we forget hes there. The screenwriters should have developed him more and drop Electra King from being the bad guy.The action this time around the action is a re hash of the older 007 films. The opening sequence was the best part of the movie and probably one of the best opening sequences. We have seen the skiing chase before but its lamely done. The bunker and helicopter sequences are good but then the climax which should be the best part is lame.I have notice something about the action scenes in the last 3 007 films they all concentrate on one thing.Like in Goldeneye it was stunt sequences, In Tomorrow Never Dies its shoot outs and this one there are lots of explosion.It does matter if there on snow something will blow. Theres no huge shoot outs or fights on a top high buildings...no we get a fist fight in a tilted submarine. Oh Well at least Densie Richards wet tank top saves the ending.The cast is fine. The usuals return M,Q, and Moneypenny. Valentin returns from Goldeneye in an amusing role. We are introduced to R played by John Cleese who is seemly going to replace Q. Sadly Desmond who has played Q was killed in December...he will be missed. The girls this time are more sexy then TND. Denise Richards is the sexist, perhaps she lacks credibilty on being a nuclear scientist but I enjoyed her preformence more then Marceua.In the end despite numerous flaws this remains a entertaining time and an above average 007 film.

M's involvement was taken to new heights, breaking away from bond tradition, and I have no idea what the writer was thinking making MI:6 so easily accessible to some oil tycoon. tch! tch!

461,drewmcd2011,My favorite Bond film,10,30 July 2011,"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH has to be my favorite James Bond film. It seems that Pierce Brosnan's Bond films have the longest teasers (pre-credits sequences) in the series and the River Thames chase was a brilliant start, not to mention well-filmed with the London background. The action scene that stands out from them all in the film is the helicopter attack on the Caspian Sea. The plot is very interesting with twists and turns with all the oil involvement, and Pierce perhaps gives his finest Bond performance in his four outings.Robert Carlyle makes a chilling villain as Renard (he's already dead and can't feel pain), but the biggest highlight of TWINE is the two leading women: Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards. Marceau is very well-cast as villainess Elektra King and is perhaps the best Bond villainess since THUNDERBALL's Fiona Volpe. Richards is a gorgeous actress and she's very charming and fun as heroine Dr. Christmas Jones. These are two of the most beautiful and sexiest Bond girls in the series; you are going to love both of them.With its well-staged action, epic plot, Pierce's wonderful performance, and two brilliant Bond girls, TWINE is a Bond adventure both Bond fans and non-Bond fans will treasure. ****",The World Is Not Enough

--Valentin Zukovsky is one of my favorite characters. They should have had him stick around longer.
--Judi Dench as M; she may be in the office now but she hasn't forgotten how to work in the field.
--John Cleese as R; his witty sarcasm ""The famous Bond wit. Or at least half of it."" He can hold his own against Bonds' blatant disregard for respecting equipment.
--Pierce Brosnan plays a sophisticated, suave Bond with emotional depth. (I think audiences at the time weren't ready to have a more human Bond.)
--Robert Carlyle: Hard for me to watch this and not see Rumpelstiltskin from Once Upon A Time. His natural accent kept slipping through. Maybe the writers should've made him Scottish instead? For a man of 5' 6"" he is imposing on screen. He can convey a half-page of dialogue with just his eyes.
--Sophie Marceau: Elektra King was a well written character and portrayed with expertise. One minute you feel sorry for her, you wonder where she gets the strength to go on, the next you want to shoot her in the gut.

Come on, if the best they can do is a plot that involves the worst villains (Renard, a man who feels no pain- we are not in comic book land here, and the rest that don't really make an appearance, apart from Electra who was reasonably good) and the worst Bond woman (with the worst name, Electra is a Villain so can't be counted as a Bond woman in my opinion). The action was reasonably good but ruined it when M got involved too much (you would think that Bond being her best agent would count as something, but she still doesn't listen to him, in my opinion she deserved to be shot by Renard then at least he would have done something rather menacing). On the other hand, there were some good points, like Brosnan getting more comfortable in the role and Valantin making his second and last appearance (even though I thought it was a disappointment that he was nicer he was rather funny).

The story line is a bit too complicated for the typical fast paced  style of all Bond films. However, the plot does begin to make sense half way through the movie( I think)! Robert Carlyle and Sophie Marceau were excellent as the villainous duo, while Denise Richards was somewhat mediocre in her portrayal of a nuclear physicist. With her voluptuous figure and with a name like Christmas Jones, it seems her only role was to be a  ready target of sexual innuendoes  from Bond. The best being, after some steamy lovemaking ,"" I thought Christmas came only once a year"". The special effects were as exciting and unbelievable as ever.

Carlyle, although shortlived, is a very believable and even sympathetic villain and Robbie Coltrane makes a meal of his second appearance as Valentin Zukovsky.The opening scene of TWINE is probably the best action scene ever in a Bond film and while the ones that follow cannot quite match up to it, they are still top class. Director Michael Apted shows that he has a real talent for dealing with these parts of the movie, and the excellent soundtrack can only improve them.I went to see this movie on consecutive days and bought the soundtrack (Garbage&David Arnold) the second time, this is the best recommendation that I can possibly give it.",The World Is Not Enough

Sophie Marceau as Elektra King was also the best Bond woman I've ever seen.  She made an incredible performance.,The World Is Not Enough
475,Mayhew-3,Best Bond Film Ever!!!,10,26 November 1999,"Ok this film was frankly amazing.  The Brosnan Bonds continue to get better and better.  TWINE betters TND in several ways.  Firstly ther are many times during the film where it has the feel of a classic Bond.  Secondly, and most importantly, this one actually manages to make Bond look like he might be in danger, and not that he has the situation completely under control.  This film was just edge of your seat stuff, combined with some really cheesy moments.  Bond at its best.",The World Is Not Enough
476,Trumpter,"Not Excellent, Not Bad",9,5 December 1999,"OK, I have to admit I was not that fond of this movie. I am a huge James Bond fan, having seen almost all the movies more than once! Maybe that it was I was displeased with it. I don't know why. It is driving me crazy! I guess I set my expectation too high with this one. I would have thought the director/producers/actors would have seen the comments made on Goldeneye and TND and made the appropriate changes. I thought wrong. It just doesn't have that classical element that I am sure many of us miss. The car wasn't used that much, and I felt that Renard had potential, but was not in the movie enough. And also I didn't think many of the things in here were that original. But I guess after 19 movies it's pretty hard to keep it original. All the actors/actresses were fantastic, with the obvious exception of Denise Richards, who I liked only because of the.....ehem...close-ups. I guess what I am trying to say is that it better be better next time!",The World Is Not Enough

You are also probably the ones who enjoyed the timothy (I Can't Act)dalton years. This movie is exactly what we want. It's the world being threatened by a madman with nuclear capabilities. Boat chases, ski chases, explosions, submarines, attractive women, great oneliners, gadgets, and bond nails three different women. This is what it's all about. Bond is and will always be a sexist male. He is confident and bold. If your looking for real life watch 90210. If you want adventure, fantasy, and fun, watch Bond.",The World Is Not Enough
478,001,Brilliantly plotted.,10,19 November 1999,"This movie gave me a hope that the Bond series wasn't over.  Tomorrow Never Dies, as everyone knows, was a spoof.  The World Is Not Enough proved that even without Albert Broccoli the job can still get done.  For those who own the whole collection of Bond movies, this one is for sure to be ranked up as an instant classic.  Goldeneye was a classic and now this, TWINE.  Pierce Brosnan along with the rest of the cast, acted their parts  extremely well, and made the movie, original, witty, and classically,'Bond'.",The World Is Not Enough
479,ladykat81,The old Bond is back!,4,20 November 1999,"I remember seeing Goldeneye and being disappointed by the uncharacteristic political correctness of Bond... well, they fixed that in The World Is Not Enough.  Bond is back with his charmingly womanizing ways...Pierce Brosnan performs his best as Bond, playing the cool, suave agent perfectly.  Sophie Marceau is fabulous as Elektra King, but I think she should have played a more prominent role toward the end.  Richard Carlyle is a bit disappointing - despite the fact that he is made more powerful with his inability to feel pain, he is too much a typical thug to really pull off the final show down.  Denise Richards does a bang-up job with sticking out her chest (if you like that kind of thing), but she cannot act at all... though I suppose she is much more in line with the original Bond girls.Despite its flaws, The World Is Not Enough is a great movie.  Perhaps not the best of the Bonds, but definitely entertaining, with some rather funny, if a tad predictable, one-liners.",The World Is Not Enough

Connery Bond,8,10 December 1999,"When I entered the movie theater I had no special expectations for this movie, and maybe that was the reason why I loved it so much. After ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" this TWINE could only be better, but the outcome was very enjoyable. Classic Bond, the best. The argue about Sean Connery Vs. Pierce Brosnan will continue but to me is clear at this point that Pierce is the best as an international mistery ""invencible"" man. Sophie Marceau was the perfect casting. Sophie has done for modern Bond what the ever lasting Pussy Galore did for the old one. Charm, excitation: The true Bond Girl!. This is with no doubt the Bond movie I recommend to a person who had never seen one. Bond in a nutshell. Classic.",The World Is Not Enough
482,jo hell,Bond is not enough,5,8 December 1999,"I just love the james bond movies.All of them and this one too. But, after TOMORROW... the level of expectation was too big and ambitious that when the movie was released i was a little disappointed. The work of directed by Apted is not as good as Campbell or Spottiswood except for the exposition dialogues and the casting is great. The action sequences isn't totally working. Not too much passion in it. Denise Richard is a lust bond girl and that's it. Sophie Marceau has a great caracter and is very good as Pierce Brosnan.The very best point of this movie is, for me, the score that wrote the genius David Arnold. I just loved every single notes.

I loved DR.NO, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS, GOLDENEYE, and TOMORROW NEVER DIES. I'm very tempted to make this new film my favorite of all the Bond films. I just need to see it a few more times before I make up my mind for sure.

484,ataraxy123,Return to Form,7,4 December 1999,"Third Brosnan Bond.  Goldeneye was good Bond, TND was bad Bond, and TWINE is good Bond again.  After starting off Brosnan's Bond career well with Goldeneye, the writer's made him too politically correct in TND.  Now, with TWINE, they have returned Bond to his un-PC, un-feminist, chauvinistic, sauve, debonair self.Sorry to see Q go, although I am a huge John Cleese fan and look forward to his next stint as R.  Judi Dench is a good M.  Sophie Marceau is an absolutely stunningly beautiful woman and a good actress as well.  Robert Carlyle was the best Brosnan Bond villian yet.  But although Denise Richards presents some awesome eye candy, can she really act?  Fortunately they kept her role relatively small.The gadget and action sequences were OK.  The pre-credit boat chase was the best.  Also liked the helicopter scene and the casino.

486,BJWuotila,A poorly assembled toy from the James Bond factory,3,20 July 2001,"The World Is Not Enough achieves the difficult task of distilling one of Hollywood's most simple plot formulas.  The story-line is already written, the only task of the film's writers is to add engaging characters.  They couldn't even get 007 right.  James Bond is faster, smarter and better looking than the audience who pays to see him save the world. Pierce Brosnan plays the part like a middle-aged man doing a James Bond impression.  His uninviting persona and detached attitude is strained and inappropriate. Other characters have too much personality. In particular, superbly cast Judi Dench is given a part that is too large for the character.  It is the nature of M to be almost non-existent.  Also, Q's departure leaves John Cleese in charge of the flashy equipment.  While John Cleese may be the only redeeming addition to this movie, his character seems out of place and pasted in to excite certain areas of the plot.  It's obvious that the writers were grabbing plot twists from wherever they could find them. Perhaps this is because the villains were so weak and uninteresting. Denise Richards was the last nail in this movie's coffin (not pun intended). Bond gets lucky with a bimbo and gets in a horrifying final line.  Thank you Ms. Richards.  This is just another product from the James Bond factory. Luckily, it did not pass inspection.",The World Is Not Enough
487,Slick Rick,"All in all a good Bond movie, but not great.",6,9 December 1999,"All in all a good Bond movie, but not great.  It had little plot and the characters jumped from place to place with no rhyme or reason as to how they got there.  But the special effects were very well done as were the stunts.

488,genesis_now,Didn't live up to expectations.,6,30 November 1999,"Of the three Brosnan Bond movies, this must be the most disappointing, lacking exoticity and originality as well as a strong screenplay.

The only valid points to celebrate were John Cleese, Sophie Marcreau and Denise Richards; all giving solid performances.",The World Is Not Enough
489,schayak,formulaic but highly enjoyable. some lovely location shots of London.,7,3 December 1999,"I've been a Bond fan for most of my life, with the exception of the unfortunate casting choice of Roger Moore.  Pierce Brosnan makes an excellent Bond, and he even resembles Ian Fleming's description (Sean Connery had the wrong color eyes).  Obviously, Bond has been modernized- no more racist, sexist, mysoginistic, cruel, and abusive behavior- well, more or less.  I think it's a good change, and I admire Brosnan for refusing to smoke in this film.  The sixties are long gone, and it's only natural for the series to update the character of Bond.  He's still the same basic archetype, and very appealing at that.  Of course, the bad puns and silly double entendres remain- it wouldn't be 007 without them.  And the ridiculous names of female characters are essential as well, though casting Denise Richards as a tank top wearing nuclear scientist named Christmas is a stretch even for a Bond movie.  She looks about 19, and can't act her way out of a paper bag as far as I could see.  But the exquisite Sophie Marceau made a fine villainess, though Renard's character was underwritten and not particularly menacing.  I felt sort of sorry for him, actually.  I loved the location shots along the Thames- it made me want to visit London.  I was sorry to see that Russian mafia guy killed off- I liked him in Goldeneye (a great movie) and I was happy to see him again.  I have to say that Pierce Brosnan's haircut was sort of wierd- too long and brush like on top.  But that's a minor complaint.  For the most part, I really enjoyed this movie. I can't wait to see the next Bond film.  I hope they will bring Desmond Llewelan back, although I understand he's very old and they are trying to phase him out in case anything should happen to him (God forbid).  Still, John Cleese was funny and should be a fine follow up.",The World Is Not Enough
490,Colin-53,Good but not great,7,5 December 1999,"Reviewing Bond films has become a little like guessing the age of trees. Thus we have to assess not merely whether we have a good or bad Bond film but do we have a good early, mid, or late period Bond. I have to say this latest opus is definitely good late Bond, and average overall Bond. Not as good as ""Goldeneye"" (A great Bond film) but infinitely better than the execrable ""Tomorrow never dies"". Brosnan is now number 2 in Bond hierachy IMHO after Connery, and the added depth of expression he is allowed in this vehicle allows him to actually, well, act. The plot is so so, as it concerns a devilish plot to control the Worlds oil supply. Oh yeah? How sixties. The villain (Robert Carlyle) is also so so. The current Bond penchant for weak chinned British thesps as lead villain is as ineffective as it is infuriating. Can't we go back to the old middle European nasties, or is that non-PC? The pre-credits sequence is excellent if a little forced. You do get not one but two stunts so it's worth it. The problem is the PCS in ""Goldeneye"" (The best ever?) was SO good you compare all new ones with it. The Women are good and bad. Sophie Marceau is the most complex and well written female character ever in a Bond movie, and allied to her considerable physical gifts (She's drop dead gorgeous) she makes for a refreshing new approach to the standard Bondette. But that I could say the same for Denise Richards. She is positioned in this film (and in life, truth to tell)as a body with brains. She obviously left her brains at home for this role. She is not credible as a nuclear phycisist who isn't interested in men. Yawn. I am not giving anything away when I tell you she finally succumbs to that certain someone. She does a little wiring at one point to show how independent she is, and saves the our heroes life. Apart from that she is a piece of fluff and spends most of the film mewing.Her underwater swimming sequence almost redeems her, however. The script is very sharp (An early jab at the Swiss, and Nazi gold is gets things rolling). Recruiting Apted (A renowned dramatic director) has paid dividends with some of the best interplay ever in a Bond film. The sequences between Marceau and Brosnan are particularly well handled. Judi Dench gets to pay a part in the plot (A good move) and the locations are handled better than any Bond film I can remember. They are actually credible within the context of the plot. So some good and some bad. The reality is that its the central villain and the central premise that fail this film. Not to the detriment of the film, but in comparison with previous Bonds. The rest of the film is undoubtedly superior Bond. I hope Brosnan sticks around and fulfills his promise to recruit Quentin Tarantino to helm a Bond movie. Now that would be interesting",The World Is Not Enough
491,stuarts-,excellent drama/espionage film,10,4 January 2000,I really enjoyed this film for the drama and Action involved in the film.

492,Me-134,Best Bond Movie Ever Made!,10,27 January 2000,"WARNING SPOILERS!!!!This has got to be the best Bond movie ever. It starts with a perfect pre-title sequence set in a bankers office in Bilbao, Spain with Bond getting some money or something (the movie has a complicated plot - you will need to watch the movie several times to understand it fully). Bond disposes of the bankers and then to escape makes a thrilling jump out of the window. Just this would have made a great opening but they then go back to London to give you more. And what we get is fantastic- the villain from the bankers office (cigar girl) blows up a section of the MI6 building (killing Robert King, some rich guy involved in oil). Bond then chases her in a fantastic little boat down the River Thames before ending up at the Millenium Dome. Cigar girl jumps into a hot air balloon and Bond grabs on to a rope dangling from it. Cigar girl blows herself up and the balloon leaving Bond to fall down on to the top of the MD and dislocating his collar bone. The main titles are disapointing. It has a perfect song by GARBAGE but the graphics are bad - girls covered in oil dancing in front of weird colours that look like a kailodoscope (hope I spelt that right). It's not exactly a great turn on. The rest of the movie is great except for one problem. It takes too long to get into the next action sequence. The ski chase is very disappointing for a Bond movie and by the time you get to the next one, a whole hour has nearly gone buy. Other than that the movie is brilliant. The villains are great. Although people have been complaining about Renard not being a great villain, they have been judging him wrong. He is only a henchman, like Oddjob or Jaws. Elektra King is the main villain (played brilliantly by Sophie Marcaue) and she is a great character, unusual to see a character so complex as her in a bond movie. I can't wait till the next one, hopefully they will film in Australia with Sean Connery as the villain.",The World Is Not Enough

496,rsterling20,Pretty good thriller up to usual Bond standard.,7,17 July 2000,"All in all a good high-octane thriller which has come to be expected from the most successful film series of all time. Pierce Brosnan is adequate as the 00 agent once again, although his attempts to give Bond a deep gravelly voice can get a little annoying as can his gasps of pain and agony when touched in the slightest way. Sophie Marceau is excellent as the female lead, using her considerable acting range to put across a variety of moods. Her scenes with Brosnan are often electrifying. Robert Carlyle provides the staple Bond villain with the low deep voice and corny threats. Another excellent performance by Robbie Coltrane as Zukovsky, reprising his role from Goldeneye, is included with a convincing Russian accent to boot. This is Desmond Llewellyn's final Bond. His acting, understandably had by now become slightly stilted. One of the true high points of the film is John Cleeses appearance as R. His Fawltyesque remarks are hilarious in any context. One of the real low points of the film is Denise Richards' acting. While, she is not lacking in some aspects, she is the least-convincing nuclear physicist I can imagine. Her delivery of technical speak, particularly at the climax, is laughable. Judi Dench's performance is once again believable as M. The script has its highs and lows, the latter occurring in the early stages. The music is more synthagal that usual, but mostly fine. The music in the first of the three pre-credits scenes is absolutely dire. The main theme tune by Garbage has to rank among the best of the Bond series so far, however. The pre-credits sequence is as usual a mix of action and ludicrousness, though the thought of Bond boatmotoring through suburban London rather than Venice or Jamaica is quite comforting. This film is promising at times but the climax is not worthy of its formidable build-up.",The World Is Not Enough
497,smokey82000,Not enough.,3,23 January 2001,"This film was the least satisfying of all the Bond films. The plot was too convoluted.

I can imagine one producer saying to another, ""Hey, I've got this great idea, we can have these snowmobiles on parachutes.  So we better write in a skiing scene, even though it has NOTHING to do with the story.""  Not only that, but Denise Richards has to be the poorest excuse for a nuclear physicist EVER.  Sophie Marceau is beautiful, but did she have to spend 3/4 of her screen time wearing nothing but bedsheets?  Does James Bond have to sleep with EVERY woman in the movie? I'm surprised there wasn't a love scene with him and Judi Dench.  I always thought Pierce Brosnan would make an excellent James Bond (and he does), but these poor excuses for scripts they are using are ruining the Bond series.

500,sraja,With each movie the series goes further downhill,3,12 July 2005,"While Pierce Brosnan fits the mold perfectly. However, why do the scripts force him to essentially ""hate"" his job. Previous Bond characters enjoyed their job, and disliked aspects. The tables appeared reversed here. So in trying create a sense of realism, they have ruined the character, but made the scripts more preposterous (though Bond's increasingly lame quips belongs in a bad cartoon). And the scripts are dreadful. The bad guys are wimpy and stupid. Judi Dench is not good as ""M"" (and this movie and the beginning of Die Another Day prove it). She had hope in the first flick, but that fizzled out fast. It is a shame the script and direction have both taken away from these two quality actors (Brosnan and Dench).Christmas Jones? The Bond women were plausible in their roles even as they were attractive. Denise Richards doesn't come close to pulling this off. The dialog between the two is so contrived.

501,jwielgosz,So underrated and unappreciated...,8,21 November 2002,"In November of 1999, a very strange thing happened.  An intelligent action film filled with well-drawn characters, an unconventional plot structure, and a storyline that required you to pay attention.  Stranger still, it was a James Bond film, a series widely regarded by the mass public as `fluff' when Bond films have actually been among the prime example of properly done plot-motivated action pieces.  The highly underrated `The Living Daylights' comes to mind.But the strangest thing is the critical thrashing `The World Is Not Enough' received.  From Entertainment Weekly singling it out as a reason to overhaul the Bond franchise, to Internet critics (cough Harry Knowles cough) soundly trashing it in long, diatribe-filled electronic pieces.  The fact that Harry praised the previous entry `Tomorrow Never Dies' (or as a friend described it, 12 pages of script and 90 pages of storyboards) as the best entry since `The Spy Who Loved Me' only leads to my conclusion that the critics and movie-goers of today have firmly and finally `checked their brains at the door' so to speak.The range of critiques for TWINE is stunning.  I have read dismissals of the first fifteen minutes as nothing more than one action sequence after another, despite the fact that the opening teaser has direct relevance to the storyline and contains more complex plot structure than the aforementioned previous entry, TND.  Claims of it being `boring' and `dull' were often tossed about.  Even the fact that Bond actually expresses discomfort was singled out as a major flaw.  See my above `brain-checking' comment.  But I am not here to make TWINE look good exclusively in comparison to TND, so here goes.TWINE had me from the start, from Bond's instant realization of the money bomb.  I knew I was in good hands from that point on.  Indeed, in an era of clumsily handled twists and blindingly obvious revelations, the Electra King twist completely threw me.  I had my suspicions, just as James himself wisely did, but I didn't want to believe it.  Again, just like James.  I could go on for a good half-hour about M's shock when she sees exactly what she and MI6 have created in 007.  His cold-bloodedness has never been on bigger display in recent ventures, save a few select moments. (`For England James?  No.  For Me.')  Make no mistake about it.  Bond is first and foremost a trained killer in this outing, firmly focused on carrying out the will of MI6, even at the cost of.The action sequences serve the story for a change, and each carry emotional weight, resulting from character's needs beyond that of eliminating Mister Bond.  Two of the primary sequences are ploys by the main villain, blatant attempts to misdirect rather than outright kill for the sake of killing. Indeed, misdirection and misreading motivations are the primary plot movers. By the end, everything believed by our antagonist neatly shifts into reverse.  And thankfully, the `one-man army' Bond of late is greatly reduced here, pitting Bond against more realistic odds.The small moments count too.  The high-backed chairs at the MI6 briefing. Zukofsky's small moment of delight upon seeing Bond's new Beemer sliced in half.  The expertly placed shot toward Renard's head, blocked by safety glass.  Elektra's emotional breakdown when trapped inside the avalanche (but faked or not?)  And Zukofsy's silent communication to Bond to take care of business for him.  Reverence and respect is held for the series' past, even Bond's marriage is referenced as he dodges Electra's query as to whether he's ever lost someone that he loves.   Heck, these days even a lone `Universal Exports' reference would be considered gold, but the writers of TWINE have obviously done their studying.If TWINE has any weaknesses, the action sequences are not always staged at the series' prime.  Although the raid on Zukovsky's factory is executed beautifully and is a superb set piece for Bond, some clumsy editing and lensing weakens the ski sequence and the climactic fight on board the Victor II sub.  David Arnold's score is under-mixed; giving the movie a bit too much subtlety in moments the grandness should be spilling into the theater (commercial or home).  And of course, Denise Richards is just plainly miscast for the part of Christmas Jones, which screams for someone of greater maturity.  As someone on the Internet said `Bond girls should have class, not be late for it.'  Can't argue much there.In closing, I hope the producers choose to ignore the gnashing of hypocritical teeth and continue on a similar path for the next Bond film. Do not return to a one-set-piece-after-another film.  Have faith (however small) that the audience will wake up.  I know I for one will be there, hoping that the next film will live up to the lofty (if unappreciated) standards of 'The World Is Not Enough'.",The World Is Not Enough

How anyone that has any taste can like this movie I wil never understand. But its total Crap.First off the beginning (spoiler) Bond breaks his collor bone on fall and catches himself on some ropes. What the hell is that. Then as if that isn't enough (spoiler)the bad guy knows about it so during the end fight Bond is nursing the injured shoulder while the bad guy is beating him senseless. Which by the way he doesn't feel pain do to a bullett wound he got.Now lets talk about Denise Richards as a nuclear engineer. She is way to young to even be believable as that.

Its unrealistic....but who cares?? thats the point.. The boat scene is also very good(all be it long). But what puzzles me is the general hatred of Denise Richards and her character Dr.Christmas Jones... Now I know its crazy that a beautiful American physicist could ever end up working for the Russians in Kazakhstan...but bond needs a good bond girl and she is one...I mean you can't have him sleeping with some fat ugly Russian woman...

505,Scudder,Unbelievably Awful,1,20 November 1999,"While I like Pierce Brosnan as Bond, this movie is simply awful.  The story is weak, jumping from location to location without reason.  When I saw the helicopter with a giant saw hanging from it, I about lost it.  How lame. At least that was an original idea.  'World' didn't have many. This film even rips off other Bond films, i.e. the ski chase, the boat chase over land, and riding through a pipeline.  And while I'm certainly no nuclear physicist, I don't think you can take the core of a nuclear weapon and turn it into a rod for a nuclear reactor in 15 minutes!!  It was refreshing to see John Cleese as R, but nearly all of the humor in this film (including Cleese's) was far over the top.  Maybe that's just typical Bond, but it's never been this bad.

506,Jeffwest,One of the worst of the Bonds,3,20 November 1999,"Having been a Bond fan for more than 20 years, I never thought myself capable of hating a Bond movie as much as I hate this one. The plot is confusing and the dialogue is terrible. ""Oil flows through my veins like blood!"" Give me a break! Robert Carlyle is wasted. The writers give him a great gimmick by saying he can feel no pain, and what is the biggest thing they do with it? Let him get all frowny-faced because he can't feel a kiss. (And if Renard can feel no pain, why does he grunt when Bond hits him?) Pierce Brosnan trudges through like he's trying to win first place in a frowning competition. This Bond is so lame even the action sequences are boring.Now I know how Trekkers fans felt after seeing ""Star Trek V.""",The World Is Not Enough
507,Sammy-29,Awesome movie,10,27 November 1999,"I am a Bond fanatic.  I own all the movies and have seen them multiple times each.  Although this does not make me a true ""expert"" I do know a good deal about Bond and I have to say that this was one of the best Bond films in years.  I personally disliked the past two (having fear that Bond's days were numbered) but have since recanted that view.  This movie by far makes up for any past problems.  It had amazing action, phenomenal plot twists, great characters, and (as any Bond film should) wonderful women.  I highly recommend it for any Bond connoisseur.",The World Is Not Enough

Everything you would expect from a Bond film is here, from the standard exotic locations and excellent cast, through a marvellous plot. The pre-titles sequence alone has enough in it to make most other action films hang their heads in shame - someone has finally found a reason for the existence of the Millennium Dome.Once again the producers of the Bond series have left the competition miles behind, and full marks must go to Pierce Brosnan for shaking off the ghost of Connery once and for all.",The World Is Not Enough

Once again the filmmakers tried an exhausted plot and throw in some not-so-original characters.  This is the most invigorating Bond film ever, as well.  All involved should be ashamed. Especially Judi Dench.  Luckily Michael Apted has an award winning documentary coming out this week as well (42 Up) so maybe he can keep some artistic integrity.  All things considered, this movie should have never made it out of pre-production, let alone be able to make almost $40 million opening weekend.  A true disappointment.",The World Is Not Enough
510,tajaron,A waste of good money,3,19 November 1999,"I went to see The World is Not Enough with less than great expectations - having seen and not been impressed by Goldeneye (the only other Bond movie I've seen).  I was hoping for at least a somewhat interesting action movie, boy was I wrong.  This movie flaters in all respects - story (Blowing up Istanbul with a nuclear sub - boring!), casting (Denise Richards! Need I say more), acting (John Cleese is totally wasted and again Denise Richards!), humor (In the theatre I was in almost no one laughed at any of the ""jokes""), villains (bland and uninteresting), and most importantly action (except for the boat chase at the begining the rest is just explosion after explosion and don't even get me started on the submarine squence).Don't bother with this waste money, wait until its on the permium cable channels so you can just turn it off when see how bad it is.BTW - If this movie is supposed to be normal for the series then I won't be bothering with any of the other James Bond films.",The World Is Not Enough
511,J.Bond-2,A wonderful catch for all Bond fans.,10,21 November 1999,"Having just returned from viewing ""The World Is Not Enough"" (TWINE), I must say that it was a wonderful movie.  Pierce Brosnan looks as if he is comfortably settled in as James Bond, compared with his first appearance in ""Goldeneye"".  In fact, the one fault I found with this movie was the casting of Dr. Christmas Jones, played by Denise Richards.  Richards proves herself to be more of a body than an actress in this film, as all of her lines are pathetic (yet carried off with perfect comedic timing, intended or not). In fact, her outfits reveal more about her figure than she ever reveals about her character and personality.  Perhaps the producers decided that in true Bond fashion there had to be a bimbo in distress for Bond to rescue if anything should go wrong.  Sophie Marceau is the complete opposite from Richards, however, as she steals the spotlight of the two Bond women in TWINE, acting brilliantly as Elektra King (a wealthy oil heiress Bond is assigned to protect).  Marceau offers a glimpse back to the days when the Bond women actually had some substance to them.Overall, TWINE is a very worthy installment in the Bond franchise, and a must-see.  With the classic films being released right now on VHS and DVD again, this truly is the season for Bond to take on the world's markets. Not that it will ever be enough.",The World Is Not Enough
512,ChrisG-7,"Good, but not Excellent",8,30 November 1999,"It's very much a case of Bond-by-Numbers in this film - we get re-workings of several ideas from previous films, and I can't help but get the feeling that I've seen this before.There's a boat chase (which, admittedly was pretty good), a ski chase, and even a nuclear bomb. (though I had to ask myself why Bond needed help diffusing the bomb when he's done that sort of thing hundreds of times before on his own.)Robert Carlisle was barely in it. However, Elektra is a great character, and brought out some emotion from Bond, and surprisingly M, too.If you like Bond, and especially Brosnan, I'd recommend it. If you like John Cleese, you'll enjoy his scenes.Overall, not bad, but could be better. A fun way to pass a couple of hours.",The World Is Not Enough

It may not be as good as some of Connery's Bonds but that is hard to beat. This movie provides a sufficient amount of action in conjunction with an interesting plot to go along. My only complaint would be that the new car, the BMW Z-8 roadster, that we were all physced up to see was inadequately used. From some non-Bond fans that I have talked to this movie brought out a new love for the James Bond saga.

515,clopin,This is the Bond adventure of the 90's,10,19 November 1999,"TWINE is without doubt the 007 adventure of the 90's. I would consider it to be one of the best Bond movies ever, but for sure the best of the Brosnan era so far, because it perfectly combines Bond's universe with the real world. The movie has a terrific look, crystal clear colours and benefits from the great craft of Clark and Biddle who both did a fantastic job. In addition Pierce Brosnan gives one of the best performances in years, taking his character both seriously and on the other hand not too seriously. Sophie Marceau offers a fantastic villainess and puts herself in one line with Chris Walken, Robert Davi and Klaus Maria Brandauer.The writers Michael France, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, Dana Stevens and Bruce Feirstein have outdone themselves by creating some of the best characters in the series and by far the best punchlines and dialogues in years.

517,rnblover,Once Is Not Enough,10,30 November 1999,"Overall, I thought that this movie was excellent.  I am a die-hard James Bond fan (I own all the videos) and have most of the soundtracks.  It is definitely one of the more well-rounded James Bond films, with a nice balance between action, drama, and plot.  I saw it three times in one week, but I think it takes that many viewings in order to fully understand the complicated plot.I think that the acting (with exception of Denise Richards) was superb all around, although I could never grasp how a villain like Renard could come across as so frightening that he could drive one of his henchman to suicide (You'll know what I mean when you see the film).  He seemed very diminutive and sometimes I even sympathized with him when he couldn't feel any pain.Even so, I enjoyed Robert Carlyle's performance, as well as Sophie Marceau's.  There was talk about Sharon Stone playing the role of Elektra, but I don't think that Sharon Stone could have played the part any better. I wouldn't have been able to generate sympathy had she played the part. Sophie Marceau played a tortured Bond Girl with conviction.  Now that's what we need, some good Bond girl characterization!!  She's the best bond girl since Octopussy.Denise Richards was good to look at, but many of my friends couldn't help but giggle every time she said a word on screen.  As a nuclear physicist she sounded very Teeny-Bopperish.Pierce Brosnan?  What can I say?  The credits are wrong.  They show ""Pierce Brosnan AS Ian Fleming's James Bond 007"".  The ""as"" should be an ""is"". Pierce Brosnan IS James Bond 007!!By the way, did anyone notice in the opening credits scene that John Cleese was NOT credited.  Now that is an injustice considering that he is the most popular star, save Pierce Brosnan and Desmond Llewelyn, in the entire movie!!!!!  He needed more screen time.  I think he was perfectly cast considering he had very little to work with.Go see this one more than once.  It's worth it each time!!",The World Is Not Enough

Pierce Brosnan portrays James Bond as a cool but reluctant killer, as you would expect of the character as originally written.  The sex is kept well under control, unlike some of the earlier Bond movies.The only spoiling factor is that there are too many special effects and your brain tends to get overloaded.  May be better in a cinema with a top class sound system.That said, well worth the effort to go and see it.",The World Is Not Enough

Brosnan is devoid of any real Bond edge, unlike in Tomorow Never Dies, which should include self-deprecation and overt sexism, yet the real weakness of the film is the inclusion of Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones.  Her blatant lack of acting ability is only rivaled by the thin excuse of her inclusion in the story.  Her role in the film would've been better filled by a really cool Bond gadget, yet she is dragged along, literally and figuratively, through the story with no other rationale than to show off her various augmented body parts.  Her character isn't nearly intelligent or interesting enough to to justify her existence in the already banal plot.Bond needs Mel Gibson.  Period.",The World Is Not Enough

Robbie Coltrane was excellent and so was Goldie as his driver.  Judi Dench was decent.  Pierce himself... I like Pierce Brosnan.  He was fine. Everything in it had been done in another Bond movie.

And even though his screen time is very short, John Cleese looks like he will fill Q's part perfectly.  The exotic locations are interesting and... well, it IS a Bond movie.  Fans of the series will see it no matter what, but I think this movie will quickly be seen as one of the most forgettable of the 007 offerings.",The World Is Not Enough

This was beyond bad, above bad, outside of bad: it cannot be classified with current language. A new branch of phenomenology would have to be established to attempt classification.  Any serious scientific effort to classify this film should be undertaken with the utmost caution; its power to suck all intelligence from living matter viewing it is awesome to behold.This was a Bond flick with all the elements: skiing, weird vehicles, gratuitous use of submarines, hot chicks, and villains who can't actually figure out how to just shoot this guy...  Unfortunately, none of these elements could save this film from its pretentious abuse of traditional Bond motifs; motifs that made earlier Bond films great (or at least not quite so mind numbing.)  Never in the depravity of the late Moore years did Bond sink to these depths!Tired dialog, complete lack of pace, (another) tired story line, and some very bad acting all contribute to the ""stink pot"" factor of this movie.

John Cleese makes a very promising start (to what he has now announced is a 3-picture deal) as Q`s assistant ""R"".

Bond will probably maintain a place in the public's affections - after all it survived several farcical episodes with the indescribably wooden Moore - but when compared with the slick work in Goldeneye, for example, this movie was distinctly third rate (and even that is a generous assessment).",The World Is Not Enough

As such, it is the best Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969 and does not rely on gadgets but certainly relies on the girls. It also sees Pierce Brosnan totally at home in the role of Bond and maintains the tradition that the third film for each actor reaching that number is a high point (Goldfinger and Spy Who Loved Me were the pinnacles for Connery and Moore).The film contains across the board superb acting from Robert Carlyle as a very different Bond villain, Robbie Coltrane in the welcome return in his colourful role of Zuckovsky previously seen in ""Goldeneye, oscar winner Judi Dench in an extended outing for M and particularly Sophie Marceau in the pivitol role of Elektra King. Even the minor characters are superbly played from the beautiful assassin (Maria Garazia Cucinotti) to Q's new assistant R (the irrepressible John Cleese). It was also nice to see the M16 boys back from Brosnan's previous outings.The film is well paced and wonderfully held together with sensitive and excellent direction from Michael Apted. Add to the mix, the necessary stunts including a brilliant chase along the River Thames, unusual locations in Baku and a soundtrack from David Arnold of which John Barry would be proud.Congratulations, 007, your time is certainly not up!

Brosnan seems to have finally discovered that you need a sense of humour when playing Bond. He didn't seem to get it in his earlier efforts.  The smug smile of Connery or the bedroom smile of Moore have been missed, but maybe they are not forgotten quite yet.  If this movie is a reflection of what to expect from here on in, then we will have something to look forward to in the future. Carlyle is a better villain, Marceau was fun as the ""is she good, is she bad"" girl, and Coltrane added some very funny lines.  The only terribly miscast role went to Denise Richards.

548,hoenen,One of the least good Bond Movies.,5,27 February 2001,"Ok...I am a huge Bond fan and basically enjoy all of the movies.  So I wouldn't call this one bad.  But it is certainly more Hollywood than Pinewood.  It's an ok action movie......but not what I would consider a typical Bond movie.So......rent it...watch it and enjoy a couple of hours of decent action.But if you expect all the special charm that most Bond movies have, you'll probably get disappointed.",The World Is Not Enough
549,y-54045,The world is enough for this viewer,7,22 January 2020,"In this Classic, action movie we see James Bond, played by Pierce Brosnan, attempt to unravel a sinister plot to overtake the oil market. As a warning this essay will include spoilers so if you wish to still see this movie I would advise you watch it first then come back. The whole plot of this movie hinges on one character Elektra King, played by Sophie Marceau. Who's father died in a terrible explosion that they suspect Renard is behind. For her protection MI6 sends their best agent to help protect and potentially uncover what is going on with the King family. Soon Bond learns that Elektra King is actually evil and is plotting to level the entire city of Istanbul to destroy her competitor's oil lines. That is just a quick recap of the plot if you would like to learn more about this movie I would highly suggest you actually watch it.Overall I enjoyed this film, as I do with most James Bond movies. I thought the music was fantastic and the cinematography excellent. Unfortunately the acting was subpar and some of the visuals were just peculiar to say nicely. Anyway let's start with the positives. First I thought the action in this movie delivers. You as a viewer never get bored whether it's the ski scene in the mountains, or the fight in the nuclear bunker this movie knows how to pack action into its runtime. Another positive of this movie was it's soundtrack, which was composed by David Arnold. These songs really set the mood for each scene and partially make up for the poor acting, that usually plagues these types of films. Finally the cinematography of this movie is next level. The combination of wide pan shots for setting the scene and the quick cuts to James Bond for action, make this movie very visually pleasing.Now onto the negatives of this film. First, let's start with the most prolific problem that this movie faces, the acting. As a successful franchise I feel that the producers don't feel the need to make the best film they could. They are content with mediocrity, which is why they focus so much on the action of this movie. They understand that the majority of their fans want to see James Bond, and what that usually entails is action scenes on action scenes. Which for some viewers is perfect but to me it comes off as lazy. Another critique of this film is the visuals. Not to say that they were horrible but if you have 135 million dollars at your disposal I better be getting some believable explosions. Granted it was created over 20 years ago but still me and the rest of the audience want believable explosions! My final criticism would be the story. I enjoyed the first part of the movie, the action was nice and we got to know a little bit about some of the characters. What ruined the story for me was towards the end when the plot started to unfurl. I mean come on you're telling me that no one at MI6 even suspected that Elektra was evil. The plot twist, if you can even call it that was predictable and basic. The plot was honestly elementary and left me unfulfilled.Even if you're not a fan of James Bond or action movies in general, I would still suggest that you watch this movie. It contains great cinematography and fantastic music even if it's sometimes overshadowed by the subpar acting and basic plot.",The World Is Not Enough
550,tassunto,The Worst Bond Girl.,7,9 October 2021,"If you eliminate Denise Richards, this would make this movie an easy 8 or 9. Good plot, some good support acting. She can't act and was most likely reading from a cue card. You do not need T & A to make a movie interesting. John Cleese can go too. You don't need slapstick in a Bond movie. I can watch the 3 Stooges for that. Also, close ups of Bond swapping salvia just doesn't cut it. Go back and look at what made this work. Leave something to the imagination. Less is more. After Connery it is a toss up between Roger Moore and Pierce Bronson. The rest are just fill in's. Daniel Craig is just an action figure , will never have the Bond appeal.",The World Is Not Enough
551,fineto,Standard Bond action including the hottest Bond girl ever,5,26 November 2002,"I didn´t like this movie that much when I saw it first time. And when I saw it again yesterday I must say it was just as bad as I recalled. In the end Denise Richards saves a lot as she is nice to watch, but all in all this Bond falls in the category: ""worst three Bond-movies""",The World Is Not Enough
552,Prue Halliwell-Trudeau,best bond movie to date,8,5 June 2003,"i found this movie to be the best of all the bond films.  not only did it have a great plot (which thickened as you went along, with the whole elektra good-evil storyline), but the stunts were awesome (as they always are in bond movies) and different.  the ski scen and the boat scene were among my favourite parts in the movie. and it didn't hurt that denise richards was the bond girl, and for once bond had to work at her to get her to fall for his 'charms'.",The World Is Not Enough
553,marshallowens,Decent,5,17 March 2012,"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH has to be my favorite James Bond film. It seems that Pierce Brosnan's Bond films have the longest teasers (pre-credits sequences) in the series and the River Thames chase was a brilliant start, not to mention well-filmed with the London background. The action scene that stands out from them all in the film is the helicopter attack on the Caspian Sea. The plot is very interesting with twists and turns with all the oil involvement, and Pierce perhaps gives his finest Bond performance in his four outings.Robert Carlyle makes a chilling villain as Renard (he's already dead and can't feel pain), but the biggest highlight of TWINE is the two leading women: Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards. Marceau is very well-cast as villainess Elektra King and is perhaps the best Bond villainess since THUNDERBALL's Fiona Volpe. Richards is a gorgeous actress and she's very charming and fun as heroine Dr. Christmas Jones. These are two of the most beautiful and sexiest Bond girls in the series; you are going to love both of them.With its well-staged action, epic plot, Pierce's wonderful performance, and two brilliant Bond girls, TWINE is a Bond adventure both Bond fans and non-Bond fans will treasure. ****",The World Is Not Enough
554,Elektra_King,A near-perfect Bond film with the best cast,10,29 November 2014,"This film was my first Bond film, and I honestly could not have asked for a better one. The pre-credits sequence is among my all time favorites, because it features one of my favorite stunts in a film, (Bond escaping the bank by using a window shade cord and jumping out of the window) as well as an amazing boat chase on the Thames. The title song by Garbage is marvelous, as well as the title sequence itself. As for the rest of the film, it maintains a good pace, and features great action sequences, as well as great amount of character dialogue. My favorite action scene is the helicopter attack on Zukovsky's caviar factory, and my favorite non-action scene is the scene where we are introduced to Dr Christmas Jones. I do love the ending as well. The locations in this one are very good, and I think of all the Bond films which David Arnold scored, this is the best one.Pierce Brosnan is the best James Bond in my eyes, and in his third film, he gives the best performance out of the four films he made. Sophie Marceau is very good as Elektra King, although I have to say, I do like Robert Carlyle as Renard better and the two make a very good duo of Bond villains. Robbie Coltrane reprises his role as Valentin Zukovsky in this one, proving that he is easily among the best allies to Bond. Judi Dench gives a brilliant performance as M, and it is nice to see her character finally getting involved in the story because the only thing she pretty much has done in her previous two films, which also her predecessors have done, is to sit behind a desk and give Bond orders. Denise Richards as Christmas Jones is my all-time favorite Bond Girl. Not only do I think she is the most beautiful Bond Girl, character-wise she is also the best. She is intelligent and very brave, and provides real help, instead of simply being there for the purpose of being eye-candy. Her acting may not win her an Oscar, but she did an outstanding job regardless. There are only a few minor problems I see with this film: 1. There is no scene which shows Bond and Christmas preparing to go to Zukovsky's caviar factory. It would also be interesting, but not necessary to find out more about Christmas's background and character. 2. I would have liked to have the ending scene, when Bond and Christmas celebrates Christmas in Turkey a bit longer. But for what it is, it is very good.Not only did this film inspire me to watch the rest of the Bond films, but it also inspired me to watch other films and TV-shows which both Pierce and Denise have done, and I hope they will do another film together someday.",The World Is Not Enough
555,doctorwhotrailersnet,Underrated much?,8,19 June 2016,"villains! The film opens with quite a long pre-credit sequence that establishes the actual story quite well and features a brilliant hovercraft chase scene across the Thames and London! After a stylish title sequence the story kicks off, in which Bond has to look after Elektra, daughter of a murdered oil tycoon, who runs a massive oil pipeline. It would become quite obvious that Elektra was a villain, but it was a nice twist considering we rooted for her during the ski chase (thanks for that) and she became a very unlike-able character that had a somewhat odd relationship with the main villain, Renard. Renard is quite a standard villain but with the far-fetched gimmick of being immune to pain due to a bullet in his head. The rest of the cast is great, with the return of Robbie Coltrane (who is sadly killed) as well as Judi Dench as M with a more prominent role this time and the last appearance of Desmond Llewellyn as Q. Also, there's inexplicably John Cleese as Q's replacement. The Bond girl of the film, Dr. Christmas Jones, is certainly capable...but it's very hard to believe she's a nuclear physicist. Her name was also just there to make a crude pun at the end of the film. Brosnan as Bond is great here, partaking in some great action, like the ski chase, the battle at the oil pipeline, as well as showing off his gadget-filled car at the caviar factory and some fisty cuffs in Renard's boat. Of course, because he can't feel anything, that fight is not satisfying and Elektra deserved that death a lot more. Overall, I think this is fairly underrated, stylish and action-packed film with some dragging and disjointed scenes, but always manages to pick up.",The World Is Not Enough
556,agelis,Best of the modern Bonds.,10,11 October 2005,"Excellent plot (although the villain's medical 'condition' that allows him to perform at superhuman powers because he does not feel pain is a little implausible), fantastic locations and setting, fast-paced action and enough sexual tension and banter mean that this film has all the hallmarks of a classic bond. And not as over-commercialised as Die Another Day.The only weak point is the pathetic casting of Denise Richards. The bimbo-American style character has no place in the classy, sophisticated world of Bond. Although the corny but hilarious ""Never had Christmas in Turkey"" and ""I thought Christmas only came once a year"" lines were classics, in the vein of Sean Connery in the Goldfinger era.",The World Is Not Enough
557,lewisthegame,TWINE - the best Bond film so far,10,13 March 2006,"The World Is Not Enough is, in my opinion, the best Bond movie to date. After the poor showings in the early 80's with The Living Daylights and View to a Kill Pierce Brosnan breathes new life into what was a dying movie franchise. Goldeneye was the start of the Bond revival and what a superb film that was. Followed 2 years later by the sublime Tomorrow Never Dies. The World Is Not Enough is the icing on the cake for me. The opening chase on the Thames has got to be one of the best pieces of film produced. The bad guys are perfect and the 'girls' are top tottie! Judy Dench as M is, as always, perfect (does that woman know how to act or what?).Still love watching it even now, 6 years after its release.All in all, the best Bond movie",The World Is Not Enough
