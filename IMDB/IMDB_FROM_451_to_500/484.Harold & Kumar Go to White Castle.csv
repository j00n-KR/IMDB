0,SnoopyStyle,Hilarious Slacker Humor,8,5 October 2013,Harold Lee (John Cho) is a meek Asian who gets picked on all the time. He can't even get up the courage to talk to his neighbor Maria (Paula Garcés). Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) is his highly inappropriate slacker roommate who works hard NOT to get into medical school. They get stoned together and feel the need for White Castle.This is full on slacker humor. The two guys make great comedic chemistry without the usual comedian. Their humor really comes from their friendship. The fact that they're both Asians is almost a side issue except for some ignorant racists characters in the movie. NPH makes a hilarious outrageous cameo.,Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
1,Prismark10,Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,5,9 October 2019,"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle is slacker stoner broad comedy with an Asian American and Indian American lead.Harold (John Cho) is a put upon lowly investment banker. His roommate Kumar (Kal Penn) goes to medical school but does not want to be a doctor.One friday night with Harold assigned to finish the reports by his work shy colleagues, Kumar persuades him to get stoned and then they get the munchies. They want to go to the White Castle for hamburgers. It ends up being a weird road trip as the stoned duo have trouble finding it.The film is raucous and silly. The memorable part is an ugly tow truck driver called Freakshow who takes them to his house and they meet his alluring wife. The film has racist cops, racist youths who always end up where Harold and Kumar are heading and a perverted Neil Patrick Harris.It is crass and intermittently funny slapstick. It is also refreshing that the film has Asian leads and they are a likeable duo.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
2,jboothmillard,Harold & Kumar Get the Munchies,6,10 November 2010,"I saw a short clip of this film on TV and instantly recognised the Asian star of American Pie, I assumed the two characters were in their own spin-off movie, I was annoyed it wasn't, but I was going to see it, from director Danny Leiner (Dude, Where's My Car?). Basically stoner teenage friends Harold Lee (John Cho), who works as a stock analyst, and Kumar Patel (Epic Movie's Kal Penn), a medical student, live pretty uninteresting lives. While sitting at home watching TV they say to themselves they crave a good meal somewhere, and they watch a commercial advertising the popular White Castle burger chain. Kumar convinces Harold that he should do his important work on his laptop on the way as they journey to the nearest White Castle, and they are let down when the nearest one is closed down. So with their stomachs empty and no real sense of direction, a road trip begins to the relocated White Castle, but it's not going to be an easy journey, as chaos follows disaster. Along the way Harold and Kumar encounter a raccoon attack, ending up with a trip to hospital with a Male Nurse (The Proposal's Ryan Reynolds) mistaking them for doctors, thankfully they save the patient's life. Next they have the car break down, and get a lift from the hideous looking Randy, or Freakshow (Christopher Meloni), who may have said they can shag his beautiful wife Liane (The Heartbreak Kid's Malin Akerman), and after the car is fixed they run away when it looks like ti could be a foursome. Then Harolf and Kumar give a ride to a hitchhiker, who turns out to be actor Neil Patrick Harris, desperate to get laid and looking high, and he steals the car when they stop for gas. The next thing they know they are arrested by a mean cop for jaywalking, and Harold learns a few things from his African American cell mate, before Kumar and him escape, with a big mound of marijuana. A few times on the way they are harassed by the high school skinheads, but they get their comeuppance when Harold and Kumar steal their car to carry on their way. Finally, they see a light in the distance and spot the White Castle restaurant, and with a hang-glider handy they fly across the country to reach it. It looks like after all the effort they can't pay with their wallets empty, but Neil Patrick Harris shows up to repay them for stealing their car, and they are ready to eat their big order of burgers, french fries and cold sodas. After their delicious meal they feel like they can do anything, so Harold finally speaks to the girl he has feelings for, Maria (Paula Garcés), and Kumar follows his father's wish to be a doctor. Also starring David Krumholtz as Goldstein, American Pie's Eddie Kaye Thomas as Rosenberg, Ethan Embry as Billy Carver, American Pie: The Wedding's Fred Willard as Dr. Willoughby, Scary Movie 3 & 4's Anthony Anderson as Burger Shack Employee and Jamie Kennedy as Creepy Guy. The leading actors make a good buddy movie duo, the road movie format is a good way to go, the slapstick and some gross jokes are good, and the story is simple but surprisingly warm, a really fun comedy. Good!",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
3,Quinoa1984,"Sometimes it's dumb, sometimes dumber than dumb, reverberating to minor genius",8,30 July 2004,"Director Danny Leiner is one of the few comedy film directors that has it right, following up his cult comedy classic Dude, Where's My Car (at least it's a cult with the kids I talk to)- if you want to do a dumb, lower than dumb comedy, where pot, strange sex innuendo, flatulence and toilet humor, and the plain old ridiculous come into play, don't hold out on the core crowd.  Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle provides the audience with two likable, goofy, yet dependable and focused leads in the well paired John Cho (Harold) and Kal Penn (Kumar), as they go on a quest after getting baked out of their skulls.  As exaggerations go, the story takes turns that go for the odd, the obscene, and try to go for broke.  Here and there jokes don't work, but then that passes once the next whammy comes around.  Basically, if you saw Dude, Where's My Car, or know what to expect from the zany, herb-induced comedies going on through the lineage of the masterpiece Up in Smoke, you'll know if you'll like it or sit stone-faced (no pun intended).  I liked it, and like in Leiner's previous there were a few moments where I was laughing from the very epicenter of my gut going through my membrane.  Highlights for me were a little dealer fiend in Princeton, a cameo with Neal Patrick Harris, and a particular, momentary dream sequence where Kumar pictures his future with a pound-sized baggie.

4,jotix100,Fast food craving,7,3 January 2006,"Not having seen this film in its commercial run, we caught with it recently when it was shown on cable. Director Danny Leiner has to be credited for the success of this movie. Written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, this comedy about two roommates proves to be a winner.The film is well paced and it's hard not to like its humor. The movie, in someone else's hands could have turned to be a disaster. Mr. Leiner keeps things under control as he presents Harold and his friend Kumar, who are one of the funniest duos one has seen on the screen in recent memory. Their antics sound so true that there is not a false moment in the film. Their long ride looking for the White Castle to satisfy their craving for some of those tiny burgers after smoking some excellent stuff is full of amazing situations.John Cho, as Harold, and the irresistible Kal Penn, who plays Kumar, are seen at their best as they are never obnoxious characters like is the case in some other Hollywood movies. A great appearance by Neil Patrick Harris is one of the best moments in the film. The beautiful Paula Garces is seen as the object of these guys' admiration.Danny Leiner and his creative team and the two stars will have the viewer laughing throughout the film.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
5,Hey_Sweden,One truly will have a high old time with this.,7,28 March 2012,"It's appreciable that writers Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg and director Danny Leiner are among those keeping the stoner comedy alive and kicking in the 21st century. It stars the personable, and genuinely funny, pair of John Cho and Kal Penn as Harold and Kumar, two fun loving guys who inevitably get the munchies after getting high, deciding that White Castle will be their destination for the night. As the viewer might expect, on their way to the ultimate meal they will experience one setback after another, in the tradition of misadventure comedy such as ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and ""License to Drive"". Episodes include their meeting with Neil Patrick Harris, playing a crazed, perverted version of himself, their having to improvise like mad when they're mistaken for doctors, their encounter with a character named ""Freakshow"" (a memorable Christopher Meloni), their repeated confrontations with a punk gang who use a certain word EXTREMEly frequently, and other assorted escapades. Heavily satirical as well as rude, crude, and outrageous, one can see that there's more going on here than just lowbrow comedy (and it does get very low, as witness the ""battle *beep*"" sequence in the washroom), as it pokes merciless fun at stereotyping. Leiner, cast, and crew take an amazing ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach to their wild and witty movie, throwing in things like animation and utter nonsense involving a possibly rabid raccoon. The soundtrack is full of catchy tunes and the pacing is consistently effective. A few cameos add to the fun factor; in addition to Harris, we get to see Fred Willard, Anthony Anderson, an uncredited Jamie Kennedy, Ethan Embry, and Ryan Reynolds; other familiar faces include David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Shaun Majumder, and Boyd Banks, with lovely Paula Garces and Malin Akerman as Maria and Liane, respectively. There's even a message about learning to stand up for oneself, and having confidence, in the end. One can't help but feel good for our leads when things go their way and laugh at the misfortunes they endure. Cho mostly plays straight to the more zany Penn, but they both earn a nice number of laughs with their performances. All in all, this is a decent diversion that always manages to come up with some great bits of business and is anything but boring. Seven out of 10.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
6,zardoz-13,Dumb But Hilarious!!!,8,18 August 2013,"Actors John Cho and Kal Penn play a pair of contemporary stoners in ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" who experience such a craving for White Castle hamburgers after they smoke pot that they put their lives on the line to find the nearest franchise. They encounter a number of obstacles on their freaky, buddy road trip comedy. Our heroes tangle with a raccoon, a couple of hot babes who play a different form of 'battleship,' a group of redneck sports extremists, straddle a cheetah and ride it through the woods after dark, and are stranded after Neil Patrick Harris steals their car. During most of its nimble 88 minutes, ""Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle"" is a whole lot of dumb fun. Unlike many destination movies, our heroes do reach their destination and munch out. John Cho plays Harold Lee and he works for accounting firm, while Kumar Patel is attends a number of university admission interviews. Harold is the straight guy in that he is constantly serious, whereas Kumar is the clown who will do anything stupid. If you're searching for a lowest common denominator saga that you don't have to think about, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" is good. There are several memorably funny scenes like the animal semen scene and the toilet scene.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
7,Boba_Fett1138,Yeah it's entertaining alright...,7,16 December 2005,"But still I don't fully understand why this movie become such a huge hit and got such a high rating on here. Sure it's good entertainment but it's far from the best comedy I have ever seen. There are some good and well made sequences that are really funny but there also are multiple lame moments in the movie and the story itself also isn't exactly solid.John Cho and Kal Penn are good and fun as the main characters but they aren't actors that will gain an huge star status. What makes the movie really fun and work are the other crazy characters that pop up in this movie. The movie mainly consists out of several different crazy situations that don't always exactly feel connected, which gives the movie a bit of an incoherent feeling at times and the movie isn't always constantly fun to watch. There are some weaker and lame moments in this movie which makes this movie a just above average 'silly' comedy. A better script would had definitely made this movie a better one.Still of course the movie is perfectly entertaining to watch if you want to have some silly crazy fun without having to think too much.Not exactly the comedy of the decade but certainly a perfectly watchable and entertaining one.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
8,evanston_dad,Harold and Kumar Come Close to Making a Classic Comedy Team (But Just Fall Short),6,5 May 2008,"Perfectly enjoyable and appropriately stupid, ""Harold and Kumar..."" isn't good enough to be a comedy classic, but it's much better than the average boys-behaving-badly flick.It aims for smart satire rather than easy gross out jokes, which made me appreciate its efforts even if it doesn't always succeed. The filmmakers try to be clever, but they're not quite up to the task. Neither are the two actors who play Harold and Kumar, who are passable, and come close to displaying the kind of chemistry that buddy comedies like this need to completely score, but don't quite make it. I found myself laughing at situations and the minor characters that come in and out of the film, but rarely at Harold and Kumar themselves.I'd recommend this, though, if you're looking for something you don't have to think about.Grade: B",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
9,anaconda-40658,White Castle Forever.,9,16 June 2015,"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle (2004): Dir: Danny Leiner / Cast: John Cho, Kal Penn, Neill Patrick Harris, Christopher Meloni, Paula Garces: Strange road movie comedy about achievement. John Cho and Kal Penn are Harold and Kumar who are dominated within the work force where others are rewarded for their efforts. Bored with the routine they set off to White Castle restaurant for burgers and are involved in one mishap after another. They dispense a raccoon from their car; get a cheetah high on marijuana; break out of jail; and have their car stolen by Neil Patrick Harris. Director Danny Leiner achieves the comic greatness he failed to achieve in the dreadful Dude, Where's My Car? Perhaps it is the film's ordinary appeal verses the exaggerated situations. Interesting racial theme that addresses Harold as oriental and Kumar as Asian. Cho and Penn have wonderful comic chemistry and are backed by hilarious cameos including Harris from the TV show Doogie Howser M.D. Despite his theft and vandalism of the car he does prove to have charm. Christopher Meloni steals moments as a mechanic named Freak Show who surprises the duo in more ways than one with his beautiful wife. Paula Garces plays the neighbour and fixation of Harold who struggles to communicate with her. Despite vulgar humour we still root for the duo to beat overbearing odds for a burger.

10,movieman_kev,the PC stoner film,4,21 June 2005,"Harold and Kumar hit the road looking for Sliders from White Castle and weed. They encounter such ""wacky"" characters as racist jocks, wrongly imprisoned blacks (well it IS a comedy after all), other stoners, and Doogie Houser. Directed by the same moron who made ""Dude, Where's My Car?"". Fortunately, it doesn't have the same writer. So this film is mildly amusing... MILDLY. I saw it because some people have called it un-politically correct. Of course, me being vastly against that train of thought, I thought what the hay I'll give it a spin. Well let me set that straight, this is a pretty damn PC comedy.Do I feel like my time was wasted watching it? Nope, not really. It just wasn't nearly as good as I was led to believe. You can find way better 'stoner' comedies, may I suggest any ""Cheech & Chong"", ""Dazed & Confused"", or ""Half Baked"" My Grade: C- Eye Candy: Malin Akerman, and 4 other nobodies get topless",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
11,Sylviastel,I wanted to like it!,7,11 March 2007,"I do find the film entertaining at some moments but completely unbelievable at another. Harold and Kumar are two guys from New Jersey (my home state) who are not mobsters for a change or the stereotype of New Jersey that we get from other medias. Anyway, Harold is a Korean American investment banker and his friend Kumar who should be going to medical school like his father and brother. One of my problems was the whole pot situation in this movie. It seems like that and sex is the center of men's existence. They go out to White Castle after they get stoned because the white castle burgers taste better that way. One of my problems with the movie is the drug issue because it becomes a core aspect of the movie's humor. Anyway, they pick up hitch-hiker Neil Patrick Harris along the way playing himself. As somebody who lived in New Jersey my whole life, believe me, the highways are much closer than they appear on the maps. Anyway, the movie has it's moments and I love Bobby Lee from Mad TV even for only a few minutes of him in the movie.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
12,StevePulaski,"Knows what to do, how to do it, and when do to it",9,17 July 2011,"""There's no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time. The universe tends to unfold as it should."" - Guy in prison, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle is nothing but a huge improvement from Danny Leiner's earlier film Dude, Where's My Car?. This is a lot smarter, more believable in most places, and gives our two main characters more deserved screen-time than Dude, Where's My Car gave Kutcher and Scott.The reason I loved this movie so much? Because of its plot. It's nothing but two guys who go on the ultimate quest for something simple, White Castle sliders (small Hamburgers). Are those burgers really worth all of this aggravation and harm? To someone who smokes enough marijuana they are.Harold (Cho) and Kumar (Penn) are roommates in New Jersey. Harold is a shy and geeky office employee and Kumar is the loud mouth partying type. One day, upon returning home from work, Harold and Kumar both smoke enough pot for a group of people and then look for something to eat. Kumar wants ""the perfect meal,"" and boom, a White Castle commercial comes on TV.Both Harold and Kumar haven't been to a White Castle in years, but that doesn't stop them. Kumar believes there is one in the multiplex downtown, but after driving to it they find out it has been made into a Burger Shack. An employee (Anderson) tells them there is a White Castle that is open twenty-four hours a day in Cherry Hill, forty five minutes away. Harold and Kumar make the trip, and everything goes awry.There are various subplots like Harold wanting to get his dream girl, Maria (Garcés), and Kumar's father portraying Kumar to go to med-school to become a doctor like him and his brother. Kumar doesn't want to, but his dad's forceful behavior makes him think twice. Very rarely in a stoner comedy do we get so much detail on these two innocent characters, so it's a really nice change of pace.In Dude, Where's My Car?, most of the events occurred were extremely fictitious and that is what ruined the film. The concepts of space aliens, and a bunch of other randomness added in only made everything about the film more and more unlikable. With this, with the exception of the raccoon scene, is all pretty realistic. Some parts are over-exaggerated, another part being the hang-glider scene, but it isn't over the top compared to Dude.The quote above is something I took out of this movie at an extremely young age. I saw this around, maybe six-years-old, and have always liked the ""There's no sense getting all riled up"" quote. Sometimes I hear it in my head and think, ""yeah, that's the way to go."" It's one of my favorite quotes, and it sounds obscure that one of my favorite movie quotes comes from a stoner comedy, but stop and think, and that quote is very good and very true.The simplicity is what makes Harold and Kumar so enjoyable. The randomness, and the film knowing its boundaries does too. Once it knows it is being funny, it doesn't hop all over the place to get the most laughs. It knows how to get laughs, and when to get them.Starring: John Cho, Kal Penn, Paula Garcés, and Anthony Anderson. Directed by: Danny Leiner.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,This is either one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen or one of the funniest,8,7 April 2008,"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, in 2004 just from the title, I never wanted to see this movie, it just sounded so incredibly stupid and a waste of good film. But on Bravo a few months ago they had this movie on it's top 100 funniest films of all time and also they're not releasing the new sequel in a month, so I figured what do I have to loose? Just go ahead and give the movie a chance, so I rented it yesterday and watched it today, I hate to say it, I couldn't stop laughing. I mean from beginning to end this movie is just so unbelievably funny, I think it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and the actors just have so much fun with it. Kenn Pal and John Cho have a great chemistry for the buddy relationship of Harold and Kumar, not since Bill and Ted has been such a great stoner move.Harold and Kumar are two friends who are about to enjoy their Friday night getting high, they get the munchies and are looking for the ultimate satisfying food: WHITE CASTLE. So they go on a trip to the local White Castle where they are disappointed to find out that the White Castle is closed, so they have to travel across town to get their craving. But the night is still young from emergency surgery to chilling with the cheetah's, from Neil Patrick Harris stealing their car to hang gliding, this is the ultimate night just to get the perfect square hamburger.Seriously Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I couldn't believe how much I laughed out loud during this film, I think I have to join in with the fans on this movie. I just loved everything about this film except for the potty humor, that's always for me a huge turn off, but I got over it because this was just a fun movie. The script, the actors, the fantasy with the weed and Kumar was just beyond hilarious. I loved Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle and highly recommend it, don't take it seriously, just have fun.8/10",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

The story isn't particularly important as the film is more a conglomeration of misadventures which beset the duo as they run afoul of a bunch of street punks, cops, a really weird tow truck driver and his hottie wife, and more. Chock full of gross-out and potty humor, T but no A, blatant vulgarity, silly situational comedy moments, and some unoriginal stuff borrowed from other films, this raucous road trip flick is not for the sophisticated and will play best with ""boomer babies"" and the college crowd.

16,Buddy-51,very funny comedy,8,12 June 2005,"If you are easily offended by jokes about casual drug use and promiscuous sex, you may want to avoid ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Caste,"" a comedy dedicated to the noble causes of reckless driving, uninhibited gluttony and unbridled flatulence as well. If, however, these topics don't offend you, then you may find yourself enjoying this raucous, riotous and high-spirited tale of two young potheads who take to the road in pursuit of the world's greatest hamburger.Harold and Kumar are two young men desperate to overcome the burden of their respective ethnic stereotypes. Harold is a shy, introverted Korean businessman who wants to be anything but a shy, introverted Korean businessman. Kumar, a young, twenty-three year old Indian, has opted to become a slacker, mainly as a way of rebelling against the future his high-pressured dad has mapped out for him (being an ""Indian doctor"" like his far-more-ambitious older brother). One Friday night, bonged out of their minds and desperate to find a way to satisfy their ""munchies,"" Harold and Kumar decide to go on a quest for the stoner's holy grail - White Castle hamburgers, of course. As they traverse the wilds of northern New Jersey, our two illustrious compatriots undergo a series of bizarre and often surrealistic misadventures that give them a night neither of them will ever forget.As stated before, the humor in ""Harold and Kumar"" is crass, crude, vulgar and epicene. It is also clever, good-natured and downright hilarious, with a little satirical bite thrown in from time to time to keep the higher thinkers in the crowd entertained. John Cho and Kal Penn make a great comic team as Harold and Kumar and the other actors are all fine as well. Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser) makes an appearance playing himself, showing that he's a game player when it comes to engaging in a little good-natured ribbing at his own expense.Although ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" is not likely to earn the Concerned Parents of America Seal of Approval, that's no reason why the rest of us can't just sit back, buckle up and enjoy the trip.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
17,cherold,the best white castle commercial ever,7,19 July 2005,"In many ways similar to purposely dumb comedies like the Bill and Ted movies and Dude Where's My Car, the main difference with this one is the lead characters aren't idiots. They are simply two guys with a simple idea, a bad habit of making inadvisable detours and a whole bunch of bad luck. The movie manages to make it believable that two smart, stoned guys can get into just as much trouble as a couple of idiots, and at least within the logic of the movie Harold and Kumar's actions make perfect sense.The movie is often outrageously funny. It can also be rather gross, which didn't thrill my squeamish girlfriend, who laughed a lot but also sometimes cringed. The movie's wacky, ever-moving story keeps things lively and the movie is smart enough to take its characters seriously as they go through their outlandish adventures.It's interesting that the lead characters are Asian and Indian. It's not really generally a plot point, although the movie does occasionally let its social consciousness with some clever commentary on racism. I'd be curious as to whether the director just thought these guys were funny and wanted to put them in a movie or just thought it would be funny to have a movie with Kumar in the title. Of course, it's only striking because it just never happens. The purposely-dumb-movie-about-a-couple-of-guys-who-get-in- all-sorts-of-crazy-situations genre has been a white guy thing for years. The only non-white examples I can think of are those old Cheech and Chong movies. Perhaps the director chose an Asian and an Indian precisely because in this country both groups are seen as good-two-shoes and he wanted to balance out the stereotypes. I guess it doesn't much matter why though, the important thing is it's a really funny movie.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
18,FeastMode,my notes,7,26 July 2019,"Awesome and hilarious classic. holds up. and well made overall, which i was not expecting. the story, as ridiculous as it is, is well-put-together and full of surprises. and it has great characters (about 5 viewings)",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
19,lost-in-limbo,You can't dismiss that craving feeling!,6,17 May 2006,"An Indian-American med student Kumar and his roommate an Asian-American investment banker Harold go on a night road trip after smoking some dope to feed their craving hunger for some White Castle burgers, which was advertised when they were watching TV. On their way to White Castle - Harold has got some of the boss's work to finish off by the following morning and Kumar has got an interview for a possible job aspect the next day. But both of them didn't plan on the night to be filled with many out-there adventures and humorous obstacles stopping them from getting to their preferred destination.Why don't you roll us up another one, dude! Welcome, to the new potheads of this generation! I'm fan of Cheech and Chong, but now the mantle in this new age has moved on to some far more intelligent and rather outcast buddy stoner's - Harold and Kumar. I say they are worthy of it too. It comes to no surprise that the director Danny Leiner made the even more stupider and whacked out film ""Dude Where's My Car"". Here Leiner repeats some of that goofiness, but the circumstances have changed around and it's a far more better effort. Maybe the story and it's high-jinks were not heavily populated with drugs or even entirely centred on it (say like most of Cheech and Chong's flicks), but it compensates that with its break-neck pace, mellow soundtrack and with a whole range of humorous gags. Some were just so politically incorrect, while others were filled with stoner humour, or they were just so crassly, infantile. But the main thing about this film is that it just plain stupid fun that parodies a lot of stereotypes and putting a spin on it to its advantage. While providing us with a couple of likable stoner's who have a lot more things on their mind, but their main priorities on this outing are some dope and White Castle. The story as it goes is simple; there on their way to White Castle, but a whole lot of small episodes sidetrack them before they get there. So, the plot is thin and it treads a familiar path like many teen comedies do, but really it doesn't matter too much because there are plenty of adventurous and comical situations that work out (like that of the ""extreme"" jocks) than actually misfire. Well, actually there's a small sub-plot involving Harold having a thing for his neighbour Maria that adds something else to the table. Really it's all about a bunch of ripe characters and ludicrous scenarios. Another factor that keeps this above the usual fluff is the highly witty, self-aware script that adds a fresh outlook with the irony of every situation seeming to find its way into the frame. Plus having a pair of protagonists who have a bit more brains and a strong friendship in nice change to the formula of the teen format. John Cho and Kal Penn's chemistry is perfect and they are sensational in their parts as the uptight and focused Harold and then you got happy-go-lucky Kumar. The supporting roles also have some funny moments from David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Jamie Kennedy, Neal Patrick Harris and Fred Willard. And Paula Garces is gorgeous in her small part as Maria.There's not too much behind this film, but I found to be a pleasing piece were no one is safe from this distasteful onslaught.

20,Robert_duder,Typical supposedly funny stoner crap,6,24 July 2005,"Harold and Kumar is the stereotypical example of what the young generation for the most part has become. It's the movie that kids will flock to and think it's absolutely hilarious because they get high, have stupid sexual misadventures and constantly make reference to being high. It's what American Pie started really but American Pie was actually funny and covered a wide spectrum of taboo topics rather than films like this which is strictly about being or getting high and ""the munchies."" Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle is the story of two College best friends and room mates, Harold, the more conservative uptight business man and Kumar, the free spirited, rebellious wanna-be doctor. Kumar decides he wants to party, they get some great weed and Harold, despite being held up at the office with work hesitates but finally agrees. The two smoke up and when they are done they both have monster munchies and after seeing a commercial on TV they are hellbent about having the delicious White Castle Burgers. Kumar knows the closest spot and they head out in Harold's car. Such begins their wacky misadventures trying to get to White Castle. The closest White Castle Kumar knows of turns out to be a Hot Dog Heaven and they have to get to Cherry Hill. Along the way they have numerous run ins with the same bullies, a religious ""Freakshow"" covered head to toe in boils and his extremely hot wife, Neil Patrick Harris who steals their car to have orgies, a cheetah, Kumar's father, a dying man in a hospital, a psychotic police officer, a black man imprisoned for being black, and much much more. In the end Harold and Kumar not only get what they started out for but learn a lot about their lives.The first half of the movie just killed me and I don't mean in a good, funny way...I mean it was painstaking. Brutally unfunny, stupid, typical crap. Now I must admit the last half of the movie got much much better and more funny and a little less typical while still being about the weed. These are supposed to be two intelligent guys learning something about life and they are dope heads?? Come on give me a break. However their journey does turn into something rather funny and has some genuinely unique characters and rather amusing moments. The true highlight of the film is the two stars John Cho and Kal Penn. They have great chemistry together and they play their roles very well. Having previously been funny little supporting characters in big movies of the same type ie: American Pie series and Van Wilder, this is their first big starring role and they carry the film easily and humorously and they deliver their lines well. I think both of them are better comedians and smarter actors than what this film offers them. Some of the offbeat characters they meet in their travels are also very funny and well done...Neil Patrick Harris playing himself, Ryan Reynolds, Christopher Meloni, Anthony Anderson, Sandy Jobin-Bevans...all these characters make appearances and move the film along. Special mention to Christopher Meloni of Law and Order fame who plays Freakshow, one of the funniest and scariest characters in the film. The entire scene is hilarious. So the entire film is not bad and if you like the stupid slapstick, gross out humor then you will bring this movie on board with a 10 outta 10 but for me I really don't like comedy that resorts to the stupidest grossest humor imaginable and also revolves around getting high or drunk or any other mind altering stupid plots. The first half of the movie was so typical, it was boring but fortunately found some footholds in the end. And I must admit the sappy happy ending was a nice addition. If you're looking for something intelligently funny stay away but for a stupid road trip type movie...rent it. 6/10",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
21,MLDinTN,It was fun and silly,7,26 July 2005,"This had some laughs and was OK. It's about 2 ethnic potheads who must eat at White Castle. So they drive all over the place with one misadventure after another. Harold gets attacked by a raccoon; they keep meeting up with these bullies; Doogie House steals their car; Harold gets arrested after a run in with a jerk cop; they go to Princeton only to have a run in with hot chicks in a bathroom that is stank. The one part that was too absurd and should have been left out was them riding a cheetah. I mean they happen to run into a cheetah in New Jersey!There's also a funny scene involving Kumar treating his bag of weed like a wife. And the Doogie Houser subplot was funny, especially when he's giving them $200 and telling them why.FINAL VERDICT: If you like raunchy comedies, you'll like this.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

It's sad that I finally got the chance to see this now, should have been six years ago. Anyway, there are hilarious scenes. Also, the story is ridiculously stupid but that also makes the movie funny.This movie is about two stoners who wants to take a trip to White Castle. This is the stupidest story ever but it works.I liked the two main actors. I knew John Cho from the American Pie series and I knew Kal Penn from Epic Movie.

24,The-Sarkologist,Maybe I'm too old for this,3,26 August 2017,"A part of me wonders whether the 'Stoner Movie' has reached its used by date. Well, maybe they have, maybe they haven't, or maybe this was just one of the really bad ones. Okay, you did have the classic Stoner Movies of the 80s and 90s, including Bill and Teds (which, while they are clearly stoners, doesn't have them smoking drugs), and these days you have copious amounts of marijuana appearing on our screens, but the whole concept of a couple of drug users going on a trek to get some food can be a little dull – and this is basically what this movie is about: two stoners go on a quest to get some food.Honestly, I'm not too thrilled about this film, especially with the characters. Sure, Harold was okay, but his so called best friend, Kumar, is one of those guys that is clearly a bad influence. It is almost as if we want to slap Harold about the face, tell him to snap out of it, and to actually go and find some decent friends. Sure, while it is the case that business people do take drugs, Harold really didn't come across as one of those drug user types. In fact it seemed as if he was completely out of place, and completely out of character.The other thing about this film is that it is one of those T&A movies (and I'll let you work out for yourself what that means since IMDb does have a word filter on it). Sure, I've seen plenty of those types of films in my time, but in reality there really isn't all that much to be said about the excess exposure of flesh in some of these films. Also, the film was so predictable, which added to its blandness. In a sense, while it was a low budget film, it really wasn't one of these films that I would recommend going out of your way to see because it isn't entertaining, it isn't funny, and it really isn't all that enjoyable.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

What they crave the most after seeing a TV advertisement, is a trip to White Castle. So from here, follows a journey for the burgers they require. On their way they will encounter many obstacles.Neil Patrick Harris is brilliant in his cameo as a horny Neil Patrick Harris, he is the best thing in this movie.

26,Floated2,I don't understand the hype and cult following of this film,2,21 January 2011,"I don't know why I waited so long to watch this film. I finally watched it, and really didn't find it that funny- just predictable. Many people consider this film a very funny comedy with great humour, but I just didn't see it that way. The humour wasn't creative. It seemed to rehash the American Pie films comedy, and just tried to make this more crude, sexual, and thrilling. But I didn't think it ended up that way. It had no heart and was just random at time. Also its jokes were lame and unfunny, and the dialogue wasn't clever, just uninteresting. Since this is a road trip film, Harold and Kumar go thru the basic movements of a typical stoner films. But this film just contained so many random scenes with characters that just made one or two scene appearances. Some examples of dumb scenes with unfunny and crude humour I though are: Harold and Kumar at Princeston with these two British girls using the bathroom playing a game called battlesh*t (it was unfunny and just gross- even for this film), a guy named Freakshow with gross scabs and bumps on his face who happen to pickup Harold and Kumar along the way, an appearance by Neil Patrick Harris (wasn't that funny, just predictable), a ridiculous jail scene with a sophisticated black guy speaking about his life in prison- not funny stereotype, a scene with Harold and Kumar riding a cheetah and getting stoned with it, and few more silly and dumb things. This film was just too predictable, and not really well written. The plot just wasn't good or original and didn't seem worth it. Though, I liked the ending, I thought it was pretty decent but still predictable nonetheless. This film is pretty overrated, and should have been better. ==================================================================== ====== As for a rewatch (05/22/17'), thoughts and opinions have not changed much. One can find this film not funny or entertaining and many have considered. The plot is simply basic with a bunch of misdirections and random misturns occurring from stopping the leads from their goal of reaching White Castle.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

28,funkyfry,funny funny funny,8,24 September 2007,"This is a very funny movie in my opinion, and I usually don't enjoy the ""stoner"" comedies even though I have been known to indulge in the sweet leaf now and then. I feel like usually they are condescending not only to the protagonists but also to the audience, but this film was an exception to that rule because the characters of Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are portrayed and developed so well.Whether or not we really feel the urgency of their mission  to eat a plate of cheap burgers at fast food restaurant White Castle  we do get caught up in the carefully constructed motivations and needs of the characters that coincide with this journey. Harold is frustrated at work by pushy middle executives who think he should do all their work because he's the ""quiet Asian."" He can't talk to the girl of his dreams, Maria Quesa Dilla (Paula Garces) and he feels that it's inevitable that he will be hitched to the insistent Cindy Kim (Sui Ta). Kumar feels trapped in the life prepared for him by his doctor father and takes every chance to sabotage his chances of entering medical school. As they encounter a variety of challenges in their journey, they are often met with the limited stereotypical expectations of others; initially each man meets this challenge with something like resigned anger, but as their confidence grows their reactions change. Neither man ever accepted the prejudices around them, that is not the problem  the problem is that they accepted the consequences of the prejudices, which really amounts to the same thing. The film-makers are clever in the way in which they reveal the character details about Harold and Kumar, basically taking the audience on the same journey of de-programming and discovery that they take the characters on.Not that much else to say about it  if you haven't seen it and you enjoy really over-the-top comedy, you should see it because it's one of the few recent films of this type with reasonable intelligence and the 2 main characters are very appealing. I think the film would not appeal as much to women because they are only seen through the horny eyes of Harold and Kumar and the film never really even attempts to portray them with any depth (the fact that Harold's dreamgirl is named ""Maria Quesa Dilla"" should be a big tip-off). My girlfriend enjoyed it though, so I'm sure a lot of women will be able to look past any sexism or to realize it's all part of the film's unique perspective. I didn't really care for the parts with ""Freak Show"" (Christopher Meloni) for whatever reason just a bit too silly and grotesque to be excused considering they don't advance the story and really just aren't that funny. But the parts with Neil Patrick Harris  playing himself. If he was the most drug-infested heterosexual man in America  more than make up for it. Harris is of course not really playing ""himself"" because he's a talented and reasonably well-behaved gay man, but as is typical for this film the part he's playing is more of the ""Doogie Hauser M.D."" fantasy that Kumar cherishes than the ""real"" Harris.It's a giddy journey to a predictable ending, but one that will still leave the audience nearly as satisfied as Harold and Kumar are when they bite into that mountain of little onion burgers and fulfill their own version of the ""American Dream."" I thought this film was funnier than ""Cheech and Chong"", ""Dazed and Confused"" or any other ""stoner"" comedy I've seen, and with far more appealing characters. I'm looking forward to the sequel.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
29,dfranzen70,"Funny stuff man, pass the pipe",7,8 April 2005,"Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are a couple of college-educated smart dudes who also happen to love the wacky tobacky. But they're not typical stoners, either; Harold is an investment banker, and Kuman is a medical whiz whose father is trying to get into med school. So although they're lovable losers who just wanna get high, the boys aren't complete slackers, either.The movie deals with the duo's journey one evening to White Castle and the various wild (and increasingly unlikely) events that befall them during their travels. Funny thing is, most people can probably relate to this, putting aside the drug portion of the program. You remember your college years, right? Didn't you ever take a road trip somewhere, just on a whim? You could, back then. Sure, you'd think nothing more of trekking up to Niagara Falls, 14 hours away, for a weekend. You didn't have responsibilities back then, so it was cool.Anyway, when Harold and Kumar discover that the White Castle burger joint they thought was nearby has been gone for five years, they decide to drive 45 minutes to lovely, elite Cherry Hill, New Jersey, where the closest WC resides. Along the way, they stop off at Princeton University to try to score weed and hot babes, run into surf punk jerkos who harass them at every opportunity, take the police on a wild chase, get incarcerated, bust out of jail, and even meet Neil Patrick Harris, he of the long-gone Doogie Howser show.All in one night.It's a justifiably ludicrous scenario, and yet its implausibility is what works so strongly for it. For crying out loud, they ride a cheetah! They hang glide! Just the anticipation of What Might Happen Next is enough to keep all but the most apathetic of viewers from giving a rat's buttocks.Through all the chaos, Harold and Kumar don't always see eye to eye - just like in real life. Each fights the other from time to time, with blame for their current predicament being concentrated like rage in an anarchist. But though they're bickering and sniping, we know that Harold and Kumar will be there for each other through it all and will - we fervently hope - survive the night to feast on White Castle hamburgers and fries.There are a few reasons that this movie might not appeal to everyone. There are drug references. There's nudity. There's profanity. And there's the fact that zillions of people have never even heard of White Castle, let alone had one of its famous (infamous?) burgers. White Castle burgers are known for their small size and affordability, making them favorites of college kids. Hey, you can buy a SACK of White Castle Sliders. How cool is that? A sack of burgers! Cho and Penn are appealing as the titular duo, charming but not self-aggrandizing. Doubtless a lot of people watched the movie and said to themselves, ""Dude! I know that guy!"" And indeed I did. I knew a guy who's a dead ringer for Kumar. Absolutely down to every fiber of his personality. So for me, the movie was pleasantly familiar.Do Harold and Kumar make it to their Shangri-La, their Mecca, their holies of holy lands, White Castle? Well, maybe. But as perhaps they could tell you, it's the puff that's the most fun, not the exhaling.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

32,jimbo-53-186511,"Hilarious stoner comedy, much better than Dude where's my car?",7,3 June 2013,"I was quite shocked after watching this film that it was directed by the same person that directed the awful 'Dude where's my car?. All I can say is that Danny Leiner clearly learnt from the mistakes that he made in 'Dude where's my car'? and has actually made a genuinely funny film.The plot is very simple and follows the lives of 2 friends Harold Lee (John Cho - one of the 'milf' guys from American Pie) who plays the uptight, put upon office worker and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) who plays the fun loving laid back medical student. They both decide to take a trip to White Castle in search of 'White Castle' burgers after seeing the burgers advertised on TV (they go on a road trip as a result of both men getting the 'munchies'. Of course this being a stoner comedy, even this simple task turns into a nightmare for our 2 inept stoners and they both go from one hilarious scenario to another.One of the reason this works is because of the chemistry between the 2 leads, Harold and Kumar both bounce off each other. Harold is more reserved than Kumar and is shy and lacks confidence (he is pushed around by his work colleagues and gets awkward around women). Kumar is the total opposite, loud mouthed and over confident. The 2 men are constantly bickering, you still get the impression that they are both looking out for each other.Whilst Harold and Kumar go to White Castle isn't exactly an original film (it's kind of a cross between American Pie, Road Trip & Dude where's my car) it certainly achieved its objective and made me laugh - on several occasions.This film is certainly not for everyone though - if you are easily offended by bad language or drug use then this film is not for you. If however you like films like American Pie or Road Trip then you'll love Harold and Kumar. As 1 reviewer rightly said this is everything that Dude where's my car should have been. So to sum up, if you're looking for a film that will make you laugh and that doesn't require too much thought then this may just be the film for you.

33,davispittman,Maybe it's me I don't know.....,3,13 July 2015,"This movie was just too crude, offensive, stupid and often times tiring to me to be entertaining. Also, just the characters Harold and Kumar themselves annoyed me. I thought that Neil Patrick Harris's cameo would be at least mildly entertaining, but nope, he was even more annoying than Harold and Kumar, which I did not think was even possible. He just tried to get laid throughout the entire movie, and talk about sexy women, which was crude, annoying and got real old, real fast. A few scenes were pretty entertaining, but just a few, unfortunately that trend did not last throughout the film. 3/10 for Harold and Kumar go to White Castle.

After getting high... Harold and Kumar decide to go at the fast-food joint ""White Castle"". What turns into a simple road trip turns into a hilarious all-night adventure.Directed by Danny Leiner (Dude, Where my Car?) made an enjoyable, silly light comedy that turns into a surprisingly well received comedy by the critics. This comedy was a small hit at the box office. This film will age well on DVD.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

36,TOMNEL,"Mixed bag in the humor, but the performances and characters are surprisingly good.",7,9 September 2008,"Harold and Kumar is surprisingly smart and good natured for a stoner movies. Though drugs play a large role, they aren't what the movie's about, which is a huge positive. The jokes may not be the most intelligent in the world, but the movie has a unique way of going from sub-plot to sub-plot, but always feeling like it had a point and wasn't just a random collection of stories. For what this is, it's actually quite good.Harold Lee (John Cho) is a hard worker in his office job. Kumar (Kal Penn) is extremely intelligent, but isn't interested in following his father and brother's footsteps and becoming a doctor. Harold and Kumar have are roommates with different work ethics, but one thing they have in common is they both love to smoke pot. After blazing up one night, they see a commercial for White Castle Hamburgers and go on a quest to find the nearest White Castle. Along the way they get lost and meet many interesting people and get into wacky adventures.The characters of Harold and Kumar are fairly well written, which isn't typical for this genre of movie. Despite some stupidity, they both are likable, and both actors make good leads. The supporting cast mainly consists of B-actors and comedians in cameo roles, some of which work, some of which don't. Anthony Anderson as a burger boy is an example of one who does not work, where Christopher Meloni's hideously bizarre character nicknamed Freakshow produces quite a few laughs.The jokes here are really hit and miss. There are more hits than misses, but there are far too many misses to make this a great movie. The gross out humor is dumb and very plentiful, but at times it can be very funny. Most of the laughs come from the stupidity of the situations. Adversely sometimes this movie is so dumb at times I felt like reading some Stephen Hawking or something.Overall, this movie has a good leading cast and has some good laughs even in the silliest of situations.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins.

37,Boyo-2,The need for fast food is an honorable one,8,11 March 2006,"Most of this movie was hilarious, and it when it wasn't, it was never less than amusing.Two friends have to have White Castle and travel (practically) the entire length of the state of New Jersey in order to feed that craving. At least some of the movie seems to have been filmed in New Jersey. I'm not exactly sure there are any White Castles in Cherry Hill but it does not matter at all.Along the way there are misadventures of several types. Some of the best involve a tow truck driver named Freakshow (played by an unrecognizable Chris Meloni from ""Law & Order SVU) and his sweet young wife, Neil Patrick Harris (!) and a quickie emergency room operation. The stops at Princeton University, a convenience store and a jail cell were good, too. Cameos are a lot of fun, too, especially Ryan Reynolds. Plus I haven't seen 'Anita Bonghit' in a long time, I thought she retired from movie-making, at least since Cheech and Chong stopped making movies. Nice to see her back on screen. I'd only seen the guy who played Harold in ""American Pie"" and had not seen the guy who played Kumar, but they are both very good. Each has a very substantial amount of screen charisma.A lot of fun, worth seeing if you can. 8/10.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
38,aidanratesmovies,One of the best buddy comedies and stoner comedies ever!,10,25 March 2020,"An absolutely entertaining frenzy of jokes, this misadventure is more than worth the watch, and is certainly one of the greatest stoner comedies of all time. John Cho and Kal Penn make for quite a lovely duo, as the film's two main protagonists, and their chemistry is the best a buddy comedy has seen since the likes of Dumb and Dumber. Not only are these two able to land all the jokes that come at them, but the film itself, as basic as it may be at times, is actually surprisingly smart. Although it may seem all over the place, the film is a comedy gold mine, full of outrageously hilarious situations that is sure to make you laugh out loud. The film also contains some rather amusing cameos, most notably from Neil Patrick Harris and Ryan Reynolds. In the end, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle is a more than an amusing comedy, that may play it safe as it starts out, but by the end, will have you buckling your seat belts for the ride.

39,vertigo_14,"Tries too hard to be funny, but will find big audience appeal. (spoilers)",6,17 April 2005,"This is going to appeal to a certain young comedy audience. Probably if you found movies like 'Road Trip' to be hysterical, you'll get a kick out of Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. It's the same brand of humor and style of characters, though condensed into two guys instead of several four or five.Harold and Kumar are like the millennium's answer to the Odd Couple's Oscar and Felix. Harold is the precarious personality, and you can tell it right down to the way he dresses, speaks, and even the job he has. Kumar is the complete opposite, a total rule breaker if it gets him what he wants. Of course, if you've seen these movies before, you should know that Harold won't stay inhibited forever. Compare it to Mile's encouragement for Joel to just say ""what the f***"" in risky business as a way to take advantage of what life has to offer and not worry so much about precalculated risks all the time because things can't always turn out so horribly if you don't always follow the game plan.Harold and Kumar go to White Castle is essentially that. The buddies get high one night and, once having gotten ""the munchies,"" decide that the best provisions are at White Castle. Only, that symbolic fast food joint is no easy goal, and the entire movie is basically the disastrous duo running into one weird dilemma after the next as they try desperately to make their way to White Castle some towns over. It is a plot like Dude Where's My Car, except it's not completely dumbed down and utterly useless like that movie is. Like many movies similar to Harold and Kumar, though, this one features more unbelievable comedy (such as riding a cheetah through the forest or Doogie Howser's Neil Patrick Harris scandalizing your memories of sweet Doogie, playing himself, a guy who gets totally trashed throughout the movie). For me, however, these incredulous plot points strive too hard to be funny. Probably because the story is just too simplistic to bring up too much conflict. Although, they don't do much with the quick exchange of minute-or-two subplots either, where the filmmakers took ample advantage of cameo appearances.Young New Jersey residents, be on the lookout as this film takes place in many Jersey locations (filmed in Hoboken and probably on campus at Princeton), though filming was also shared with Canada locations.This one may be worth your time if you've enjoyed this particular brand of comedy before. Some, like myself, may not be too amused with it. But, there's only one way to find out...",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

The story also develops quite blindly with no real relevance from one instance to the other. But that essentially the essence of wild night comedies, although this movie sure take it quite a step further. Fortunately, the movie supports that crazy story development with quite strong comedy and humor. The thing with Liane and NPH passing by with the stolen car makes this movie very unpredictable. It's like you will already know that things will end up funnily since this is a comedy, but you really want to see how it does. The acting overall is actually quite good.

The continuity suffers a bit, but its done so well that it feels seemless in the moment.The comedy writing is good enough that it holds up over 16 years, the majority of which is really funny.

First of all, you get that tired old plot where two friends have to reach some kind of destination while meeting all kinds of adversity. A movie like that is released about once every twelve minutes, and the formula isn't getting any newer. Then you have your typical underdogs who never stand up to anyone, obviously until they reach that clichéd breaking point. And just to be on the safe side, there's also a mind-numbingly banal love sub-plot. Why the hell did I like this movie then? Well, the destination in this movie is White Castle, that ought to count for something. Also Kal Penn and John Cho are pretty sympathetic heroes, their antics are predictable but that doesn't make them less hilarious. And the hallucinations, God the hallucinations.

44,brando647,Excellent stoner comedy...,7,16 February 2006,"This movie is terrific, not that it should win an Oscar or anything. It is just the funniest stoner comedy I've seen. This movie had me and my roommates laughing straight through for the entire hour and a half. There isn't really a whole lot to say about a movie like this. I can't exactly rave about the cinematography, plot, special effects, etc. Because none of those things really matter in this film. The sole purpose of this film is to make the audience laugh, and it does a great job.John Cho and Kal Penn have a great buddy chemistry together and play off each other perfectly. I think the real stars of this movie, though, are the cameo appearances. We get some hilarious comedic performances from Jamie Kennedy, Ryan Reynolds, and Anthony Anderson. The best cameo comes in the form of Neil Patrick Harris, who plays himself. The man obviously knows how to take a joke, since he doesn't mind playing himself as being on a night-long acid trip for laughs.Not really much else you can say about a movie like this. If you're in the mood for some laughs, check it out. Just don't go looking to this movie for intelligent humor (those people should check out Kevin Smith's work). This movie is more for people who enjoyed ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""Half-Baked"".",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Its packed with hilarious comedy and underlying the story is a tale of social satire about the lack of equality between races.The movie plays well and aside from being rude, crude and outrageously absurd at times; it never becomes offensive, despite the nature of its theme.It's definitely one of the funniest movies to come out in years, it really will have you laughing for the entire ride.8/10",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
46,sme_no_densetsu,Mildly amusing at best,6,7 September 2008,"""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" is about a couple of stoners who get the munchies and decide to take a trip to White Castle. Along the way they face multiple obstacles but never lose sight of their ultimate goal: delicious hamburgers.Whether or not you enjoy this movie will depend on whether or not you enjoy stoner comedy in general. Personally, I don't care for that sub-genre at all, particularly since at least every second joke seems meant to elicit the reaction, ""Oh man, he is SO stoned!"". This film is isn't quite so lazy in that regard but I still found it unimaginative for the most part. Granted, NPH as himself was an inspired touch and I got a kick out of the Wilson Phillips sing-along but besides that it was just a lot of clichés and pointless diversions. Add to that toilet humour that is sure to thrill anyone under the age of 12 and you've got a recipe for boredom on my part.In retrospect, it was perhaps too much to expect a simple stoner comedy to include much humour that could be appreciated without being under the influence. Nevertheless, I wish that I had realized that the director's last film was ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" because that would have given me a none-too-subtle clue about the actual merits of this film.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

48,oneguyrambling,Whaddya know - a stoner comedy that is actually funny!,7,27 December 2010,"Harold and Kumar etc is a teen-gross out-sex comedy done better than most.Harold is the Asian guy and it must be said a little stereotypical. He is an investment banker, very conscientious and organised. In short he is a squeaky clean uptight perfectionist.Kumar is the Indian guy (tech-support not ""How"") who is Harold's roommate. He is a slacker genius with a Dr father and brother, though he doesn't want to follow in their footsteps even though he already has the knowledge. He is a disorganised and irresponsible slacker.The two get stoned on a Friday night and decide (as the title demands) that they need White Castle burgers. Nothing else will suffice. So off they go.Along the way they repeatedly meet the ""extreme"" gang of moron X-Sports enthusiasts and run into the hot white chick that lives in their building and whom Harold covets, but can't bring himself to talk to.On top of that, in between setting off and chomping down on the first burger they:* Take an impromptu drug hunt at the local university campus and get sidetracked by a group of apparently uptight Asian students before nearly-banging some hot English chicks.* Get help from a seemingly diseased and feral backwoods gent who offers to let them ""use"" his hot young wife.* Cross paths with a zonked out poon-crazed Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser MD!) who steals their car and ""stains"" the upholstery.* Get jailed for jaywalking.* Ride an escaped cheetah and hang glide to freedom.Being a gross-out sex comedy there are fluid jokes, bodily function jokes, gross jokes and d*ck jokes. On top of that being that the two leads are non-white there are a bunch of race-related jokes, but they tend to very carefully and painstakingly toe the line of inoffensiveness.There are a couple of good unexpected cameos, most notably the aforementioned Doogie Howser, but also Anthony Anderson has a good scene. Thankfully neither cameo has the ""Look who we got in our movie"" factor.Harold and Kumar are both likable guys, their banter is unforced and seems pretty natural despite all the freaky movie stuff that is always going on around them, and you generally want them to win. (And it must be said you reallllly want them to punch the ""Extreeeeme"" idiots!)The film ended on a good note that really set up a sequel that I think was well deserved, only when it finally arrived it was pretty obvious that they were unable to capture whatever made the first film such an unexpected hit.Of course the film gives good coverage at the end to the titular burger chain, but when they put the name in the film's title that is a given.One last thing. These films tend to have the most awful soundtracks featuring teeny-boppers, try-hard punk anthems and wannabe rappers. But Harold and Kumar has maybe half a dozen songs, and all of them are pretty good, and I hadn't heard any of them before or since. That is a fair achievement in itself these days.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Whaddya know? A stoner comedy that is actually funny even if you aren't ""toking up"", or whatever the unemployed (or NBA players) call it these days. Boobs, tunes and frequent laughs without mean pointless spirited humour (which has its place, just not in these films) good stuff.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
49,Spuzzlightyear,Let's Go Get Some Mountain Dew!,8,31 July 2006,"I was actually quite amazed at how funny, smart and terrific ""Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle"" was. I was actually preparing myself for the stupidest movie imaginable. While this movie DOES have it's juvenile moments, it's also filled with some REALLY clever ideas and lines that made this one extremely enjoyable. This movie is about two stoners (with actual bright futures), who after a night of toking, get the munchies and decide that White Castle is the only way to go! Thus, this begins a SERIOUSLY funny road trip with racist cops, raccoons and uh, Neil Patrick Harris met along the way! John Cho and Kal Penn do a great job as the title stoners here, but they are almost eclipsed by the great supporting cast. Look for breakout Canadian actor (and personal fave) Dov Tiefeenbach as a particularly zonked weed dealer). But I think my favorite characters are the EXTREEEEEME dudes who do nothing but do EXTREEEEEME sports, eat EXTREEEEME Doritos and drink Mountain Dew! They also say ""Extreme"" a lot. These guys gave me the extreme giggles. They were great. A real surprise, this is something I wouldn't mind owning.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
50,napierslogs,"""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" is funny all the way through",8,25 September 2010,"""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" is a night full of laughs. It is fairly low-end humour but with enough substance to it that I'm not ashamed of enjoying it.Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) get high one night and after seeing a commercial for White Castle burgers they then get a craving, which becomes an obsessive need, to get to White Castle. And that is the entire movie, but it works marvellously. Their night is filled with detours, obstacles, and illegal antics all of which are very funny. The movie sets a very fast pace, and it never lets up. All the gags and high-jinks have quick timing and they don't get dull. It's funny all the way through.Cho and Penn have great on screen camaraderie and you join in on their quest for White Castle burgers. There are a lot of jokes on marijuana, on racial stereotypes, and on New Jersey. There's enough social commentary that the humour even seems intelligent. I recommend ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" for the not-faint-of-heart.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
51,film-critic,What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris? Why is he so horny?,2,23 January 2005,"After watching this film I checked online to see how much this film cost to be made. Normally, I do not do this, but upon seeing this movie I had to see where all the money went. When I discovered that it cost nine million dollars to create, I was flabbergasted. Where did they put all the money? For those that argue that the money is in the production, I would beg to differ. Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle was one of the worst productions that I have ever seen. Even for a pre-teen comedy, it continually felt fake and ""sound-staged"" instead of fun and humorous. You could tell, from scene to scene, which ones actually involved Harold and Kumar being out in the real world and those that were created in a Hollywood studio. The infamous green-screen was very apparent in nearly 80% of the film, giving us that impression that not much was spent to make this a quality picture. Again, I ask, where did the nine million go? The acting was average. You are not dealing with comedy heavy hitters in this film, but instead two actors that gained some popularity due to films that actually spent their money on production, American Pie and Van Wilder. While I will admit that both of these films stand on their own two feet, I cannot agree that Harold and Kumar does the same. The acting hurt the comedy, which ultimately hurt the film as a whole. I think what hurt the actors directly were the apparent lack of character development that was so desperately needed to find these guys funny. I think I may have laughed a bit more at their jokes if I knew who they were and what pressures that they were feeling in life to get to where they currently are in life. The brief seconds at the beginning of the film just didn't cut it for me. For those that claim that they are just ""stoners"", I would have to argue that they are more. Their high spirits and sense of fun does not come from smoking weed, but because they are not challenged in life and desperately seek adventure. That is who I saw in this film, not just stoners, but adventurers that needed their quest. Sadly, I do not think the general population saw this because of the crass humor, the cheapened production values, and overall the lack of defined acting by John Cho and Kal Penn). Do I need to ask where the nine million dollars went again?!? Aside from the horrible acting by our guides, and the funnier parts of the film coming from our side performers like Jamie Kennedy and Ryan Reynolds, the jokes just didn't seem like they worked for the most part. The Neil Patrick Harris scenes felt as if they were placed in the film just to be ""cool"" and to resurrect a struggling actor that had some success as a child. I didn't capture the full purpose that the director went with Harris because the budget was NINE MILLION DOLLARS! Another actor could have been funnier, but instead Harris was called upon to grope women and provide some of the unfunnier moments. The girls in the bathroom scene were uncalled for and definitely lacked the actual comedy appeal. Perhaps I am getting to old, but I desire more films like Van Wilder that relies heavily on the sharp tongue of the main actor instead of amateurish humor. I continually felt that the director used over used techniques of past teen comedies to monopolize his film and make himself some cash. He was not being creative, but instead repetitive, and it hurt this film.Finally, I need to bring up the production values again, especially near the end of the film where it became apparent that money had run dry and the green-screen effect needed to be used and abused. You could tell that you were on a set and not actually following two twenty-something on their adventure. This completely ruined my sense of fun for this film. With a nine million-dollar budget, could they not get actual shots of these two driving in a real car? To me, we moved past that technique in the early 60s, and we do not need to repeat it for this feature. I felt cheated watching this film, wondering where my money and Hollywood's money went, thinking that perhaps the director is lighting his own weed with $100 bills while enjoying his free samples from White Castle since they used the name in the film. Cheapened production values is what soured this film for me.Overall, I was high disappointed in this film. With fresh thoughtful comedies being released everyday that actually use your mind and intelligence to make you laugh, this film resorted to last-years trend (already too dated) of bathroom humor and nudity to make their characters likable and work. Cho and Penn need to work a bit harder on some supporting roles before making another big jump, which in this case was very premature. The supporting stars in this film had a chance to shine through and they took it proving that Ryan Reynolds could be the next Chevy Chase and Jamie Kennedy is funny. Outside of this, I am still seeking an answer to the age-old riddle of where the NINE MILLION-DOLLAR budget disappeared to! Grade: ** out of *****",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

53,hall895,What you crave? Could be.,7,17 April 2006,"As stoner comedies go, well, you could do a lot worse than Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle. It's not a consistent laugh riot by any means, rather hit and miss. But there are enough comedic gems along the way to make it worth your while.As you would expect from the title the focus of the film is on Harold and Kumar, two stoner friends who in what may be among the simplest plots in movie history, are going to White Castle. That's it, there's your plot. Believe it or not enough things can happen on the way to White Castle to make this a rather entertaining movie. The lead actors, John Cho as serious, straight-laced Asian guy Harold, and Kal Penn as the free-spirited Indian guy Kumar play off each other brilliantly throughout. Both Cho and Penn do a great job of bringing these very different, but in a lot of ways, very similar characters to life. Our ""heroes"" find themselves in a number of uncomfortable situations and manage to find the comic gold in each of them. Well, most of them anyway. Cho and Penn are supported by a wide array of supporting characters. One of the most notable is Christopher Merloni as Freakshow, a guy who suffice to say is not the most attractive fellow. But really stealing the show by playing against Doogie Howser type is Neil Patrick Harris in an inspired cameo as, well, Neil Patrick Harris. Hey, you never know who you'll meet on the way to White Castle.Some of the gags may misfire and a few sequences may go on a bit too long but in the end your journey with Harold and Kumar will leave a smile on your face. There's more to like here than there is to quibble with. And at those moments when things do start to drag you can rest assured knowing something better is usually right around the corner. If there is such a thing as a smart stoner comedy, Harold and Kumar is it. Well-written and well-acted...that's generally a winning combination and that is the case here.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
54,CitizenCaine,Harold & Kumar Take Us To Laugh Land,8,18 July 2005,"There's this smart Asian guy, Harold (John Cho), who works in an office and gets work dumped on him. He calls his pre-med Indian friend, Kumar (Kal Penn), to say that he can't party with him because he's got too much work to do. Kumar won't take no for an answer, and later while they're both doping it up, they get the munchies for some White Castle Hamburgers. That's just the beginning of this politically incorrect potpourri of potshots at ethnic stereotyping, road movies, and the American Dream. The film is reminiscent of early 1970's blacksploitation films where only the white characters are stereotypes: Manipulative, white male co-workers (full of their own self-importance) dumping work on a minority; the tight-ass college administrator (Fred Willard); the dopey pothead dealer; slutty college girls and housewives; nerdy security guards; corrupt, racist cops; racist skinheads. They're all here. We even get Neil Patrick Harris, from Doogie Howser fame, as we've never seen him before. The casting of every part (from large to small) in this film is superb, including Anthony Anderson as a drive-through attendant for Burger Shack. The film is well written by Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg; the dialog feels so life-like at times that we forget we're watching a movie. The film's scenes come across as vignettes, many of which are memorable and howlingly funny. The Burger Shack scene with Anthony Anderson, the operating room scene, the dream sequence in graphics that Harold (John Cho) has, the cheetah bit, the police station scenario, and the dream sequence that Kumar (Kal Penn) has about dope are all very funny. On top of this, we get Hollywood in-jokes tossed in for good measure. This is quite simply one of the funniest movies I've seen in recent years for pure out loud laughs. For once we're not overwhelmed by incessant, inane hip-hop or pop music in the background of a movie geared toward the under thirty demographic, which will ensure the film's posterity. It's sure to be a staple on college campuses for years to come. *** of 4 stars.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

56,jon.h.ochiai,It's all about the Journey...,8,8 August 2004,"With the title ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"", how can one not see this movie? Well, one could, and would be missing a very funny movie. H&R is genius creative marketing, and the director Danny Leiner's movie is actually funnier than it's trailer. The movie demographic is probably from 15 to 25-- totally not mine. Written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, the story is more hit than miss, with inspired moments and a drugged out cool. Consequently, the humor can be gross out bathroom humor. However, ""Harold & Kumar"" can be clever funny, and has moments of comic genius. In the beginning, Kumar(Kal Penn) is having a medical school interview, and the dean (a classically clueless Fred Ward) asks him why he isn't already in school with his perfect MCAT scores. Kumar says, ""Just because you're hung like moose, doesn't mean you have to do porn."" I was rolling. John Cho and Kal Penn as Harold and Kumar have a natural chemistry and are completely charming. Cho and Penn overcome much of the movie's inconsistencies. Harold (Cho) is the straight Korean guy who works as an associate at an investment bank. Kumar is the free spirited Indian guy, who interviews with medical schools, but never accepts. That way his father keeps supporting him. It's Friday, and one of the partners at Harold's firm dumps a report on Harold, so that he can party with some babes-- unbeknown-st to Harold. The report is due on Saturday. Harold is not having a particularly stellar day.Kumar wants to smoke pot with his bud, regardless of Harold's deadline. Back at their apartment complex, we meet Maria (a gorgeous Paula Garces), the object of Harold's affection. Harold is in love with her, but has yet to utter a complete sentence to her in their daily elevator rides. So Harold and Kumar smoke weed and watch TV. Then they get the munchies, and thus begins their quest for White Castle-- somewhere in New Jersey. Give props to Leiner, Hurwitz, and Schlossberg for ignoring political correctness and having fun with stereotypes. Even in this simplistic comedy, this frames the story as the Harold and Kumar evolve-- after the high subsides. The scenes where Harold is giving career advice at a college Asian club meeting or where Kumar is talking with his father and older brother who are both doctors at the hospital are funny, and have an air of authenticity. Also the story plays off the fact that our duo are perceived geeks and are targets of the Extreme Sports Punks. ""Harold and Kumar"" has some of the funniest scenes that sometimes blur lines of taste. Regardless, it's funny. In their quest for White Castle burgers and... getting laid, they end up at the home of mechanic Freakshow (an unrecognizable Chris Meloni). The ""threesome"" encounter with Lianne (the stunning Malin Akerman), Freakshow's wife, is hot and hilarious-- more than the trailer tease which is good. Perhaps, H&K's defining moment is when the high duo ride a cheetah through the woods. You have to see the movie for this. Neil Patrick Harris as himself is awesome. H&K pick the Harris on the road on the way to White Castle. Amazingly, his character is integral to the plot-- really. Harris is having fun playing against his own casting stereotype, and doing it well. He is totally out there. You can figure out how this all ends. ""Harold and Kumar"" is not a cinematic masterpiece, but it is a lot of fun. John Cho is a talented reactive actor, some of his expression are priceless. Kal Penn is a great smart guy rebel, and a good actor. The two together are a solid comic team. I would see, for example ""Harold and Kumar Go to Disneyland"".",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
57,cultfilmfan,Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle,7,5 February 2005,"Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle, is about an uptight Asian young man named Harold Lee, who is picked on at work and never has enough courage to ask the girl out in the elevator that he has a crush on.

He also likes to smoke marijuana a lot. After getting high one night the two of them decide to go to a fast food restaurant called White Castle, and get some burgers. They find out that there is no longer one in town so they will have to drive aways to get to the nearest one. Along the way they encounter many interesting people and get into a lot of trouble with the cops and during this one night have the adventure of a lifetime and have an experience they will never forget on their way to White Castle. Harold And Kumar, is a comedy much similar to the Cheech and Chong films from the 70's and 80's. While not as funny as the Cheech and Chong films, Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle is very entertaining.

The actors did a great job and were both very funny. The writing was hilarious and fit to a T of what a story line should be. When I was in film class in school my teacher actually used this as a reference of how a perfect movie is with a beginning middle and end with lots of conflict.This movie is about an Asian American and an Indian American who are best friends and real potheads. One night after a day of work they are sitting on their couch getting high when the munchies kick in. For those of you who don't smoke weed the munchies is a state of uncontrollable hunger. They decide to cure their munchies fit with some White Castle that they just saw a commercial for. So they set out on their quest to get burgers running into problem after problem mainly because of getting high.This movie was just perfect from start to finish.

63,TheOtherFool,Well... it's *kinda* funny,5,28 January 2005,"If you like movies such as 'Dude, where's my car?' or 'Road Trip', 'Harold and Kumar' might just be your taste. Now, that might not come as any surprise as H&K share the same director as Dude. What *is* a surprise is that many people see H&K as more than just an easy 'crazy kids getting high, wanting to see breasts' kinda movie. To them, it's something more. When I first went to the IMDb page of Harold and Kumar, there was a comment on it's main page by a certain willden21, who claimed H&K was a 'Hilarious Social Satire'.Mind you, this comment by me is by no means intended to slam that statement. In fact, considering it's high IMDb rating and the positive reviews it got from many, young and old, I must be missing something. But what is it? Let's start with the beginning then.Harold (John Cho) is a shy, hard-working Asian guy who, on Friday night of all nights, is being put up to do some overtime work for the office he works for. This to not only his shock, but also that of his intelligent yet lazy Indian roommate Kumar (Ethan Embry, who looks like a cross between Zach Braff and Mark Ruffalo, don't you think?). Anyway, the two stoners find themselves hungry just as a commercial for fast food joint White Castle come up. Having a serious case of the munchies, the two set out to find the nearest White Castle. As you would have guessed, that is easier said than done.I won't go into all the detours the two make, but they include mean skater kids, a game of Battlesh*ts, a guy named Freakshow, a cheetah with horse skills, and a mysterious hitchhiker who turns out to be actor Neil Patrick Harris, famous for the TV show Doogie Houser apparently (never heard of that).Now, considering all this, why is H&K something else, something better than the two movies I named in the beginning? Perhaps people notice the fact our two heroes are not your typical surfer dudes, and find that so refreshing they overlook the fact that 'the racial factor' is only very slightly there, and not really played out very well. Another point of interest might be the fact that Harold in the end shakes of his shyness to ask out the girl of his dreams, and yells at his superiors at work. Or that Kumar finally decides to make something of his life. But to me, it was too little too late.What's left is an entertaining movie about two guys on the road for some hash and some breasts.

from a BD, in fact there are moments where its a bit on the DNR side. AQ is decent, it does not have that great depth to
it and for the most part it is not a very excellent sounding mix. The 7.1 soundstage is a bit wasted here. On the special
features it has a good assortment of them which were imported from the DVD. There's a commentary track, lots of
deleted scenes and other goodies.Overall, a very entertaining and funny stoner comedy that really make for its two protagonist a satisfying and craving
night to head over to a White Castle. After all, the taste of those little white crystal onions that just explode in your
mouth and that juicy burger and those little soft breads just make me wanna burn this motha down now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on Warner Bros 4k ultra hd release April 2021",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
66,movieguy1021,Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle: 5/10,5,7 August 2004,"Do you smoke pot? Neither do I, but to enjoy a stoner comedy, you don't need to be high. In fact, you don't even need to see the main characters smoke to understand that they're potheads. Think of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, or even all of the late night tokes that have been taken while watching Scooby-Doo, with that perpetual pothead Shaggy. One that takes the stoner movie from its almost innocent counterparts into the teen movie genre of the 80s that we all know and love is Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. It's the type of movie that advertises that its director also directed Dude, Where's My Car, and thinks that touting that an actor was in Van Wilder is a good thing. That's exactly the type of movie White Castle is. It's for those who like stuff like Dude (which I didn't see).Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are stereotypes of their respective races. Harold is a milquetoast investment banker who can't stand up for himself, and Kumar is training to be an M.D., but doesn't really think anything of it. After some Friday night pot smoking, the two roommates crave White Castle burgers. They travel around in their car, smoking the occasional weed (until they run out), and getting into all sorts of trouble looking for the infamous 24/7 White Castle in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. They meet Neil Patrick Harris, aka Doogie Hauser, get in trouble with the law, and other partially drug-induced scenarios.White Castle has its moments. By far the funniest bit of the film was Kumar's fantasy involving a huge bag of marijuana. A couple other bits are humorous, but are either too obvious or stretched out away from its potential. When they need to get a ride, they hitchhike with a horribly disfigured man. They whisper to each other about how disgusting he looks. Isn't that about the most obvious joke you could use? And, although the main characters aren't as much like the aforementioned teen comedies, it's sickeningly refreshing to see women put into a misogynist style. I'm not promoting sexism, but in such movies as American Pie (where Cho stars), the women always outsmart the men. But the awkwardness and the natural chemistry of the two stars work to the movie's advantage, and instead of making the characters the stereotypes others make them out to be, they create three-dimensional characters. That's not saying that everything in the script was as well developed. The relationships that the main characters have with their ""love interests"", for instance, are barely fleshed out. There's a few humorous scenes with them (love that ""baggage"" scene), but nothing spectacular.The no-holds-barred feel of the movie worked both to its advantage and to its disadvantage. We see nudity usually not shown in teen comedies now, we have some bad taste (and not all of it sexual, like Pie), and we have lots of drug usage. Most movies now shy away from that, and it's this lack of boundaries that give this movie a free spirit, I suppose. A place to go where no recent teen comedy has gone before. But on the flip side, we have huge defecation contests and random grotesqueness. I don't expect everything to be tasteful, but it still takes away from the movie. And is Fred Willard contractually obligated to star in every comedy of late? I love the guy, but why not give, say, Chevy Chase or someone a chance? I did like that scene, though. It, like most of the other hit-or-miss humor, comes obviously but is pulled off in a good way. Some of the humor is even subtle (see the shirt that Harold, I believe, wears in his apartment). But since this humor is hit-or-miss, it obviously either hits or misses. Many times it misses, but when it hits, it ain't exactly a bulls-eye. Just enough to keep you from walking out of the theater. And with the box office results of this movie, they need to keep as many people in the theater as possible.My rating: 5/10Rated R for strong language, sexual content, drug use and some crude humor.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
67,OriginalMovieBuff21,Decent comedy with a few hysterical moments,6,5 May 2005,"I borrowed Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle from a friend after hearing how hilarious this film was. Personally, I've always thought this film looked really stupid since the day in July 2004 when the first trailer came out for it. After I saw it, I thought the film was decent. It was such a simple film to make it's not even funny and there was a lot of scenes in the movie that got it off other movies such as Road Trip or Tommy Boy. There were a few really funny moments such as the Marijuna Kills commercial, the Neil Patrick Harris scenes, and the cop scenes. I mean those were really funny moments in the movie that made me laugh but not laugh hard enough like I was hoping to. To me Kal Penn was the funniest character of the film as the Indian stoner named Kumar. Overall, a decent comedy with a good old few laughs but overrated in a lot of ways.Hedeen's Outlook: 6/10 ** C-",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
68,Antagonisten,Better than expected,5,2 February 2005,"I'm no fan of so-called ""stoner"" comedy. You know, comedy where the plot usually revolves around people doing stupid things while stoned out of their head. But this is actually quite entertaining.Harold & Kumar are two stoner friends. They sit smoking in their apartment one night and suddenly get the munchies for some hamburgers. They decide to go to the restaurant ""White Castle"". And this is the start of an all-night road trip that features some interesting stops...What makes this work is mostly the acting. Both John Cho as Harold and Kal Penn as Kumar are great. Kumars laid-back style and Harolds disbelief at what is happening to them is just hilarious. The comedy is otherwise mostly like other movies of the genre. Which means that most of it is under the belt, much of it is VERY low and the rest is mostly about stupid things people do when stoned. But it works so much better here than in many other movies. I have seen many comparisons to ""Dude Where's My Car"" which is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. This is so much better, probably because there seems to at least someone on the set here who has a feeling for what's funny and what's not.So, even if you hated ""Dude Where's My Car"" this might be worth seeing. It was for me. It's gives you a couple of laughs and it's fun for as long as it lasts, even though it's nothing memorable. I rate it 5/10.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
69,EmperorNortonII,"One Long, Strange Trip",7,1 September 2004,"""Harold & Kumar go To White Castle"" tells the story of two stoners (who aren't necessarily slackers) on a quest for their Holy Grail of hamburgers. On the way, they have a crazy load of adventures, and encounter all sorts of odd characters: other stoners, ""extreme"" skinheads who turn out to be poseurs, trigger-happy racist policemen, a freakish tow truck driver, an escaped cheetah and Neil Patrick ""Doogie Hauser"" Harris himself.  The main characters, John Cho and Kal Penn, play their characters adequately.  As characters of Asian heritage, they play up to ethnic stereotypes, then explode them.  The humor in the movie is mostly low-brow. (You'd have to be high yourself to find some of it funny!) But there are some enjoyable sequences, such as Harold's semi-animated fantasy with Maria.  So ""Harold & Kumar"" has its good qualities, and is worth a look.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
70,MichaelMargetis,The New Cheech & Chong?... No Freakin' Way!,4,2 April 2005,"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Burger isn't very funny at all. It has it's moments, but it's just like Dude, Where's My Car 2. The jokes are very stupid to anyone who isn't as high as Robert Downey, Jr. on New Year's Eve. But the one thing that kind of attracts you to the film is the amazing screen presence of the two stars. For some reason, if they even aren't being funny they interest you, and reel you in.The cameos in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle are numerous. Ranging from the star of the Jamie Kennedy Show as a pervert in the woods, to Law & Order: SVU's Christopher Meloni as a wart-faced redneck who wants to get Harold and Kumar in a four way between him and his unexpectedly attractive wife. Also, most surprising is Neil Patrick Harris as himself. Harris is portrayed as a sex-crazed drunken loser constantly on experimental drugs (which I believe isn't really what he is like in real life.) Fred Willard too has a cameo, as the admissions officer at Harvard University  quite a change from his role in Best in Show as the lax, and crude dog show host.I said Harold & Kumar isn't very funny and it is not. Except in about three parts of the movie. Those three parts are absolutely hysterical, but again can't make up for the whole movie. Very often in Harold & Kumar you'll find yourself not so much interested in the story, but interested in who will appear in the next cameo performance. In conclusion, Harold & Kumar is nothing more than average. I would definitely wait for video, or HBO. People's over twenty-five will mostly find it stupid. Hell, I'm 14 and I find it stupid.

On their way they will encounter many obstacles including a raccoon, a racist officer and a horny Neil Patrick Harris.I was recommended 'Harold & Kumar Get the Munchies' (I'm in the UK), after i had watched and enjoyed the American Pie series. Although, this didn't make me laugh out loud as much, it definitely was a lot of fun to watch. I didn't know what i would think of it, as i am someone who doesn't support drugs, but i just found this movie hilarious and entertaining.

One of my favourites involves opening the door of my Moscow hotel room to discover it had been replaced by a bottomless pit to Hell, before the stony-faced, matronly concierge pointed out I'd been staring into a walk-in closet for several minutes. So here's a comedy for all of us, the buried message being the suitably far-out ""the universe unfolds as it should"". Chinese-American Harold (Cho) and Asian-American Kumar (Kal Penn) get mashed one night and, with the single-mindedness of the truly blitzed, decide to go out and get 'White Castle' burgers from the near-mystical 24-hour emporium.

The two leads are fantastic, particularly the guy playing Harold. He's just very funny. I love how this movie illuminates racism but also how the two guys, and all the other characters, laugh at themselves. For example, the earnest young men and women who fawn over Harold when he visits the student lounge, sending up the stereotype of the straight-laced goody-goody Asian student. Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle shows how very few Hollywood movies have Asians in the lead roles, and that's a travesty. Here, they are front and centre, giving their view of the world but also laughing at white guys, black guys and everyone else. One thing I didn't like was the emphasis on marijuana. It just got a bit labored in the end. I'm not a prude, but it's a bit of a crutch to rely on getting stoned as a joke.

76,supertom-3,Funniest Film in a very long time! Ulitmate Stoner comedy!,8,6 July 2005,"Every now and again a film passes under the hype radar and takes Hollywood by surprise. Napoleon Dynamite did it and so did Harold And Kumar. Over the years we have had many stoner comedies, slacker comedies, teen comedies, which revolve around debauchery and getting laid. Harold And Kumar represents a slight change to the usual with an underlying satirising of racial stereotypes that make the film better than it's genre. Harold And Kumar comes under the stoner category, however this is a post teenager comedy focusing on an Asian and Indian pair of twenty something buddies. One with a respectable job, and the other with the potential to be a great doctor. However both never achieve as much as they can because of getting stoned or letting their racial backgrounds dictate their lives. As a co-worker of the Asian Harold (Jon Cho) comments ""Asian guys love crunching numbers!"" That is exactly what he does, and his superiors take advantage of him. One night they get stoned and suddenly get the urge to have some munchies, but of course only one snack will do, White Castle burgers. So on ensues a hunt across country to found a White Castle to gorge themselves on the burgers. It's a simple premise and yet another stoner comedy shouldn't work, but the film is filled with some many quotable lines and ludicrously funny situations and side characters that it ends up being the most funny comedy in ages. This is even funnier than the American Pie series.The cast are good. It is a refreshing change not watching a bunch of horny, drug addled white college guys for once. The genius in having two ethnic minorities in the lead instantly makes this film feel unique and gives it a more affable charm, while Jon Cho and Kal Penn are excellent in the leading roles. The delivery is funny and the chemistry between the two is superb, making funny situations all the more enjoyable. Cho plays the straight man while Penn is the more outrageous and that balance of nutty and straight works well, with Penn the instigator leading the conservative Cho astray. The supporting cast is filled with hilarious cameos from Anthony Anderson, Neil Patrick Harris, Ryan Reynolds, Jamie Kennedy but especially Christopher Meloni as freak-show who is perhaps the most hilarious creation in many years.This really is a funny comedy, it's got gross out gags by the truck load but it's so briskly paced, laced with outrageous situations such as a bare backed cheetah ride, as well as some clever jokes too that it will certainly please most comedy fans. This is certainly a comedy I'd add to my collection. ****",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Yeah, there's a lot of poop and fart and penis jokes, and that ruins some of it, but there's also a lot of genuine hilarity about race relations and middle America that feels authentic. Sure, it's a silly stoner comedy, but it's at least one that makes (somewhat) sense.I also love these types of comedies that deal with one crazy night (Dazed + Confused, American Graffiti, Can't Hardly Wait), and though this isn't about graduation, there's that same sense of spontaneity and immediacy developed here.

Kal Penn and John Cho have much better chemistry on the screen than what Seam William Scott and Ashton Kutcher did; instead of looking like two guys missing their brains, harold and kumar where more normal, it looked like they had a life.

It's basically a carbon copy of the ""pretty-girl-taking-a-wet-crap"" scene from TEEN MOVIE, but with two girls instead of one. I guess that's what passes for originality these days.But, as an exercise in brainless gross-out comedy, HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE will hold your attention.

I had many doubts going into the theater, after seeing Danny Leiner's previous film, Dude, Where's My Car?, but it turned out to be entertaining and, although it had many moments of stupidity, it also managed to bring in many moments of humor that were actually thoughtful as well. The story is a little weak, with lots of nonsequitars thrown in, and the characters are a little hard to believe at times. There are other weaknesses, such as some less-than-funny segments (including a dream segment that doesn't work that well). And it was stupid. A lot of the humor was plainly scatological, which didn't really affect laughter, but there were a few moments when the whole theater erupted into laughter. It's not a great movie by any stretch, but it is funny, even if it lacks solid laughs throughout. If you're going to watch this, I recommend your check your brain at the door.

Although, not as funny as the first time I saw it, it still has so much humor that is hard not to acknowledge. It's the type of film that will be hit or miss with audience goers. Either you love or you hate it. I've heard both from different people, and that's generally the consensus. I for one, loved it, however.Starting out at the beginning of the film, a twenty-something guy working at a office decides to go party for the weekend, and tells Harlod (Cho), to do the rest of his work, and have it ready by the next morning at nine a.m., making an excuse that he and his partner have to meet clients that night. Harlod, upset, calls his friend Kumar (Penn), and tells him he will be unable to smoke some fine chronic that evening.Kumar, nonnegotiable, tells him to not worry about his work, that he will have time to do it, and convinces Harold to come home and party with him. After they get high, they decide to go to White Castle for some food, since they're hungry. Throughout the rest of the film, mishaps, adventures and crazy people find their way into the two unlikely pair's lives.I love this film. It is one of the funniest and most honest teen to twenty-something films I've really, ever seen, and it is more than just a weed movie. There is so much humor in the film, not only in that of speech, or dialogue, but also in facial expressions and unspoken situations, they get themselves into.I will warn some of you, that there is some nudity, scachalint humor, and of course drug activity, not to mention sex. The only thing I will say for it, is that they keep each of these to a minimum in every situation, and it's worth watching, to get to the almost unbearably funny parts.I guarantee that if you liked, 'Road Trip', or movies in that same sort of field or genre, you'll love 'Harlod and Kumar'.

89,anhedonia,Surprisingly funny,8,9 August 2004,"[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]Any 15 seconds of ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" offer more enjoyment than ""The Village,"" ""Raising Helen"" and ""Connie and Carla"" combined.Like most comedies, ""Harold and Kumar"" has hit-or-miss gags. But, surprisingly, there are plenty more hits than misses. Many of the hits might be silly - this is a stoner comedy, after all - but they're rarely stupid; in fact, they're often uproariously good. There are some genuine belly laughs here.The problem with most recent bake movies is that they've been terribly unfunny, with brainless characters stuck in humorless, bland situations.What sets ""Harold and Kumar"" apart are its winning, charming stars - Kal Penn and John Cho. Writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg sensibly avoid turning Harold and Kumar into cultural stereotypes for cheap laughs; instead they make Harold and Kumar goofy, yet clever and funny. These are normal guys who smoke pot, meet some gals and, yes, sate their appetite.Harold and Kumar got the munchies and so they embark on a zany odyssey. It starts innocently enough, but then spirals into a madcap adventure. I suppose you could find parallels to the Greek epic - Freakshow as Cyclops; the Princeton co-eds and Freakshow's wife as the Sirens, etc. But that's reading way too much into this pleasant comedy, where some zingers fly by so quickly, you could miss 'em if you aren't paying attention.To elicit some great laughs, the writers and director Danny Leiner wisely place Harold and Kumar in one surreal situation after another and have the actors play those situations seriously. That's what makes this so inspired.Take, for instance, the scene of Penn relieving himself in the bushes. It turns side-splittingly funny thanks to a comically straight-faced cameo by Jamie Kennedy and Penn's lovely sense of outrage. Or, Kumar's college interview with a deadpan performance by Fred Willard as the dean and a brilliant quip from Penn. Or, Kumar's mirror scene, which must be seen to be believed. And there's Neil Patrick Harris hilariously eviscerating his Doogie Howser persona. True, some jokes misfire. A bit in a hospital, the Katie Holmes joke and a subplot involving an escaped animal (an homage to Howard Hawks' 1938 screwball classic, ""Bringing Up Baby,"" perhaps?) aren't as funny as they could be. Though, I'll admit, Penn perfectly delivers the very funny punch line to the subplot's joke.What everyone involved in ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" has accomplished is making easily not only the best stoner movie to come along in years, but also the funniest comedy of the year, so far.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

It has the hallucinogenic weed scene as mentioned above, it has two Asian protagonists, it plays on racial stereotypes, and it has some wicked lines-for example (when speaking about a sighting of Katie Holmes' breasts in a movie: ""Remember the Holocaust?

High times""",9,19 December 2011,"An Asian-American office worker and his Indian-American stoner friend embark on a quest to satisfy their desire for White Castle burgers.I'm not the biggest 'stoner comedy' fan, but sometimes (very rarely) I'll see what the big hype is. With the recent release of Harold and Kumar's Christmas movie, I just HAD to see what was so special about the movie. And let me tell you, I didn't expect any of it... If you know the basic formula of these comedies, you'll know this film will be a trip. During the movie's run you'll find them running into random encounters, being doctors, picking up Neil Patrick Harris, riding a cheetah down the highway, and gliding down to their destination. During the process, you will laugh so hard you'll be desperate for breath. I never expected the vulgarity, the shocks, and the cameos. They all added together to create a classic stoner comedy. So I have to admit, the movie had those times where it slowed the process down. Maybe it was because I wasn't EXPECTING it or maybe because I'm not the biggest fan of these stoner comedies. Nevertheless, the movie redeems itself with yet another classic gag to keep it rolling. There is so many classic lines, so many classic scenes that you'll have to watch it again with some friends. I don't have too many complaints. It had it's flaws, yes, but nothing too bad. The characters were memorable, the plot was memorable, and those final moments at White Castle were memorable. I feel as if, on IMDb, I give too high of scores. I rarely give films 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6's because I pick the right ones. And when I saw this film, undermining it's potential, I once again found a classic. I seriously recommend this comedy. It hits all the right spots, all the right places, all the right moves. If your not a fan of these stoner comedies, which I'm not the biggest to be honest, then I still say go see it. It's a (yeah) underrated comedy that has to be seen. I give Harold and Kumar a 10/10 for giving me the laughs needed for the right comedy. I have high expectations for the next and the Christmas one. I hope they give me what this gave me. 9/10.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
93,ryan_kuhn,"""Did Doogie Howser just steal my car?""",7,23 July 2005,"I have in the past been critical of the dumb college road trip movie (See: Road Trip), and Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle certainly fits the bill. But the difference between Road Trip, which I didn't like all that much, and White Castle is that I found Harold and Kumar to be funny and likable and the characters in the other movies not funny and likable. Harold and Kumar live in New Jersey, Harold (John Cho), an Asian accountant, and Kumar (Kal Penn), an Indian pre-med student-to-be, who share an apartment and their preference for chilling out. After one night of smoking up, they get the munchies; only White Castle will quench their desires. The movie then becomes a road trip movie, as over the next 90 minutes, we follow the pair as they find out their local White Castle has been taken over, visit Princeton to conduct what turns into an information session/press conference starring Harold, fix a flat tire, pick up a hitchhiker (more on him later), ride a cheetah, get arrested after jay-walking, hang gliding, and several other adventures. There are crude moments, mostly early and involving the after effects of eating tacos, that almost lost me as a viewer, but quickly make up for it with moments of one character marrying a bad of weed and the hitchhiker. The person they pick up is Neil Patrick Harris, who is of course Doogie Howser. Who knew Doogie had such a repressed childhood in the hospital? The scenes with Harris were, in my mind, the best of the movie. But there are some surprisingly funny moments involving a runaway cheetah that ran away from a zoo, Kumar's father (Errol Sitahal), and a gang of skateboarders who take their music listening to the extreme. You'll laugh, you'll enjoy the amples of amount of gratuitous female nudity, you'll get your USDA recommended amounts of the ""f"" word, and maybe you'll find something out about yourself. Well, maybe not, unless you are also hungry for White Castle.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
94,Torgo_Approves,"The dumbest movie I've seen since ""House of the Dead"" - Hilarious!!",9,23 September 2006,"(r#69)Harold and Kumar are stoned out of their minds and looking for the perfect food. Where else but at a White Castle restaurant could they find what they crave? Unfortunately, they're two unlucky stoners, and their journey becomes a strange, unforgettable and life-changing experience.No, this movie is not subtle or particularly intelligent... but it's also fully aware that it isn't, which makes it much funnier than a Uwe Boll film or a Paris Hilton TV series. In fact, the dumber ""Harold and Kumar"" gets, the funnier it is. The most memorably stupid scene is definitely the one which explores Kumar's relationship with a giant bag of pot. Who the hell came up with this stuff?? John Cho - ""the Chinese guy from American Pie"", as the DVD box delicately explains - is totally hilarious as Harold. This guy has comedic talent and I hope he continues down this road. Kal Penn is also good as his best buddy Kumar. During their adventures on the way to White Castle the two encounter a myriad of cameos, ranging from Fred Willard to Neil Patrick Harris to a very typecast Eddie Kay Thomas.The jokes are simple but effective. A perfect movie to watch on a late night when there's nothing else to do. ""Harold and Kumar"" is easily one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Recommended!",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
95,oshram-3,"Okay, but not as zany as it could have been",5,31 July 2004,"Wow, now I know 'Eurotrip' spoiled me, because I'm comparing all other so-called 'stupid' teen comedies to it, and this one doesn't even come close. With an oddball title like 'Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle', you know there had to be some creativity in the mix, and there is. But for a screwball movie, well, things are actually pretty normal.Harold (John Cho) is an uptight worker drone at a faceless computer corporation (shades of 'Office Space') while Kumar (Kal Penn) is a talented non-achiever who keeps ducking his father's entreaties to start medical school. The two of them are chiefly interested in getting stoned, however, and it is the by product of a late-night session that gets their hearts set on visiting White Castle. The rest of the movie merely chronicles the wacky hijinks they encounter on the road there, including an encounter with a butt-ugly local, getting their car stolen by Neil Patrick Harris (of Doogie Howser fame, playing himself), and some promising but ultimately flat encounters with some Princetonians. The movie kept me mildly entertained because it takes place in and around the area where I used to live in New Jersey, and because both Cho and Penn and very engaging and fun to watch (though Kumar is written wittier than Harold). The jokes are okay, but after a while it all feels very derivative, as if this movie was inspired by a teen-movie marathon rather than by any particularly inspired insight. A continual mocking of tattooed extreme' skateboard types never gets old, though, and the overall joviality of the film helps carry it through some of its flatter moments (riding a cheetah, a pointless but required baring the breasts' scene, and an overly long eschatological joke between two co-eds).'Harold and Kumar' isn't bad, but it's definitely b' material, the second movie you watch at 10 p.m. after you've seen the movie you really want to see. There are a few really solid laughs, a few chuckles, and unfortunately there are a few really flat stretches thrown in. It's worth seeing at a discount theater or maybe on video, but not really worth full price. If you want to see a truly funny zany teen road trip' type of film, rent 'Eurotrip'. A minor note: a recurring gag about Katie Holmes' breasts had me chuckling, and inspired the best line in the film.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
96,noizyme,How is this movie brilliant?,4,3 February 2005,"OK, so Harold and Kumar are two guys who smoke pot and get the muchies to got to White Castle, a mostly eastern US burger establishment. That's the plot...need I say more? There's nothing else going on in this movie other than them getting the usual Americanized stereotypes of Chinese and Inian people and a bunch of gags to fill up time.There's a (hot) love interest, Maria, and a gang of hooligans who resemble the ""extreme"" people in deodorant and Mountain Dew commercials, but that's about the only great times that this movie has. I didn't laugh out loud until about 40 minutes into the movie. A friend of mine said that you just really be stoned to watch this one...I guess. But any movie (especially comedy) that relies on that aspect of getting high alone shouldn't be worth your $3 for a rental. The music and everything was playful as ever (a good point) however it's nothing new or exciting. This is like a multi-cultural Tommy Boy when it comes down to ripping off elements of the movie. Even Eurotrip was better than this because it (at least) made you want to watch it for more than half the movie.I guess this is aimed at younger, high school kids who do nothing but smoke pot and like to see boobies. And for whatever reason, there's a lot of unwanted, uncaring racial stereotypes thrown in. I heard that they might do a sequel called ""H & K go to Amsterdam."" How is that going to be interesting? It's all been done before and I'm surprised that they would stretch out whatever jokes might be funny in this movie.So I gave it a 4/10 because I am a comedy fan, I like the cameo by Neal Patrick Harris, and it was original to mess up a plot this badly and have it go to theaters. Here's the deal: rent it if you liked ""Dude, where's my car"" (because it's the same director...they even ask where's my car in the white castle) but don't expect great things...unless your high.PS...any movie that has a cheetah (or any other animal) smoking pot has got to be a stupid stoner flick.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

(Yes, it's that good!)I'm not high myself, but it seems that every time I watch a movie like this, I seem to get the munchies just by watching.

But this stuff is all so tired and obvious that, four days after seeing it, I can't cite a single stand-out moment.It's not the worst of its type but every scene has been done before, and better.

100,dhaufrect-1,A weak excuse for a comedy.,3,6 March 2005,"""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" is difficult to watch to the very end. However difficult it was, I was able to do so without turning off my DVD player. John Cho plays Harold Lee, the Asian employee of middle America. Kal Penn plays Kumar Patel, the premed student who has no interest in becoming a doctor. The concept is cute, but the movie is a conglomeration of cheap and adolescent humor. There is much slapstick to keep the teens entertained. However, the very low humor is raw enough to encourage the youngsters to avoid this one. Few films get such low scores, but this one does deserve it's low rating. There should not be a waiting list of folks picking this movie as their very own DVD. Perhaps the music is entertaining enough to hold one's attention to the very end. The end had only one redeeming quality: It was over.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
101,billybrown41,Friends don't let friends watch this movie sober,10,8 January 2005,"I was a little intrigued when I saw the preview for this one. It looked, to me, like a fun way to kill an hour and a half on an uneventful Saturday night but having not been too thrilled with ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" four years ago, I was a little skeptical. I finally picked up the DVD a couple of days ago and I'm happy to report that ""Harold and Kumar..."" is the funniest movie of it's kinds since ""Road Trip"". The plot is irrelevant. If you've seen the previews, then you know what you're getting into. Two Stoners do their thing, see a commercial for White Castle, get the munchies and decide to take the 80 mile trip to satisfy their craving. Needless to say, absurd things happen...That's all we get in terms of story, but what really keeps it all together is the chemistry of the two leads. I loved every minute of their bantering and Neil Patrick Harris's cameo as himself still has me laughing when I think about it. His bit about the ""offscreen relationships"" with the cast of Doogie Howser MD. had me crying and rewinding. Someone get this guy some more parts like this one. He's great.Bathroom humor has never been one of my faves, but I didn't mind it so much here. I could've done without that one sequence (if you see it, then you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about) and I was a little bored during the whole ""Freakshow"" bit. Coulda done without that too..However, the rest of the movie is so good that those two gripes are easily forgiven. True, this may be a stoner comedy, but you don't even have to be a fan of that genre to enjoy this one. I watched it with a 12 pack and had a blast.

The casting certainly evokes several controversies--for example, while most Americans know very well that there are many Gen-X or Gen-Y types among Asian-Americans and Indian-Americans, why does Hollywood rarely portray them in this film's manner? Leiner and company may bring up these issues to make changes, and maybe to find some commercial niche.

The scene in the toilet practically made me laugh out loud and the result of it was my dad telling me to quieten down. I could smell the farts ( never knew girls could do that).After seeing a commercial for a hamburger place, Harold and his marijuana loving buddy Kumar decide to go try it out but what they didn't expect was the encounters they would have along the way.

John Cho had lots of parts before this movie but never a lead role. Kal Penn did mostly TV stuff before Van Wilder movies, but this movie moved him up big time. This was the writing and directing debut of Joh Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, hell of a home run on the first shot.

Harold and Kumar are two best friends who get into one hilarious mishap after another on a simple quest to get burgers on their night out. Harold is an overworked and under-appreciated Asian office worker, and Kumar is a phenomenally smart med-school candidate who purposely screws up his interviews so that he doesn't live up to the stereotype of nerdy-Indian kid turned doctor.I first watched this movie in the mid 2000's, when I didn't understand what having munchies was like, none the less ever smoked a joint in my life. But I still found it hilarious. It's not about two guys getting high, it's about two best friends having one stupid adventure after the next.

Pathetic over-acting, unfunny jokes, clichéd situations pile one on another seemingly endlessly. 'The end is near...' you keep telling yourself... but never, never near enough. Since the two central characters are of Asian origin and the 'villains' are WASPish, could this be a clumsy attempt to make a PC comedy of ethnicity? If so, I cannot imagine any of my Indian friends will enjoy being portrayed as crassly priapic or undiscerning pot-heads. Nor will any east asians relish being portrayed as weak-willed and lacking in taste.

108,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"Hilarious Stoner Comedy...Everything ""Dude Where's My Car"" should have been",9,9 September 2004,"""Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle"" is an amusing, hilarious comedy not to be taken too seriously and not to be dismissed as just another silly stoner comedy. Certainly there are plenty of elements which appeal to those dophamine, ""good times"" movie-goers, yet there are also some classic instances of comedic greatness. Aside from chronicling two inane potheads on a quest to satisfy their appetites, ""White Castle"" offers a great coming-of-age and funny coincidence premise, which reminds us of the heavy, sadistic curveballs life hurls at us, sometimes when we merely desire something simple and cannot attain it. Here is a story of a simple goal by two simple minds: to find a White Castle hamburger joint and fulfill the lasting effects of ""the munchies"". Yet, as these two stoner friends come to realize, even the seemingly simplest of goals in life can be impossible to achieve, due to such disturbances as irony, circumstance, error, and misfortune, as they are all encountered in this journey. The comic elements are listless: stoner instinct-gone horribly awry, catastrophic error, not-so-pleasant raunchy surprise, near-death escapes in the most unlikeliest of ways, and the eventual finesse of overcoming all obstacles to finally enjoy a binge at a hamburger joint. This is a fresh, original, and satisfying comedy, and though it is nothing of a brilliant production or a cinematic masterpiece, there are plenty of the elements here which constitute for a barrel of laughs and a genuinely entertaining experience at the movies. ***1/2 out of ****",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

110,JimD73,Harold & Kumar are the new Jay & Silent Bob,8,3 February 2005,"Another day, another stoner movie. If you are the type who would really want to see this movie, you aren't reading this anyway, so I'll be blunt (haha). Stoner movies either really rule or really suck. Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back and Animal Housethose ruled. Dude Where's My Car and Road Tripthose sucked. Where does H&K fall? Plot: 17/25: Dude, in this kind of movie, who needs a plot? Plot shmot. Regardless, I guess this isn't SNL or anything, so we kind of need something to piece it together. We have two stereotypical roomies. There's an Asian guy named Harold (Cho) who gets ridden like the village bicycle at work. In other words, the other guys dump their share on him. Then there's his Indian roommate Kumar (Penn), who has the grades and his M-cats all good for medical school, but doesn't want to do it, despite his surgeon father's insistence. As he puts it ""If you're hung like a horse, do you have to do porn?"" Anyway, the thing they have in common is an appreciation for what makes the world go round and round and round and roundmarijuana. One day, they get majorly stoned, and get the munchies. They want to go to somewhere new, and see a commercial for White Castle. So begins an epic quest to get a shitload of burgers. They find that the White Castle in their town got bought out, and the nearest one is 45 minutes away. We branch off in about 50 different directions, all of which are easy to guess but regardlessly flow fairly well, better than other movies of the type. Really, the plot isn't really a plot. It seems like a series of R-rated Mad TV or SNL skits, but that's exactly what we want here.Comedy: 22/25: When Harold & Kumar brings the goods, it brings them well. There is a lot of filler in this one, and I mean a lot of filler, but every time it had me laughing, it was a gut-buster. It won't have you laughing the whole way through, but when it gets you, which is often, if leaves your stomach hurting. Also, it is filled with keen social commentary, so don't think this movie is just blowing smoke the whole way through.Acting: 21/25: Cho & Penn, best known for smaller roles in American Pie and Van Wilder, are perfect here. I've been a John Cho fan ever since that TV show Off Centre, and I hope he gets more leading roles after this. There are a slew of cameos, from Jamie Kennedy to Neil Patrick Harris, all of whom fit in well. I really have no problems with the acting. The leads are likable, what more do you want? Entertainment: 19/25: This movie takes sex, drugs and cursing extremely lightly, so some people may be offended. It also pokes fun at many social issues and stereotypes, but never in a blatantly offensive way. If this is your type of movie, you'll love it, but this isn't a movie for everyone.Bonus -.2 for blatant advertising: As much as I understand the reason here, this movie is still a huge White Castle commercial. This annoys me, moreso from a critical perspective than a viewer's, but regardless, I won't hurt it too bad as I wouldn't have appreciated them making up a restaurant.Total: 77%: Harold & Kumar is a good stoner movie. It is a stoner movie though, so it's not for everyone. It doesn't keep you laughing consistently, but it is a gut-buster when it gets going. Basically, if you're the Dude Where's My Car or Jay & Silent Bob types, this is for you. H&K are the new J&SB.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

116,Scorching,As expected,7,26 December 2004,"I think it would be fair for me to say that I pretty much expected what I would get from this film given the director and the cast's previous projects. Yes, as expected there wasn't much of a story or at least they tried to pass out a very thin storyline. As expected it was predictable and ordinary given this genre of teen comedy flicks. It was of course was filled with many gags and good laughs. Though I thought they should have spent more time on the sub-plots as some of them seemed half baked. It felt that they squeezed two hours worth of laughs in an hour and a half. Yes, there were a lot of stereotypes especially about Asians. Not sure they would appreciate it though.This film was no where near a classic comedy movie but if you are in for a cheap thrill ride then perhaps this is the movie you ought to see.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
117,Hellrazr360,Instant and Hilarious Stoner Classic,9,25 February 2006,"Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle follows two stoners on a journey to get White Castle, but they have to deal with many awkward occurrences along the way. Harold is the laid-back, quiet character that tries to avoid anything that his friend Kumar would do. Kumar is the ""real"" stoner of the two and tries almost anything for drugs.From the director of Dude, Where's My Car?, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle promised and delivers dumb comedy. However, in the case of this movie, ""dumb"" comedy is like saying ""this movie will hit you like a laughing drug"". The humor that this movie has is both ridiculous and outrageous, in a hilarious way. One thing that Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle has that other movies don't is more than one memorable moments, a lot more. From the battles**ts scene, to the occurrence with Freakshow, and the beyond over-the-top marijuana dream, this movie is like a marathon of South Park episodes.Watching this movie multiple times is a dose of laughter each time, but the first time is always the greatest. If you ever catch this movie on TV you'd better watch it if you haven't, because you will laugh your a** off.

How is Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle any different? The difference is that Harold or Kumar do not have a history. They are total American characters who are not of an American origin. As a result, all along, you are surprised as much as you already know the events belong to the genre that you have seen so many films of.Harold and Kumar have an amazing night. They ride a leopard for God sake! Their search for White Castle burgers take them from one fun riot to another. You can see that Kumar in spite of his sex and weed fogged mind is a good guy. Harold on the other hand is cautious but for some reason or the other always gives in to his impulsive friend. They are a perfect foil for each other.

""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" is simply about a couple of guys who get a bad case of the munchies after getting stoned in their apartment. They see an ad for White Castle and are entranced like a couple of monkeys eyeing a new tire swing. The two of them embark on a quest to find the 24 hour spot and get them some tasty sliders. Hilarity and many mis-adventures ensue.Harold and Kumar (Kal Penn & John Cho) aren't your typical stoner guys. They're both very smart, educated guys with bright careers ahead of them if they want it. They are also very ethnic, which is very much part of the humor. The movie is filled with racial jokes, sexual innuendo, gross-out, and broad humor. Along the lines of the ""Pie"" films, this movie is pretty similar. For starters, many of the same actors appear in the movie including Cho. Also look for Eddie Kaye Thomas and Fred Willard. The funniest appearance is by Neil Patrick Harris playing himself as this sex crazed ""gotta get me some"" hitchiking nut. He's not the Doogie Howser I remember.This film takes a simple premise and runs with it. It doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you. Just laugh and have fun.

120,imdb2-5,Hate stoner films... loved this hilarious social satire,10,20 October 2018,"What makes Harold and Kumar so funny is that they are brilliant social satires and the performances of the two leads were standout. It's no mistake that suddenly they were cast into leading roles in top tier produced films. The chemistry is great and think that this film probably wouldn't have had success cast differently.Personally I have always hated stoner films (did not bother sitting through Dude, Pineapple, etc.) To say that this is a complete stoner film is inaccurate. H&K are the product of overachieving immigrant families in America. Some of the little 'in jokes' for each ethnicity are hilarious if you are familiar. It's done all in good fun and the film isn't even about reaching White Castle - it could have been anything (although it relates here about 'the munchies') and it's far more clever than some realize in the search for good weed, great burgers... and the transition from college graduate to adult life.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

122,AW_McGOWAN,The Odd Couple Odyssey For Stoners,6,10 January 2021,"After junior analyst Harold Lee (John Cho) and pre-med slacker Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) get stoned in their Hoboken apartment, the two see a White Castle commercial on television and immediately develop an intense craving for the fast food chain's signature sliders. Upon learning that the closest White Castle has closed down, they embark on a hunger-fueled odyssey across New Jersey. The low-brow adventure brings them through a violent Newark, a party-infested Princeton, and various other side quests as they travel in search of delicious hamburgers.This is the plot of the aptly titled ""Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle,"" a buddy-comedy that is gross, outrageous, and laugh-out-loud funny. Writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg craft some very quotable dialogue and clever jokes in the screenplay, and who better to bring this stoner story to life than ""Dude Where's My Car?"" director Danny Leiner?Above everyone else, it is Cho and Penn as the titular duo that make this movie so special. An odd couple for the modern era, Harold is an uptight and overworked straight man, while Penn is a genius who prefers partying to applying to med school. Although the two have their differences, their friendship is endearing and believable. Rather than having either character be the ""cool one,"" they both face condescension from the people that fill their equally average lives. The fact that they are minorities living in New Jersey is not lost on the film either. Harold and Kumar both combat racism, but rather than making racism the butt of the joke, the movie places the casual racists as obnoxious and abusive while maintaining the main characters' rationally annoyed perspectives.Ultimately, Harold and Kumar are relatable - ordinary people making an ordinary fast food run that gradually turns extraordinary. By the film's third act, the protagonists have undergone high speed chases, car accidents, a battle with a racoon, and an encounter with a disfigured Christian zealot in the woods. Later, they inexplicably pick up a hitchhiking Neil Patrick Harris (played by himself), who highjacks their car to go on a drug infused, horny bender. Oh, and they also impersonate doctors, break out of jail, and smoke marajuana with a cheetah in the forest.It is hard to imagine all of that happening in a single film, but ""Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle"" fluidly offers one absurd episode after another with uncompromised pacing. It has the cult qualities of ""The Big Lebowski"" with the general comedic appeal of ""American Pie."" Admittedly, movie probably appeals to male potheads the most and to Academy members the least, but judged against other raunchy comedies circa 2004, it surely stands out. Given today's call for more movies focused on non-white characters, I wouldn't be surprised to see Harold and Kumar make a comeback. In an odd way, they were ahead of their time.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

However, this time I thought that I wanted to review something different and the movie I clearly have chosen is Harold And Kumar - Goes To White Castle a ""Stoner"" movie if you can call it but a good one at that.Storyline: N/A I am not going to give the story a rating since I don't really believe there really is any, although the movie follows a certain story and a certain motive it doesn't really have a certain story anyways, this movie is all about the funny aspects and it surely deliverers in this apartment. it is the story of two stoner's who one night sees a commercial about some place called White Castle and this place is the main attractment of the movie the whole point of the movie is the travel to a place that is the hype of two meat loving stoner's, not going to say more but of course everything goes entirely WRONG!Characters: 9/10 This is were the story really have its strength, also I would like to add that if it hadn't been just these two actors then the story would've failed in so many aspects, so this is what makes the movie seem as cool as it really is, right pick I would say.Soundtrack 8/10 Your normal mixture of music, nothing really special although the main song of the movie is clearly highlighted at the beginning and at the end and it shines through, it was the perfect choice and should be praised upon but all in all it is your normal mixture of songs put into a soundtrack with a cool theme!Special Effects N/A There are some here and there but all in all this movie doesn't need them and it surely wasn't really needed for something, they could've done without any of them.All in All 7/9 All in all this movie is a great Saturday night movie and its follow-up is just as cool, everything has been done to almost perfection if you know the standards of such a movie this is, yet some things could've been done better and some parts of the movie could've been written better but all in all a great movie that should be a great pick for any fan of the comic area, pick it up and keep it.!",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

The two main guys aren't bad..they don't hurt anyone...no one dies or commits some horrible crime that CSI has to come and solve. You actually want them to reach their goal because they are trying so hard. The addition one Neil Patrick Harris was genius too. Seeing him outside of his goody goody Doogie Howser role was beyond funny..even over the top. It might have stereo-types Asians and Indian cultures..which wasn't really cool..but you get the idea and it isn't that harsh. I like the part where the jerks who harassed them so much got the tables turned on them...the deserved it. Everyone knows guys like that in real life. I did think the part with the raccoon in the car was kind of stupid..even if it was a prelude to what we know is going to happen to them as the story went on. The fact their friendship lasted through all of the chaos was an example of what great friend is suppose to be.

It looked like another ""Dude, Where's my Car"" or something. Man, was I wrong! This movie was funny as h*ll! I haven't laughed so much at a movie in quite a long time. The stoners, the slackers, the buttoned up good girls with a bad girl inside, and many other characters are blended to create a fresh comedy. Granted, older people may not see the humor. If you don't like Cheech and Chong, Friday, Half-Baked and other movies of the sort, then this isn't for you. If you, like me, can see the humor in the movies just mentioned, then you need to rent this and have a good laugh.I hope they do make a sequel. The chemistry between the lead characters is superb. They take the typical straight guy-lazy slacker routine, modernize it and give it a few twists. It works!

A key ingredient is never to preach to the audience - They are there to be entertained, not have a lesson on the dangers of drugs, like in countless teen movies. Where this film really succeeds is in its own internal self-deprecating humour - It is not afraid to laugh at itself.

It's a relatively short film, and it was about right. There is a lot of humour about the present racial aspects that we often see in life, and it's good that we can take it with a pinch of salt.

130,the-jerk,A surprisingly good satire,10,2 June 2005,"Hard as it is to believe, this movie is actually a vicious satire.I say ""hard as it is to believe"" because on the surface, it looks like a stoner movie, and nothing else (kind of like ""Dude, Where's My Car?"", the movie Danny Leiner directed before this one). But unlike DWMC, I think you should look deeper with this one.The movie is basically kicked off when Harold (an Asian-American played by John Cho, the MILF guy from ""American Pie"") and Kumar (an Indian-American played by Kal Penn, the Indian assistant from ""Van Wilder"") are sitting around getting high, and they see a commercial for White Castle on TV (yes, it's a real place, and I don't know if they exist elsewhere, but the only one I've ever been to was in New Jersey too), and they decide to go to White Castle. So the movie can be viewed as an hour-and-a-half long commercial for White Castle. But really, it's a satire of product placement in movies; they take your basic product placement and base the whole movie around it, thus exaggerating the concept of product placement and elevating this movie to the level of satire.Think about it. It is definitely not a real ""commercial""; no company would honestly advertise themselves with such a vulgar and offensive movie. Therefore it is a satire. And if you look at it that way, it's an extremely funny satire. The main target is consumerism, but they touch on a lot of other topics; also satirized is the plight of Americans of foreign descent, drug culture (and you know, I swear I know people just like the characters in this movie), medical culture, the police and their treatment of minorities, and even Hollywood culture, in the form of Neil Patrick Harris playing ""himself"". It's all wildly funny, but realistic in an exaggerated way. It's a brilliant satire.It also has a lot of great cameos; watch for David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas (also from ""American Pie""), Bobby Lee (from MadTV), Fred Willard, Ryan Reynolds (also from ""Van Wilder""), Ethan Embry (from ""Can't Hardly Wait""), Anthony Anderson, and in particular Christopher Meloni (from ""Oz"" and ""Law and Order: SVU""), who is barely recognizable as a loony, deformed mechanic appropriately named Freakshow. The movie is full of memorable dialogue and situations. This is not ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" (which I also thought was a very good movie, despite appearances); this is much better. Watch it with an open mind and you'll see that it works on many levels, and I think it deserves to be considered a great movie.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

132,golem3,Harold and Kumar  a journey in general crappiness,2,11 September 2005,"I wanted to see this movie in the theatres when it came out some time ago, since it was touted as the first time a Hollywood film featured an Indian guy. Of course, it didn't stay in the theatres long enough, and for a good reason; it's an idiotic journey, a waste of good time. The jokes are not funny, and their humorous accidents and trials are less than decent. Harold and Kumar are upper class just post-adolescents with nothing to do on weekends except smoke pot and eat take out while watching B movies. They struggle with getting girls and getting to their destination, the movie's plot, White Castle burgers. Luckily they succeed since it's a simplistic movie. Wouldn't want viewers to think that rowdy Americans can't get their burgersHollywood could have done a better job with this one. There does seem to be area for improvement  and of course, like all trashy films, there is some line (or two) that could be made into a better film. Since this is a pure laughs, pure comedy type deal, the low end nature of the film is partially acceptable.

I know people exactly like Harold and Kumar - they are very real people, and it's sad that this movie is a ""satire"" when it's really the norm. America should learn that race doesn't matter - it's a person's culture that matters. A person's culture determine's his behaviour. All I see are some American stoners. I do not see a ""Korean"" and an ""Indian"".I think one of the reasons why people find this movie so entertaining is precisely because these racial stereotypes are broken, and people are surprised that a movie that doesn't have anglo-saxon-centric actors can in fact be hugely entertaining.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

I enjoyed the college setting of the film and that the two main characters weren't two white guys with token minorities in the background. I liked the inferences that the film made about stereotypes. All the Asians on a university campus, white cops picking on minorities and pot usage. Some people might not like the gross out humor involving TV's Doogie Howser, MD, the scene with two hot college babes simulating craping. The film was laden with stereotypes but its a comedy which made fun of the stereotypes such as all the Asians on campus, potheads, the Asian guy that doesn't want the Asian chick because she is well stereotypical so he goes for a hotter non Asian babe who leans more towards Caucasian features.This film falls into the same category as 'Road Trip' and 'Half Baked' all rolled up into one.

I haven't laughed so much at a movie since....  never, seeing how this is the funniest movie I have ever seen.  What a great combination, a Korean guy and an Indian guy, both  stereotypically known to be intellectually advanced. What was great  about this movie was that they tackled modern day stereotypes and  showed the stupidity in exploiting them. Also it showed the other side  to these two minorities which is usually purposely ignored.   This movie, as you see from the trailer, is about two guys who have the  munchies and all they want is to go get some White Castle fast food.  But this movie does not fall in the same category as Half Baked or How  High; this is not another typical stoner film. It does not base its  humor solely the idea of getting high, this movie is able to find humor  in more then just that. Take the best comedic part of every movie you  have ever seen and just combine them all together to make this one  hilarious film.  I personally, being Indian found much humor in this movie, along with  something else, a little pride in the fact that this movie did not  portray the lead Indian guy to be just another book worm with a heavy  accent. I really enjoyed this film. Definitely worth a second, a third,  and fourth watch, and then some. Don't worry my not so Indian, white  friend, sitting next to me, got just as much a kick out of it as well.

142,dustinkdye,Cheech and Chong for the new generation,8,27 April 2013,"Harold and Kumar are the Cheech and Chong of the new generation. But the dynamic between the likable characters elevates ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" above the typical stoner comedy.Harold is an accountant who takes the brunt of ""positive"" Asian-American stereotypes, namely that they're all good at math. He is serious and bookish, but enjoys getting high on the weekends. Kumar is Harold's Indian-American roommate and polar opposite. Getting high is a way of life for Kumar, and he plans to float through life on his dad's money.On one fateful Friday night, the two heroes have the munchies and are determined to get their fix at White Castle after seeing a TV commercial. The nearest White Castle is a good 45-minute drive, providing you know the way. The two stoners predictably get lost and have a series of quirky late-night adventures as they stray off the beaten path, which include encounters with a Jesus freak straight out of ""Deliverance"" known as Freakshow, frequent run-ins with a gang of ""extreme"" skateboarders, and Neil Patrick Harris (TV's Doogie Howser, M.D.). One of my favorite scenes is a fantasy sequence in which Kumar imagines his life with a giant, walking sack of weed.The movie is stylish and makes good use of what appears to be a relatively low budget of $9 million ($20 million would be modest for a comedy).""Harold & Kumar"" has a lot of good laughs, including both situational humor and playing on racial stereotypes. The racial humor is funny without getting too offensive or preachy. But the movie ultimately works because of the character development. Even with their flaws, Harold and Kumar are both likable characters that the audience can root for. Character change drives good fiction, and the viewer is happy to see Harold learn to assert himself and Kumar decide to grow up.While ""Harold & Kumar"" is not a great film by any stretch of the word, it accomplishes exactly what it set out to do, which makes it effective.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
143,lucaslw-93145,Solid icon in the comedic genre,7,10 October 2020,"A movie in the same league as Good Burger or Bill and Ted (though better than Bill and Ted by far). Classic in all the right ways, cheap humor with some nice parts like the crazy guy peeing on the same bush as Kumar.Also is a blatant and massive ad for White Castle, but having just come off of The Boy's season 2 with their conspicuous Fresca and Almond-joy marketing, I'm acclimated to the corporate interests.Highlights of the movie would be the hospital scene with Ryan Reynolds, the aforementioned crazy guy peeing, and the payoff at White Castle. Solid movie, iconic but not a cinematic masterpiece in any serious consideration. Just a fun watch.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

It's the type of movie, you ask people if they have seen it.I was sick from work. My brother just dropped it in my room. I put in on and laughed hard.Spoiler for laughs.I loved the N.P.H. cameo, in my top five in comedies. Great cameo.The scene where Kumar is taking a whizz in the forest and that office worker shows up next to him. Hardest laugh in the movie.The two leads work great. I love the way it's shot at night.

Oh yeah, this is a stoner comedy, in the sense that you have your eyes half closed all the way through it, trying not to fall asleep.It just didn't do anything for me, the humour was unoriginal, all the jokes were like cheap American Pie rehashes. There doesn't seem to be any moral to the story, except that the only way to get rid of your troubles is to smoke lots of weed. Yeah right. If you're going to make a stoner comedy, at least make them do some funny things, instead of a pointless and way too drawn out quest to get a burger.The two leads seem to be way too pleased with themselves all the way through the film, thinking that they are now A list celebrities, when in fact they are D grade comedy actors.So, Harold and Kumar is a lot like getting stoned.

146,Phrankster163,More than just a stoner flick,9,29 January 2006,"Harold and Kumar are two stoners like a million other like them. They're doing pretty good (with a minimum of effort), but the big dreams just seem to elude them, whether it be the cute girl down the hall or the big weed score every stoner dreams of. So one night they get the munchies, and when you have a craving while your really hammered, there's no choice but to act on it. From there on we get laughs and great characters aplenty along the way, and it rarely (if ever) gets predictable. Sure it gets a bit silly sometimes, but it's a comedy so that's it's privilege. It's written by a 27 and a 28 year old, which is why it can be a teen/post-teen movie that still works for me as a 27 year old. There are some obvious continuity errors in it, and the one problem I have with it is that even though they smoke a lot of weed during the night, it's only at the beginning that they really act stoned. That being said, it's a great comedy (much better that ""Dude, where's my car?"") and the sequel will definitely be a must see. Whether it'll attain cult status or not is yet to be seen, but I wouldn't bet against it.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Just not funny. I thought that perhaps I'm just too old for this kind of humor, but I think Dude Where's My Car is one of the funniest movies in recent memory, so that's not it. I thought maybe the fact that the script includes a lot of drug references detracted from the humor for me, but I really enjoy Cheech and Chong.The main actors were charismatic and likable enough. The directing didn't get in the way. So I have to attribute my dislike of the film to the script -- poorly written, at least for me. Fred Willard was wasted in a throwaway role, but Anthony Anderson was a standout as a burger employee going over the edge, as was Sandy Jobin-Bevins as a racist cop, and Neal Patrick Harris as himself in a great against-type role.Seems the movie appeals to many people who frequent IMDb, but I have to tell you that I really can't recommend it, and consider it almost a total waste of what was fortunately only about 80 minutes.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

I never stopped laughing the entire movie.Definitely not one for the whole family, this movie had plenty of sexual and drug jokes, all of which were just hilarious as long as you aren't offended by them.There were a few celebrity appearances, including a small part by Doogie Howser, Neil Patrick Harris, who was also very funny in this movie.Definitely worth seeing in the theater, and absolutely worth buying on DVD. Fortunately, since this movie didn't do too well at the box office (which I have no idea why), it should be reasonably priced once it's released.Overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
149,b1lskirnir,Restores my faith in the comedy genre,9,6 March 2005,"No, this is not just another idiotic stoner movie with no plot or good acting ( cough cough Dude Where's My Car ): this is in fact one of the best movies I've seen in ages. Perfect casting, well-written plot details, and amazing humor. Do not be discouraged from seeing this movie, no matter what your elitist friends say.Basiclot summary: Harold ( that Asian guy ) is an overworked investment banker who frequently gets the raw end of the deal from the guys at his company, who perceive him as a dorky number-cruncher, which also causes problems in his love life. Kumar ( that Indian dude ) is a twentysomething stoner who has the potential to do great things with his mind, but chooses an ignorance-is-bliss path. He persuades Harold to join him for a night with the finest marijuana he could obtain, only to get the massive munchies for some White Castle burgers. To say that they embark on a quest would be an understatement. Their journey, taking at least 12 hours total, takes them all over New Jersey for their beloved burgers. Possibly the greatest attribute of this movie is that it is so ridiculous and outlandish, yet is has just enough social commentary and reflective dialogue to keep it down-to-earth and understandable, even cathartic. Throughout the night, they run afoul of dirtbag white trash skaters, a geeky Asian club, a mad raccoon, a lunatic country couple, more than a few car accidents, Neil Patrick Harris, corrupt policemen, a cheetah, and so much more.I can even begin to describe how well the story unfolds. It's a definite feel-good movie in the end, but it's much more. You really need to see it to understand it and what it's really about. There are few things I could complain about in this movie: excellent screenplay, appropriate music, the only thing stereotype-wise it could've used was some DDR or K-Pop to complete it.Once again proof that things from New Jersey, such as the Numa Numa dance, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and myself, are completely amazing.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Two guys going on a pointless movie end up in all possible situations during their quest for white castle. Everything is pointless, doesn't fit anywhere and is super unrealistic. Yet the movie keeps you laughing almost all the time. Humor is clever even if it's used in thousand different movies and in the end it is a growing up story, kinda.Had not seen this movie before so I thought it was about time. And no, this is not your top of the class artistically awesome movie. It's a movie that is supposed to keep you entertained for the night. In that, this delivers.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
151,chasman99,What the?,8,22 February 2005,"I rented this with major anticipation. Sadly this was a mix of two things, outright hilarity or sheer boredom. I was looking forward to the humor Kumar's character would bring especially being a Van Wilder fan. The humor was limited to the raccoon scene in the car, the singing of ""Hold On"" and Neil Patrick Harris. Bingo, done, that's it.There is the distinct chance that smoking up myself would have helped, but if that is what you are looking for you'd find more humor with Half Baked, Supere Troopers, Club Dread and a slew of other movies in that genre.Not terribly happy, but glad I only rented it instead of spending too much on pay per view or previously viewed DVD.**************** Update: and this may help others who didn't like it at first either. I found myself wanting to see this again and now I find it utterly hilarious. Some of the smaller bits of humor slid past me and I don't think I gave it enough credit.Kal Penn is a comic genius.

The only disappointment I have is that the funniest parts (at least to me) were at the beginning.  I won't give them away but the opening is killer.  I was rolling on the floor from the beginning.  The only problem is that it doesn't really get any funnier.  The laughs stay consistent and there is hardly any down time, but the funniest parts were at the beginning.  It's a truly adventurous movie and I'm sure many stoners have probably had one similar to it on their way to White Castle.

If you think drug humor is funny then you don't even have to read any more of this review go watch to movie now if you haven't seen it. I guarantee you won't be let down. However if you think drugs are bad and stupid, this movie still might be funny to you. This is on my list of top favorite movies if not it being my favorite movie to date.

This is with out a doubt the new Airplane of the new millennium where racial comedy and the `you can't say that attitude' are left by the way side so we can watch two friends in a campy adventure.  John Cho and Kal Penn have excellent screen presence and their ability to play off of one another is what gave them staying power through all three pie moves.  One of the best parts about this film is the cameo appearances and tie-ins to motion pictures of the age and cult following.  Leaving no gender, race, or stereo-type out the film rages with reckless abandon on the audience and with in moments you find your self laughing through your hand covered mouth and by the end of the second real you can't help but laugh aloud.  Danny Leiner is great at telling this story with honesty to the characters and not letting even their own epiphanies stand in the way.  Not to mention Neil Patrick Harris' performance epitomizing the child actor gone bye, bye.

Harold and Kumar has a pretty good plot for a stoner film but also has actual characters and are not paper thin.Harold is a hard working Asian accountant and Kumar is a genius slacker who does more sleeping than working but both have one thing in common, and that is that they like smoking weed. The film does have a steady pace from start to finish but does verge on ridiculous towards the end.I really enjoyed the jokes and plot lines running through the film and one of the highlights of the film is that NPH or neil patrick harris plays himself as a hard drinking womanising playboy and is hilarious! He really knows how to make an audience light up and is never really disliked at any point in the film.However some parts of the film i didn't like is the fact that there are some extreme points in the film which verge on ridiculous but could be down to the fact that the characters may actually be high.Overall: If you like comedies then you have to watch whitecastle and its sequel Guantanamo bay. However the Xmas film does not live up to the first two. The characters are likable and NPH is great. But be weary of some of the more ridiculous parts of the film if it doesn't float your boat.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Being a fan of White Castle and the talents of John Cho and Kal Penn, this movie was a sure fire hit. Normally I would think a script about two stoners on a quest for White Castle sliders would be boring, if not retarded, material... but this movie just works. Let's face it - the stoner angle may not appeal to everyone, but their quest is just too good/funny to pass up. There are more wacky moments than most ""buds hit the road"" comedies can muster. Imagine Neil Patrick Harris (NPH!!) playing himself - well, he flippin' does here, in a very funny, if slightly disturbing, role. The comradeship between John and Kal is fantastic. They'll probably remind you of two old buds from college - or maybe even hit closer to home.I'm not sure if it's the great delivery by John/Kal, maybe the writing, or a both - this movie is really a great time. The whole theater was laughing - I haven't heard that in A LONG TIME. Did ""Bruce Almighty"" do that? No. Did ""Envy"" do it? Hell no. Did ""50 First Dates"" do it? Ummm, no.Bottom line - this is a good movie that actually delivers the laughs.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Unlike How High, where Method Man and Redman try so hard to be the heir apparent to Cheech and Chong, Harold and Kumar just seem to fall into that role. I thought I was going to die laughing when Kumar was peeing in the bushes and Jamie Kennedy came up to him. Doogie Howser stealing their car, humping their seat. That's classic.This is the funniest movie I've seen since Old School. It's great also the way they pay homage to Dude Where's My Car, being that this is the same genre, and a similar story. I think Harold & Kumar might become this generation's Cheech & Chong. I'd like to see a sequel, may Harold & Kumar go to Taco Bell or Hot Dog Heaven.

160,cedric_owl,Sheer brilliance -- on par with Office Space,10,24 January 2005,"This film is not merely a stupid stoner comedy (although it is that), it is one of the most brilliant, biting satires of the past decade. The fact that it didn't make critic's top ten best years shows how stupidly people can be influenced by genre prejudices and advertising campaigns.H&K is a buddy road comedy with two very important differences. Firstly, that the entire road trip takes place in a single night. Secondly, and most brilliantly, the trip never leaves the confines of suburban New Jersey. In fact, the stoned main characters' only quest is to reach the titular fast food joint by daybreak. On the way, they take several detours in pursuit of drugs and sex.Many of the scenes in the film sound on paper like typically dumb stoner comedy fare (whacky characters, slutty girls, drug-induced dream sequences), but they are all executed with such brilliance that everything seems incredibly fresh.Also, this is one of the most gleefully, anarchically non-PC films ever made. I won't give too much away, but suffice it to say that the following line is indicative of what you're getting yourself into if you rent this flick (minor spoiler): ""Remember the Holocaust? Well, this was the opposite of that."" (Regarding a nude Katie Holmes).",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

They love weed and burgers and decide one night to set out on a journey to the nearest White Castle, an actually real hamburger fast food joint. They get sidetracked a lot by a rather diverse set of characters and at one point they even consider forgetting their destination. This film is unexpectedly good and will probably be a cult classic in the future. It's a morally-symbolic film disguised as a light humor movie. In the end, the characters drive a deep message home totally reinforcing the point to not judge a person by her/his physical features, but in this case it's the film you shouldn't be judging. You should be warned that this is a rated film and shouldn't be watched by the sensitive at heart. At the end of it, look beyond the laughs and think about the message it truly sends.

Luckily for the film makers, Oscars and golden globes were not what they were looking for. They succeeded in doing what they wanted to do, making the best buddy comedy of our generation so far. To do so, they had to make a wonderful connection between both 'rold and Kumar as characters which was done very well, and then to top off the humorous part, they had to put together the best one-liner jokes, and best vulgar and stupid jokes that made movies like American Pie, and the jokes that made Bill and Ted funny in both of their movies.

The appearance of Neal Patrick Harris ran totally counter to his image from Doogie Houser and I expect that was the intention. The best part of this DVD was the chance to see the special features. The guys who put these together have a very warped sense of humor, which was greatly appreciated. If you only watch one extra from this DVD, you MUST watch the segment on ""The Art of the Fart."" A mockumentary about getting just the right sound to make the ""taco sh*t"" scene work was brilliant and damned funny. I was waiting for both of the guys in this extra to just break out laughing but they held it together to make it seem like they were talking about scoring Gandhi or some other highbrow work.

The movie really does make this feel like a long, crazy adventure to go to a restaurant, and it works. We see the duo flee from a security guard, get picked up by a car mechanic, ride a cheetah, and much more.

Yes there is plenty of Drug Humor and sex humor, but the funniest stuff is actually the on going humor involved with racial inequality and characters who learn how to break those typifications because of their symbolic journey to White Castle. This film pushes the line between being too crude and sometimes too smart for it's own good. The Acting is Right on from the 2 leads and there are quite a bit of funny cameos.This film is similar to the American Pie films, but substitute the cutesy wootesy sub plots and messages with a realistic and brash message about race and class equality and beating the typifications we in life get tagged with constantly. The film has plenty of raunchy humor which acts as a great balance to the theme. It does dabble with some stereotypes but the times the stereotpyes are broken especially from Kumar who brings a light fun and jovial spirit to the film and has some of the funniest moments.At times the editing is so bad, especially when Kumar is peeing by the bush.The editing ruins a perfectly cast cameo which gets wasted it just ends up making no sense because of obvious excessive cuts.But overall I found it very very funny, and I did not leave feeling stupid like I did after the funny yet inherently stupid Dodgeball, but left thinking about these social and racial issues. Overall, I left a funny satire with some strong points and ideas that sometimes get overshot but still resonate . . . . a little anyway.

I was hoping to see more from Harold and Kumar--a few more movies, maybe a TV spin-off, but perhaps it was wise to leave the magic in one movie. Think of all the sequels and spin-offs that failed to summon the magic and flopped.Even Cheech & Chong, a seasoned comedy duo should have stopped cinematic endeavors with ""Up In Smoke."" Sure, the H&KGTWC relies on some cheap gags, like the psycho ex-child star and the Indian convenience store, but in this movie, they work.Harold & Kumar represent the a new generation of truly multicultural Americans!",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Hmmm Tricky Apparently there were some pretty girls in it too, which is always good. I suppose it's not aimed at my age/demographic. But I often find I like things not aimed at me - or anyone else in particular. In general the more a film tries to provoke a reaction in me the less it does so.

179,unimportant,"I liked Harold and Kumar, but White Castle didn't thrill me",5,10 January 2005,"Unlike the many comedies where everyone is a one-dimensional racial caricature, the characters of Harold and Kumar are funny without being insulting. Harold, an Asian-American investment banker, and Kumar, his Indian-American slacker roommate, both play up and mock racial stereotypes. Although Harold is smart, timid, and hard-working, he likes to have fun on the weekends, and is obsessed with a Latin-American beauty in his apartment complex, to the disappointment of the president of the Princeton Asian Culture club. Kumar is also smart, but lazy; pressured by his father and brother to go to medical school and become a doctor, he has a different lifestyle in mind, and intentionally botches medical school interviews so he doesn't get accepted.The plot of the movie is just as its title suggests: Harold and Kumar embark on a journey to satisfy their marijuana-induced munchies at White Castle. Although the characters are well-written, the situations they encounter are full of gross-out humor that's been done before, ridiculous situations that weren't funny enough to have a purpose, and drug humor that just doesn't appeal to me. One dream sequence, for example, has Kumar fall in love with and marry a large bag of marijuana; for some reason, many people thought this was hilarious, but I didn't find it particularly amusing.

180,GuitarJedi83,Stereotype-B!,7,15 January 2007,"Film has proved to be an effective medium to influence and shape the thoughts of movie-goers. Issues involving stereotypes have become areas where directors and scriptwriters explore; and in the process, engaging audiences to either develop, reinforce or challenge generalizations that were imbedded in our culture and society.Utilizing the genre of teenage comedy, Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle manages to accurately showcase stereotypes that are already existent for a long time in our society. Asian-Americans have long being stereotyped as hardworking, intelligent and submissive 'geeks' who wanted a piece of the American dream. The two lead characters actually live up to the stereotype by displaying intelligence and excellence in the things they do. However, their achievements were met by opposition by punks, colleagues and even law-enforcers. Despite their positive attributes, Asian minorities are still not being accepted by some sections of the American society and some see them as threats or regard them as second-class citizen. The film managed to accurately capture these various stereotypes put forth by the Americans against Asians, and actually reinforces the stereotyped attitudes that already capture our minds a long while ago.On the other hand, the introduction of Kung Fu movies such as Enter the Dragon illustrates the point that film can be used to dismiss certain notions of stereotype. Previously, Chinese male characters were reduced to an emasculated role as perceived by the western media. New action era produces yang gang icons such as Bruce Lee whom, through the media, creates an identity in which Asian males can indulge in glorified violence to honor traditions and justice. This is certainly a far cry from the image that portrays Asian Chinese males as meek and lacks ability to play bigger roles in the western societies. Similarly in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, the lead characters managed to prove that they can move out of the perceived stereotype that were held against them, and actually reject considerations such as submissiveness by rebelliously standing up against the western antagonists. At the same time, both Harold and Kumar also proved that they are not socially inept in a foreign land and that Asians are able to find an identity that fits into American culture (ironically through the usage of drugs and sex).In conclusion, film allows stereotype issues to be put into various perspectives and actually challenge audiences to discover for themselves how realistic or inaccurate some of these perceived opinions are. As multiple stereotypes are being presented throughout the two films, movie-goers are exposed to the different views and attitudes that certain fractions of the society held against those who are different from them. Filmmakers managed to use film as a medium to describe the various stereotype issues to the audience. Then, it will be up to the audience to think through and decide which school of thoughts and what sort of stereotype they would like to subscribe to.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
181,VulcanPhil,Antics in New Jersey,7,25 September 2006,"Being originally from New Jersey, I had concerns after seeing Dan Akroyd rip NJ a new one in his movie debacle, Nothing But Trouble. Harold & Kumar... had some fun with NJ's reputation and factual headlines, but it did not seem mean-spirited to me. There were weird characters, crooked cops and middle fingers flying out of car windows, but nice parts of NJ were also shown.I was pleasantly surprised that White Castle was voluntarily included in this movie. One that clearly depicts a classic motive for going to WC: marijuana-induced munchies. Of course, the nearest WCs are in Newark, but they couldn't get in nearly as much fun trouble on such a short trip.Anyway, there's not much else to say about this movie. This is no Mel Brooks classic, but it was fun and I also got a taste of my old home, oozing warts and all.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
182,MozaredTFT,"A watered down version of ""Dude, Where's my Car?""",7,22 December 2009,"I'll have to admit - pretty much the sole reason I stopped and gave this movie a glance is because of the ""From the director of ""Dude, where's my car"""" line on the DVD case. I loved that movie and figured this couldn't be much worse.I was, mostly, right. Harold & Kumar seems to be a little bit of a B-version of ""Dude, Where's my Car"" - everything this movie does right, Leiner does better in Dude. There's still plenty of nonsense-stoner but oh-so-funny high school humour going around, but this movie seems to have more parts that try too hard to be funny and therefore fail at it. Just like Dude, H&K has it's ups and downs, though it seems to have a couple more downs than Dude did.That said however, I can't deny that I laughed myself stiff over some of the incredibly satirical humour the movie features. And aside from that, H&K also seems to be one of the few comedic videos I've seen that actually manages to make a parody out of racism and racist stereotypes without failing completely. Regardless of the few flaws it has, it's still a good watch.In the end though, if you would ask me ""Should I see this movie?"", I would tell you there there are only three options: either you liked ""Dude, where's my car?"" - in that case, watching Harold & Kumar is probably a must - or, you disliked ""Dude, where's my car?"" - in that case, avoid H&K at all costs. If you haven't seen ""Dude, where's my car?"", then watch that instead and judge from there.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

What was supposed to be a trip down the highway turns into a night of run-ins with a Freakshow, escaping the cops, and Neil Patrick Harrison.Sounds like another stupid, teen flick, right? But to my and my roommate's surprise, it was witty and hilarious. We watched this at 2 in the morning on a Saturday night, and loved it.

184,dedebee,Take a trip with 'Harold and Kumar',8,24 January 2005,"It might look like a stupid stoner movie on the surface, but underneath the racial stereotypes, the marijuana jokes, the toilet humor and the gratuitous nudity of ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,"" there's a groundbreaking movie. What makes it so groundbreaking? Well, it's not the movie itself, but rather its two stars: John Cho and Kal Penn.When was the last time you saw a Korean-American and an Indian American actor co-headlining a movie? That's right, never. It's actually a bold move on New Line Cinema's part, distributing this flick without major stars or even hot young actors who might be on a WB television show. In the hands of anyone more traditional, this could have been ""Harold and Billy Go to White Castle,"" with the titular duo turned into Caucasians and played by Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott (the stars of director Danny Leiner's previous movie, ""Dude, Where's My Car?""). Thankfully, more non-conventional minds prevailed.The basic premise and plot of the movie is nothing special. Harold (Cho), an uptight workaholic, and Kumar (Penn), a smart yet underachieving slacker, are roommates who set out on a journey to find the ultimate post-smoke-up snackWhite Castle hamburgers. Unfortunately for them, the journey to find the nearest White Castle is filled with random and unexpected obstacles, including crazed raccoons, escaped cheetahs, and deformed rednecks. You've probably seen most of the gags in other movies, but that doesn't make them any less hilarious.As Harold, Cho proves to be an able lead, playing the straight man to Penn's Kumar. However, Penn doesn't seem to connect as well in his role. He begins to wear thin as the end of the movie nears and I can't figure out if it's the character or Penn's performance that causes this. The rest of the cast is filled with moderately known comedic actors in great cameos, including Doogie Howser himself, Neil Patrick Harris, playing what is hopefully an amplified parody of himself.""Harold and Kumar"" starts to run out of steam in the last third as the punchlines and gags begin to slow down and the film starts trying to tie up all of its loose ends. Still, there's more than enough laughs to keep lowbrow humor enthusiasts entertained. There's even a tiny bit of social commentary thrown in about race relations (don't worry, it's not done heavy-handedly, but rather in the same comedic vein as the rest of the film). All in all, the film proves to be a fun ride that coasts on the novelty of its two stars. Hopefully, ""Harold and Kumar"" will be successful enough to lead to more films with characters like Harold and Kumar as the leads.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
185,fireflame94,One of the best comedies i have ever seen,10,11 August 2009,"This movie is one which does not take itself seriously. From the beginning the movie doesn't make any notions of realistic characters or believable situations. Harold and Kumar instead decides to use wacky comedy from the outset, as well as both embracing stereotypical depictions of the Asian community while also turning them on their head.Because of this the movie is able to be very funny as it is clear with it's intentions from the outset and you aren't left thinking why the character development didn't really happen, or if stoners behave this way.One of the most comedic features of the movie is it's use of stereotypes. While giving Harold and Kumar very typical jobs for their ethnicity, Harold the Korean hard-working investment banker and Kumar the very gifted pre-med student, it then proceeds to have them smoking pot and in general behaving in a manner usually thought of as more typical of other ethnicities.Another example would be the Princeton scene, with the Asian community interviewing him in a very typical way, discussing his career, and telling them about a party they are having, where, only to have him find that the party they were throwing, with one of the members mothers having made very good food. We then have him politely decline before seeing the party with the people smoking weed and dancing half-naked.However not all the comedy is in that vain, with more typical stoner-comedy ground being treaded, such as riding a cheetah.One of the most inspired things in the whole movie is Neil Patrick Harris' cameo. He comes in and delivers some very good lines and is able to portray himself as a nutcase in a somewhat convincing manner, though the movie does not lend itself to that.Though it eliminated character-driven, realistic comedy, it didn't really need any as the plot was fairly predictable, though it took some twists and turns along the way, so the emphasis was on the delivery of the one liners and other stuff.To summarise Harold and Kumar is a brilliant film which from the beginning doesn't take itself seriously and is therefore able to use wide-ranging comedy from one-liners to slightly more subtle stuff, though eliminating character-driven comedy.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

187,pvn9,Dare to Laugh,10,17 July 2005,"Wow! What a movie! Amazing. It made me laugh right from the beginning till the end. To summarize, the movie is all about two guys, an Indian premed student and a Korean investment banker, who head out at night to get some burgers from White Castle. Along with the burgers (which they manage only at the end), they end up involving themselves into varieties of adventures including escaping from cops and encountering a cheetah! These adventures point out to a certain amount of ugly racial tensions that exist in this country. It is also a slap on face for all those people who harbor grudge against people on racial grounds. Humor is in all ranges, from grossest punctuated with sexual innuendos to very subtle and fine (Harold's co-workers treating him like a nobody at the beginning), which you might manage to catch if you pay attention. There is a decent amount of nudity in the movie, but the movie would have been great despite them. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I have no problem in rating it a perfect ten out of ten.

188,doyoubelieveingod-39954,Latest reviewing tainted my good memory,7,1 July 2021,"So, before I begin I would like to state for the record that for a very long time I would have considered this an 8 or 9.I'm in the middle of maybe the 7th viewing since first watching this about 12 years ago. This movie nails a lot of what it goes for and, yes, should be considered for the stoner canon of films. It could have been the next Cheech and Chong if the leads wanted that. I even somewhat liked the sequel, though it was a noticeable decline in quality....Heavy spoilers to follow...However, what stuck out this most recent viewing was just how many of my favorite moments are similar to other classic bits done ibefore. This latest viewing I had realized when they got to Newark early on, it was hitting the same spot as National Lampoon's Vacation. Before I had noticed the similarity to the bush peeing bit (featuring Jamie Kennedy) to There's Something About Mary, and (more egregiously) the raccoon in the car being similar to the deer bit in Tommy Boy.Now I am not alleging that this film plagiarized any of the mentioned film, and understand that some of the similarity may be my own pattern recognition. But it does make me question my enjoyment, and if some weight is being carried by other things I already liked. Just a bummer.But this film does a lot right and is funny throughout. I still enjoy the viewing experience and I can't hate it.There is also some problematic language that hasn't aged the greatest. Contextually, I think it's thematically justified, but I think if it was made today it wouldn't belabor it as much. Your mileage may vary.Anyway, still funny and relevant. Worth the watch, or rewatch, but I'm not as in love with it as I once was.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
189,kayobee,Cool except for the chicks,7,17 January 2005,"Like some others, I agree that this film was not just funny, but displayed real wit. (I even loved the promos in which the actors are referred to as ""the Indian guy from"" movie X and ""the Asian guy from"" movie Y.) The leads are solid actors and they both have strong comedy skills. And yes, like some others, I've had the Ivy League experience and do know folks very like the ones portrayed.But.... My friends and I have a saying about movies or books in which women are people, not eye candy or plot devices -- we call them ""cool on chicks"". H&KG2WC definitely ain't cool on chicks; they exist as -- well, as plot devices. I found it particularly disappointing because I thought the film handled the issues of ethnic stereotyping/immigrant acculturation/ethnic identity and all the rest quite well, with genuine wit and believable shading (for example, when Kumar acknowledges there are worse ethnic stereotypes than being assumed a medical prodigy). Then again, there are darn few films that are cool on chicks, and it's even harder where the female roles are all small, as they are in this film.But if you can ignore this failing, or just don't care about it, I think you'll have an unreservedly good time watching this film.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
190,hannahclac,Hilarious!,9,24 January 2020,"I think this movie is hilarious. It still makes me laugh no matter how many times I've watched it. For that, it is one of my favorite comedies and probably always will be. It's not just a stoner film. Sure, they get high a few times throughout the movie, but as someone else mentioned, the comedy isn't just based on the fact that they're high like so many other stoner films. There's a lot of great social commentary and satire regarding racial stereotypes, which I love and appreciate.One of the reviews for this movie said that this is predictable. In what way is it predictable? Soo.. you predicted that Harold and Kumar would ride on a cheetah, pick up Neil Patrick Harris on the side of the road, hide in a bathroom stall while listening to the British girls play battle sh#ts, and all the other random scenes in the movie? Sure, Jan.I'm a fan of all three Harold and Kumar movies, but this is definitely the best one. If you haven't seen this movie already, what are you waiting for? It's a fun watch.

So I loved it on that level.The problem is that the jokes in this film aren't funny and it often veers into cartoon territory (READ: WAY over the top). I think that it would have worked if it were directed better. John Landis would have totally made a movie like this work. But give the director credit for even attempting a film like this.

Sure there are a few times in this movie where I didn't laugh when a joke may have been intended, but there were many times I laughed out loud. The characters are basic but enjoyable, and this is most likely Neil Patrick Harris's best role; as a drugged out version of himself. If you're not necessarily looking for a really deep or emotional movie, and you're relaxed and ready to be pretty offended, I would suggest this.

Somehow, Harold and Kumar manage to even incorporate gross-out humor that is actually funny.H&K is probably the funniest movie you will see this year, and far surpasses the hilarity in any idiocy-based comedy I've seen in a long time.The escapades of the obsessive-compulsive harold, and the overzealous, white castle craving lunatic kooooomar (kuumar (no wait, Kumar)) manage to be completely random, yet all tied together.

I figured it would be another loud, annoying movie that uses shock value to make you think it's funny.Well, Harold & Kumar is like that in a way, but is pulled off much better than movies like ""How High."" Yes, the plot revolves around post-college losers getting high, but the shock value of drug use isn't used as a crutch for a movie that claims to be a comedy. This film is a satire of sorts, poking fun at racism, drug culture (the anti-marijuana ad in particular was hilarious), and various quirks of society.However, this movie still would not have made it for me if it weren't for the ""chemistry"" (if it can be called that) between Harold and Kumar. Harold is a striving smart guy struggling to succeed who often gets the short end of the stick, while Kumar is a carefree medical genius who always manages to get the two into worse situations. In their quest for the perfect way to satisfy the munchies, they react to many strange characters and situations, in only the way each character can.All in all, Harold & Kumar is a very funny, oddball comedy that should only be watched if you're not looking for a sophisticated movie.

Harold's (John Cho) cautious and somewhat uptight approach to situations contrast with Kumar's more laid back attitude leads to great interplay between the characters.

207,Kueko,"""Harold & Kumar"" are not your average stereotypes",8,13 May 2005,"With movies like ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"", you generally know what to expect: gross-out humor, excessive sex jokes, and comedy that is mostly hit-and-miss. On all these fronts, ""Harold and Kumar"" doesn't disappoint (assuming these are the things you want to see in a movie). As a bonus, there are also some clever twists on stereotypes and racism that cause the movie to rise above other teen movies to become something slightly smarter than you were expecting.The plot of ""Harold and Kumar"" is as thin as paper. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are two intelligent guys who, by day, do respectable activities such as being an investment banker (Harold), and being a much sought-after medical school candidate (Kumar), but by night they like nothing more than to kick back and smoke some weed. It's the drugs that cause all the trouble since while high, Harold and Kumar are enticed to the nearest White Castle restaurant by a commercial that, no doubt, would not have seemed half as good if they weren't high. Nevertheless, this sets our likable goof balls off on a road trip to find a White Castle restaurant, and along the way encounter many roadblocks, most prominently being losing their high and needing more weed.The one difference between this particular comedy and the others like it (for example, ""Dude, Where's My Car?,"" which was also directed by Danny Leiner) is the continuous reminders that the two main characters are Asian and Indian. The movie gleefully pokes fun at the traditional teen movies where characters like Harold and Kumar would be nothing more than exaggerated side-characters. It's these moments that had me laughing the most, though that's not to say watching Harold and Kumar's run-in with a very angry raccoon was not funny in its own right.""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"" has a little something for everyone; even people who are out of their teen years, who are probably more likely to appreciate some of the cameos that I didn't recognize, will enjoy this movie. Everyone who liked ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" should see it  and so should everyone who didn't. It plays to many tastes.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

But after stumbling across the 'Harold & Kumar' films on an IMDb list, I thought 'hey ho' lets give it a try. God am I happy that I did, this movie is one of the funniest and easy to watch films I have ever seen! Starting off with the two pals getting stoned in their apartment and then getting a major case of the munchies they starting arguing about where they're gonna eat shortly after their argument they see a very American advert for a fast food place known as 'White Castle.' So being as roasted out of there heads are they were they decided to set off to 'White Castle!' Which doesn't turn out to be as easy as they thought it would be. Meeting red necks, runaway cheetahs, crack head celebrities and a couple of girls, this movie is a great film to sit down and watch with the lads, or even just by yourself if you are looking for an easy to watch film which will make you laugh and defiantly make you wanna set out on a road trip of your own.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Oh, wait, Ummm... In this movie, they saved someone's life. Oh wait, Ummm... There were those guys who were chasing them in this one. Oh, wait, Ummm... In this one, he got the girl at the end, Oh wait, Ummm... The first movie included actors who were in such blockbusters as ""American Pie,"" and ""A Lot Like Love."" No, that's not it. Ummm... They were imprisoned? They ran into a has-been star from a critically-acclaimed 1990's TV series? The climax of the movie involved the title? Oops, I guess that technically that's a spoiler. Sorry about that. Was it all of the references to pop-culture? Were they just the same movie? Okay, I've tiptoed around it enough. How about that in ""Dude,"" they were white, while in ""White Castle,"" they weren't? Wow, was it that simple? No it wasn't. In ""Dude,"" they were Pizza Delivery boys, while in ""White Castle,"" they were both college graduates? So, 2 white Pizza Delivery boys had the same adventure as 2 minorities with college degrees. Ashton Kutcher's making out with Charlie O'Connel's girlfriend is equivalent to Kal Penn and John Cho being Indian and Asian, respectively? Trespassing on a lunatic's private property is the equivalent of being a minority in the State of New Jersey, even if you're a SECOND GENERATION LEGAL CITIZEN who speaks PERFECT English?! A White Pizza Delivery guy solving a Rubic's cube is the equivalent of an Indian Pre-Med student pulling off an operation to save someone's life? A black college professor is the equivalent of Andy Dick? I'm sure there are many more examples that I've missed. The point is that people are all the same, regardless of race, as long as you're comparing incompetent whites to overachieving minorities. And that's the difference between the 2 movies.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

The tale of their journey through the midnight world of convenience stores, Ivy League parties, and unexpected encounters on the highway is brilliantly put together and superbly executed. The two lead actors are gifted comedians-- I especially like Kumar's eye-bugging expression in the face of both bliss and horror-- but Harold's more reserved comic timing is also excellent. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and Neil Patrick Harris is a hoot. There are so many laughs, too many to recount. Just watch it!",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

It makes ""Elvis Has Left the Building"" look like an Oscar contender. One must assume that its fans are utter idiots and/or drunken stoners. Oh well, what else can one expect these days? Ten lines are required by IMDb to create a valid post. This fits with the general degradation of culture.

Add that with getting stoned and munchies and well... this movie is definitely going into my DVD collection for those random nights. You know, those random nights where you've finished 1 round of midterms and the next round isn't coming around for a while, so you kick back on the couch with some buddies, order pizza, and follow that one cardinal rule of smoking - smoke before eat.Cho and Penn play their parts very well and pretty much reflect the many college and post-college friends that I have. I really couldn't stop laughing throughout the movie, from the bong-toking ringtone to the perfect line at the end - ""Dude, where's my car?"" ""yeah dude, where's his car?"" The scenes in between were all masterfully thought of, unlike another stoner movie (Supertroopers) that kind of tailed off at the end.I found the movie to be very solid, and one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It poked fun at touchy subjects - racism and marijuana, and captured those adventurous nights that all college students have. Coming into the movie I didn't think it could measure up to some of those nights that I've had that start out with a toke and end with the sunrise, but it really did measure up. 10/10",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

All of them make no sense.Maybe it's one of those movies that only Americans can understand (and maybe laugh ?), but for the rest of the world, I believe, it should look like one of the worst movies ever.

Did I have a laugh or two in the process? Yes. Was it worth the money I spent to rent it? No. This film goes through the basic movements of your typical stoner flick. There's the hot girl that is interest to one of the characters while the second character is your basic horn dog. You have the stoner aspect where everyone is looking for the perfect high. And last but not least the world seems to form itself into a circus of freaks around the only two normal characters who just happen to be stoners with fart joke personalities.

220,Scotchorama,Danny Leiner redeems himself with a refreshing comedy.,7,18 July 2004,"Regular sidekicks John Cho and Kal Penn take over the spotlight in a refreshing comedy that tackles issues of ethnicity and racial stereotypes while still maintaining a high score on the laugh-a-minute counter.The movie combines ""below the belt"" jokes and social commentaries, in a kind of Office Space meets American Pie meets Road Trip adventure.*Possible Spoilers*Two pot-head roommates, a Korean-American investment banker and an Indian-American med school applicant, decide, after getting the ""munchies"", that what they need to ""hit the spot"" is a White Castle feast. They then embark on a New Jersey-wide adventure during which they meet, among others, ""Extreme Sports Punks"", their neighbors (two Jewish pot-heads, one of whom is played by Eddie Kaye Thomas--American Pie's Finch), a disgruntled White-Castle-loving Burger Shack employee (played by Anthony Anderson), a ""wife sharing"" auto mechanic named Freakshow (played by an unrecognizable Christopher Meloni of Law & Order SVU fame), a racist abusive disturbed cop, and many other delightful characters... including a sex-crazed ""NPH"" (Neil Patrick Harris, playing himself).While containing the usual teen comedy gross out elements (cf. Dude Where's My Car, Van Wilder, American Pie, etc...), ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" adds a new dimension to the usual comedy. Stereotypes are now reversed, and white Americans are now the sidekicks. Some scenes are fairly bitter sweet, and actually achieve a surprisingly more ""intellectual"", or more ""ethnic-oriented"" overtone. Some of the jokes will be better understood by the Asian viewer, others by New Jersey inhabitants, while many will appeal to all viewers.All in all, thumbs up to director Danny Leiner who, in this reviewer's humble opinion, has redeemed himself (cf. Dude Where's My Car). Although still part of mainstream comedy, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" is closer to a Kevin Smith movie than an American Pie. It will be interesting to see if this movie is the first of a trend of comedies featuring Asian Americans as the main protagonists.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

(One of the things that bothered me about Cheech & Chong, was feeling let down by the lack of intelligent humor to balance out the lowbrow content.)

Frankly some of it was too crude for me personally.However, that said, if that is all you see in the movie that you didn't really get it. There are a lot of clever and subtle elements in the movie. Being a first-gen American, I could see a lot of slices of Americana that aren't often in cinema in a brilliant and nonchalant way. It both includes and lampoons lots of stereotypes.There are lots of great lines and moments, and even plot elements (the whole Doogie Howser thing!). This comes at the cost of having a disjointed and silly overall plot. This is not a serious movie, folks. So the genuine bits and expressions even more brilliant. For example, the scene where Kumar is ""defending"" having a non-Anglo name to the cop, simultaneously feeling betrayed by Harold who gleefully points out that he has an ""American"" name, and then mouthing off about how unfair and ridiculous the cop is behaving. That scene alone makes the movie worthwhile, IMO.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
224,JonathanWellington,"A visually stunning, intellectually rewarding film",10,20 April 2006,"Danny Leiner's most popular film, ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"", is one of the most beautiful films of all time. From its subdued, atmospheric use of color to its smooth, graceful camera-work, this is an overwhelmingly visual film.Luckily, the script is up to par. Danny Leiner is one of the greatest screenwriters in history, and he is at top form here. The scene with Harold and Kumar arguing about the state of the New Union is one of the most chilling in cinematic history, thanks especially to Danny Leiner's taut, wonderfully impressive screenplay.The plot is rather complex; far too advanced to summarize here, in less than 100,000 words. Basically, there is a man named Harold. He is an average thirty year old man, with an average-looking wife and a newborn baby who is, well, average. On the way to work on one average day, his car is hijacked by the famed political activist Kumar. This activist - or terrorist? - brandishes a large, cylinder-shaped rocket launcher. He also sports an M16, which he impressively stores in his large mouth.Many things happen. In one sentence I will try my hardest to summarize these events, without giving away the infamous, chilling twist. Kumar forces Harold to assassinate the president and establish a new government, called the New Union. The last quarter of the film centers around the inevitable demise of the New Union and Harold himself.So that was two sentences. I apologize sincerely, but the film is so incredible and deep -- there is no possible way to write but one sentence about its intricate, involving story line.The bottom line is this: if you want masterful directing, an utterly impressive plot, one of the greatest screenplays ever written, an unforgettable pan flute score, and acting at its best, go and see Danny Leiner's 10 hour epic, ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle.""

It's random, it's a mind-mess and the continuity is way off, but Cho and Penn toss in enough personality to make each scene zoom past with EXTREME hilarity.For the cinephile who might shy away from films like this, there are enough cheesy movie references to make it worth a look. It's great to see some ethnicities other than whites and blacks get their own comedy, and it's even better to see them take racial profiling and mix it into a plot about stoners.

228,gsanchet,This movie was supposed to have everything I hate in these types of movies,7,16 May 2005,"It had all the makings of why I hated these type of genre movies. Teen comedies with guy trying to lose their virginity seemed to be beat to death by the Sixteen Candles stuff, only to be resurrected by Scream and the movies that followed after (which didn't seem to have the knowing ""wink"" at the audience that Scream did). I never saw myself in these comedies. Long Duk Dong in 16 candles came close (hey, there's an Asian guy. but he's such an idiot. but he's Asian!). I could appreciate these movies by being an American, but I couldn't find people who were like me that weren't stereotypes.My brother had me rent the movie yesterday, and I have to admit that I really liked it. It didn't cop out with the stereotypes...hell it even showed why certain Asian stereotypes were there in the first place. The previous movies I saw with notable Asian Actors was Yellow and American Adobo (not to mention the very fun but short lived Margret Cho Show), and I really liked that, for a mainstream movie like this, that they would acknowledge 1) why these stereotypes exist 2) why these stereotypes are funny and 3) why these characters don't necessarily prescribe to these stereotypes. Both Harold and Kumar come from second generation families. Even though Kumar's speech was a little over the top, it highlights the right idea of how the first generation sees the second generation and how it's the job of the second generation to change traditions (for a very similar speech, check out Yellow which has an immigrant father telling his son's girlfriend why he only believes in work instead of ideology).This movie also works well in the realm of comedy because it blends the general idea of a ""comedy of manners"" from British comedy and a ""comedy of teens"" from American comedy into something that really works. Race-comedy is America's bread and butter, and to have a comedy about race that deals with the idea of ""model minorities"" really made this movie for me.I was a very big fan of this Asian-American theatrical troop when I was younger (their name escapes me right now) from San Fransisco and Harold and Kumar remind me why I liked that troop in the first place: Asian people aren't just an object of comedy and ridicule, they have emotional experiences that are tragic and funny and are relatable to different people.gsanchet",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

The entire movie was so painfully stupid! There were about 2 good scenes in the whole entire film, which are definitely not worth paying for to go see. The story tells of two stupid guys on an incredibly boring and dumb trip to White Castle. They get lost, high, almost laid repeatedly, robbed, jailed, ride a high cheetah, meet a horny TV star and a man named 'Freakshow', bitten by a raccoon, and finally hang-glide over to White Castle to get their food, save the day and make out with elevator-girl. Overall plot is idiotic, only topped by its extremely poor jokes.Simply put, it was a disgusting, moronic and piece of $#*^ movie.People who actually give good ratings to this film clearly no longer know a good from a crap movie. We can only thank Hollywood for allowing the film industry to come to this kind of lameness. Why don't we just make movies now about people taking a dump in the bathroom?

For all those that love The Big Lebowski, this movie will make a lot of sense. There are loads and loads of memorable lines in the film. Even more interesting was the interesting metaphors about race relations, immigration and assimilation in the US. It seems to me that White Castle (not, in my view, randomly selected as the munchie destination of choice) represented that idealized destination that all those pursuing happiness and the American Dream seek out. A telling moment is where Harold and Kumar, before getting to White Castle, see their Jewish friends Goldstein and Rosenberg happily enjoying their hotdogs in another fast food joint. They gaze longingly at their two friends and Harold says ""I want what they have"". He elaborates that he means having exactly what you want, not hot dogs per se. You could argue that this was a metaphor for Asian-American and Indian-American first or second generation immigrants looking to Jewish-Americans as examples of a group that came to the US and managed to be admitted to the ""White Castle"", to assimilate and to ultimately attain the American Dream. I could be way off about this, but it's clear that immigration, assimilation and race-relations is a prominent theme throughout the film.

However, it was nice to see two minority types playing average people as opposed to overdone stereotypes of them. As far as the story goes, it was not all that feasible. The events that went on were forced, and anybody who believes any of it wants an excuse to watch the amusement. If you need a good laugh, keep your eyes peeled and don't miss a second, but if you are looking for a great story line and developing characters, you will be disappointed. It's better than any average Joe would theorize, but don't expect brilliance.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

It does miracles to your mood. I happen to watch this movie in a bad day, as the movie past i started to feel happy, i just couldn't believe a film could do such a thing on a person.The argument doesn't seem very rich, but it all compensates with the colours the actors give to the characters in the different situations get them to a climax of fun, joy and great laughs. Well folks to finish i will like to say John Cho and Kal Penn are made for comedy and they know how to make people laugh good. And the most notable of all is that the director attacked stereotypes but from a healthy natural and super funny way, so Danny Leiner in direction, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg in the scripts .....

238,silverHat222,Me Too!,7,27 August 2006,I wish I could say I had a White Castle story like this. But I don't:-( I used to go there every Monday though. That's when I went out that way with my job. Any way I thought the movie was great. I laughed so hard. I haven't laughed like that since the old Cheech movies. The girl in this movie is so gorgeous. But if I had to choose who was funnier between the two guys I'd say the Asian guy. Just his facial expressions alone made me laugh without him even saying a word. I'm looking forward to the next one. I can see this movie going on up to a part five or so until they get old and no one cares anymore. But part two should be a treat. I'll be the first in line.

It's light years beyond Dude Where's My Car?, or for that matter any stoner/dumbass flick I've seen in years. This will be a cult comedy classic, one you watch ten times till you know all the words. How many times do you get to see someone so excited over a giant bag of marijuana that he dances slow-motion in circles with it, then marries it, then bitch-slaps it because it served him bad coffee, then sobs and hugs it, crying, ""I love you honey!""? (This is a dream sequence, and uh it's funnier that it sounds.) Or this description of seeing Katie Holmes topless: ""You know the holocaust? It was, like, the complete opposite of that, man!"" Or when a med school admissions officer asks one of the lead characters, who has a perfect score on the MCATs, why he doesn't want to be a doctor.

But it's a great laugh ! In the beginning, it seems like just another teen-college (college people getting sillier but wiser then ever) movie. Something like ""When Eurotrip (!) met How High (!)"".... I think that if you loved those movies (mensioned here above), then you must see this one ! This film has new (2005) angles on immigrant prototypes, especially the young ones (2nd generation in America), and their own pursuit of happiness. Don't expect too much though.

They run into people they know, they go to parties, go to jail,they ride on a cheetah's back they almost die, they hand glide in the air and constantly get off track their whole journey just to go to White Castle.

I am continually impressed with New Jersey movies. The Korean dude plays an attractive nerd as well as Cary Grant and the Indian dude matches Katherine Hepburn's manic energy. Kevin Smith and Todd Solondz better watch out. They no longer own the state of New Jersey. The director dude is that good. The movie is crude and will not appeal to all tastes.

244,imdb-1810,Harold & Kumar KICKS ASS,9,4 August 2004,"""This night is about The American Dream"" - perhaps an unlikely quote from this movie about everything stupid and profane. Under this story about a munchie-hunt trip to a legendary burger joint, lies a tender, pulsating message about race, tolerance and potential. In fact, the director lays on the moral undercurrent so thick that you are only prevented from choking on it by the fact that you are laughing so hard. I left the theatre wondering if this movie was truly wonderful, or too manipulative a combination. Undoing the stereotypes it parodies, Harold and Kumar's assault on White Castle is successful because the people are human (though fantastic) and familiar (though characteristic of their sub-cultures.)Having said all that - if you've not yet seen this movie, you should see it expecting trash comedy... done right.Oh yeah, - there's a lot of tits, weed and violence.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

The lead characters did a great job in this movie. John Cho and Kal Penn were hilarious. A lot of the Asian stereotypes were dead on, and I can appreciate that being Japanese myself. Cameos by Ryan Reynolds, Bobby Lee, and Jamie Kennedy where also damn funny. Harold and Kumar would have proven that ""Just cause I ain't white don't mean it ain't alright"" accept they where up against the subtle brilliance that is Neil Patrick Harris. The plot only consists of the two guys getting high, then having some wacky adventures while trying to get food. That may not sound all that interesting, however the great characters and hilarious jokes actually make for a great movie.

Consequently, when I won free tickets to see Harold and Kumar at a sneak preview attended by John Cho and Kal Penn, the writers, and the director, I was interested to see what this type of wacky movie would reveal.This movie is definitely in the line of movies like Dude, Where's My Car (not a surprise, considering the director) and Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. There some very wacky and random scenes where you have to say what the heck??!! as you laugh hysterically. Not unsurprisingly, given that it was a sneak peek with the cast and filmmakers, I watched the movie in a packed theater, and it seems that most of the people really got into it. I would say that I liked this movie much better than Dude, Where's My Car, but I don't know if it will have the cult-like staying power of Bill & Ted.I think that you should go see it if you've enjoyed other movies that are similar in concept to these. John Cho and Kal Penn do an amazing job in their respective roles. There are some crude moments a la Dude/American Pie/etc, some slapstick humor, and some zany situations.

Forgive when I say that I am a cinematic expert with great taste in movies, but it's true. The writing in this movie was horrible. The acting was not much better. The story line itself is ridiculous. The only people who would be entertained by this movie are of subnormal intelligence who are easily amused. Simple minds are easily amused. I have trouble imagining how this piece of cinematic shame got funding. The director must be mildly retarded to lend his/her name to such a shoddy movie. How do these actors get jobs? I feel equally retarded as anyone involved in making this crappy film, as I actually spent MONEY to see it. I should have followed my friend as he left in the middle of this movie, but I needed to confirm that it was as horrible as it was. Or maybe I was too shocked by the overall horrible story line. Thinking about this movie literally raises my blood pressure with rage. I would normally write an intelligent and hilariously true smack-in-the-face review for a film of this caliber, but I'm too fatigued with rage to do so. If you see this movie for entertainment, you are stupid. Even if you want to see it to be entertained by it's shittiness, you are stupid because it's too bad for that.

A previous poster inquired as to what non-Americans thought of the movie.I am European and saw the film,American cultural references aside, as truly woeful. A series of poorly executed "" comedic"" spots that culminated in the incredibly tired ethnic comedy act that is ""whitey is the devil"" punchlines. I do not understand how this film is rated 7.7!?. Have any of you seen Mortal Combat II Annihilation with the ""animality"". Thats how bad this was. Damn it, I really wanted to love this movie and am so disappointed. one thing I have learned is if they thought Ashton and Sean would do a sequel to Dude(or even assumed this was the sequel), they can forget about it.

They get beaten up, chased, and put down, but these two freaking hilarious guys stand strong and finally make it to White Castle at the end of the movie, of course getting stoned along the way.

The humor isn't as simple as you'd think, coming from the creator of 'Dude where's my car', but it's pretty basic.

256,matthew_schaffner,"A ridiculous, but somehow inspirational journey",7,7 December 2014,"This film is awesome, and despite its reliance on illicit humour, I not only found it funny but also quite inspiring.Firstly, the plot's not that complex, and often at times ridiculous. But it is held together by Harold and Kumar's journey exposing some great chemistry between John Cho and Kal Penn. They bring along a very relatable, juxtaposed friendship, following the classic funny man/straight man routine perfectly.Even better so, these characters are flawed: Harold is a push-over and Kumar is in denial. And it is excellent how in achieving their goal after a long journey, they are able to reflect on themselves, and overcome their flaws. They help establish a connection to viewers, as their portrayals seem real.And I love how even though comedy ties into the whole film, themes of racism, social profiling, and drug abuse are dealt in such a way to have serious undertones that challenge audiences and allows them to sympathise with the protagonists,I also enjoyed NPH's appearance, and how it subsequently put him back into business, he is a great talent.However, this film is not perfect. Sometimes the humour falls short by being too ridiculous or unappealing. Also the low budget of this film is obvious through its sometimes poor editing.Nevertheless, I thought it was a very entertaining and oddly inspirational story, at least to the ""young people"" it was marketed to.

If you want to see an excellent tasteless movie, go for the ones with a constructive layer such as ""Orange County"" or ""Borat"". That's what I call intelligent rude, crude, over the top humor which doesn't let aside sexual jokes and even stoners. It makes one's eyes bleed seeing there will be a sequel to this. I can only say that mankind is at bay since Sacha Baron Cohen's movie was discussed at a presidential level (which displays an exquisitely stingy humor with an intelligence which only an Oxford graduate would show in such a manner, as in his case), yet the majority finely became complacent with such a pathetic excuse for a movie as this BS. The extremely stupid so-called tasteless jokes were so one after another that the humor was out of question. Easily boring and predictable for someone with a decent IQ who expects to laugh his head off.This is just another proof of how low human beings can sink when it comes to ""rude"" humor.

It is truly and feel-good, hilarious comedy. Not to mention a HUGE boost in White Castle business. ;) I know I plan on stopping by my local White Castle and picking up a bunch of Sliders. Overall, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle is a must-see.. TWICE !! (.. okay four times.)",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
272,kstarboy,Harold and Kumar Definitely A Stoner Comedy [Review],6,22 July 2004,"I just arrived back from my advance screening of Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle. To be honest, the previews don't do the movie justice; it was better than I expected it to be. That's not to say I'd be willing to pay for it though, a possible rental could be in order.If you're a comedy junkie (by comedy I mean of course the stupider bits of comedy, we're not talking Coen Brothers here), then I'd recommend it if you've seen all the other movies on your list, otherwise it's wise to just wait and rent it. Also, if you're a fan of Stoner comedies, you might wanna check this out.Though there are ethnic stereotype jokes, there are not a lot (whether or not you think that's good or bad, I'll let you decide). They definitely don't detract from the film and I did find some of them funny.Taking the movie for what it's worth (it's no academy award winning drama), I'd rate Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle **1/2 out of **** stars.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
273,caschatze,Fantastic Movie for the Minorities,9,27 July 2004,"This movie, though it looks stupid, is really... well... pretty much that, stupid. What do you expect from the same guy who brought you ""Dude, where's my car?"". But it's better, absolutely hilarious, especially for those who have seen the majority of the recent Teeny-Bopper, High School movies such as ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""Van Wilder"", ""American Pies"" and as mentioned above ""Dude, where's my car?"". You'll see actors from other movies that you know and love (the main guy, Ethan Embry, from Can't hardly Wait, Finch from the American Pies, Ryan Reynolds who is Van Wilder, also worth mentioning Anthony Anderson). The two main stars themselves, are familiar to us (Kal Penn: American Desi, Van Wilder and John Cho: Better Luck Tomorrow - a great movie and from the American Pies as the one who sees Stiffler's Mom's picture and calls her a MILF) The movie is great, it was so funny and I was laughing so hard. So go see it for a good laugh and take it at face value. But there is more underlying to this flick than may seem. It make some very interesting points, such as one of Kumar's shirts says 'I love Bush... the pussy not the President', but it should be noted that they are both pussies.;) Also, at one point when a small town ALL-WHITE police department are beating on an African-America, Harold and Kumar ask what should they do? Another African-America, sitting next to them says ""Run while you can"" or ""Get out of here while you can"" while saying this to our 2 stars there is a nice picture of President Bush on the wall behind them, in between them in the camera shot, as if the African-American character (a minority) was telling the newer Minorities (East Indians, Asians) to run away from an America that is run and controlled by Bush. This movie is a lot more than just Harold and Kumar going to a Burger joint. It deals with a Korean (though society and perhaps even the movie generalizes Asians all as one kind or type) and an East Indian as they deal with the nature of being possibly born, but for sure raised in a WHITE America. It deals with many racial issues of minorities in a very jokingly and unrealistic manner, but is it really that far from the truth??? Moral of the story Get stoned or 'High' on what it is you get high on (drugs, alcohol, sports, art, music), and follow your dreams (eating at White Castle or becoming the next President of the United States), that's what this movie is really about.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

If you liked any of the movies i just listed, go see this movie! If not, then go see it anyways! I love when great movies are made from plots as silly as this. I went with a group of like 10 kids and all of us were laughing our asses off. Penn and Cho are geniuses in this movie, and they inspire me to further more make it as an actor. It would be an honor to work with them and be involved in such a great film, i loved it. Go see this movie, or you'll regret not going to see it later.

276,dougthonus,"If you don't mind drug humor, one of the funniest movies ever.",10,3 August 2004,"Pros: This movie is laugh out loud funny. It's a nice mixture of the shock/fart joke humor and subtle quotable line humor. It's still somewhat of an immature comedy, but it's good enough that I think it would appeal to a wide array of audiences.Cons: If you're a parent, or strongly anti-drugs, you may be discouraged by the passive encouragement to smoke pot. Obviously, you'd expect that going into the movie if you've read anything about it, but it still may turn off some audiences.Conclusion: If you're looking for a funny movie and don't mind the drug use, then I think you'll probably love this one.

277,tbonebilly4877,"A lot of great laughs, but is a white exploitation film",5,26 August 2013,"It delivers a lot of great laughs, but there seems to be an underlying theme in this movie, and that is that all white people who aren't Jewish, are terrible. Rosenberg and Goldstein are their 2 nice Jewish friends, who in spite of being fellow pot-heads, seem like decent guys. But the coolest white person, who is not Jewish, is Neil Patrick Harris playing himself in a hysterical cameo, and he ends up stealing their car, and leaving them stranded. That says a lot about how bad the other white people are. Here is a syllabus of my favorite portrayals of white people: We have racist cops who beat up minorities for fun. An idiot stoner, capitalist, hippie named Bradley, who deals weed. Bradley's mom who pays off the white cops to let her son Bradley go when he is arrested for dealing. A creepy (albeit funny) Jamie Kennedy who plays a psycho that Kumar encounters in the woods. A boil covered, inbred truck driver, who is a member of the church choir and is also a swinger. A pack of skateboarding extremists who harass every minority they encounter throughout the movie, yet listen to Wilson Philips.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

I'm still amazed that with all the quality scripts out there in the world, THIS movie gets made! It's astonishing! A story based on 2 guys getting burgers? Why didn't they just stop and grab something at the 7-eleven if they were soooooo hungry? Bad script--predictable and extremely amateur. And if I have to hear the word ""titty, or tit"" come out of Goldstein's mouth again, I may lose control. ""It's about more than burgers. Our parents came to this country to escape persecution""...""This is about the pursuit of happiness"". These are some of the ridiculous lines from the film. Please spare us from more of these kinds of films. The fart scene in the bathroom with 2 preppy Princeton girls wasn't funny. The only comparable scene like this in a film was in Blazing Saddles.

As the police officers saw Harold (an Asian, who was the closest to the gate), they yelled that the African American was trying to escape (who was sitting at the corner of the cell). They shoved the Indian guy (Kumar, who had sneaked inside and was holding some weed) out of the way, and go and beat the black guy, while leaving the Asian, Indian and latino unattended.

The plot was as basic(stupid) as it gets, the jokes/situations are all re-manufactured from other recent movies (didnt see a shred of originality). The acting was sub par, to me John Cho and Kal Penn were trying too hard to sell themselves as hip teenage rebels, it all made the movie a lot more corny. And forget about interesting plot twists or realistic character development, this movie is not very intelligent, like I said before, its just about two guys who search for a burger place and along the way get into a few funny(if that) situations.

However, after catching it on TV late at night I got sucked right into it. I found it to be one of the funniest movies that I have seen in quite a while. I laughed harder than I have for any comedy that I have seen recently. It reminded my of my college years, not because I ever had that kind of experience, but because my friend and I used to keep a notebook in his car and whenever one of us had an insane and random movie idea we would write it down. This is what Harold and Kumar seemed like to me, a set of random funny scenes strung together by a loose plot. As I'm writing this the credits are still rolling, so I suppose it is possible that my enjoyment might fade a little in the morning. But I just have to say this. Immediately following the movie I feel happy and satisfied....just like after eating White Castle.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

I, myself being 18 and relatively immature in comparison to the older viewers of cinema found it so funny I had to rewind several parts in order to relive the brief moments of boisterous laughter and enjoyment. It's most likely hit or miss, it plays on the things that I consider true. It takes real life and exaggerates to a point that it's funny.For example, a guy is too afraid to face a girl he wants. Asians and African Americans are treated poorly, but receive their proper retribution in the end. It's just an exaggerated, comical representation of the lives of some teens and the not so great realities of life. If you want a great laugh SEE THIS MOviE!",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

But then I saw great reviews pouring in, calling it ""Witty"", ""The best stoner movie ever"". From the reviews I was reading, I thought it was going to be an 80's style sex farce, with a slab of stoner comedy. I really got my hopes up. I finally saw it on DVD. What a disappointment. How could this did get so many good reviews? It was just another American Pie/There's Something About Mary wannabe, with pot thrown in. It wasn't even as good Van Wilder, for Pete's sake. Completely predictable and unoriginal jokes. The Doogie Howser business sounds much funnier on paper. There's only two jokes that come anywhere close to the glowing reviews that this movie is getting: The Anti-Drug spoof, and a scene that happened during the end credits.I'm just baffled as how much this movie is liked.

There is no possible way to be in a bad mood after watching this movie. The plot is perfect for all the stoners out there, but its amazing for you stone cold sobers as well. The humor does NOT just limit itself to marijuana jokes. There are parts that are genuinely and uniquely funny. Kal Penn and John Cho definitely deliver a breakthrough performance.

I'm usually a big fan of dumb comedies (Dumb & Dumber, Billy Madison, even truly crappy ones like Dirty Work), but the gags in this movie just didn't seem clever or humorous to me. This movie reminded me a bit of EuroTrip in that a lot of the guys must have sounded hilarious when writing them, but ended up being so over-the-top in execution that they seemed forced and ultimately stupid.

The other reason would be because i've seen too many stoner movies come out that nearly every idea has been used over and over again.In closing, you should only see this movie if someone else will waste their money on it, or you don't have something better to do.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

The movie is just so clever, delivering amazing lines that you and your friends can quote for hours and just keep on laughing. I think the pairing of an Indian and an Asian is one of the most dynamic, original and spectacular moves ever done in modern cinema. It is hilariously funny and well put together. The story, while still a good stoner movie, is not solely based around smoking. It brings in a ton of other elements that add to the entire experience.

Now there's a new movie to add to that list of irreverent teenage raunch-fests...Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle. Although lacking in plot, true character development, and any technical achievements, Harold and Kumar still manages to entertain, confuse, and implant itself into the minds of stoners and non-stoners alike.The story revolves around two best friends: the near-OCD Harold and the brilliant slacker Kumar. The rest of the plot is pretty much given away in the title. How, you're asking, do they manage to stretch that title into an hour and a half? Well, that's easy. Throw in a beautiful girl, a hilarious dream sequence, a hillbilly with a hot wife, a handful of random cameos (Jamie Kennedy? That Asian guy from Mad TV? Doogie?! What?!), and a cheetah, and you've got yourself the perfect recipe for pointless laughs.The movie itself is great fun, but as was mentioned early, it's nothing really cinematically spectacular. The use of a cheap green screen effect gets old fast and the ""heartwarming"" moments are unnecessary. But the insanity of the whole movie makes you forgive and forget the minor downsides...at least for the most part.If you're in the mood for something quick and light-hearted, Harold and Kumar is for you.

There is nothing funny about this comedy, recycled humor stolen from Kevin Smith films. This film is racist toward white people. There is proof of this in how they identified the 3 white kids in the pickup truck as arrogant jerks and the white policemen as hell-bent on throwing black people in jail for no reason. If they portrayed black people, Muslims, or Jews in the way they portrayed white people in this film, it would have never hit theaters. The scene where the cop gives them a ticket for J-walking when no cars where around was so predictable. Getting a cheetah high and riding it? Now there really grasping for straws in a frantic attempt to make people laugh in this complete crap fest of a movie. I hope the thought of a sequel never crosses the writers mind.

296,SCAEMENE,The Best Hamburger Joint Out There,3,28 September 2005,"Everyone gets ""the munchies,"" and they will go on a great quest to get that one thing which their taste buds are craving? These two men, Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn), had a taste for the best burger on this earth. Although different obstacles are in front of them, these two men prove they are not lazy. Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle is an infantile movie; in spite of this, it has a wonderful and powerful point. The director Danny Leiner of Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle made this satire towards young adults showing the things that young men go through. For instance, Kumar is very indecisive about what he wants to do with his life. His family is encouraging him to become a doctor. Though his father is edging him towards the goal, he does not feel that he should do that. On the other hand, Harold has his own problems at work. He is being taken advantage of by the office jerks. This movie tells the viewers that what we want or will be is already in front of us. We only need to steady ourselves and to go for our own ambitions. The characters of Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle are perfect for this movie. It shows the life of two young minority men taking control of their lives and making something of it. These men go from work to campus to a stranger's home and finally end at White Castle. A couple of secondary characters also assisted the men on there ""journey of enlightenment."" Another point I enjoyed about this movie is that wonderful restaurant White Castle. The people that have not tasted their sandwich will want one after watching this more. The thing that I like the most about this movie is the fact that I personally can relate to it. When a person is somewhere in the United States and wants one of those succulent, delicious, small burgers covered in onions, a substitute will not satisfy that craving. I highly suggest that everyone head to White Castle and take Harold and Kumar along for your ride.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
297,swamiksat,"Lots of Comedy, but with a good message",10,3 March 2017,"America has a dark history regarding segregation and white supremacy. People often think of segregation in the past tense; however, racial discrimination is still an imminent problem. Under the command of America's new president, immigrants are racially profiled and face losing some of their rights. With the recent cases of police brutality regarding African Americans, it is clear that US still has a problem with racism. Because racial profiling is a controversial topic, many movies do not wish to address this problem. Although Danny Leiner's ""Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"" addresses the racial discrimination that still occur in America, it uses strategically placed comedy to make the movie approachable by all races. The first scene of the movie shows a Korean American, Harold, working in a cubicle. The movie then pans to show two Caucasians conspiring to rid themselves of their work. One Caucasian says ""those Asians just love crunching numbers"" to justify forcing Harold to do their work. They threaten Harold and he , afraid for his job, takes on the extra workload. In the first scene, the viewer is introduced to this idea of discrimination in the workplace. The acts of the white males were unfair and unjust, but because Harold was a minority, the Caucasians felt that he would be submissive to them. If Harold was a fellow Caucasian, the white men could not have passed down their work onto him. At the end of the first scene, the two Caucasians are seen hopping onto their convertible, located near the office building, and rushing off. Harold, angry with his inability to stand up, decides to go home. Harold's car, an old Toyota sedan, is parked in the furthest possible parking space. The office scene finishes with Harold slow walking to his car. This scene was hilarious, but still addressed the fact of white supremacy in the work force. Harold, who does his own work, owns a old Toyota while the while males that do not work as hard own a convertible. This car scene shows that immigrants are under paid and because of their inability to stand up for their rights. Harold and Kumar smoke weed and got the munchies, so they decide to go to White Castle to buy burgers. They need to take a road trip, and along the way, they decide to stop at Princeton to meet some of Harold's friends and get more marijuana. The movie shows the stereotypical nerdy and studious Korean student. Harold and Kumar were invited to a party hosted by the Koreans. Thinking that the party would be lame, they decide to ditch the party. As they were leaving, they see that the Korean party was ""lit."" The movie is trying to break the stereotypes that society has placed on certain races. After a series of events, Harrold is arrested and is in jail with an African American, Tarik Jackson. When Harold asked Tarik why he was arrested, Tarik responded, ""for being black."" Tarik was peacefully reading at Barnes & Nobles, but there was a robbery in Newark, and because he was black, the police officers thought he was the robber and arrested him. Tarik did not resist arrest or show any aggression, but the police officers abused him and did not treat him as a human.Police brutality is a serious problem in the United States that has only recently made headlines in the news. Police and society have associated crime and violence with the African American community and find it easier to accuse them of crimes. Tarik is very calm about his situation and when he is asked to why, he says: ""People have been messing with me my whole life. I learned a long time ago that there's no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time."" The movie breaks the stereotypes society has placed on African Americans. Any human being with a sense of pride would get angry at the police officers for their harsh treatment, but Tarik is not violent at all. He is calm and is not violent. When Kumar breaks Harold out of jail, Tarik is in the corner reading a book. The officers return to see Harold escaping, but instead say ""Jackson's trying to escape,"" and call his book a gun. Tarik is raising his hands and has his knees on the floor, but the officers say he is resisting and start to hit him with their sticks. The movie shows the viewer the hardships African Americans face even in this time and age. The color of their skin makes them discriminated against and second class citizens with no human rights. Throughout the movie, the viewer sees Harold and Kumar as immigrants, but as the movie comes to a close, we see that their actions are those of Americans. The idea of road trips and eating burgers is American. The trip to White Castle was not just about getting burgers, but was about fulfilling the American Dream. Their ""parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty and hunger. . . . they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals."" The idea that everyone has an equal chance in America resonates strongly inside both Harold and Kumar's hearts. The movie ends with Harold and Kumar fulfilling their American Dream. The movie uses comedy to destroy the stereotypes society has placed on certain racial and ethnic groups. The movie address the serious problems that America still faces, but uses comedy to make the movie more approachable. Harold confronts the two Caucasians from his work and tells them off. His speech shows his transformation from a being a nerdy, quiet Asian to a high spirited American that stands up for his rights. A simple story of two men getting burgers, turned into a story of fulfilling the American Dream.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle

Kumar is your medical genius and is pressed by his father who is a doctor to become a doctor himself, the only thing is Kumar is not sure if that's what he wants to do. Kumar is only sure of one thing and that is partying hard, getting high and meeting up with girls. Harold is your hard working Asian who is kinda shy compared to Kumar, and lets people run over him (while that's all about to change). Kumar and Harold have only one thing in common and that is they like to get high and when they do they crave food, well this time they are craving White Castle Burgers and they set out on a little road trip to get to White Castle, which turns out to be an hilarious night, and all the trouble that they get themselves into while trying to get there.",Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
301,Dectetive_John_Kimble,Excellent this is,7,9 March 2006,This is a great film and i have watched it loads of times now. this film is great some bits are cheesy bit overall enjoyable I'm going to watch it again when i get in :D. the cheetah was really funny. even though i don't think it is possible to get a cheetah high. even though i believe the next film will be worth the wait as i should be a great sequel to this one. all though i do believe they could do Rosenberg and Goldstein going to hot-dog heaven. Overall i rate this film 8 out of 10 as it could still be improved in bits but the way the film has been done it has been great to watch. Hopefully the next film will be a good as this one. anyway peace out John Kimble,Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle
