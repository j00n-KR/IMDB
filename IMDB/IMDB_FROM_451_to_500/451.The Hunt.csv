0,Leofwine_draca,Brisk action comedy,6,11 October 2021,"A familiar but efficient action comedy with an extremely brisk pacing and some good satire aimed squarely at American politics. There's an anything goes policy here with every political position a target and that makes for good humour, at least as far as I'm concerned. It's noticeably violent, kicking off with lots of shock deaths and scenes, before turning into a female-led revenge thriller towards the climax. Aside from Hilary Swank, most of the cast are unknown but they do a pretty good job here. It's not an amazing film but it did entertain me throughout.",The Hunt
1,SnoopyStyle,wild political concept taken to the extreme,5,4 April 2020,"A group of Americans from all over the country have been kidnapped and flown to an unknown place to be hunted to death. Crystal (Betty Gilpin), one of the hunted, is smarter with military experience. She encounters hunters and hunted along the way.The big name here is Damon Lindelof. I don't know how much he had to do with the material. I expect better from him. I can certainly see these guys coming up with the concept and dialing it up to eleven. I didn't feel for the emotionally closed off Crystal. I do love the early kills. It's a back and forth affair. I was still on the fence coming around to the final act. There are a few times where I see better writing or a better twist opportunities available. The other Crystal is a gold mine for twists and comedy which is left on the table. The final fight turns into a farce which is different from the rest of the movie. Eventually, I had to let this go.",The Hunt
2,nogodnomasters,Snowball,7,26 April 2020,"A group of elites hunts ""deplorables"" who believe there is a group of elites who hunt ""deplorables"". As in all hunt flicks the hunted become the hunters. This film centers on vet Crystal (Betty Gilpin).I liked it as a hunting film and looked past the political comments that were off the mark. The worst thing about the film is that the characters were introduced too close to the end. The script needed some work.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. 3 1/2 stars",The Hunt
3,kosmasp,Choosing sides,9,26 July 2020,"Yes this is an analogy as someone already has written (or probably more than one) and for my money it is a pretty clever one. Not the message overall, not the simple structured story, but the layers within. This mirrors in a very bloody and violent way (it's a movie and it's heightened, but was still able to agitate some so this had to be postponed several times) what is happening in America specifically but in a way all over the world overall.While the two party system is kind of unique to America - and yes I know that independents can be on the ballot and technically have a chance to become president without belonging to the Democrats or Republicans, everyone knows this is not something that will likely happen in the near future. Maybe someday - maybe there will be more parties to choose from too.Just me sighting Democrats first in the paragraph above though will have some people agitated and some excited and drawing conclusions from it. I went alphabetically. And the movie itself does not take prisoners or makes one side look so much superior than the other. You could make the case and the hunted and hunter roles could have been reversed - but as it is, it is way funnier and more apt to the situation America is in.So take this with a grain of salt, accept that no one is right all the time - and be entertained. You don't have to even think about it, to just have fun with it. But if you do, it might elevate it. And the powerhouse performances, especially from the two female leads and ""enemies"" ... beyond amazing.And if that wasn't enough: the movie let's you decide what the answer to some questions are! Who is she? Did you notice anything in her behavior that would help answer that question or do you just think you did? Does it matter? Fast drawing conclussions can be the death of us(a) ... very literally here",The Hunt
4,classicsoncall,"""Hey, thank you for your service.""",6,23 December 2020,"With a concept heavily borrowed from the 1924 short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"", and later made into the 1932 movie of the same name, ""The Hunt"" adds a satirical ideological component pitting the elites versus the deplorables. It's played out in stylistically gory fashion with the uniquely creative 'kills' masterminded by the screenwriters and director Craig Zobel. Some of them are so gruesome they're almost as funny as they are horrific. Like the unfortunate lady who falls into a pit full of spikes. Still alive after being impaled by two of the huge stakes through the center of her body, she survives long enough to be blown to kingdom come. Well, at least half of her. And so it goes, until the last woman standing from a group of twelve mysteriously dropped into the center of a hunting ground in a foreign country, begins the formidable task of being the hunter to take out Athena Stone (Hilary Swank), the owner and host of Manorgate. I think I would have appreciated it if Snowball/Crystal (Betty Gilpin) had cracked a smile or two every now and then. I mean, I know her situation was pretty dire before she got a handle on things, but it would have taken some of the gritty edge off her character. I have to say though, that amazingly long catfight between her and Athena Stone ranks right up there with the best of them in virtually any genre. It was kind of cool too, to see Swank's character call forth some of her 'Next Karate Kid' training to deliver some neat martial art moves. You know, when you think about it, we're probably not too far away from a reality show that raises the stakes and takes the concept of ""The Hunt"" to the next level in cable programming and internet streaming. I for one, am not signing up.",The Hunt
5,BA_Harrison,The first really fun film of the decade.,8,13 March 2020,"The Most Dangerous Game, Deadly Prey, Hard Target, The Condemned, Manhunt: hunting humans for sport has been done to death in the movies, but not since Turkey Shoot (AKA Escape 2000 or Blood Camp Thatcher) has it been so unashamedly gory and so much fun. In addition to providing the viewer with plenty of over-the-top violence, The Hunt delivers a healthy dose of scathing social satire, making it a hugely enjoyable way to spend 89 minutes (the perfect run-time for a film of this ilk).The film sees twelve strangers waking up in a wooded area with no idea how they got there. Making their way to a clearing, they discover a crate full of weapons, but no sooner have they armed themselves than they find themselves under fire from their abductors - a group of rich liberals who have selected their prey for their 'deplorable' conservative views. Unfortunately for the hunters, one of their unwilling targets, Crystal (Betty Gilpin), is a highly trained servicewoman who isn't too chuffed about her predicament.From the opening assault on the abductees, which is chock full of cartoonish gore, to the wonderfully executed, lengthy and very brutal final fight scene between Crystal and Athena (Hilary Swank), the leader of the liberals, The Hunt is pure fun. The playful script by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof delivers a few neat surprises regarding the nature of some of the characters (although we never do find out whether Don is 'in on it'), while director Craig Zobel displays a lot of flair for both action and comedy - I sure hope we'll be seeing more from him soon (fingers crossed that the Corona virus doesn't kill this film's chances at the box office).I know there hasn't been a lot of competition (Cats, Sonic, Fantasy Island, Brahms, Birds of Prey-hell, even The Invisible Man disappointed), but The Hunt is easily my favourite film of the year so far. 8/10.",The Hunt
6,BandSAboutMovies,Alright,4,31 July 2020,"The Hunt has often been a punchline in the emails between this site's R. D Francis and myself, as we've discussed many times how bad the film appeared from trailers and whether or not the controversy was just made up to get rid of a movie that did not appear ready for theaters.When the COVID-19 epidemic finally pushed this out - anything that is in the can and could be released is being shown - I finally got my chance to see just how bad - or good - this movie was.Directed by Craig Zobel - who helped created Homestar Runner - from a script by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof, this movie reimagines The Most Dangerous Game for the nightmare hellworld that we find ourselves navigating every day.The movie was originally called Red State Vs. Blue State and so upset President Trump that he referred to it as """"Liberal Hollywood"" being ""racist at the highest level"" and stating, ""The movie coming out is made in order to inflame and cause chaos"", and ""They create their own violence, and then try to blame others.""Nobody cared.I mean, this is a movie that has Sturgill Simpson play a character named Vanilla Nice. That's the extent of its humor. And the idea that perhaps there's no right side in this war is pretty much wasted so that Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank can have a fifteen-minute fistfight.The whole beginning of this movie feels less like a film and more like watching someone else play PUBG, with numerous deaths happening with no consequences or emotions.It's closer to a slasher, some would say, but most slashers are entertaining.Imagine if The Purge, but remove all the over-the-top ridiculousness and square up reel moralizing - as well as most of the fun - and you have this movie.Look, Hard Target, Turkey Shoot and Surviving the Game are already much better cover versions than this. They just didn't have a ton of money behind them and all manner of hype that they didn't deserve.",The Hunt
7,Coventry,"The valuable and child-friendly life-lessons of ""The Tortoise and the Hare"". Or something like it...",7,25 October 2020,"If there's one horror/thriller premise that already got turned into plenty of movies, it's the ""hunting humans for fun/sports"" idea. There are far too many titles to list, but some of my personal favorites include the 1932 original ""The Most Dangerous Game"", but also ""Blood Camp Thatcher"", ""Deadly Prey"", ""The Woman Hunt"" and ""Surviving the Game"". There's always room for anther favorite, though. In fact, there's even room for another twenty favorites, as long as they deliver suspense, gore, fresh & inventive killings and insane characters. Craig Zobel's ""The Hunt"" is definitely a new favorite!This film's strongest assets are the eccentric but strong female lead, versus the overall ""worthlessness"" of the rest of the characters. By this I mean that literally everyone can die at any given moment - and many of them will - regardless of how significant or insignificant their roles have been up until then. I love that. The strong female lead speaks for itself. The woman is quite petrifying, unpredictable, not very eloquent, nihilistic, and deadlier than a whole army of vengeful liberal democrats with guns. She's also quite weird, since she shamelessly pees in front of people and narrates disturbing variants of classic children's stories.Admittedly, I found the political ""satire"" very exaggerated and far over the top. Many taboo subjects, like refugees and the free possession of firearms, are inevitably included and the views of both ""obnoxious"" democrats and ""imbecilic"" republicans are shoved down our throats, only to conclude that all extremist opinions are deplorable. Yeah, fine, please blow away some more people Mrs. Gilpin! The obvious thing to enjoy here is the extreme violence, the gore and Betty's stoic face.",The Hunt
8,LeonLouisRicci,SCATTER-BRAINED...SPLATTER-BRAINED...BRAIN-LESS SATIRICAL MESS,7,26 August 2021,"Some Fun can be had Watching this Messy Movie if One Doesn't Try and Figure Out WTF is Going On in its Daft Definition of Social-Media and Politics.It Name-Drops Buzz-Words and Memes to Grab its Audience.Trying to Point Out the Absurdity that is Our Current Paradigm of Divisiveness that Controls Behavior, Attitudes, and New-Speak in Today's Ludicrous Landscape.Getting a Handle on Most of What Goes On Behind the Blood-Drenched Ballyhoo Presented in this Pretentious Picture is a Challenge.Suffice to Say, Forget the Intellectual Debate.Because the Wit is in Short-Supply and the Script is Sophomoric at Best.The Ideas are Dumbed-Down for the Lowest Common Denominator with Extreme Stereotypical Characters.Everyone Acts Smarter than They are and Everyone Exhibits Loathsome Behavior.Misses the Mark its Shooting for by a Mile.Except in its Exhibition and Exploitation of Gore-Movie Red-Stuff.That's the Aforementioned Fun that this Movie Offers and for that it's...Worth a Watch.",The Hunt
9,CinemaSerf,"I'm off to look for ""Red October""...",5,12 March 2020,"I really was expecting a bit more from this. The premiss that a bunch of bored, rich, folks kidnap a dozen ""deplorables"" and plonk them in a wood whereupon they are hunted with guns, grenades and good old bows and arrows could have been quite fun. A sort of ""Hunger Games"" without the endless CGI. What we do get is a really tame, poorly executed horror flick in which virtually all of the dozen are dead within the first five minutes and we embark on a truly implausible hunt by the survivors to turn the tables. The two in the gas station inject a little levity into the proceedings but otherwise it is rather a missed opportunity that will not linger long in the mind.",The Hunt
10,zardoz-13,Run for Your Life!!!,8,16 June 2020,"You won't have to wait long for the blood, gore, and violence to erupt in ""Compliance"" director Craig Zobel's ""The Hunt,"" an entertaining, but derivative socio-political jeremiad about conspiracy theories in the Google age of misinformation. Disgraced cultural elitists on the Liberal Left start shooting, slashing, and slaying adherents of the populist Right without a qualm. This pretentious but polished yarn evokes memories of Richard Connell's classic short story ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" published on January 19, 1924. A mad Russian aristocrat stalks an unarmed big-game hunter for amusement on his privately-owned Caribbean island. Similarly, in ""The Hunt,"" ten men and women die gruesome deaths from bullets, boobytraps, and bows & arrows during the first thirty minutes of this 90-minute massacre. Clearly, producer & director Craig Zobel admires George Orwell's allegorical novel ""Animal Farm"" as much as ""The Most Dangerous Game."" Not only do Zobel and co-scripters Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof insert frequent ""Animal Farm"" allusions in the dialogue, but they also let a cute little pig cavort amidst all the savagery until its trigger-happy, Liberal owners ambush it by accident. Parenthetically, Cuse co-scripted the HBO mini-series remake of ""Watchmen"" (2019), while Lindelof created ""Lost"" (2004-2010).Primarily, ""The Hunt"" features only two fully fleshed-out characters. The heroine is a Mississippi native, Crystal Mae Creasy (Betty Gilpin of Netflix's ""Glow"") who served in Afghanistan and knows how to shoot, while her wealthy antagonist is Athena (Hilary Swank of ""Boys Don't Cry""), one of the disgraced CEOs who planned this sadistic hunt for humans. Everybody else is typecast. One victim (Emma Roberts of ""Aquamarine"") wears a yoga outfit. Literally, her character is listed in the end credits as 'Yoga Pants!' Indeed, the Liberal Left label these populists as ""a basket of deplorables."" Mind you, Hilary Clinton coined this ugly term during her 2016 Presidential campaign. TheNew York Times wrote that she identified half of Trump's supporters as ""deplorables."" Clinton reviled them as racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, and Islamophobic. Meantime, dastardly villains here constitute a faction of snobbish, affluent, but ostracized Whites in seclusion. They had been chastised for the texting thread shown in the opening scene. Naturally, they were shocked to learn that somebody had hacked their thread. Accordingly, these CEOs were either fired or resigned voluntarily. Later, in retaliation, these CEOs executed what they had contemplated initially as a farce.
Meantime, Zobel and co-writers frustrate audiences because it is virtually impossible to choose a character with which you can align your sympathies before the first hour elapses. No sooner do you warm up to one character than that person suffers a sudden case of death. For example, a fleeing brunette stumbles into a pit studded with huge wooden spikes. Miraculously, another character hoists this fatally wounded brunette off those blood-soaked spikes. Staggering away with her arm around his shoulder, he realizes too late he has just stepped on a land mine. BLAM! The explosion atomizes him, while the poor brunette is blown back into the same pit. Landing in it again, she recovers only to find herself skewered on those same spikes. Sadly, the explosion has obliterated everything below her navel!Ultimately, the hopelessly random but CGI-enhanced carnage may divert action purists as much as it may prompt thoughtful audiences to grumble about its contrived third act. If you abhor movies that waste too much time setting up a premise, then you'll relish ""The Hunt."" Zobel and company stall audiences until the 60-minute mark before they clear up the plot's mystery. Two flashbacks before the ultimate showdown between the two leading ladies signifying both the populist Right and Disgraced Liberal Left clarify everything. Had they presented these revelations in chronological order, the filmmakers would have spoiled their own grand finale. The initial critical response to ""The Hunt"" serves as a testament to the filmmakers' creativity. The white-knuckled suspense and the blood-splattered spectacle of ""The Hunt"" overshadow its complicated shenanigans. Basically, the message in ""The Hunt"" is don't believe anything you either read or hear on social media.
The violence in the trailer for ""The Hunt"" plunged it into hot water when Universal Studios unveiled it. President Donald Trump condemned this cinematic sophistry on Twitter in the aftermath of the tragic shootings in both Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas. Trump's text argued: ""Liberal Hollywood is Racist at the highest level, and with great Anger and Hate! They like to call themselves ""Elite,"" but they are not Elite. In fact, it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the Elite. The movie coming out is made to inflame and cause chaos. They create their own violence and then try to blame others. They are the true Racists, and are very bad for our Country!"" Instead, since the President never saw ""The Hunt,"" he didn't know the film slammed the Liberals far more than the Right-wing populists. Similarly, other critics derided Zobel for glamourizing wholesale bloodshed. Mind you, neither the President nor the critics saw the movie before they leveled their criticism. Basically, Trump and the critics jumped the gun! Ironically, the movie's message about people who leap to conclusions about media content was played out in real life by its impetuous detractors.
Consequently, Universal delayed ""The Hunt's"" release until the controversy waned. Unfortunately, the Coronavirus engulfed the nation just as the film opened on theater screens. When the theaters were shuttered, Universal released it on cable strictly as a rental until its recent availability on home video. Indeed, the violence is graphic but no more violent than any number of R-rated actioneers. Furthermore, the villains who orchestrated the murders in ""The Hunt"" turned out to be just as half-witted as both the Dayton and El Paso gunmen. You have to wait until the third act of ""The Hunt"" to understand its complicated plot.If you enjoyed subversive thrillers, such as ""The Purge"" franchise, you'll probably appreciate this outlandish opus that shows the shortcomings of both sides.",The Hunt
11,grantss,Better than expected,5,26 March 2021,"A group of strangers find themselves in a field after having been drugged. They are provided with weapons but then find themselves the targets of distant, unseen assailants. The odds are stacked against them surviving. They are the prey in The Hunt.I had fairly low expectations for this and the opening few scenes didn't change my view: it all seemed rather one-dimensional, clumsy and hammy. The one positive quality of the opening few scenes was that it wasn't obvious who the ""hero"" was. The writers and director do a good job of presenting certain characters as if they are going to survive, building engagement with these characters...and then killing them off.The unpredictability in that regard made me think there might be a bit more to this than it appears. It turns out the cleverness with regard to character survivability is about all that's clever about the film but once a true, long-surviving hero does emerge, that's when things get interesting. The action gets ramped up and you at last have someone to support. Our hero does not disappoint.Ultimately, a reasonably entertaining action movie. Is still quite gung ho and one-dimensional but is a decent watch nevertheless.",The Hunt
12,george.schmidt,Part pitch black comedy cum horror film part political satire; Gilpin is the secret ingredient,7,8 July 2020,"THE HUNT (2020) *** Betty Gilpin, Hilary Swank, Ike Barinholtz, Wayne Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Emma Roberts, Amy Madigan. Part pitch black comedy cum horror film part political satire with a dozen strangers finding themselves being hunted down without any idea why and who among the reasons of a diabolical revenge plot. Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof's screenplay has larger aspirations with its pinprickings of every social strata in 'merica however the characters are more or less caricatures and with names like 'yoga pants' obviously not interested in developing their backstories. Gilpin is the wild-card as the shrewd final girl and her battle to the death with the event's villainous Swank is one of the best recent cinematic fights ever. (Dir: Craig Zobel)",The Hunt
13,ferguson-6,it's a wild one for both extremes,7,12 March 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Let's face it. It was a brilliant marketing strategy. In the wake of mass shootings, the release date of this film was delayed when its subject matter was deemed controversial, even scandalous The film's new marketing slogan became, ""The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one's actually seen."" Of course, it wasn't really true, as very few were actually talking about it. But that's what made it genius marketing ... they created interest amidst controversy that has since proven unnecessary. Director Craig Zobel (Z FOR ZACHARIAH, 2015) has delivered the least controversial, non-polarizing film of the year. It basically laughs at extremes on the left and right, and reminds us how laughing at something can often take away its power. And regardless of your ""side"", you'll find some laughs here.If you've seen the trailer, you know that the premise has a group of liberal elites hunting a hand-selected group of social media-active MAGA deplorables. It's a twist on Richard Connell's 1924 short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"", although the modern day rich aren't hunting for sport, but rather for political affiliation - gun lovers and climate change deniers. That may sound politically charged, but in fact, it plays as more comedy than comeuppance. Sure, the violence is over-the-top and often quite graphic, but this is a skewering of both red and blue.Preventing the project from falling into B-movie muck is a standout performance from Betty Gilpin (""Glow"") as Crystal. She's a Rambo-type who speaks (with a southern drawl) only when necessary, and seems to have learned a lot while serving in Afghanistan. Most of the time she looks like she has ""a pinch between her cheek and gum"" (a tip of the Stetson to Walt Garrison), and she also hums to herself and tosses down some unusual facial expressions. This is a seriously oddball performance that is the film's highlight.One of the best sequences of the film comes quite early as the dozen or so 'deplorables' slowly wake-up and find themselves gagged in a field. A container of weapons leads to an early massacre that allows the filmmaker to tease us with numerous familiar faces taking turns as the heir-apparent lead. Some of the faces that pop up include Ike Barinholtz, Wayne Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Emma Roberts, Christopher Berry, Sturgill Simpson, Kate Nowlin, Amy Madigan, Reed Birney, Glenn Howerton, Hannah Alline (flight attendant), and Usman Ally.Of course we know this is headed to a showdown between Crystal and Athena (2-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank), the ringleader of the hunting party. A fight scene reminiscent of the KILL BILL movies (sans Samurai swords) takes place at Athena's ""manor"", and it is stunningly staged and executed. Unfortunately this scene also highlights the mostly inadequate dialogue that exists throughout the film. Some of the quips click, but many fall flat - surprising since the co-writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof have previously collaborated on ""Watchmen"" and ""The Leftovers.""Blumhouse Productions keeps cranking out these offbeat genre films, and this one likely benefits from a misplaced scandal, and it strives for self-importance by comparing itself to George Orwell's ""Animal House"" and with an obscure reference to TEARS OF THE SUN (2013). It's not at the level of last year's gem READY OR NOT, and it missed the opportunity to make some political points, but it's a hoot to watch and as an added bonus, Hilary Swank teaches us the proper way to make a grilled cheese sandwich!",The Hunt
14,morrison-dylan-fan,The Last Film I Saw Before The Lockdown.,5,20 March 2020,"Since having followed reports of the virus in January, (and being told by friends ""It will pass in a few weeks."") I've been getting ready for things to shut down in the UK. In late 2019,I was interested to read about a Thriller being delayed over controversy.Seeing the film finally come out,and a friend having a Odeon Unlimited card, we went on what I suspected would be the last visit to the cinema for ages. In the middle of the film,my friend got a news alert, of Boris Johnson announcing pubs and cinemas to be closed.View on the film:Aiming for the first target with the opening of a Mystery Box, (which Lost any curiosity value over a decade ago) the screenplay by Nick Cuse & inept hack Damon Lindelof lay on the clunky political commentary with the same trowel Lindelof's co-writer fellow hack Roberto Orci slapped Truther conspires on Star Trek: Truther Into Darkness (2013-also reviewed.)Instead of drawing even a basic thumbnail sketch for each of the strangers,the hacks give them Identity Kits, awkwardly forced dialogue of being guns and Trump-loving hicks (who don't talk about fear of what they are caught in,or mentioning family/friends they miss.)It is a testament to Richard Connell's creativity, that his 1924 creation of The Most Dangerous Game is now a archetype that can withstand a riff from any hacks, with the hunting thrills being able to overcome the dialogue,in deep-fried Crystal having to deduct who is a real fellow Deplorable,and who is a Liberal Elite hidden under the cap. Taking place in Manor House, the writers keep just on the right side of not leaning too hard into their links into Orwell's Animal Farm, until a final twist slickly uses it to twist a misconception of Crystal.
The first movie he's made since 2015's Z for Zachariah,director Craig Zobel & cinematographer Darran Tiernan place down snappy, gory traps that crackle with a darkly comedic mood,from Zobel zapping along to the aftermath of Deplorable's being caught in a trap.Whilst the writers miss the target, Zobel hits the satire by going over the top on the beer-swilling, cap-wearing Deplorable's fighting to survive against the pristine Liberal Elite on the hunt.",The Hunt

17,mm-39,The Hunt I get it!,8,16 May 2021,"The Hunt is a hard movie to pull off. The Hunt has a social lecture, but does it right without a lecture. The Hunt has a story about Trump/deplorables being hunted down for sport, while the P C elites lectures the victims. What makes the Hunt work is the snobbish elites are condescending and believe in being better then others, while showing how the elites care by snobby virtual signaling. So phony is the phony virtual signaling The Hunt gives the viewer a feeling too vomit. The character development of the un likable snobs makes the movie work well, because what one see's as minor/or being stupid is so deplorable for the morally self righteous elite, and drives the The Hunt as a revenge movie. The sets, stereotype characters, and storyline intertwin well with the movie's message. The Hunt uses all the elements with a style/message of 80's old school satire, of being able to laugh with faults/stereotypes via dark humor which make The Hunt's message about coping strategies. Knowing the difference of laughing with each other and serious problems, unfolds and becomes the crux of the story. The ending is good with out giving it away we have an old school revenge flick, with the questions of assumptions which makes the protagonist the glitch in the plan, and asks did the assumptions on social media create the event or where the characters just waiting for an excuse to apply their revenge? Profound ending. The Hunt is the surprise horror film of 2020!",The Hunt

Can you just not relax a little bit and enjoy a movie without mixing politics into it? For my part I did enjoy The Hunt, it's a refreshing story worth watching. There is some subtle humor (like the pig's name Orwell for instance), just the right amount, that made it even better. The acting was good and that from the whole cast. The story isn't difficult to follow, it's spiced up with a bit of gore, but it's way better than any other cheap slasher. The Hunt is a bit better than a regular 'good' movie, one that I would be glad to watch again in the future.",The Hunt

20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Hunting headlines.,5,14 March 2020,"'The Hunt (2020)' takes aim at both sides of the USA's current political climate, satirising both extreme liberals and extreme conservatives alike. The problem is that its observations are neither keen nor funny. Its ultimate point seems to be that everyone is as bad as each other. The characters are all, to one degree or another, bad people (or, at the very least, implied to be); the eventual lead is the only person who blurs the line between the two distinct categories of stereotype everyone else falls into. Divorced from its subtext, the affair is very much a generic, 'Battle Royale (2000)'-esque action flick. It's passively entertaining and moves at a decent pace, but it's never hugely engaging or, even, exciting. It does attempt to subvert genre expectations, though, by setting up a series of potential protagonists only to kill them off one by one in as surprising a way as possible. Sadly, the trailer ruins any potential shock these moments could have had and, even then, most of them don't have much value outside of their initial intent. Even though it isn't entirely successful, the action itself is sometimes rather enjoyable and a lot of it is fairly well conceived. The film does have a tonal problem, however, that even manages to seep its way into such sequences. Basically, a lot of the 'humour' disconcertingly seems to stem from the violence portrayed on screen. The other comedy, that which doesn't stem from the satire, is either far too broad or far too subtle, leading you to question whether any given moment is supposed to be treated seriously or not (and this never feels by design). The picture isn't bad, don't get me wrong. It's just incredibly uneven and ultimately unsatisfying. It's very much a cursory commentary on today's ever-polarising political climate and, as such, it's a bit of a missed opportunity. Plus, a lot of people seem to be missing its point - which shows that it isn't conveyed all that well - and taking offence to some of the stuff it says (or, perhaps, is interpreted to say). I guess that's what you get when you make a movie that simply sits on the fence and laughs at those on either side. In the end, the thing's not worth getting mad about; it doesn't agree or disagree with anyone. It almost feels like it was made purely to be superficially inflammatory. It isn't inflammatory, though. It's a run-of-the-mill action film with a satirical subtext. It's not great but, depending on what you want, it might be good enough. 5/10",The Hunt

22,Cineanalyst,The Most Ridiculous Game of Politics,5,1 November 2020,"""The Hunt"" had an unfortunate and controversial release history. Advertising and its release were delayed after the mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso in early August 2019. Not until March 2020 did Universal decide to finally release it, and then the pandemic hit--resulting in theatres closing throughout the United States and the world. The trailer badmouthed by conservative media and, thus, the president of the United States, only for entertainment critics to largely pan the picture before it was finally released as a video-on-demand, it's hard to think of a movie that has been so mistreated as a political football and a victim of events outside of its control. Granted, I think I got the wrong impression, too, that this would be an earnest horror thriller underlined by confused political commentary, and so I wasn't eager to see it at first when it finally became available. What a pleasant surprise, then, especially as an American presidential election is already under way, that ""The Hunt"" isn't a serious satire at all, but more of trashy B-picture, campy exploitation--parodying to extremes the left/right, as well as rich/poor, divide in American politics.The entire reworking of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" scenario is self-evidently absurd that it's forehead-smacking ridiculous that anyone would've ever thought it would incite violence or that it's even a liberal fantasy, or a conservative one, or whatever. Wealthy, mostly white, elites turning away caviar because they had caviar last night, arguing with each other over who is the most politically correct, in between bragging about their acquaintance to Ava DuVernay (director of ""Selma"" (2014) and ""A Wrinkle in Time"" (2018)), is an unflattering caricature for something that's allegedly left-wing wish fulfillment. And that's as if the telltale indication of villainy of delaying showing Hilary Swank's face, as the rich hunters' leader, weren't obvious enough. As for the political right, at least for most of the picture the protagonist, played by Betty Gilpin, is fighting for survival on their side, and the so-called ""deplorables"" and ""rednecks"" depicted are more economically relatable if one doesn't fly by private jet. The hunt is largely one of class warfare, too. Sure, they're still cartoons; they all are on both caricatured sides here.To take ""The Hunt"" seriously is to fall into the same conspiracy-theory trap of the so-called ""Manor-gate""--""gate"" because every supposed political scandal in American must be framed by Watergate, apparently--within the movie: a bad joke taken too seriously and a sense of grievance and victimhood becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, each side dehumanizing the other until careers and lives are ruined. In reality, such self-righteous politicking is exasperating. ""The Hunt"" exploiting that for some laughs and well-staged action scenes, including a particularly entertaining performance from Gilpin, however, may have the opposite effect of deescalating political tensions, or rather the stress inflicted therefrom. It worked for me, at least.",The Hunt
23,westsideschl,Much Better Than Expected,9,10 June 2020,"I've seen this plot several times before of a wealthy group tired of their customary 4-legged prey try kidnapping more challenging ones to set loose on their private reserve. Yes, the prey are what we would call humans. So I was prepared to rate this lower. But, in a bit of sardonic humor the predators are environmental & animal rights liberals while the prey are redneck conservatives. We even have red & blue allusions. Besides a few twists to keep us guessing the best part was the acting of Betty Gilpin who despite her mostly New York upbringing came across as raw & tough a southern chick as you would never want to meet. Especially notable in that most of her resumé & awards have been for comedy style scripts.
Note: A philosophical undertone weaves through the script concerning barrier building & stereotyping of people.",The Hunt

26,paulclaassen,One word: AMAZING!!!,7,1 October 2021,"Wow, this was amazing! And now for something completely different!The demented opening to the movie will either reel you in hook, line and sinker, or deter you from continuing watching. It certainly hooked me! The film then jumps to a field where a few people emerge from the woods - all gagged. The interesting thing about 'The Hunt' is that you don't know who the lead is until well into the movie. This was an interesting approach. Just as I rooted for characters thinking they're the protagonists, they got killed! With attention constantly shifting from character to character it was hard to tell!The lead character, Crystal, is introduced much later in the film than is the norm. Betty Gilpin delivers a stunning performance as Crystal. I mean, give this woman an Oscar already!! 'The Hunt' is an incredibly well made film with a lot of gore, but thanks to the highly effective satirical humor the killings were not as gory or disturbing as a 'Saw' movie for example. This was pure entertainment.I feared the movie might develop the same way 'The Maze Runner' did, but fortunately it didn't (I hated that movie by the way). Instead, 'The Hunt' was super exciting and had me wondering and guessing all the way. The film is fast-paced and there literally never is a dull second. I've never seen anything like this. If I could, I'd compare this to equally satirical horror movies like 'You're Next', 'Ready or Not', and 'The Babysitter' (the latter two starring the incredibly talented Samara Weaving).My gosh, this was a pleasant viewing experience. I absolutely loved it. (The ending doesn't really justify all the killings, but the film was so good that it didn't really matter). 'The Hunt' is completely unpredictable. This was fu*king great!!Would I watch it again? Hell yes!!",The Hunt

They have to fight for their survival without knowing who is the good or the bad.I enjoyed this movie because I had really low expectations from it but I was happily surprised by it. The direction which was made by Craig Zobel was good, with many action scenes and plenty of suspense. I have to admit that the interpretations of both Betty Gilpin who played as Crystal and Hilary Swank who played as Athena were below average and I expected more from them. In general ""The Hunt"" is a nice Horror movie to spend your time with but if you have high expectations by it I advise you to lower them otherwise you are going to be disappointed.",The Hunt
28,cruise01,The Hunt may break controversy with its political satire but the movie hides away better ideas on where it could go.,4,25 March 2020,"The Hunt (2 out of 5 stars).The Hunt is a dark comedy thriller that plays a similiar concept idea like Hunger Games or The Condemned. While involving real world political themes like republicans and liberals. But the movies terrible direction, humor, acting, and plot is just plain stupid. Its cheesy. Its dumb. And even if you are looking for a mindless violent action flick. You will still be left disappointed.The plot starts out promising. But after half an hour in. You will be left with no fun surprises. Just characters hunting people for sport with terrible motives behind it. Crystal (Betty Gilspin) wakes up in the middle of the field with other strangers. Realizing they are being hunted by another group of people. People led by Athena (Hilary Swank). There is barely much you can say without spoilers. But the twist is dumb and forgettable. If you can call it a twist.The direction is dumb. The humor was dry and stupid like a sci fi channel movie bad. You may be left feeling like the humor is more awkward on screen than funny. The characters are forgettable. The main character Crystal played by Betty Gilspin looks more awkward on screen and delivering a terrible performance.The cast ensemble is forgettable. The acting is cheesy. With a script that tried to be a bloody fun time. It may have some decent thrilling action with some violent bloody fight scenes. But the movie is boring.Overall, The Hunt is a bad film. It lacks the bloody fun time the direction is trying to be. The acting, direction, and plot is just stupid and boring.

29,zkonedog,A True Satire In Every Sense Of The Word,8,29 March 2020,"I'm not sure a film has ever had to traverse a rockier road to get to audiences than ""The Hunt"". Scheduled to hit the cinema in late-summer of 2019, it was pushed back due to its subject matter supposedly clashing with a number of political/social events at the time (almost a bit ironic considered the film's overall message). Then, after finally getting a March 2020 release date, a pandemic hits and shuts down all theaters, forcing the movie to be released digital-only. Throughout that winding road to viewers, ""The Hunt"" gained a negative reputation as subversive or dangerous in politically-charged ways, as well as featuring a satirical tone that is potentially off-putting to those either unwilling or unable to look beyond its surface level. While I would 100% agree that a film like ""The Hunt"" doesn't tackle political/social matters in a way movie viewers are used to, it does provide an interesting treatise on the current social landscape through the lens of political stereotypes and biases.For a very basic overview, ""The Hunt"" sees 12 strangers suddenly and inexplicably thrown together out in the middle of nowhere. The initial confusion quickly switches to terror, however, when they realize they are being hunted (presumably for sport) by others. Through a series of conversations and flashbacks, viewers learn that the hunters are your stereotypical ""liberal elites"", while the hunted are the ""conservative, red state"" types. But are things really that simple?The thing I would stress most to anyone watching ""The Hunt"" is to always remember that it is satire at heart. There are groan-inducing wisecracks as people are blown to bits, and cringe-worthy lines of dialogue abound. But that doesn't make ""The Hunt"" a bad movie! I wonder if perhaps the satire genre is a bit of a lost art form in that people now expect movies about social/political themes to be life-or-death serious. I'm as big of a ""heavy drama"" fan as anyone, but that isn't the only way to tackle those subjects. Here, the model is to set up a basic Blumhouse Productions film strategy (i.e. slightly ridiculous but able to appeal to younger audiences). If made as a sweeping, serious epic, right away more than half the audience base would be cut out from under it.Of course, the above characterization is only this film's surface-level description. Embedded deep within the Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse-penned script is a surprisingly deft characterization of the current sociopolitical landscape. While at first ""The Hunt"" comically leans into stereotypes, it then deconstructs them and ultimately turns into a compelling treatise on how ""both sides of the aisle"" share the same common problems. One just has to look past the surface-level buffoonery to get there.Perhaps the biggest criticism levied against ""The Hunt"" has been that it simply panders to political stereotypes. In my viewing, that couldn't be further from the truth--again, as long as one realizes the tone is comic/satirical in nature. For all the world this film seems like an exercise in ridiculousness, but there's a reason the pig pictured prominently in the film's marketing is named Orwell.Overall, ""The Hunt"" is a brilliant social/political skewering camouflaged as a cheesy, over-the-top action/thriller. It isn't shallow, by any means, nor is it overly pompous. In these ""all or nothing"" political times, however, it may be odd or perplexing to some to see the issues chuckled at rather than the gnashing of teeth. If you can get past or embrace the satire, however, there are spot-on messages here that will/should make both conservatives and liberals stop and think a bit.",The Hunt
30,Floated2,Strong violent crime thriller,6,20 May 2020,"With a relatively simple plot, and a genre type of hunting humans for sport which has been done times before.However this film seemed to stir up controversy which ended up being pushed back several moments later than its initial release date.There was plenty of anticipation but once it was released, the rollout was somewhat disappointing and the film didn't make nearly as much box office as the studios intended.Decent scenes of action and the violence does deliver, also many unpredictable scenes where we as the audience don't anyways know what will occur next (which is a good thing as it keeps us guessing- involving several deaths of course)The first half is stronger than the second half where the film slows down a little and once we get introduced to Hilary Swank's character, the film takes a downhill turn (around the part where the reveal occurs with the caption of ""one year ago"").There is quite a lengthy fight scene with Hilary Swank and the lead protagonist (Betty Gilpin) where it seemed as if both characters were invincible. But as expected, Betty ends up surviving then walks out as if nothing happened (no visible scars or bruises).The Hunt is a decent one watch thriller, not great as several of these top reviews claim but not also not terrible. This is most definitely a violet film and not for the weak fainted.",The Hunt
31,eddie_baggins,Doesn't live up the media hype,4,8 April 2020,"Forever set to be the film that infamously canned it's initial theatrical release after it was surrounded in controversy due to it's darkly satirical examination of America's gun violence and political climate, The Hunt as a film is far less memorable, even if it at times subverts expectations in some neatly designed ways.Director Craig Zobel, whose shown form before with the indie hit Compliance and the the overlooked Z for Zachariah, must have somewhere somehow run across a particularly vicious black cat as after month's of his film sitting in limbo it found itself released in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning many were never even properly aware his Damon Lindelof written and produced feature was even available for their viewing needs.Regardless of what stopped the film from jumping into the mainstream conversation bar it's headline making postponement, The Hunt never does enough with it's loaded idea to ensure that it was going to become a film people started talking about around the water cooler.Things start out in a promising fashion, as we are thrown head first into a ridiculously violent and frantic plot-line that sees a collection of 12 strangers awaking in a forest and on the run from a group of gun wielding hunters, this group includes recognizable faces such as Emma Robert's, Ethan Suplee and Ike Barinholtz, but once the focus turns to Betty Giplin's feisty Crystal, The Hunt gets bogged down in a more generic procession of events that don't grip you like they should.What first feels like some type of politically charged Hunger Games done the way of Crank mixed with Happy Death Day like horror comedy, quickly begins to feel like a collection of big ideas that Zobel doesn't have the time to explore across 90 minutes, with only so much over the top violence and snarky social commentary able to cover that up.The cast certainly have a fun time, with many of the core players getting roles and situations you wouldn't normally associate them with, with Hilary Swank a standout as the mysterious Athena, but The Hunt'sunwieldy tone and inconsistent execution undoes much of the effort of the actors, who begin to get lost in the midst of a film that never gets to make the most of it's big ideas and imagination.Final Say -Not living up the hype that surrounded it thanks to ample media controversies, The Hunt has some nice early moments and some unexpected turn of events but it never comes to terms with exactly what it is as it runs out of steam well before the final showdown.2 on the loose pigs out of 5",The Hunt

The highlights: I liked Betty Gilpin as Crystal and Hilary Swank is like always a safe bet. The references to certain political views/agendas etc. are rather redundant and overused (even if used for satirical reasons like in The Hunt).

36,southdavid,Liberty Belle - ends,7,20 March 2020,"How interesting that so much controversy would be generated by a film an inherently, and deliberately, silly as this one.A group seemingly unconnected Americans, of various ages and genders, awake to find themselves on a strange compound with the only clue to their situation being a large crate nearby. The crate contains a variety of weapons. Once armed, the people are then picked off by an unseen enemy.I don't know why I'm being so coy in my synopsis, as you'll know from any of the advertising that the film is about ""liberal elites"" hunting ""deplorables"". What you won't get is the tone of the film, which is pretty much a comedy. A black comedy at times admittedly, but occasionally just an out and out comedy. The film I'd most compare it too is ""Cabin in The Woods"" - as it takes a similarly well worn premise and manages to do some different and new things with it. However, ""The Hunt"" doesn't have ""Cabin's"" rewatchability. Once you know the plot, I can't really see another reason to come back to it.I'd also say, the trailer for the film really does the movie a disservice, as it gives away a couple of the films secrets, including revealing who the lead ""Liberal"" is played by - which the movie goes to great lengths to keep concealed. The deaths are nicely done though, and often come out of nowhere, with a wonderful practical feel to the effects and it's a funny film, occasionally laugh out loud so. Betty Gilphin is great, as ever, in this.The controversy that'd dogged the film seems pretty silly once you've seen it. - although the advertising has played into it too - so they only have themselves to blame. I felt the film not only attacks both sides in equal measure but has an overall message of once you scratch the surface there being more that unites us than divides us.It's a solid, entertaining film - just not one with much replay value.",The Hunt

38,jtindahouse,A strong female lead driving a smart and captivating film,10,21 March 2020,"'The Hunt' must feel like it is cursed. Right before the initial release date there was a mass-shooting in the USA and so they decided to delay the release. Not a decision I entirely agree with, but I at least understand it. Then a week after the new release date the coronavirus became so bad that all cinema chains had to close and the movie was forced to release online. What is lost behind all of that is the fact that this is an amazingly good horror film. It doesn't deserve the misfortune that has fallen upon it. What remains though is that what was going to be one of the best films of 2019 is now one of the best films of 2020.I'm a sucker for a horror movie with a strong female lead. Thinking back on it, the majority of my favourite films in that genre over the years have one. 'The Hunt' happens to have one of the better ones I've ever seen. Betty Gilpin, who I had barely heard of before this, is ridiculously good in this film. She is cool, funny, bad-ass and someone you definitely want on your side. I remember once seeing a list of the 100 greatest movie characters of all time and there only being 6 females on the list. I think if the list was done again today she would have to be given serious consideration.Within 3 minutes of this film getting underway you can tell just how good it is going to be. The dialogue is smart, witty, engaging and mysterious. The filmmakers are clearly in complete control. I genuinely believe that smart-horror is the way of the future. Films like 'Happy Death Day', 'Ready or Not' and 'The Hunt' all stand out above the pack because there is intelligence behind the plot. This movie takes the usual horror tropes and turns them on their head, deliberately going against the grain to keep the audience on their toes. Also, without spoiling anything, I'll just say that early in the film it uses a trick made famous in the opening scene of 'Scream' almost 25 years ago. It really caught me off-guard and was an early indicator to just how clever this film was capable of being.'The Hunt' isn't trying to set up a franchise or a sequel. It is just a stand-alone film that wants to be as good and entertaining as it can possibly be. That's incredibly refreshing in today's world. It's done so well that it very well may get a sequel one day, that wouldn't surprise me at all, but that doesn't change the fact that that was never its intention.

Yes, the country was extraordinarily divided, yes, people did think that those that voted another way deserved to die, and yes, the division did seem to be largely along class lines, as well as coastal cities against the Heartland.The satire is mostly given the backseat to the over-the-top violence, however, including exploding heads, exploding bodies, sliced arteries, people impaled on spikes.Most of the satire only comes in during scenes where the ""Liberal elites"" are shown bickering. Separated from the Trumpists, they have no choice other than to take swipes at each other. How else are they going to stay woke?I was underwhelmed by the over-the-top violence, and thought it dampened the satire.

This movie is based on a short story called 'The Most Dangerous Game' and it has been made into several movies, both with the same name and some with different names. This one has Damon Lindelof-Lost, Watchmen-as one of the writers so you know you are in for a twist & a treat. The movie was originally scheduled for release last September but was postponed due to mass shootings and is now hitting theaters during the corona_virus scare. Anyway, Betty, Ike & Ethan are part of a group of 12 strangers that wake up in the middle of a field with no knowledge of how they got there, or even where they actually are. They soon learn that they are being hunted and they have to try to survive and find out what is going on-and not everyone makes it out alive. Hilary plays the leader of the group doing the hunting. There are several cameos-I remember seeing Emma Roberts, Sturgill Simpson & Justin Hartley, just to name a few-and if you are really into politics, I have heard that there is a Liberals vs Conservatives vibe going on here with Liberals as the bad guys and Conservatives as the good guys. But you will have to decide if that's the case-I used to hate symbolism back when I was in school. FYI: There is a kick_ass fight scene near the end that could have been taken from a John Wick movie.

Gary (Ethan Suplee), Yoga Pants (Emma Roberts), and Don (Wayne Duvall), Amy Madigan all playing a caricature of certain ideologies are hilariously fun. Betty Gilpin's ""Crystal"" was the scene-stealer as she played her character with such cynical wit. Every time she's onscreen you look forward to seeing how she outsmarts her pursuers.Darkly funny, very surprising, and violent. With first class prosthetic make-up and practical effects that add an excellent dash of gore. The Hunt is a success. If you're just looking for some fun death sequences and a few laughs, it'll be right up your alley. 9/10",The Hunt

Well done!",6,2 April 2020,"This film start with a secret character ""Ted"" having group chat on her phone, and a bunch of people been killing and capture on a plane scene! As turnout, this film is about a woman ""Crystal"" need to survive in a killing game, and take down the woman behind it, ""Athena""! Entire film full of intense bloody violence scene, make the film quite watchable! The action scene have, explode by landmine, explode by grenade, kill by shooting, kill by stabbing, martial art fighting, breaking glass, and furniture! The letdown scenes are, the flashback of Athena character, and not every killing scene show to the audience! At the end, Crystal fight with Athena at her manor, Athena eventually wounded, and die!

A few hours before viewing THE HUNT, I visited my local Kroger and TWO different CVS stores, but failed to find a single square of TP available on their emptied shelves!

Sure, some effete wimps went through three or four rolls of TP weekly when Obama was in the White House, but our novel Elephantine Rules hark back to our hardy heritage of being Cave People. No one expected to ""enjoy the go"" back then! Once most Americans adapt to Life Without TP, don't be surprise to find new Elephantine Rules imposed down the track.

49,smatysia,A hate crime in cinematic form,6,20 August 2021,"From what little I had heard about this film, I expected it to be basically a hate crime. It was, but not in the way I expected. The filmmakers skewer both sides of the political divide in roughly equal incidences and severity, except for the basic premise. It turned out to be a semi-comedic horror/gore/action film. There were some pretty good performances, leavened by the level of the material. I am unfamiliar with Betty Gilpin, but I hope she gets some good roles in the future. I didn't recognize Hilary Swank, but she was good as well. There were some plot holes, but I can't really point them out without writing a spoiler. I gave this a much higher rating than I expected to, and my dislike of gore cinema probably cost it another star. Don't know that I can exactly recommend this movie, but it was better than I thought it would be, and was not what I expected.",The Hunt

51,Pairic,Dark Satire,8,7 June 2021,"The Hunt: A satire which takes no prisoners, the ""Deplorables"" and the ""Liberal elite"" both end up literally riddled with holes in their arguments (and bodies). A group of Deplorables wake up in a forest, they are gagged and make their way to a crate in the middle of a field A piglet runs out of the ,crate which also contains guns. They then come under fire, you've no sooner identified with a character when they're shot, blow up, impaled on stakes or stabbed. But the tables are turned when some of the Deplorables ably fight back. The Libs are sent up with woke language and horror at offending anyone even when they are offing rednecks. How the whole Hunt scenario comes about is really a lampooning of both sides. The deps see crisis actors everywhere, even refugee babies are performing. Great acting from Hilary Swank as Athena, the Lib leader and Betty Gilpin as Crystal, the Dep who fights back; their one to one combat is wonderfully choreographed. An enjoyable dark comedy/satire which is extremely violent. Directed by Craig Zobel from a screenplay by Nick Cuse and Damien Lindelof. 8/10.",The Hunt

54,peterp-450-298716,A controversial movie? Not to me!,6,11 April 2020,"Why would they do something like that?
Same reason elites do anything...
'cause they think they're better than us.Can someone please explain why there was so much fuss about the movie ""The Hunt"". I understand that the release date has been postponed due to the El Paso, Dayton and Gilroy shootings last year. Let's just hope that not every violent film suffers the same fate, as the number of mass murders in the U.S., according to the database of the news agency AP, USA Today and Northeastern University, is shockingly high. In 2019, they counted 41 such massacres. Those are a huge number of incidents that can cause releases to be postponed. I suggest they restrict the release of violent video games, new material from well-known music bands that use a rougher music style and bloody comic strips. Because let's admit it. Every time such an incident happens in the U.S., doomsayers pop up like mushrooms to proclaim that heavy metal (in the past Marilyn Manson was a sitting target) and violent games (such as Counterstrike for example) are the cause of senseless violence with dozens of victims. No sensible person there relates free (and uncontrolled) sale of weapons with all that violence. Even now in this Corona crisis, US citizens are flocking to the arms stores to purchase firearms and ammunition en masse, because they fear that people may react rather strangely to this crisis. Well, here in Europe one can only make victims by throwing tons of toilet paper at someone since that's the most hoarded item here.In itself, ""The Hunt"" is just an average violent film with explicit, gory footage. But claiming this film is the superlative of other films in terms of violence, is certainly a bit simplistic and short-sighted. Let's look at films such as ""You're next"" or ""The Purge"". These films have an almost similar concept. The concept of hunters and the hunted. Even ""The Hunger Games"" tends to go in that direction. But apparently, that was commercially permissible. The recent film ""Ready or not"" is better comparison material. Also, a film in which someone is being hunted like a wild animal and a series of gory, bloody scenes are shown. Though, the denouement in this movie effortlessly exceeds what is to be seen in ""The Hunt"". On the other hand, the satirical character is more prominently present in ""The Hunt"". And you still want to watch a movie where blood flows freely? Well, you should try ""Revenge"" (also a movie that ends with a fight to the death). In short, if you categorize all films that could possibly incite senseless violence, you'd end up with a richly filled list.What's explicitly emphasized in ""The Hunt"", is the immense gap that exists between the wealthy and the average people living in the US. Of course, they turn it into a political statement once again (conservatives against liberals). A group of so-called conservatives is being kidnapped by a group of foully and berserkly rich liberals who have too much time on their hands or probably couldn't think of anything else to spend their hard-earned money on. I'm sure there are also rich conservatives and poor liberals living in the US. But that's a completely different discussion. The fact that there's a gap (as big as the Grand Canyon) between rich and poor becomes clear during these Corona times. The poorer inhabitants who cannot afford health insurance massively die a slow and horrible death at this very moment. I suppose many will now consider the fuss about ""The Hunt"" as being a trivial matter. Storywise it's really nothing and there's not much beating around the bush so the action-rich part kicks in quite quickly. It takes less than 10 minutes, I think, for the first victim to die with a well-aimed shot through the head. And from then on it's a series of massacres and exploding bodies. Not that the victims are unarmed because the hunters have left behind a huge chest packed with dangerous-looking weaponry. Unfortunately, the hunted ones are not exactly experts in warfare or close-combat techniques. However, the group of sadistic hunters haven't done their homework and checked the background of Crystal (Betty Gilpin). This female McClane has quite a bit of knowledge about combat techniques and weaponry. And that's something the group of rich people hasn't taken into account. Crystal plays the game harder and more fiercely than those vicious elitists and manages to turn the situation to her advantage.Betty Gilpin is perfectly cast for this role. She's fanatic and grim. A merciless tough lady whose sarcastic and blunt comments made me smile several times. To be honest, I sometimes wondered if she was mentally alright. And yes, she reminded me a bit of Phoebe Buffay. Not only because of the looks. But also by her behavior. A bit of an absent and childlike acting person. Unfortunately, the final confrontation was a bit exaggerated and unrealistic, which accented the slapstick character of the film even more. All in all, ""The Hunt"" isn't as impressive as I suspected it to be. It's watchable but not more than that. The commotion around this film only had the opposite effect (as usual). A new, short-term hype with an over-the-top reputation. But, as violent and gory as this movie may seem, it's certainly not as controversial as certain tweets from an alleged important person implied.",The Hunt
55,aidanratesmovies,"Politics get in the way, but don't ruin this fun film",8,17 September 2020,"Although its political messages are quite out of place at times, and its characters, besides it heroine, can be rather thin, The Hunt proves to be a very entertaining little thriller with plenty of clever attributes and gore to keep any fan satisfied. I'll begin with this films flaws. The films underlying political message, and constant references to that fact, seems to be a bit awkward. I don't care much for the overabundant use of politics in films, or at the very least in reasons like this, and it isn't all bad throughout, but it just feels like it wasn't really needed, and purposely done to cause a divide among audiences. The film also has quite a few stereotypes, and incredibly thin characters, which at times seems rather ironic considering the films subject matter. I did enjoy this film quite a bit however, despite these fallacies, and found it to have quite a few great moments. I love Betty Gilpin in this role, as she is not only very different in her sense of portrayal, but excellent in her portrayal of the main character. There were a few other decent actors throughout, but no one too memorable. I liked the idea of the film, and found it to be suspenseful, entertaining, and oddly fun at times. It doesn't try to dazzle you with lots of special effects or lots of crazy angles throughout, it just feels like a simply made film that is anything but simple, and I can't help but say I enjoyed the direction the film took. In the end, The Hunt was not what I expected. It's not the most perfect film this year, nor is it great, but it has quite a few strong moments that make the film worth the watch.
My Rating: 8.5/10",The Hunt
56,questl-18592,The Hunt for the 1%,5,19 June 2020,"Once upon a time, there was a little movie called The Hunt. Billed as a horror thriller, it was originally set to release way back in September of 2019, but because we as people can't figure out how to just get along with each other, it got pushed back. The heavy handed political vows probably didn't help either though. But not all was lost for the little movie that could and it was soon rescheduled for a fresh release in March of 2020. It had no idea it would be vying for our attention with a little diddy off a thing, COVID-19. It lost that contest handily and, in a final effort to get this thing out there, Universal threw it to home video.So, what have we learned?When the world, not studios or fan hate or whatever but the WORLD tells you no twice? Wash your hands and walk away. There was no conceivable way this thing would be praised by the collective viewership with all this baggage attached.This movie is a mess. It's remarkably heavy handed yet trying to be subtle so it feels very in your face but then when you stop to think about it the whole thing feels muddled and indecisive. The main character is given no backstory at all, no explanation satisfactory enough for why she's able to do what she does or why she seems to switch from mood to mood like someone's hitting a switch. It's also listed as horror thriller and I guess I can kinda see thriller but there's no horror here at all. Comedy thriller might be a better fit, cause it does try to be funny. It was also hated on originally for its political statement and I get that. It's not actually targeting anyone important, it's just making pot shots at rednecks and social justice warriors. Thank heaven, right? Cause they don't ever get made fun of. So glad The Hunt is breaking that barrier down.The biggest problem to me is the way this movie reeks of desperation. They desperately wanted to make some cheap commentary and stuffed it into this half baked story. They wanted to desperately take cracks at ""both sides"" but didn't have the backbone to actually hit anything real. They desperately want you to buy into plot misdirects when they spell out EVERYTHING pretty consistently regarding what's happening. And they desperately don't want you to stop and think about the actual movie for a second because it is so dumb.That said, there is some wonderfully superficial stuff here to enjoy and I thought Betty Gilpin, who I'd never heard of before, was a delight, even if she was poorly written.End of the day, I'm torn on whether I recommend this or not. From a story, plot, intellectual standpoint? Absolutely not. But there are some fun aspects here... All of which are done better elsewhere in other action movies... I think I'd recommend it for a rent or stream. Don't pay full price on this thing but it's worth it to watch for the action because while I can see similar and better things elsewhere, it's rare to see a not overly sexualized woman kick this much butt. That's what pushes it over the edge.",The Hunt
57,valleyjohn,Started so well but ran out of ideas,5,28 March 2020,"Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don't know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they've been chosen... for a very specific purpose... The Hunt. The hunters plan is about to be derailed because one of the hunted, knows The Hunters' game better than they do. She turns the tables on the killers, picking them off, one by one.
This has the potential to be a really good movie . The first half an hour Is not only funny but very clever the way you are lead to believe that you are following the supposed hero of the film only for them to shockingly die.
The problem comes when this policy stops and it because just another violent action thriller/horror .
Betty Gilpin is good as the unhinged psychopath who is turning the tables but the problem is the political message gets in the way .
The underlying message is about the hypocrisy of left and right political thinking and to be quite honest I could have done without it . It's not an intelligent enough movie to get that message across .
All in all the film has limited entertainment value and fizzles out in the last half hour when it becomes formulaic but I can see some people enjoying it .",The Hunt

59,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Satire that Plays Real World Issues,9,1 September 2020,"This was a film that I remember when I first heard about it and then was pretty shocked that it got pulled. There was some buzz about it and I had an idea of where they were going to take it. To be honest, it seemed like a marketing ploy though to have it pulled and then to reissue it later. It didn't work out as well since COVID happened and it really only had two weeks in the theater. The buzz then was it had a price tag to rent of $20 on streaming services. I missed it in theaters unfortunately and couldn't justify the high price. It was one I waited the drop to normal prices so Jaime and I could finally see it. We gave it a second viewing now as it was added to HBO Max. The synopsis is twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don't know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they've been chose - for a very specific purpose - The Hunt.We start this movie off with looking over someone's shoulder as they're part of a text message thread. What is interesting is that I knew a bit about this movie and how it was twisting something I've seen recently on social media. What is important here is that the phone belongs to Athena. She's irate about something and states that she can't wait to go hunt at the manor. The others state they shouldn't be talking about it over text.It then shifts over to an airplane where Richard (Glenn Howerton) is giving the stewardess a hard time. We see he has particular tastes and they aren't necessarily getting met. It all takes a turn though when a guy barges in and we can tell he's been drugged. There is a doctor on board, portrayed by Steve Coulter, and they try to get the guy to calm down. It ends with who we assume is Athena, stabbing him in the eye with her high heel shoe.We then get into really what is happening here. Yoga Pants (Emma Roberts) wakes up in the woods. She looks across from her over a creek is Crystal (Betty Gilpin). Yoga Pants goes off and comes to a large field where there is Staten Island (Ike Barinholtz) and Don (Wayne Duvall) amongst others. There is a giant crate that is opened to reveal a bunch of weapons. Also inside is a pig wearing clothes, which escapes into the woods.This is where it gets wild. People start to shoot at the ones I've named in the clearing and it is a blood bath. We follow Staten Island, Big Red (Kate Nowlin) and Vanilla Nice (Sturgill Simpson) as they make it to a small gas station. Things aren't as it seems though with the owners, Ma (Amy Madigan) and Pop (Reed Birney).There is a much deeper plot going on here and Crystal really just wants to get home. We get to meet her for the first time when she arrives at this same gas station. Later we learn that she has military training and she is quite observant. It becomes a fight for survival from these elites that are hunting them, but as I said, not everything is as it seems.To shift this over to my thoughts on the film, that is where I wanted to leave the recap. It really has an interesting way to present the story. I've been hearing for months of how great Gilpin was in this movie as Crystal, so I knew from the beginning that she was going to be our lead. What is interesting is that I watched this with Jaime and she had no idea. When certain characters we were following died, I had to let on for the movie to settle in as we really hadn't met the star yet. That is kind of an interesting way to kick this off for sure. It actually feels a lot like Psycho or Scream, where you are expecting actors you recognize to be around longer and our stars don't show up until 30 minutes and an hour respectively.What I do like about this movie is that I feel the satirical nature of it is intriguing. My initial thought was that they were going to have rich right-wing people hunting liberals. I picked up on from the opening text message thread that isn't the case, they actually flip it on its head. The movie is playing with the idea of these '-gate' conspiracies. They refer to #ManorGate. People online are running with it and this is the crux of this story. What is even more interesting with this is how things play out in the end and the idea of self-fulfilling prophecies. This movie is mocking 'social justice warriors', 'cancel culture', 'toxic fandom' and how things on the internet can get out of hand very quickly. It is funny though that the villains in this movie are those that think they're helping the country and the 'crazy' people are actually the sane ones. What we are really getting here is that the Far Right and the Far Left are the problem where most everyone is in the middle.Taking this even farther, it is wild that I just re-read the novel Animal Farm before my first viewing. While Jaime and I were watching this I realized that Athena, who is Hilary Swank, states that someone can be their Snowball. That was when the references I heard earlier clicked. The pig's name is Orwell after the author. Some of the nicknames given to people are from the novel and of course, Snowball. What is funny is that reference is used wrong which makes it a bit ironic. Especially since Athena thinks she is more intelligent than Crystal. We also get a different telling of the classic children's story of the Tortoise and the Hare as well.I want to take this next to the acting. I heard a lot of people bragging up Gilpin and I have to agree. Her character is from Mississippi, which I think actually works well. There's a couple reveals about her character, one of which I've referenced before that she has military training. Swank is interesting as someone I would despise. Her performance is good though and it is a shame that she doesn't act much anymore. I'd say aside from that, we have some really good side characters that serve their purpose around these two stars of Barinholtz, Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Roberts, Madigan and Howerton. It is even more interesting that we don't really see our stars for some time and it is a technique that wouldn't always work, but does here.Next I'll shift this over to the effects of the movie, which for the most part are good. This movie is more brutal than I was expecting which was pleasant. There is some CGI that doesn't necessarily work for me. This is most with blood splatter so it doesn't ruin anything. The movie has practical effects in conjunction with this so that makes me happy there. Aside from that, I'd say the cinematography is also good in my opinion.Now with that said, I'm glad that I finally got around to seeing this movie. This was the last major in theater film that I didn't get a chance to see before this quarantine came down for COVID. It was bothering me as I know a lot of people were speaking pretty highly about it as I wanted to see this. I think that this movie does some really good stuff with social commentary and playing with it in a way that I can respect. Some of it is over the top, but I can forgive that being a satire. The acting from the two leads was strong with the rest in support of them. The effects are good for the most part as was the cinematography. The soundtrack didn't stand out to me and I never got bored watching this movie. Not everything worked with it and I do find some of material a bit problematic though as well. My rating here would be that this is a good movie, but not sure I can go higher than that. Also can't recommend this to everyone as some people are going to despise what this movie is doing. If you have thick enough skin, I think this is a fun movie in general. I'm also glad to give this a second viewing as I enjoyed it even more after hearing others thoughts to make me consider more things this time around.",The Hunt
60,robertemerald,Fantastic survival movie,10,31 August 2020,"If you like the I Spit On Your Grave movies you should like this one. The Hunt is more sophisticated, with a fairly deep and strangely socially aware backstory. A little like the story of the modern horror movie Us, The Hunt's story tries to be a little out-of-the-box original. For me, I really liked that aspect. I liked the mayhem too, which starts early on, and the part played by the heroine, whom oozes confidence and disregard for fear, the very opposite of what both former movies of this genre, as well as the antagonists actually in the movie, expect. Very refreshing, and supremely entertaining. It's full of twists. Production standards are high. This is not a B movie.",The Hunt
61,rgkarim,The Hunt For A Good Satire,7,13 March 2020,"The left-wing movies often are wild cards that have a hard time getting the recognition and credit they deserve. Unlike so many other big chains, these movies dare to defy the normal with their approaches, taking radical chances to deliver an original film that manages to stick in your mind. Unfortunately, these artistic visions can often be too out there, ahead of their time or too boring that they get shuffled into the forgotten realm. However, reviewers like me are taking a dive into the ,movie to see if this film successfully defies the big chain tales that many love to hopefully do it justice.

Too Silly At Times
The Sometimes Too Political Nature Of ItSummary:This tale already started off right with the promise of a shorter movie, not only for time saving components, but also for the potential of a good exciting tale. Well, The Hunt did this for me in the weirdest ways. First off, its ironically original, despite what the trailers suggest, deeper into the film though you get a much more original presentation that turns out to really fit in this crazy world they unleashed. Campy tropes and movie mannerisms come out in full effect, and much like the movies of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s,, the cheesy approach really works. That corny nature not only works for the action and pacing, but the comedy that again works in weird ways. The Hunt is one of those movies that is overly aggressive for much of the film, but given the theme of the movie that quirky sense of humor starts to come out and wind up being funny when all is revealed. In addition, the brilliant change in the movie's presentation of the story opens up a sort of mystery as to what is the true bizarre source of the film. By putting out so many questions and keeping that air of mystery keeps you intrigued as to how deep the rabbit hole of hunting goes, leading to again a more engaging tale. An added bonus, the movie ends up having few slow parts to go with it too, with the pace, time span, and weird mystery leading to few drawn, out conversation heavy moments. When all of these moments start finally converging at the end, the climactic finish really feels climactic as the ending sequences unleash the torrent of action goodness you were looking for in this thriller. It pulls the pieces together, reveals much of the secrets, and just finishes in the manner you've come to both expect and not expect, just like this movie says it would and keeps that weird energy going all the way. When pulling all this together, the movie's artistic satire on political division, typical human responses to just about everything, and sort of the daydreaming fantasies of how some of this drama could be resolved.As I have said before though, these left field flicks are not afraid to cross the lines and sometimes it's a little too much for this reviewer. While not the worst breaking of one of my rules, the film did hit one of my no-nos that affected me a bit more than I care to admit. Fortunately, it was short lived, but still a slight rewrite could have fit with the scheme of the film and been a little better for me. However, past that, the movies focus on crude language and threats occasionally got into the lazy writing arena that again is more annoying than creative for me to see. Past these two though, the movie's flaws that really stood out started with the opening sequence. Upon the start, the movie throws some odd curveballs that made me start to hate it and walk out. A very rapid introduction, and some rather crappy character development left me feeling like I had been cheated by the trailers again, and was left with a shock culture film that did little more. Fortunately, the movie worked the story better, but the character development did not improve much past two characters... which stunk with the potential it had. I would have liked a little more sustenance behind the characters, but doing that would have shattered the illusion of comedy they were going for. This brings me to my next point, the silliness of the film. While clever, witty, original, and artistic, the over aggressive comedy of the film may have also been a slight downfall in terms of the story/character development. By taking this ridiculously campy focus, so much else was crammed to fit this scheme that I felt it got a little too forced at times. Yet I will have to admit I'll take the forced comedy over the forced politics that this movie does. While artistic and wholly satisfying to see at the end, the very dramatic, politically charged dialogue hit a nerve, primarily in how much I dislike social media ranting. The movie crossed the territory at times, and though pointed out how ridiculous things could be... the movie sometimes got a little too preaching of political agendas that were not fun.The VERDICT:The movie certainly surprised me in how fun it was as the first act opened up too much better components that were hidden by the trailers. It was campy and original, adding some nice surprise and to create an engaging and fast paced film with an ever-changing premise. Most things flowed naturally, and the underlying mystery of what pulled everything together and why kept me engaged in the film to get to that fitting end. An exciting climax and the brilliant poking at the ridiculousness of our extreme society tendencies further wraps this odd piece with a casing of fun ridiculousness that will be remembered. Yet, this is not going to be a hit for those too hooked on the limited violence and straight and narrow tale presentation. The Hunt has a lot of times stepping over the line and if you are sensitive to that stuff, you may be blinded from the smarter things this movie has. I implore you not to walk out of the opening sequence despite the chaotic, simplistic, nightmare it starts out as. Yet, be ready for some over silly moments, lackluster character development, and very in your face political components to raid your ears. If you can' handle these annoying trends that seem to continue to grow and infest entertainment, you need to stay away. However, if you can enjoy that wit and see the bigger pictures and components, you'll be in good shape to enjoy this film and can recommend hitting this one up in theaters.My scores are:Action/Horror/Thriller: 7.5

62,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Hunt,6,3 April 2020,"The Hunt is my latest review. And no, it has nothing to do with ""Red October"", Lee Marvin, or an actress named Helen.Released at maybe the wrong month for these trying times (March of 2020) and featuring a pig character named Orwell (that's symbolism at its finest), ""Hunt"" is directed by one Craig Zobel. Zobel fashions The Hunt as part ""grindhouse"", part camp, and something the late Charlton Heston would get a kick out of (NRA hint hint).Starring the likes of known actors Hillary Swank, Emma Roberts, and Ike Barinholtz (Emma and Ike basically make cameos), ""Hunt"" is splatter house tongue-in-cheek with a non-sequential narrative. It starts out as Surviving the Game meets 1981's Southern Comfort only to harbor more twists and turns than a street called Lombard.So yeah, I squirmed at ""Hunt's"" putrid violence which was remorseless (look for the best girl fight since Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman squared off in Kill Bill). And yes, The Hunt had enough political remnants to make me think it was actually making a broad statement. Still, the film is sort of ill-timed and I think the viewer might get a bad taste in their mouths after an on demand purchase.Clocking in at a running time of 90 minutes and distributed by Universal Pictures International (in 7 different countries), The Hunt has to do with 12 people who wake up in the middle of nowhere. With gags in their mouths, plenty of ammo, and not a darn clue, they are being hunted for sport in the country of Croatia (which initially masks as Arkansas).Bottom line: ""Hunt"" targets its audience as the ""cynical"" prey. No one is safe in this movie and the mean-spirited surplus is almost too much to handle with the world we're living in. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",The Hunt
63,Kamurai25,"""Say It, and It Shall Become""",9,12 December 2020,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and do recommend.This is one of the best, if weirdly refreshing movies I've seen in quite some time. I'm a sucker for a good survival movie, and this is an ""elites hunt people for sport"" trope mixed with a good mystery plot if there ever was one. The story structure alone is worth the watch as it essentially runs 3 (-4) sequential stories to tell one overall story while telling you about the story structure. Some movies clearly put a lot of effort into keeping you on your toes, this movie just does it.Not only is the gunfighting immaculate, but the combat action sequences are amazing. Betty Gilpin steals the show every time she's on screen, and I would normally say she's the one that carries the movie, but the movie is good enough that even though she's over the top great, I can't say the movie needs her to carry it.There is an investigative aspect of the movie that is very intriguing, but that is given in the ""why are they doing this to us"" of it all, but unless the villains give an ""evil speech"", then it should be expected.If you enjoy human vs human survival situations, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised by this one.",The Hunt
64,justin-fencsak,A clever take on the most dangerous game,6,17 December 2020,A conservative take on the classic tale the most dangerous game this controversial movie is very well done and short.,The Hunt
65,vengeance20,Political Hunger Games,8,13 March 2020,"Remember this film being banned due to the recent shootings taking place across the US. I was slightly disappointed at not seeing this as I only heard about it when it got banned back in August last year. It was also then that I saw a trailer & thought it looked good.So with a film being surrounded by much controversy due to it's political theme, I had to see this I wouldn't have been nearly as excited had it not been banned temporarily & given a new poster & marketing campaign to capitalise on the controversy!The film follows a group of victims who are put into a Hunger Games like situation & are being hunted by some corrupt division. They have no idea how they got there or what is going on, but something doesn't feel right...I found the film to be pretty epic for the most part, it was very graphic & gory. I really liked the rawness of the film. The fights, the kills, the corruption etc. The film did have a couple of left wing snipes, but also had some right wing ones too (I was aware this film was going to be politically oriented).The ending was a bit weird & I did find the plot to be a tad messy at points, like the motivation wasn't entirely clear. 8/10",The Hunt
66,begob,Hiding behind identities,6,6 July 2020,"A group of American strangers awake in the wilderness to find themselves lined up as prey for wealthy hunters: how will they survive?All grisly action from the get go, and the film takes its rhythm from cartoonish violence and choreographed punch-ups. There's a running tease in the delay to the introduction of the hero, and when she turns up she proves to be interesting and likeable, yet delivering some odd lines.Performances all round are fine, but the plot often undermines everything with implausibilities about the competence of the hunters. Even their ""consultant"" is lame. As for the foreign setting and the episode with the army - puzzlingly unnecessary, with a touch of Yankee paranoia. Yet the pace is good, and we enter a switcheroo about 2/3 of the way through.Humorous tone, but I didn't get many laughs out of it. In one scene, there's a great idea involving a stake-pit, but the direction and editing didn't drive the joke home. Later, during a set-piece fight, the tongue-in-cheek humour oversteps the bounds. But the biggest problem is that as a political satire it can't even identify its target. Ask anyone outside the US about the American Left, and they shrug their shoulders and say, What Left? It's right-wing all the way, with two brands arguing over the public relations strategy of capitalism. Maybe it's impossible for a mainstream movie to understand that the politics it seeks to satirise is a big, fat void and doesn't really exist.One reviewer made a good point, that this is like the embodiment of social media rage, where fallacies are preferred over genuine debate. That clicks with the Toasted Cheese speech, which then fails to make a point about the twisted nature of truth, and whimpers about before being gored with a wisecrack.Only thing to add is that the score is deliberate and insistent, so the audience isn't allowed much room for imagination.Overall: Well produced and energetic, but empty.",The Hunt
67,mhorg2018,Lame,1,27 March 2020,"Want to watch a really good movie? Check out 1932s The Most Dangerous Game. Yes, you'll see those sets used again in the classic King Kong, but Robert Armstrong alone out acts the entire cast of this poorly thought out, badly directed, slow as molasses crapfest. Not an original thought in this caricature filled nonsense. Oh yes, I know women can be strong. But, just like men, can they can be stupid and petty. We're both sides of the same species, neither is better than the other. How this trash got made in today's political climate amazes me. More Lindelhof trash.",The Hunt
68,elliotjeory,Like The hunters but worse,2,23 March 2020,Another lame film about killing people in unusual and 'hilarious' ways. Reminds me of the awful TV show The Hunters. It's just boring. Zzzz.,The Hunt
69,arungeorge13,Betty Gilpin is awesome; the movie is so-so! [+51%],5,22 March 2020,"As a survival thriller, The Hunt is good fun. There are decent amounts of cinematic 'gore & viscera' if you're looking for it. Above all, there's a no-nonsense lead played by Betty Gilpin who owns every scene she's in. As a matter of fact, googling The Hunt (2020) would open up links that talk about Trump's tweets and/or its controversial delay. The Hunt, while political to a certain extent, is more about fallacies on the internet and its make-believe standpoint.The internet gives rise to faster reactions between people, sometimes even leading to unnecessarily bloody showdowns. The Hunt is one of those instances taken too far, with an added dose of satire that's not as effective as you might expect it to be (comparisons to a film like 'Get Out' is inevitable). Director Craig Zobel makes it clear early on that you're in for a gory B-movie that takes its blood and guts (read: cheap thrills) more seriously than its writing.It is also easy to see through the writers' not-so-subtle efforts to humanise some of the gun-toting conservatives (who are pictured as 'victims' here). Yet, leaving the lead character played by Betty Gilpin largely undefined beyond the few straightforward lines she utters and letting her blaze through the elite neoliberals like true-Rambo-like fashion (she's an ex-veteran, and that explains it) was a neat decision on their part.The antagonists in The Hunt are the least convincing. Powered by the internet and social media mix-ups, their characterizations are weak, to say the least. I particularly enjoyed the shootout set in the field - lots of ambiguity, and a good number of well-known faces pop up (Ike Barinholtz, Emma Roberts, Wayne Duvall) but whatever follows couldn't match its intensity - whether in thrills or in storytelling. For what it is, The Hunt is a not-bad 90-minute survival thriller with satirical elements that often fail to hit the intended mark.",The Hunt
70,Abdulxoxo,Love this first 15 minutes,7,9 July 2020,"Ohh the first fifteen minutes or so, it's so great, how I wish they had continue the storyline that way. But they killed off most of the characters too soon. After the gas station the film became slow. It's gruesome and it's enjoyable if you manage to stay through the slow last half. And the lead is really good!",The Hunt
71,martimusross,Just about OK,6,19 March 2020,"The HuntOverall I enjoyed the movie, but it's certainly not for everyone as there was a lot of stylised violence.",The Hunt
72,rivertam26,Entertaining but flawed,6,2 April 2020,"So initially I forgot to review this when originally seeing it. Sadly it was the last thing I got to see it due to our current situation. That being said I've seen it twice so far and still pretty much feel the same that I did the first go around except enjoying it just a touch more. So the setup is simple, a few privileged, hypocritical liberals design a human hunt in which they target pigheaded Republicans supposedly. The movie wants to be a smarmy, clever satire but it never really commits to anything so the audience is left wavering. Performance wise Hilary Swank shines as always but the gold definitely goes to Betty Gilpin (Glow) who rules the movie. The movie is flooded with talk of somewhat exaggerated politics and leads to a questionable but I guess somewhat satisfying finale. Not for plot or rationales sake but for sheer entertainment value. Having the two women beat the crap out of eachother while spouting clever snippets makes the whole thing almost worthwhile. Well almost but it's still a bit of dark fun.3.25/5Budget: $18.2m
Domestic Box Office: $6m
Worldwide Box Office: $7m",The Hunt
73,Xstal,"'It's not a country, it's a business'...",6,1 May 2020,I prefer my political satire a little more subtle although replacing H for C in the title to describe some or all of the participants (you choose which depending on your polarisation) was the wittiest thing I've seen in a film all year. If you didn't laugh you'd cry.,The Hunt
74,Sergiodave,A breath of fresh air,7,3 November 2020,"A very clever movie showing the falseness of both the far right and far left. It is very funny, though not to the easily offended. Betty Gilpin in the lead role is superb and gets the character spot on, I think she will have a great future in movies. As a satire this is the best I've seen for a while. Well done.",The Hunt
75,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Ludicrous stereotype vs ludicrous stereotype. Appreciate what it was trying to do, but execution isn't perfect",6,31 October 2020,"Pros:
Gore is fun, not gonna lie.Betty Gilpin is funny, charming, cool, and ridiculously attractive all at once, and is probably the main reason this movie is watchable.I'm a sucker for movies where lots of people die with little to no warning, I can't help it.Cons:
This sort of premise has been done better in the past.Ideas/premise are good, but sometimes the execution is off.The satire/commentary can be so on the nose at times it's eye-rolling and groan-inducing.Overall: I needed something light to watch while drinking some wine, after a busy/less than ideal week, so this more or less did the job 🤷‍♂️",The Hunt
76,vithiet,I am surprised some people get all political about this movie.,6,9 September 2021,"I was entertained, even if I probably wouldn't re-watch it again. There is definitely nothing to take seriously about the 'political' angle of the movie: it's not condemning liberals or praising conservatives (or vice versa ??!) but is just basic satire about the current 'Divided States of America'. There is not much in terms of plot or character development but it was never the point of the movie; if you're down to watching an unlikely hero beat some people up for 90 minutes you'll enjoy this.",The Hunt
77,saptesh786,Never Joke on FB,8,1 April 2020,"Surprisingly good movie ! Began with man hunting and killing scene indicates us to watch one more slaughter killing drama, but movie takes turn then and change in a escape and action movie with unknown suspense. Good story, good screenplay and logical suspense revealing with cat fight end. Kick ass fight sequences by Betty Gilpin are super. She looks something like renown actress Sandra Bullock. No boring moments throughout the movie this is another good point. Overall must watchable an action and suspense thriller for every action lovers. However it is not horror.",The Hunt
78,blott2319-1,Like listening to a lousy political debate,2,2 September 2020,"If you've ever spent time on social media reading through political discussions where there are people firmly encamped on opposite sides of the issue, then you'll understand what it's like to watch The Hunt. This film is stupid and obnoxious, but thinks it's so clever. Also, it goes on for way too long when the actual point it is trying (and failing) to make could have been accomplished in a 10-minute short. We have to watch a parade of annoying stereotypes killing one another, and we're meant to care for some reason. Even worse is the fact that the entire thing is meant to be a comedy, but it's clear that no one in the creative process knows how to deliver a joke. I was rolling my eyes most of the time, and only found a couple of scenes that managed to make me chuckle. Perhaps it was less humorous to me because I don't see the comedy in mimicking the radical right or left, because these are things that real people espouse, and they are making the world a worse place.If you stripped away all the political rambling of this film it would amount to a glorified Battle Royale or Hunger Games, and since those movies have already taken on that genre effectively, this just feels like a cheap imitation. I was on the fence whether I disliked or completely loathed The Hunt until the climax. The final confrontation is utter nonsense. They don't give a proper explanation for anything that is happening, even though they try hard to come up with one. Plus the fight itself is ludicrous and downright boring. I suppose if I cared more about the hero character then I would find a way to get invested in this battle, but she's so unpleasant, I struggle to get on her side. I've certainly seen worse movies than The Hunt, but this was pretty obnoxious. It's clear that the director and writers overestimated their ability to create something that was smart, topical, and witty. (Instead they made something that was none of the above.)",The Hunt
79,thekarmicnomad,So much fun!!,9,7 September 2020,"This is a really good fun slasher/action/survival movie - but with a budget.
It doesn't take itself too seriously and keeps you guessing.
I wouldn't read too many reviews as it is best to go into this pretty fresh.From the hype it sounded like this was going to be really political.
I am from the U.K so I don't understand the relevance of Arkansas or what NPR is but I get a general gist of what is going on by all the clips of red-caps fighting with people dressed like ninjas on YouTube.This film isn't that political in that it makes fun of anyone and everyone who has an extreme view: meaning there is a little bit of something for everybody.The action is great and gory and funny and gritty and slapstick - this really should be a mess of a film but it feels very tight.Betty Gilpin is absolutely amazing here.
Her part is very well written and she plays it with a real determination.
Amongst the violent mayhem I found myself hanging off her every word.
Somehow she manages to inject mountains of charisma and tension into an essentially dry and stoic character whilst sporting the most imposing breasts I have ever seen on screen.If you like a bit of silly gore and tough action with some dry humour sprinkled on the top then this is a must see.
I loved it.",The Hunt
80,gilgongo1980,partly funny and partly stupid,4,9 May 2020,"I know it's satire, but it was too stupid for me, because portraying a weak and thin woman as Superman was just too unrealistic for me. It was probably fantasy.",The Hunt

82,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Entertaining Horror-Comedy for people who love gore,6,22 March 2020,"I found this film entertaining. Not usually my kind of horror film but the comedy between the leftist, the right wingers and anti politically correctness made for an interesting funny horror film, especially for a presidential election year, 2020.Lots of action, gore, and fight scenes. You could somewhat confuse this film for a Quentin Tarantino film if you haven't seen many of his films before. Especially the end scene that reminded me of Kill Bill with the two females going after each other. I enjoyed it.",The Hunt
83,markthomassintek,just got boring after the shop scene,6,18 March 2020,"REVIEW - THE HUNTHonesty there aren't many films I don't understand either in some way or another but....This film starts very strongly and who you are led to believe are the main characters are actually......I personally loved this because so many times we see our hero of heroine straight from the off and all the way through doing what they must to survive and defeat but the start of this film was actually a very pleasant surprise but unfortunately it quickly went downhill from there very quickly.I said above that there aren't many films I just don't get and this is a prime example, a group of doo gooding liberals suddenly decided to create a hunt where they hunt people who don't believe in the same liberal policies that they do, hang on, liberals suddenly going around killing people, wouldn't they ask the victims permission first, apologise and then run to their psychologist for years upon years of councilling because they took away someone's liberty or hurt their feelings.Watching this silly nonsense story actually made me think of (dare I say it) people who don't supporters Trump, yes.Not a political satire but definitely I felt one group of people who don't follow Trump basically telling everyone else who does that you're not a liberal so you're not nice so should die.Sound familiar, Trump telling Clinton to go die during his initial campaign.Strange watch and just got boring after the shop scene where the film suddenly and unexpectedly took a nose dive.Rating 6 out of 10",The Hunt
84,abisio,A great and unexpected political satire,9,14 March 2020,"Contrary to what the trailer suggested; the movie is about Liberals chasing and killing RedNecks; not for sport but for vengeance.
It is far from serious but extremely violent and play with many cliches just twisted them unexpectedly. For example; many of the best known actors are killed after a few minutes.
Do not even attempt to take it seriously. It is a satire and a very darkly funny one.
The movie joke about the moral stupidity and division on our society and while some jokes could have gone deeper the tone is still funny and cynical.
If you like violence; well the movie has a lot. The last woman to woman fight is better than any one in Kill Bill and more realistic. Some killings seem quite gory but most of the time the camera shy away of the carnage.
Other killings; like the bunker scene are quite funny and violent at the same time.
In brief; it is a great satire; plenty of fun and a lot to think about",The Hunt
85,Sir_AmirSyarif,An amusing satire that skewers both conservatives and liberals of the American political spectrum,7,9 December 2020,"Sure, 'The Hunt' has a premise that's been done many times before - think 'The Most Dangerous Game' (Irving Pichel, Ernest B. Schoedsack, 1932) or 'Battle Royale' (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000) or 'The Hunger Games' (Gary Ross, 2012) - but director Craig Zobel and screenwriters Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof have put together an amusing satire with carefully measured storytelling, razor-sharp wit, and maniacal mayhem that skewers both conservatives and liberals of the American political spectrum. Violence is used gratuitously for laughs and shock value with Tarantino-esque moments of comedy and dialogue. The final standoff between Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank is a must-see spectacle. Fun as hell!",The Hunt
86,killercharm,Girl fight!,7,20 August 2020,"What fun. A bunch of rednecks are hunted for sport by a bunch of uber-rich Politically Corrects. So many good things - especially toward the end. The girl fight in particular. The music is so good it's special; it's all girl music. Until the Mahler that is. My one beef is that depiction of ""Snowball"" defeating men in fighting, especially the consultant. If a slim woman is fighting a man, especially a taller man, she should be using something as a weapon. If he's muscled it becomes especially hard to believe, and belief makes it so much more delicious.",The Hunt
87,kjproulx,"Enjoyable, But Underwhelming",6,20 March 2020,"It's hard not to think about the controversy of a movie when the media all over the world was covering the fact that this film was delayed, due to violence in the world. Going into this movie, I was worried about how similar it was going to feel to the real-world events of the last couple of years. Normally I can just brush off reality and enjoy a movie for what it is, but after watching this movie, even I found myself wondering why it was delayed. It's really just a more brutal version of a film like The Hunger Games. Regardless, this is a very violent film, but it's all meant to give audiences an enjoyable time. While it didn't always work for me, The Hunt is absolutely the definition of a violent film that's just trying to provide some adult fun.After a couple of needless scenes, this film opens with a group of twelve individuals, not knowing where they are or why they are there. Placed in a forest with nothing but weapons, they must flee for their lives, for reasons that will come to light later on. The first act of this movie is very enjoyable and my jaw was on the floor on a couple of occasions, but I found myself very uninterested in the events to follow after that. This is a very rushed movie that ultimately feels dull by the end. Once the third act of this film began, I just didn't seem to care anymore.Where this film shines is in its shock factor. While I don't commend movies for showcasing violence for the sake of violence and nothing else, the use of it here felt like it was a part of the world being presented. The first act of this movie, as I mentioned, is quite shocking and I was curious where the movie would go. Sadly, the first act of this film should've been how the majority of it all played out. The best part about this movie is over far too quickly. With that said, Betty Gilpin as Crystal (the main character of the film) was very likeable in this role. It was due to her committed performance that I bought into the events unfolding on-screen.This film suffers from a very weak third act, which was a shame. If this film started the way it should have and left everything ambiguous, it would've been so much cooler to see revelations later on. With that said, this movie chooses to just give you all the answers, before the climax even unfolds, so that's why I found myself not caring by the end. It was clear that director Craig Zobel was trying to make a fun, violent piece of cinema and the duo of Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof as the writers was promising as well, so why did this movie fall apart? It really didn't have to. It's really a mess when it comes to explaining what has really been going on.In the end, The Hunt is a fun movie at times and surprised me on multiple occasions, but those moments were too far and in between. I can recommend this movie to fans of this type of film, but it absolutely won't impress many others. I'm more positive about it than negative, but there were absolutely major details about the movie that I didn't like. Due to things going on in the world at the moment, The Hunt is now available to rent on all streaming services. If you're a fan of violent movies, you may get a kick out of this one, so take my very mild recommendation with a grain of salt.",The Hunt
88,kuarinofu,Well done satirical gorefest,8,29 March 2020,"It's one of those films where anything goes, the expectations are low and you can't get disappointed.The film combines brainless fun and gore with hilarious dialogue that feels like it was written by the Internet itself. The exchanges between the characters feel like youtube/Facebook comments mixed with Reddit and imageboards copypastas.And that's what is great about this film, it lets you shut down your brain to enjoy the mindless violence and gore, but from time to time they drag you back with a good jab at whatever side they are ripping on this time.There is no real point to dig deeper into this, just enjoy the violence and the humor. If you're open-minded enough and can laugh at others AND yourself - you will surely enjoy this.",The Hunt
89,nicholls905-280-546911,Didn't deliver against the hype,7,27 March 2020,"I'll review this film at a later date. The film was delayed due to violence concerns at the time, but this wasn't that crazy. Other films are much more violent. Hell, even the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is harder to watch. I think it's more down to the senseless nature of the deaths. There's a lot of humour here, and the violence is just part of the storyline. If you're not into a film like this, obviously don't watch. I honestly felt it was underwhelming, but it had hype attached. This may develop into a cult gem over time. That's why I would like to revisit after the hype has vanished.",The Hunt
90,JohnRayPeterson,"Target practice more than a hunt, retribution more than a depraved game.",7,23 March 2020,"In case you didn't notice the warning, this review has spoilers, it has the mother of all spoilers. That being said, you may recall the movie was originally set to premiere in 2019 but it was during a string of mass shootings in the US and so it was postponed because of potential negative press and social media backlash.This last point, social media backlash, is at the core of 'The Hunt's premise. You see, many believe the story we think we're going to see unfold is about a bunch of rich depraved people using less fortunate folks as animals for a hunt. It's not. It's more a bunch of redneck conspiracy theory supporters, who are referred to in the movie as 'deplorables', being rounded up and used as target practice for rich inept executives who lost their precious jobs following such social media viral tempest.The top CEO affected by the social media campaign, Athena, played by Oscar winner Hilary Swank, is not taking the ramblings of the 'deplorables' lying down. She gets even big time. During the year that followed calls for her resignation, she enlists her inept associates participation to carry out her plan of revenge. We observe Athena's 'bad-assery' early in the movie when she kills a Goliath type deplorable with all the coolness of a cold blooded assassin, using one of her Louboutin high heel shoe for the job; she was after all a killer CEO.Key social media 'deplorables' are, we presume, singled out and investigated so they can be better eliminated in a wild target practice shoot, a very deadly and gruesome one. The story revealed that the fake news about the executives was one having those executives carrying out a human hunt for their sick pleasure, which wasn't true, just like the Pizzagate story and other conspiracy theories from the far right aren't. However, it inspired Athena to serve her retribution by delivering exactly that with which she was alleged of doing. I really like that twist. Her bumbling associates were not lethal like Athena, so she hired a consultant mercenary to train and supervise her friends for 'The Hunt'. Athena supervised the whole thing remotely, via 'walkie-walkies' and drones. But something unexpected was happening.One of the 'deplorables' was mistakenly targeted. Crystal, played by Betty Gilpin, had the same name and lived in the same town as another, named Crystale; she was anything but a deplorable. Crystal was a well read, smart Afghan war veteran with better fighting skills than Athena's and tactical experience superior to the consultant she had hired. When Crystal woke up from her drug induced kidnapping, like all the other target victims she immediately started to assess and reassess the situation. One by one, she mercilessly defeated Aathena's pawns, including that mercenary consultant. Did I mention she was a bad-ass broad?All things considered, what you'll see is inept liberal elites going after far right deplorables with one kick-ass smart female vet not taking crap from anyone. Of course Athena and Crystal will have a final confrontation, violent and exhausting; you can't be sure who will emerge the winner but let me spoil it for you by saying Athena's last words are priceless. Did I have fun watching this movie? Take a wild guess.",The Hunt
91,brankovranjkovic,The Hunt - especially for those who like bloody violence,6,12 March 2020,"Dark comedy horror.It's a very simple plot, twelve strangers wake up in a field at a remote location, they don't know how they got there, but we very quickly realise they're being hunted for sport by a group of elite's. I was never completely sure who the elite hunters were or who was being hunted, the objective is survival.However, one of the hunted is a tough bad ass female hero, she methodically kills off the elites one by one as she makes her way towards the elusive principal woman at her manor house for Kill bill style catfight showdown at the end.You really need to consider this as a bit of mindless entertainment especially for those who like bloody violence.",The Hunt
92,msbreviews,The Hunt is one of the most divisive films of the last few years... and I love it!,8,7 April 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)In case you don't know, I'm from Portugal. Why does this matter? Well, The Hunt was delayed after a massive shooting in the USA, and since the movies' themes are extremely sensitive, the producers decided to postpone the film. At the time, I felt frustrated that, once again, movies have to suffer from real-life situations. Going to the theater is supposed to be an ""out of this world"" experience. The audience is transported into a fictional place where real-world problems can be forgotten for a couple of hours. So, I never handled these constant controversies surrounding films very well...With that said, I believe The Hunt not only benefited from that delay, but its satirical story has even more impact now. There's no way around this. Craig Zobel's movie is meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years. I know it's a pretty basic analogy, but it's just like a dark humor standup show. If you don't have any issues with jokes about topics like racism, stereotypes, immigration, refugees, religion, politics, and every sensitive theme that your mind can imagine, then you'll find The Hunt a brilliant allegory of society's most extreme people. If you do have problems with this type of comedy, then stay away from this movie because Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out!When I write that every remotely sensitive taboo subject or activity is unrestrainedly addressed, I mean EVERY SINGLE theme. This is a narrative completely packed with extreme, over-the-top cliches and stereotypes of both right and left political sides. At first glance, The Hunters feel like the ""bad guys"", in the sense that they're hunting innocent people for pure pleasure. Once the audience understands the reasons behind the selection of the people being hunted, one small but tremendously effective thought enters everyone's mind: ""you know what... the world would actually be a better place without this kind of people"".Suddenly, not a single character is worth caring about. To clarify, I don't mean ""caring about"" in the common, emotional way. No character is written with the purpose of making the audience worry about it. In fact, almost every character (maybe except Betty Gilpin's) is a despicable human being. Their view of the world is clouded by ideologically outdated mentalities. I love how the screenwriters use each character to represent a particular type of ... extreme personality, let's call it that. One of the best compliments I can give the film is that it didn't pick a side. Everyone gets blasted with jokes.It's a dark yet hilarious satire of today's society with a special focus on the close-minded people that go online to try and spread their conspiracy theories and immoral beliefs. Everything that I just wrote so far resembles the movie's impact on the viewer: either you're okay with this type of screenplay and you'll be incredibly entertained; or you'll get extremely triggered by all this. It's one of those films that will end up on a bunch of ""Worst Movies of 2020"" lists simply due to its narrative's nature.However, the story isn't the only aspect that can make people give up on watching this movie. The actual hunt is as over-the-top as everything else. There's blood everywhere, ridiculously disgusting deaths, and absolutely no limits whatsoever in killing people in the most insanely entertaining way possible. Action-wise, The Hunt is better filmed than a lot of blockbusters. Beautiful wide shots when something (or someone) explodes, exceptional (and hilariously long) choreography for the ""final fight"", and excellent editing overall. It's genuinely a well-made, well-produced, and well-filmed movie. The score is also pretty cool.Obviously, it's one of those films that's easy to pinpoint flaws. Every single paragraph that I wrote above can be interpreted as some of the worst aspects of the entire movie, depending on each person's perspective. In my opinion, I think the ending would have benefited from a more serious tone, but at the same time, it would probably clash with the widespread satirical one, so it's an inevitably difficult ending to completely get right. The cast is a bit hit-and-miss when it comes to each actor's performance (some are very bland), but Betty Gilpin delivers an outstanding display and seamlessly carries the whole film. Finally, there's a small part of the movie that involves military characters who don't belong to either side of The Hunt, and that portion didn't really work for me.All in all, The Hunt is a brilliantly dark satire on today's political views of the world. It's meant to be one of the most divisive films of the last few years, and it undoubtedly succeeds in its mission. Just like dark humor, either you're okay with it, or you're not. If you can't take a joke about the most extremely sensitive taboo themes (and I mean ALL of them), then stay away from this movie or you'll be triggered for a whole week. However, if you can see the fun side of this type of comedy, The Hunt is the most entertaining, witty, hilarious, bloody, over-the-top action thriller you'll see for a long time. Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse go all out, and they don't forget to approach a single topic. It's a well-made film all-around: well-written, well-produced, and well-filmed. A few minor issues regarding its ending and a small subplot don't diminish Craig Zobel's exceptionally captivating concept and Betty Gilpin's compelling performance. I definitely recommend it depending on how much you enjoy dark humor.PS: everyone knows the tale about the rabbit and the turtle, right? How the rabbit races the turtle, and all that? Well, The Hunt's version of that story just became my all-time favorite.Rating: A-",The Hunt

And it didn't really disappoint me nor did satisfy. It's a bang average film that does well on some parts, in others it fails poorly.The main highlight of the film should be Betty Gilpin and her tremendous performance. She almost carried this otherwise soulless film into a dramatic turn. The fast pacing also helps in regard of the action pieces that were truly enjoyable. The cinematography looks fine and The background score was also decent enough accordingly.Now about the political satire thing. Well for the U.S. citizens and those people who are well aware of current political Scenarios all over the world would relate more to the concerning plot. This Left vs Right Ideologies and the Jokes intended to poke fun at them on the both sides is definitely on the broader spectrum. You need to understand those jokes in particular to have an understanding of the film's true motives! But for us, for the normal audience it might not be the same case. The choppy plot, close to zero characterization, and the screenplay struggles on few occasions.

I even liked the ""Why"" behind it all. If ever the words ""guilty pleasure"" applied to a film, this would be that film.The story starts with a tight group of friends texting each other. When one of them talks about hunting ""deplorables"", he is quickly hushed and the chat thread is closed. Then we cut to eleven strangers waking up in the middle of nowhere, gagged, confused, and totally lost. They meet in the middle of a clearing where a large wooden crate waits for them. Before we know it, they are on the run for their lives - bullets whizzing by them, arrows searing through the air, and explosives sending chunks of earth all around. It is chaos from start to finish.This movie was paced so well, that when the end came, I couldn't believe how fast that 90 minutes flew by. I was completely engrossed and on the edge of my seat. I had the hardest time figuring out who the main character was going to be. You don't stay with one person very long until later in the film. I had never seen Betty Gilpin in a movie before this, but I became a quick fan. I loved her character and she acted it out to the full. And, at 46, Hilary Swank has still got it goin' on. This movie did NOT hold back at all. It is unapologetic and unabashed to its core.I highly recommend ""The Hunt"". All elements of this film were very well done. The acting was spot on, the EFX and make-up was perfect, the dark humor was truly funny, the story and characters (such as they were) were strong, the cinematography was perfect, and the re-watchability is very high.

Its kinda made to be funny, satyrical, yet violent, it even manage to surprise you fast in the beginning.The plot is rather thin and make very little sense, and most of the character's back story are not developed at all, even the main protagonist we don't know much about her, but ultimately it does not matter that much in the big picture.When i mentioned Cabin in the Woods i don't refer to horror or supernatural aspect but just that its a movie purposely made so you have fun with it, and not of it.

110,PyroSikTh,Left or Right Doesn't Matter. It's a Bloodbath Either Way,7,21 March 2020,"The Hunt follows two groups of people in a story not too dissimilar to The Most Dangerous Game, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games, and Ready or Not; one group are working-class who wake up in a strange place with no idea how they got there, while the others are the wealthy elite who hunt the ""peasants"" for sport. For the most part it plays out like any other movie of its ilk. Except The Hunt injects some clunky political satire into it, and dials up the caricatures for comedic effect. What really surprised me about this movie was how the typical roles were reversed. When these kinds of movies emerge, the wealthy are often depicted as outright evil with distasteful worldviews, while the peasants are likeable, easy to root for, and fighting for freedom for themselves and everyone else. The Hunt flips that on its head, giving us a series of right-wing, conspiracy theorist huntees as the protagonists, and having the wealthy elite as outright liberals making sure they don't offend anyone while killing humans for sport. Hollywood as an entity tends to lean quite hard to the left, so to see an American movie show left-wing liberals as the bad guys was refreshing in itself.While a big point is made of the two groups' political affiliations throughout the film's entire ninety minute running time, it actually doesn't matter all that much as the film soon devolves into the typical protagonist vs antagonist story. Nonetheless the movie takes this approach to make a point, no matter how hamfisted and lacking in subtlety it may be. The film acts as a cartoon representation of the political discourse that often emerges between those two groups. I don't believe politics can or should be easily separated into left or right, and that's sort of the point The Hunt is trying to make. There are terrible people on both sides who put too much stock into their political ideologies. The huntees may largely be racist, selfish, and full to the brim with conspiracy theories, but that doesn't mean they deserve to be hunted, and some of them definitely have redeeming qualities. Likewise just because you preach acceptance of other cultures and lead an ethical life does not suddenly turn you into a god above men, free to look down upon those who disagree with you. The biting criticism of left-leaning Hollywood sidelining filmmakers for the things they post online in order to appear ethical didn't miss the mark either.Of course to get this point across to both sides, each side is portrayed with borderline offensive caricatures. This is the left and right pulled right to their extremes. This results in the movie's most clear cut comedy. I wasn't even sure this was meant to be a funny movie going in, but it had me howling on a number of occasions. And it's not like this film pokes fun at one side and not the other. This is an equal opportunity kind of satire. The ridiculousness or piling bodies up while arguing over the correct vernacular of what to call black people co-exists alongside the daftness of waltzing up to foreign military arrogantly brandishing your American identity as if it gives you a free pass.And in the middle of all of this is Betty Gilpin as Crystal, who shows wisdom beyond her education. She's the unexpected variable who breaks the plan and shakes it all up in everyone's faces. Gilpin is absolutely fantastic in this role. While I cannot stand Debbie Eagan on GLOW, that's more down to how her insufferable character is written, and not how Gilpin decides to portray her. Gilpin has proven to be undoubtedly talented on that show, and she brings that same skill here as a completely different kind of character. She plays Crystal with a subtlety that leaves you unsure of where she stands in this mess, and while the question is asked, a concrete answer is never given. She's an obvious badass with some considerable training, but also quite clearly a bit screwy in the head. Crazy yet level-headed with military training is probably not who you want to be pissing off. And Gilpin seems to be having the time of her life with it all.While the political undercurrents remain throughout, the film does fall into predictability once Crystal takes her place centre stage. And that doesn't take long. The rotating protagonist angle is fantastic, shifting from Emma Roberts to Ike Barinholtz, but then less than half an hour in it's thrown out entirely. Similarly the final fifteen minutes are electric, almost entirely comprised of a mano a mano fight between Gilpin and Hilary Swank, without ever getting too stylish or lofty, grounding both characters in exhaustion and brutal efficiency. The mad grab for an exclusive bottle of champagne is a particular highlight. But the middle? It all just becomes kind of dull a by-the-numbers.The Hunt is cack-handedly politically charged lacking any sense of subtlety or subtext. It has a message worth listening to, but at the same time doesn't take itself too seriously and is filled with dark humour, poking fun at both sides in equal measure. My advice? Take it for what it is. A silly, over-the-top romp pointing out how ridiculous political arguments on the internet can be. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.P.S. Ethan Suplee really is as hench as those viral photos show. Goddamn.",The Hunt

However, it wasn't without its problems, major problems. I think they just threw in a bunch of stereotypes of left and right, but never really found a common way to glue them together.So the ""hunt"" started as a joke but because people believed it was real so they made it real? That is just a lame reason. There was really no indication of why any of these people would do what they were doing. Very little was shown regarding why they picked who and they never really answered it. The ""whoops"" at the end seemed like a rushed lazy way to end it. The biggest redeeming quality was that there is an actual movie that tried to evenly show both sides.And there were zero characters, meaning we knew basically nothing about them other what amounts to a ""meme character"" so you weren't really rooting for anyone, other than maybe Crystal, who we got to know nothing about.So you really have to overlook a lot of plot holes and rushed writing to enjoy it. I did enjoy it, but that is likely because I expected a total dud.They should have spent more time with the hunted at the beginning instead of the rushed kill off and the whole Croatia seemed silly.If you want to see a better CLASS WAR film, go see THEY LIVE by John Carpenter. Much better writing and everything is more subtle, like the Matrix.So if you wanna waste your time on it, have at it, but at the end, it was a blown opportunity.",The Hunt
115,stevenrotherforth,Unique and refreshing take on a tried and tested formula,8,3 April 2020,"The Hunt'The Hunt' gave me a dilemma when trying to figure out what score to give this rather entertaining and unique take on a tried and tested formula.
Anyone who's seen 'Hard Target' or 'The Hunger games' will recognise this movies plot.
It's been done many times before that is true but I don't think it's been done any better.
'The Hunt' stands tall due to some excellent script writing with excellent delivery from lead actress Betty Gilpin.
She is wonderfully badass as Crystal, one of twelve strangers that awake in a field and then find themselves hunted for sport.
What's so interesting and indeed unique about Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof's story is that the hero or heroine doesn't present themselves immediately.
We the audience latch on to several characters only for them to meet their demise rather gruesomely within minutes of their establishment.
This film starts off at a relentless pace and doesn't ever let up
Director Craig Zobel gets a lot done within the films lean 1hr 30min runtime.
Once Crystal is introduced the movie really picks up momentum and the audience are in for a comical, gruesome and action packed thrill ride.
Action is staged expertly and Betty Gilpin could be the next female action heroine. She's brilliant and believable performing the fight scenes and her comedic timing is refreshing to behold.
Despite having support from such seasoned pros as Hilary Swank and a brief appearance by Emma Roberts this is Gilpins movie.
'The Hunt' is a blood soaked satire sensation that delivers in all the key areas. It's funny, action packed and cringe inducing gruesomeness.
A film that just manages to stay within the confines of entertaining. Towards the end you start to believe it may over step the mark and ruin all the groundwork it set down at the beginning.
Thankfully an epic climatic fight between Gilpin and Swanks villainous character manages to keep this film on the good side of awesome.In terms of audio and visual quality 'The Hunt' doesn't look anything special in High Definition.
There's no remarkable crispness to the image or eye popping colour.
I don't believe it's a film worthy of a 4K HDR purchase. Save some cash and stick to the 1080p version.
On the other hand, audio is sublime.
This is one entertaining listen.
I enjoyed this film with a Dolby Digital Plus mix.
It's really punchy. Gunfire and explosions sound deep and impactful.
Heads explode assertively with the splatter of blood stretching across the mid range.
Shattering glass can cause you to wince as every blow of the climatic fight scene can be felt.
Dialogue is always crisp and audible with surround sound effects put to subtle but good use.So why the dilemma in scoring this movie?
At first 'The Hunt' was on course for a 9/10.
Then I faltered. Despite thoroughly enjoying this movie it's probably not one I will rush to revisit any time soon.
But when I eventually do I'm in for another treat.",The Hunt
116,Just-A-Girl-14,DISGUSTING!!!,1,27 January 2021,"The only thing scary about this movie is that someone thought it was worth making. What the hell was that?
Let me see if I got this right, so a bunch of idiots thought joking about hunting people is funny then they were fired for it because another bunch of idiots thought it was for real and instead of being angry at the people who fired them (those who knew it was just a stupid joke), they decided to be mad at the idiots who believed it to be true so their reaction was to make it true (because joking about killing people and actually doing it is the same).
Meaning, the rich, powerful idiots who got fired kidnapped and hunted the poor idiots who thought the joke was a real thing so now they are dead but right idiots. Yeah? Am getting this right?
And as if this isn't bad enough, they managed to add every insult and stereotype they could find, kill almost all the characters in about 10 minutes in the most gory and disgusting way and then of course - die.
Oh, and the one woman who outsmarted them all (and killed them) was not even the person they intended to catch and the reaction of the ""mastermind"" (of course it's another woman #womenempowerment) is ""oops""?!
Is this supposed to be clever? Funny? Scary? Am I supposed to be impressed?
I'd call it garbage but that would be an insult to garbage so I'm just gonna say that this is one of the most idiotic lame movie I've ever seen. I should have stopped watching it at the beginning when ""OMG one of them woke up"" because it was obvious where this was going. I was just curious to see if there was any point to all of this. In case you are reading my review and you haven't watched it yet, the answer is: there isn't any! Do yourself a favor and SKIP IT!!!

The scene with the heel in the eye was really disgusting! I almost turned off the TV but I was too tired and the remote was nowhere to be found.

121,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"Well aware of it's own silliness, and thus, purely a good time",8,9 February 2021,"This was pretty much exactly what I hoped it would be - a consciously dumb but thoroughly entertaining B-movie. For a B-movie, it feels like it has a high budget, though it might not - but the production gloss adds a bit of value to the whole experience. Sure, a lot of the CGI violence looks cheap, totally fake, and thus it's ineffective, but it's one of the only weaknesses of the entire film - and honestly, it's really not that important with a movie like this where ""realism"" barely matters.In my opinion, the greatest strength of the whole film is in lead actress Betty Gilpin, who I was entirely unfamiliar with prior to this. She takes a character reminiscent of the more memorable ones from actresses like Uma Thurman or Sarah Polley, one that very easily could have ended up generic as heck, and truly breathes her own unique persona into it. She infused a very impressive amount of depth and dynamic into what would be a very one-dimensional character on paper.Outside of that, what you're gonna get out of this is a lot of fun, over-the-top violence, small roles from familiar faces, and silly one-liners and surface-level jokes loosely related to our current era. One of the best parts about the film is that all the fat is trimmed - it's all extremely quick and to the point for 90 minutes, so it never slows down, not for a second. And, it definitely doesn't hurt that they threw Emma Roberts in there for a bit (drool) :) :) :) :) :)When it comes down to it, this is the kind of movie I probably would have rented repetitively and watched over and over again with my friends and sleepovers as a 13 year old boy.

Though I'm a 36 year old man now, and might not ever watched it again, I still see the value in it for exactly what it is. I was going to give it a 7 out of 10, but the ""final showdown"" and ending were so effective and on point, that I decided to boost to an 8. Movies like this that are conscious of what they are deserve credit for that. This one is a heck of a good time and that's all it is.",The Hunt
122,bob_meg,"An important, clever, if very glossy movie... don't watch it if you want to feel good about yourself, though",8,12 June 2020,"The myriad references to George Orwell's Animal Farm sprinkled visually and throughout the dialogue in ""The Hunt"" are no mere reach for intellectual chutzpah in Craig Zobel's latest Feature Guaranteed to Offend *Someone*.Not that he cares, and you shouldn't either. His 2012 outing ""Compliance"" was one of those films that was extremely difficult to like, slightly sadistic, but containing such a compelling set-up, it was tough to turn off. Very similar to The Hunt in many respects.There are two immediate reasons to see this movie: first, the fact that it gamely parodies both Red and Blue (idiotic labels in themselves) sensibilities and ideas, not really the people associated with those ideas. Very few people hold party-line views on everything.That's crucial (and quite ingenious, really). This is why you have scant to almost no background on most of the characters in The Hunt... they're not really set up as blood and guts people (they explode like clay pigeons), and therein lies the vehicle for it's ""message"". Oh yeah, it's got one of *those* --- all-caps, bolded and blazing --- so if you're thinking of an elegant satire in the vein of The Shooting Party, it's not happening here. The Hunt is closer to a mix of ""Die Hard"" and ""Hostel"".The second reason to see this film is Betty Gilpin's break-out performance as the lead beast-of-prey, whose droll-delivery and manic facial expressions (she sometimes plays her role like an over-amped cartoon character, which given the content and context of The Hunt, is appropriate). Gilpin is the closest we get in The Hunt to a 3D human... the film would be nothing but an wooden totem without her energy and muted effusiveness. It's really a great example of how to create a smart character. She plays it so close to the vest that you get the illusion she's on the same faceless, moral-less par as the rest of the cast. And many of the lines writers Cuse and Lindelof give her are hilarious to say the least.When you step back from The Hunt and think about it, hopefully you'll realize that there really are no liberals or conservatives.... there are only people with and without power and money. And the steps the Haves will take (and have taken) are not overstated here, even though the barrage of violence is (with little to no physical consequences except when convenient). The pettiness and recklessness of upper crust vindictiveness is sadly accurate, and that goes back to ""Compliance"", which had no clear winner or loser.That stalemate doesn't hold in ""The Hunt"" which provides a much more satisfying ending, but that overwrought message is, like most cliches, true. ""Power corrupts... and absolute power....""Well, you know the rest.",The Hunt
123,SnobReviews,"Fast paced, bloody fun.",5,21 March 2020,"""The Hunt"" is a fast paced diabolical rush packed with blood, guts and tons of social commentary.
.
In this dark comedy-thriller, twelve strangers chosen for very specific reasons, wake up in a clearing and don't know where they are or how they got there.
.
Why is this film so controversial? It's nothing we haven't seen before and nothing we haven't tackled in film. It's clear that ""The Hunt"" is meant to divide political parties but America is so freaking sensitive to everything. What I'm getting at is this film isn't shocking at all. All the controversy and comments ""The Hunt"" received back in 2019 is just baloney. If anything, all that controversy made me want to see this film more. It's not an amazing film but I had a good time viewing it. Betty Gilpin is the real MVP here and she kicks serious ass. I wouldn't see it a second time but if you've been curious to check it out, now's your chance.

125,fciocca,A bunch of nonsense scenes and awful political satire,3,23 June 2020,"I could not understand anything about this movie: plot is extremely confusing, characters are stupid and takes dumb decisions. The movie starts off with a bunch of rich people that decided to hunt other people for a stupid and futile reason, then we see a refugee camp in Croatia, and finally one of the most uninteresting and uninspired fighting sequence that I have ever watched on a movie. They did not even tried to do something original.This movie is a joke. It is basically a parody, that mokes conspiracy theorists, the politically correct and the american amendment acts, by criticising more than once the facts that every American has the right to posses a personal weapon. A lot of elements that are very badly mixed",The Hunt
126,TheHoodOfSwords,A Dark Comedy That Falls Short Of Being The Movie It Could Be,6,25 March 2020,"Look, my problem with the political elements in this film aren't the fact that it is poking fun at US political parties, but more the fact that SO much of the movie is that that it just isn't all that fun to watch. The concept for this movie made me incredibly excited, it reminded me of almost a cross of Hunger Games and Ready Or Not. The action in this movie is fun, the middle drags just a tad, not enough for it to be too noticeable in a normal movie, but when you are making a movie filled with lots of action and comedy, you definitely notice it. The movie makes fun of every political stance, so do with that what you will. Overall, I enjoyed it, but wish it had a better plot structure and some more character development.",The Hunt
127,saraccan,Not to be taken seriously,6,7 September 2021,"Its a fun, gory movie with nice twists and disposable characters that has no story. Should not be taken seriously and that is the exact goal.

128,Tak005,Could have just been average but for one thing,8,17 December 2020,"The idea of people hunting others for sport has been done before. This could have just been an average action/thriller movie based on those lines. However, what primarily lifts this film above that level is the main character portrayed by Betty Gilpin. Whether or not it is either individually or a combination of actor input, script or direction this character elevates the film to a very interesting level. It should not go unmentioned that many of the main support cast also put in good performances.",The Hunt

The irony of sitting is really hard work, and a lot of details and stems show different charms. I have to say that this one is really amazing. To me.At the same time, he was indifferent to the concept of killing the hostess and the staff on the plane, as well as the traitor Tang, and it was interesting why Tang helped the hostess when he saw that he would die. These people are basically forced out by the underlying keyboard, and at the same time, they have a similar mentality of killing and killing? dark humor.The last waiter is similar to supporting the plot, making the plot more black humorous.",The Hunt

Overall rating 44/10The Hunt is where 12 strangers wake up on a clearing, with no idea how they got there, and they have been chosen for one reason to be hunted. The hunt got off to a great start but sadly for me turned into something it shouldn't of done and a absolute mess. Let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the concept was interesting, and I loved the dark humour. The whole concept of humans hunting humans despite being fairly dark, was highly creative and felt fairly fresh to watch which was nice, it wasn't generic which a lot of films fall into being, and the whole concept of it was executed fairly well. I also loved the films dark and dry humour. I really connected with the film's humour that it went for, the characters were just very sarcastic and dry towards each other which I loved, and they weren't afraid to push the boundaries with some jokes and for the most part they were funny and still worked.However, my first few negatives would be the lack of character background and development and killing off characters to quickly before any development. The film literally opened with no background to the plot, expecting you to know everything about the manor and the hunt just by what the characters were saying, it gave the plot a lack of depth, and was just poorly thought out, it could of easily been reconstructed so the audience is more aware of what is going on so can therefore sympathise with the characters and know what's going on. There was also no character development whatsoever, you just didn't really know anything about the characters, even the main character had nothing in terms of background or development to them. They also killed off far to many characters in the beginning before you could connect to any of them, you were introduced to a character who seemed likeable and a good character to connect with and the next minute they were killed off, I just found it very odd and frustrating to watch.My next couple of positives would be the gore, action sequences and the uncomfortable and tense tone. I thought the action sequences and gore involved were very effective in the first half and final act of the movie, this kept the film entertaining and kept you on edge, the added gore added to the impact as well, with fast paced action being the focus which I didn't mind, the gore almost had me looking away in parts but that's just how I like it in movies. The Hunt also managed to execute a very uncomfortable and tense tone throughout most of the movie, due to the dark concept of humans hunting themselves, you couldn't help but sympathise with the characters involved and how they were feeling, not knowing when any of them can be killed kept me consistently uncomfortable and on edge, so the Hunt executed it's required tone very well.My next couple of negatives would be the odd creative decisions and the messy and overly political script. I thought the creative decision to just have Betty Gilpin to be the main character and for their not to be any supporting characters around her was very odd and bad decision by the creative team, just having one main character with no back up was just odd and Crystal would of needed back up in the amount of situations she was put into, the fact that she had no development or background to her either also didn't help things. I also found in the second half of the movie, the script got consistently more messy and over the top with the situations the main character went through and with it's dialogue, one of my least favourite parts of the movie was also how overly political the script was, there was so many controversial and occasionally offensive topics bought up that it for me felt not well enough explored to justify it's existence, it was poorly thought out, insensitive and was not needed in the movie, fuelling conflict between different people who watch the film.My final positives would be the clever dialogue and parts of the script, as well as the likeable main performance from Betty Gilpin. I thought the script was occasionally clever in terms of the dialogue between characters and not knowing who was good and bad with the characters within the script was also fun. The best part of the movie however had to be Betty Gilpin, whether it was her accent, hilarious humour or kick ass attitude and action sequences, she was a great main character and it makes me excited to see Betty in more movie roles in the future.My final negatives would be the poor villains, bad plot twists and underwhelming ending. I thought the villains in the movie were absolutely poor, they were hardly used, they were made to be easily killed off and weak, and the reasoning behind the main villain doing the hunt was not clear and just not a justified reason making the film seem pointless, the plot twists to do with Crystal and all the characters having some form of bad past was poorly executed as well, the plot twist involving Crystal made the villain seen dumb, and just because some of the characters involved in the hunt did some bad things doesn't justify the villains actions so this was just poorly thought out. The ending was also very underwhelming, the fight scene between Betty and Hilary Swank was entertaining, but it then just ended very abruptly and it ended with Crystal just walking away it was just very bad and left me feeling more disappointed with the movie than impressed.Overall, despite a strong first half, great humour and fun performance from Betty Gilpin, The hunt is a poorly thought out, messy film that due to it's over the top political intentions turns into to much of a different movie to what made it good in the first place.",The Hunt
131,thebricks,Should have gone directly to streaming,3,16 March 2020,"Terrible movie. It just wasn't written properly and it was set up for more sequels. It's one of the shortest movies I've seen in a long time. The lead character is a ""country"" Mary Sue, it's so ridiculous.It's pandering of the worst kind to a certain political base, so bad, it's so obvious the main concern was money and profit, not making a good film. They tried hard to still make the conservatives look stupid and the liberals were half-heartedly made to look stupid.I got tired of this really fast. Can't recommend.",The Hunt
132,solidabs,Not half bad,5,22 March 2020,"Liberal hollywood cant make a movie anymore to save their life. This one was so bad it wasnt half bad. Betty Gilpin saved this turd of a movie. She was awesome. Couldn't understand a word she said, but she was still great. What's with HILLARY Skank. She must be so hideous the director chose to hide her face half of her time on screen, which was minimal. Anyway it's worth a watch. Sadly liberals cant make a decent movie about right wingers and guns, cause they don't know about either. Clowns",The Hunt
133,faer_kr,Interesting,9,5 September 2020,"A thriller with touches of action and suspense.

Quality.
The action stunts are spectacular and well executed, although there are two or three exaggerated moments.

135,WalkdenEntertainment,Call Me A Pig Because I Enjoyed This Film...,7,15 April 2020,"A group of strangers wake up alone in the woods with gags over their mouths. Soon they all manage to find each other, along with a large crate in the centre of an open grass field. Inside the crate are knives, blades and guns- lots of guns. The group are now being brutally hunted down like animals. Why this is happening and who is behind this devilish act is all unknown to start with. The characters trying to survive this hunt are also given little to no back story at the start of the film.The opening to this film is fun and extremely crazy. As the group wake up to discover the situation the general setup is enjoyable. I was curious to see more and understand what was going on. But what's even more fun is how this film decides to play with the audience, particularly when you're trying to work out which character is really leading the film. The surprises are different to anything I've seen in cinema before and the change was rather welcomed.But most characters (possibly all!) give an over the top performance, talk way too much and are incredibly cheesy. It's obvious this film is aiming to bring in laughs as well as crazy violence. The violence is also over the top, bloody and at times used for comedic purposes. While I do see the humour in some aspects, I feel some movie goers will be shocked or perhaps put off by this type of film given the level of violence.The lead performance of this film was great, and I'm surprised as to how many times I found myself having a good chuckle due to their delivery of dialogue. This actor and the 1st act itself are easily some of the best elements in the film.Action sequences (particularly the last act) are also filmed well and I was able to see and follow everything as the film intended.Overall, I feel ""The Hunt"" will leave many audiences divided given the level of violence and social themes. Personally, I found enjoyment in this film. With a solid performance from the leading character and a rather surprising 1st act, The Hunt is simply a brainless, entertaining movie with twists and turns. 6.8/10 - Walkden Entertainment",The Hunt
136,dommercaldi,Modern American Politics Extrapolated,6,27 March 2020,"Pros:
1. The comedy is dark and witty and genuinely hilarious.
2. The film provides really good commentary on the current state of American politics, and where the virulent divide between the Globalists and Nationalists could lead to.
3. Betty Gilpin (Crystal) puts in a great performance.
4. All of the deaths of the Elites are extremely satisfying in their execution.
5. None of the characters are safe which helps to heighten the tension and stakes.
6. The last fight between Crystal and Athena (Hilary Swank) is well-choreographed, entrancing, and brutal.Cons:
1. The score is overbearing and overplayed.
2. The dialogue, in regards to political commentary, is often too clunky.
3. The CGI blood looks horrendous.
4. Crystal goes up against a couple of much bigger men yet she easily defeats them in hand-to-hand combat.",The Hunt

However, it just didn't take any of its ideas far enough.I think the point is to under-develop all the characters, at least in the beginning. It just didn't feel like the movie wanted to go far enough with any of the characterizations. Everyone was a meeker version of a real person.The script isn't too bad, but the dialogue doesn't ring true. For my taste, there wasn't enough violence or action. It is shot well.Overall nothing to write home about, but if it was on TV and I had nothing else to do, I might not change the channel.",The Hunt

But I just went in thinking it was a new take on ""The most dangerous game"" and was pleasantly surprised.The humans hunting humans thing has been done time and again, but ""the Hunt"" really does take several u-turns to shock the audience. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just say that the movie probably isn't for everyone. But I loved it's dark humour and both sides of any political argument had fun poked at It here.My only complaint is that the fast pace slowed right down and started to limp a bit towards the end.

The Hunt, for instance, I only wanted to see because of Justin Hartley (I just love him on This Is Us) but here he didn't have enough time to shine. The first fifteen minutes in and you'd go: what the hell is going on here? but after you read who co-wrote and produced this movie everything would fall into place - it's maestro Damon Lindelof who knows how to screw up your brains in guessing games he fancy writing. The Hunt is a fun movie but it spoiled the fun a lot with its overly political undertones you are by no means looking in a slasher movie. One thing's for sure is that it hits all the right buttons when it comes to gore and violence; at times you just can't help but see that the creators were just having fun with it too. I wish there was something more behind The Hunt but all of the good ideas thrown at us were just screwed by its narrative that you would never take this movie seriously. And you shouldn't.",The Hunt

149,quaseprovisorio,even though is not balanced i enjoyed it and thought it was a fun ride.,6,15 May 2020,"There's one problem with the hunt, right from the beggining: the idea that the ""elites"" reside in the left. right wing is where a lot of elites are. in most countries in the world they're the elite. they're the bankers, the rich entrepeneurs, the guys that flew away to the country for the tax money and put them in tax havens. the fact that the left is also quite elitist in usa comes from the fact that economically they're not that different from each other - no matter what they think they still see capitalism as the main solution for the world.anyway, the movie: awesome fun in the first 30 minutes. it was a blast honestly. it was great! fun, fun, fun. we're just not expecting such a crazy pace and are surprised almost by the minute. i really enjoyed it. the rest? well...where the movie lost me was at character development. we can se the metaphor here is how both sides kinda come into extremes and are unable to communicate anymore: they see each other as walking cliches :""the homophobic hillbilly that hates refugees"" or the ""snowflake sjw that helps to feel himself better"". that idea of putting those sides in confrontation is interesting. the problem is the characters talk as if they were walking cliches too.the movie was fun until it reached the point of character development. it failed a bit there. the second and third halves as the movie weren't as effective for me as the first one, but still they were entertaining. i don't think the audience care much about the reasons of all of this, i think that part could be smaller. and i also believe that if the movie was more like the beggining i would care less about character development. but it wasn't. also because it was hard to follow that pace and it worked a bit like a cartoon - which i enjoyed.so: characters are dull in general, except crystal that we get more. the plot could be better worked if they managed to make the film more like the first part. the dialogues also fell short - knives out also had a lot of social commentary and didn't need a lot of dialogue for that. still: it's a very fun movie extremely watchable that i actually enjoyed a bit more than what i was expecting. enough for a seven? maybe not, mostly because of the pace. recommended: hell yeah. for mindless fun with a small squint of social criticism. i also smell ""cult movie"" here. it might get into that.",The Hunt

156,TuesdayThe17th,Hyper stylized violence but light on depth and too self aware,7,2 April 2020,"Though Betty Gilpin tries too hard to be ""cool"" in her role and seems far too aware of the camera in her face, ""The Hunt is actually a visually epic action/thriller movie with many big names and a bit of satire. This movie has become controversial ever since the hold back of its release date due to some of edgy and relevant material. After watching it, however, I see no reason why this movie should have been held back since all of the government stuff and the deplorable stuff only scuffs the surface. This movie does have a decent story line but it just doesn't go deep enough into it. Its like walking into a lake up to your knees because you're afraid to go waist deep let alone all the way under. Or like digging up a treasure chest with loud and aggressive tools but giving up when there are only a few digs left to uncover it. The casting was really good and it was quite smart of Zobel to kill off the big names at very unexpected times and very early, leaving us with only one or two good guys or ""deplorables"" left to fend for themselves against a full hand of crooked government officials. A few things here: Hilary Swank is usually GARBAGE but in this movie she is very good and actually very sexy. She has nice curves in those comfy pants she wears towards the end and during the final showdown. Another thing is, I loved Macon Blair and he was excellent here even if only for briefly. Betty Gilpin is a shitty actress and should have never been considered for this role. However, the most important thing to look at here, is that this is such a major change up from Craig Zobel's usual style of filmmaking and its a wild follow up after ""Z for Zechariah"" ... What came over this man, I will never know, and it may or may not be a good thing. ""The Hunt"" is super violent and super stylish but surprisingly not so entertaining. The locations used were boring and the movie was just too self aware. The story is okay but too thin and the character development just isn't there for the ""deplorables"" which to me is a bit inappropriate since the govt officials were given so much back story. Overall, a decent piece of filmmaking but not great",The Hunt

It has been a trademark in everything this guy does, ever since ""Lost"". The irony in ""Lost"" was that the people who were really lost were the scriptwriters. The irony in all his other work is that he is still lost.
After flushing down the toilet that amazing treasure trove of fiction that is the world of ""Watchmen"", pandering to a specific slice of the public in the great divide that has become identity politics and social justice, now he ritualistically and literally slaughters that slice of the public, pandering to the other slice.

I can't say it necessarily hit those expectations, but I still enjoyed it and thought it was decent.There's many elements throughout including intrigue, suspense, mystery, humor, action, gore, and a fairly unique storyline. But yeah, it's basically 'Hunger Games' on steroids.I'm not going to get political, but this movie sure does! Though, at the same time, I wouldn't say it necessarily takes sides. It puts the extremes of both the left and right on display. That being said, you'll probably enjoy it more if you inherently lean more to the right.I thought the ending was fantastic.

169,FKDZ,"Fun, fast paced and gory but ultimately a very flat and empty movie.",6,4 December 2020,"Going into this movie I surely didn't expect it to be a comedic and simple as I thought. I expected a lot more just gruesome and kind of disturbing things especially with the poster images. Also the slight uproar this movie had online aided in that preconception, but after finishing the movie the marketing department definitely did their job because this movie isn't pushing any ''boundaries''.So american politics aside this movie is overall an enjoyable one. But also left me wanting for more. One the biggest flaws in this movie is the late and lack of character background and development for pretty much every single character. Most annoyingly from the characters that are actually hunting. I'd argue none of the characters in this movie are believable at all.The writing in this movie is pretty basic, rich elitists don't like the poor with opinions, and they silence them by organizing a hunt because they also enjoy killing them in psychopathic ways(?).. this links back to there being so little character depth, why are these people so interested and nonchalant about murder? Very unbelievable. So this movie also decides to show us this backstory waaay too late in the movie. That scene where the family gathers and actually plans the whole thing needed to be there before they all got killed in the bunker.The dialog is alright. The acting though, I guess that's one of the main highlights of this movie, Betty Gilpin gives a very oddly directed but good performance. Most of the others are fine except for a few of the first throwaway characters we got. The main villain is good too, but once again, lack of screen time and backstory.The directing, now this is a thing, simply put its sloppy and all over the place. The movie doesn't look ugly, but it has such a shift in tone from the first couple of fake out main character deaths. Honestly, it was really looking like a comedy action movie the first 30 minutes. But once we get to the last two survivors it gets a lot more serious in its tone. It seemed intentional, but I would've preferred the serious tone from the start but I guess the movie never had the proper character depth for that anyways. The kills in this are sometimes good, many of them are last second cut aways, so not much to see but some are pretty gruesome and well done. Most of the action directing is good except for the final 1v1 fight. Although this fight is really fun to watch and entertaining while it happened, a lot of times its sloppy, hits that come from nowhere quick cut aways that aren't followed up well. There are some good moments, even comedic ones like the glass door, but a lot of the times I felt myself having to refocus on the fight because action wasn't followed logically.The soundtrack was good, I really enjoyed the final fight and its music. Tonally it fit and just really worked for the fight. Once again though some of the early parts of the movie had music that felt so much less serious in tone.The ending is really as simple as the whole movie, I did wait for one more surprise but not even that. It's quite a bland ending.Also I wouldn't ever categorize this is a horror, it just has a bit more blood than a typical action movie.All in all the movie definitely didn't bore me. It just missed quite some marks and felt sloppy in its direction.5.5/10 enjoyable",The Hunt
170,gk303007,Keep your brains out,7,3 June 2020,"Action, gore and violence and nothing else.

Apparently the end score did have some shreds from his movie/s.Off late, a good action movie and a definitely one time watch. Maybe these days the twist in cliche in itself works out if executed in a different way.

The script, the jokes, the hidden messages and peculiar play. This is brilliant. The script writer is a genius.
I will admit, this is not for everyone and I am not sure who this movie is for, probably for someone who can think, perhaps?? There's so much behind each dialog!!!
I don't want to spoil it. This is definitely a comedy-horror(ish gore)-thriller-action type flick. If you are into that sort of stuff, there's a good chance you will enjoy it. I can see myself re watching it again in a couple of years.

174,snowfre,"Potential for more but ends up as, not much more than, an all-out action thriller",6,15 April 2020,"Craig Zobel's ""The Hunt"" has been surrounded by controversy, resulting in push(ed) release dates. The film details Crystal (Gilpin) as she finds herself one among many targeted by another group of people. It's all about survival, and she can trust nobody. It sounds interesting but also as something we've seen before, however, co-writer Damon Lindelof promised satire on the political conflicts between the left and the right in the United States. This basis could have elevated ""The Hunt"" from the crowded list of slasher thrillers to that of allegory-filled political action movies. Unfortunately the director and writing team fails with this, quite tremendously, and it isn't until the second half of the film that the political undertones emerges. Hillary Swank plays the calculating, enlightened liberal Athena who is the constructor of the entire hunt, and Swank and Gilpin are both excelling in their performances. The climatic fight between the two definitely sets the standard for girl fights in this decade sky high. Now, to the ideological motifs of the characters; it is obvious that those responsible for the hunting event are liberal, left-wing, and politically correct, but where the writers are heading with this is still some sort of enigma to me. At first glance, ""The Hunt"" wants to demonstrate how PC-cultural has the ability to be its own antithesis, with violence as results. But at the same time, could it be that easy? Lindelof is a genius writer if you ask me, and maybe the whole idea is to showcase what humans are capable of, and that violence can be committed by all people, no matter background, political beliefs, etcetera. If ""The Hunt"" was made to spark a discussion they made it, but the discussions will be based on a film that seemingly aimed for much more but ended up with too heavy focus on the slasher elements, rather than the satire and political insinuations.",The Hunt
175,HadiAriyan07,So What Was The Point of This?! Are We Making MAGA Deplorables Look Good?!,3,27 March 2020,"From filmmaking standpoint Blumhouse's The Hunt is decent from cinematography, editing, music, action scenes, choreography and the acting all was decent. But from story, script, dialog and message it's just bad and sometimes unwatchable. The story and script is just bad and not funny and even if you take the story and the script as a ""comedy"" it's not funny. From a message and the general meaning of the movie is MAGA Deplorables are actually decent people it's just different opinions ok! and if you really focus on the Deplorables you will see the characters for how they really are but you have to focus real hard because the characterization in the script is so weak on the MAGA people but strong on the ""Liberals"" side, strong in a way that all of them are stereotypical woke very sensitive paper thin people wich make this in the end a ""MAGA Movie"" that is filled by dog whistling to other Deplorables.

182,perica-43151,Fun and plothole filled,7,17 April 2020,"This movie does not take itself too seriously, and has in your face humor with zero subtlety. Shabby work shows, in particular, let me point out something that will surely be missed/lost in translation, but is in turn pretty hilarious. Movie is supposed to happen in Croatia, and tries to use the appropriate language, but fails miserably. ""This end up"" sign on a box becomes ""ovde zavrsiti"" which actually means ""finish here"", did they rely on google translate or on some local illiterate? Having a Croatian plate under US plate makes no sense, as you can drive using foreign plates in other countries. Yet when asked where does she think she is, the main character replies ""judging by the plates and the accents, Bosnia? Serbia? Croatia?"" How did the character associate a plate indicating he precise country with the whole region, makes zero sense. Most likely, the lazy writers did not want her to guess all at once as that might
seem unconvincing, but then threw in a line that makes 0 sense.While such mistakes reveal poor attention to detail, acting is fine, movie is fun to watch if over the top, and the story, while far fetched, makes some sense, both on metaphorical and literal levels, though organizing a hunt where prey is likely to kill you serves little purpose, except if film maker wanted to point out the arrogance of the liberal elites which was in this case not too effective. The movie just does not take itself too seriously. It is not a horror movie, but a cartoonish satire aimed at political divisions in USA and internet culture. One side is painted as unsophisticated, while the other receives even harsher, if well deserved treatment. While the movie tries to punch both sides South Park style, looking from the outside it seems that liberal elites get a far more potent deconstruction, showing just how really des picable and hypocri tical they are, and their mastermind is played by none other than actress by the name of Hillary itself.",The Hunt
183,eelen-seth,Not worth all the fuss - intoscreens.com,4,21 March 2020,"Pushed back from its September 27 release date last year, without any real reason given by Universal Pictures and Blumhouse, 'The Hunt' finally finds an audience on VOD after a limited theatrical release - due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting it as ""the most talked movie of the year that no one's actually seen"" is a bit of a stretch, as a lot of people actually have never seen an ad for it in the first place. Unfortunately, Craig Zobel's (Z For Zachariah) newest feature isn't worth all the fuss to begin with.What looks like as if it could've been an obvious sequel to continue 'The Purge'-franchise, turns out to be a bit more clever, tongue-in-cheek and almost satirical when it comes to its ambiguous political commentary, but is done in a kind of very cheap looking and plotwise messy way. Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don't know where they are, or how they got there. They don't know they've been chosen - for a very specific purpose - The Hunt. Everyone's heard of it, but what was thought to be a myth, is actually something that's real. Normal people being hunted by the rich, but nothing is exactly what it seems, when the real reasoning behind it all rises to the surface with Southern femme fatale Crystal (GLOW's very own Betty Gilpin) headed towards the organiser's manor.Written by Nick Cuse (The Leftovers) and Damon Lindelof (HBO's 'Watchmen'), the film seems to have some sort of message but surprisingly never choses a side when it comes to political or social stands. It tries to please too many different POV's and thus kind of feels like a lost opportunity when just using gory kills for shock value. Why not go full out and really shock audiences? What the filmmakers really excel in, is their way of introducing and following certain characters in the first half hour to then just killing them off. Don't root too hard for your favourite actors, they probably won't even make it past the first 30 minutes. Wild is an understatement when victims get blown up because of their skin colour or just because they make a dumb decision. Or as caucasian gas station owners/couple Ma and Pop (played by Amy Madigan and Reed Birney) say, ""We really are the worst"".Cinematically paralleled kitchen fight sequence between big chief Athena (Hilary Swank) and Crystal, looks like the extended opening of Kill Bill Vol. 1's fight between Uma Thurman and Vivica A. Fox, which is one of the highlights of the film. With only a 90 minute running time, the film flies by, but is as forgettable as last week's episode of 'Neighbours'. Great for streaming, but definitely not worth a visit to the cinema - perfect for an afternoon of self-isolation in these daring times and to escape to a world where people roam free, even if they're being hunted for expressing their racy opinions on social media.",The Hunt

And, who doesn't like a good slasher/shoot-em-up film, right? Then they give us the back story. The killers were all powerful executives who liked to joke about murdering regular folks during their weekend getaways. Their files get hacked, it all comes to light. And, they lose their fancy jobs when folks believe they were serious. So, what do they do? They actually start doing the murderous hunts that they were joking about. The back story completely killed it. Now they're just misunderstood rich people who liked to joke about killing Average Joe's/Jane's and we're supposed to feel sympathy for them. Epic fail!

There are some fun twists along the way and it keeps you guessing as to who you can trust. The film is smart and it has a lot to say about both sides of American politics, without really choosing a side itself, which definitely works in its favour.

192,Svenstadt,"Fairly well put together, but offensive as hell!",8,27 June 2020,"This was a fairly entertaining movie with a high production value. Now, the question becomes one of taste. Although there's plenty of political jabs throughout the movie, plenty of references, I still think this movie falls under the weight of its own tension, which gets too thick at times. The only overarching motif in this entire story is: malice aforethought. Although there isn't any one joke or anything that goes too far, it is the tone of the entire movie that shocks. I mean, this isn't a bunch of people at a coffee shop sniping at one another over tea. I think this was banned for good reason, because it completely removes its social responsibility from the equation. There are some good parts, like the protagonist who has a dry wit. Then there is Ethan Suplee's character, whose fate is left hanging in the wind. This is all cleverly put together in a package that sometimes moves a little too fast for me. One might even call the plot a little too simplistic. The good news is that it never claims to be more than it is. There wasn't much depth to the protagonist, which was a let-down. The predictable protagonist-wins scenario was spoiled in this, I felt. There were plenty of twists and turns, making it hard to see where things were going. For those who like the gore, there's plenty. Not quite a horror film, but the collage of genres works as a whole.",The Hunt

Everyone else has limited time in their roles but they still shine at times.There isn't really any downtime. It is short, sweet and to the point.

The cast is pretty heavy on familiar actors, and one very familiar hard country guitarist, Sturgill Simpson playing a wannabe black dimwitted white dude. Sturgill does his part pretty well, though he's a musician rather than an actor. He might just break into film after this.

I really liked how the filmmakers played around with the concepts of our current political zeitgeist, and its a lot of fun to see how they play with it, and provide a satiric commentary in the movie, targeting both sides. Both sides take hits, and also learn they have misconceptions about the other, and gain a newfound respect for their ""enemy"". A rare horror gem with wit, satire, smarts, and fun at the same time. The ending I absolutely loved, and thought it was exactly how it should have been.",The Hunt

203,just_in_case,I thought it was awesome and I don't say that often.,9,22 March 2020,"It makes me sad that they held off on releasing this because of politics. It was perfectly fine as far as politics go. In fact, I think, no matter what side you're on, it had a message for you. I don't state that as ""it shows both sides"". It actually gets to the root of the problem. I don't want to spoil the film, just want to say if you're sitting on the fence because of politics don't worry it's not going to be a problem, you'll like this.I don't like beating around the bush describing the plot, its pretty clear in the synopsis. Betty Gilpin is...awesome. On so many levels. She channels Nick Cage Circa ""Raising Arizona"" and it is..indescribable. She doesn't carry the movie, she drags it, kicking and screaming, and in the end I was thankful. I want to go watch everything else shes done now.Hilary Swank as her antagonist is worth mentioning. While not quite as enrapturing, she was pretty great too. The problem is that I had this weird random thought that Gena davis would have fit the role better and it kinda ruined it for me. Go watch ""The long kiss goodnight"" after this and you'll see where I'm coming from. Regardless Betty Gilpin was great, Hilary swank was great, Glenn Howerton was great, the movie was great.

204,cwade22,Betty gilpin was great!,9,21 July 2021,"At first i thought this was a liberal orgy of killing trump voters. I watched it and felt it was fairly even. The ones who died were dumb on both sides. The final fight was hilarious. Betty Gilpin's facial expressions were fascinating and a clever idea. I loved it. I loved her character. Honestly, I've seen her in a few other things, mainly Tv Series and always had a crush on her characters. This was a great role for Her. In reality, i think she and most of the cast are liberals but wow! She was great.Hearing the liberals say the cliche things was annoying because it happens and people are like that. I live in los angeles and see tons of rich white liberal snobs with their Annoying yapper dogs(like how athena had except smaller and dumber) and they litter all over, cant park inside their lines, cant put grocery carts back! Just the dumbest, most inconsiderate types. The snobs reminded me of many people i see in this city. Not the liberals who work 2-3 jobs or have 2-3 roommates to pay for a trashy 1 bedroom apartment, but the rich liberals who live in these cheap quality over priced apartments, driving porsches and audis and even lambourghini and Ferrari. My rent for my cheap quality constructed one bedroom is 2460/month! My bathroom ceiling leaks EVERY DAY! Appliances are the cheapest quality and neighbors are the worst! Best option is to move to a red state and enjoy lower taxes. Sad but true. Anyway, Many liberals say exactly the same things the characters said and it's sad. There are idiots on both sides which is why im a registered democrat, half black dude who voted for trump in both elections and hope he wins 2024, and i hate both political parties. It's like that.Wow! Not sure why i typed that but liberals annoy me as rent/taxes/homelessness and crime keep rising in democrat states, cities. Why cant liberals hold accountable democrat politicians? Why cant they care about why dems control california and we pay a water, gas, carbon tax and smog check?! What!! They dont force these dumb climate change taxes in red states which is why you can buy a house and thrive in red states financially, but dem states everybody goes broke paying useless environmental taxes, families keep moving into apartment complexes. If only liberals could go after democrats as they do trump and repubs, we'd have better things. Same can be said about Republicans holding repubs accountable. America really needs a 3 party system to function. When dems and repubs are lazy and blame each other for inaction, the third party can be like ""eh, i'll be the grownup and do the work you losers failed to do"" and break the STALEMATE! Supreme court needs 9 to function. If they have 8, they cant function. Same should be with political parties.Anyway, Betty Gilpin's character was cute with the facial expressions and her confidence with everything. That was great. And when she saw her stomach wound, i knew she would grab the torch! I looked away. Great film! The writing was clever to make it mostly fair sided. Initially when i heard of this film, i thought it was arrogant liberal orgy fest but I watched it! It's inclusive for all sides. Cliche's to the max but it works.",The Hunt
205,tresm87,A brutal blast of an action packed political/class satire that rips apart both sides of the spectrum in bloodshed and hilarity.,8,13 March 2020,I think after the initial delay of this film in September last year this was misjudged by its violent trailer and some associated it with some violence in the news. Well now that it finally came out people are going to realize it goes after both political sides with razor sharp wit and intensity and the slaughtering doesn't discriminate. It's actually a very clever and accurate reflection of our Insane social/political climate these days full of extreme beliefs and opinions.The story itself may not be the most innovative as we've seen this human hunt concept sort of thing in other films before but it works well with its premise and mixture of satirical comedy. It's a fast paced film that really never lets up. The action and brutality comes in bunches and is actually way more than I thought form the trailer. You also get your twists and turns that keep you intrigued with the plot. As everything comes to a head we get a very visceral showdown with a fantastic ending that many will not see coming.The cast is all very expendable other than Betty Gilpin which is phenomenal in this and blew me away. Everyone else is fine in their specific roles and the dialogue is surprising and sharp as a tack. Overall you won't know what you're getting until you actually see this for yourself and shape your own opinion . I for one thought it was extremely solid.,The Hunt

209,julieshotmail,Cheesy satire,5,17 October 2020,"MAGA supporters are offended by this movie because they are the Hunted who deserve to be hunted, however it's really the ""liberal elites"" that are being made fun of - their hypocrisy on gun control and veganism, etc. The topic of the satire will not age well. However, look past all that and you have a decently-made action thriller led by Betty Gilpin (she's like an older Villanelle!). This movie could have been her breakthrough vehicle making her a household name with future action hero roles to come, unfortunately mass shootings and the pandemic did not work in her favor, so this is reduced to a $2.99 rental on Amazon Prime and I had to double-check if her name is Betsy or Betty. Quite unfortunate really; she could've been Charlize Theron-big. The fight scene at the end was fun, reminiscent of Hillary Swank in the serious ""Million Dollar Baby"" where she exhibited some boxing skills. Sixteen years later though, she is still nimble and convincing, but just got very skinny. Looking impressive at 46!",The Hunt
210,punisherversion1,A facebook comment section come to life,6,30 March 2020,"The Hunt
Directed by Craig Zobel. Written by Damon Lindelof and Nick Cuse
The Hunt is a quite infamous movie. Perhaps you may have heard of it. It was originally supposed to be released in September but was delayed due to a pair of mass shootings and a huge misunderstanding about what the movie was actually about. Trust me this continues to this day. I saw a ton of people who had no idea what this movie was truly about and got a special kind of MAGA defensive about it. Let me let you in on a little secret.The movie is about a group of rich elite liberals kidnapping and hunting down typically conservative types. There is a bit more to it than that. This is the general basic outline of what transpires but it is not the entirety of the film. There are no real good guys. Betty Gilpin seems like a cypher. She doesn't lean to the degrees that the rest of the characters do. They are the worst of the worst when it comes to the kinds of extreme conservative you find online. You got your Alex Jones types, you got your Kent State gun girl types, you got your faux military types and you got your gun nuts. But don't let that deter you oh faithful Constitutionalists. They get at those pesky liberals too. They get those overly sensitive political correct junkies. They get those cause of the week types. It is like a New York Times comment section come to life.Once you realize that these people are cartoons, you realize that it's making fun of everybody who thinks in these extreme ideologies. But it's not just that. That is just window dressing to make us swallow another version of The Most Dangerous Game. The plot is nothing to write home about. Like I mentioned a mere sentence ago, this is just The Most Dangerous Game all over again.I will say on the positive side this is an incredibly well made movie. Craig Zobel is a very talented filmmaker. Compliance was chilling to the core. It made you question humanity and feel disgust. The worst part is it was based on a true story. The Hunt executes the bait and switch in the beginning very well. It makes you think this character is the lead when everyone is expendable. This is the sign of a good horror flick.Also that fight scene between Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank is top notch. The way it was choreographed was creative and fun. It will remind you of that kitchen fight in Kill Bill. It's not quite that good but it is certainly on par with that one. This is a lean, brisk flick. It moves with a purpose and there is no fat on this one. It is certainly worth a watch even though it is a bit of a mixed bag. The controversy though was entirely unwarranted but also not surprising. Outrage culture is certainly a thing. Check it out. I give this one a C.",The Hunt

215,Brevin_Campbell,The Hunt has no chill,7,25 April 2020,"The Hunt film is a ""Hunger Games"" esque political comedy in which a bunch of liberal elite attempt to round up the conservative degenerates to try and kill them off in a game. And so from this idea we get the feeling that this film is one that won't be holding back on what it is trying to say about our current political landscape.From the start of the film the movie begins murdering off a slew of characters one by one as you try to figure out who are the main characters of the story. In this murder spree you get a sense that this is a comedy as many of the deaths are very over the top and comedic. A lot of time is spent making fun of the conservative mindset in this sequence as many character rally together to try and protect themselves. These scenes are also used to set up the world we are in and who are our antagonist going to be.Despite the scenes of making fun of the conservative party the film also does a lot to make fun of the liberal party and their innate hypocrisy. These are rich progressives who only act for these causes when they feel like it would benefit them in some way, but in reality they don't really care for the causes. There are many scenes within this film that defiantly feel like they are leaning right into the more pro-conservative camp than the liberal one. And by doing this the film forces the liberal party to look out their own innate problems that they have.However this is still a Damon Lindeloff who has just finished of the exceptional ""Watchmen"" show based on the amazing graphic novel. The Watchmen show was a very liberal leaning show, and you can still see a lot of those liberal ideas being formed in the female protagonist introduced played by Betty Gilpin. While this character does side with the conservative faction we do get many scenes showing that she has many more of the traits that are given to female heroes on the left. She doesn't show the hate to the muslim faction that her conservative friends do, and she seems to not take crap from her more oppressive male counterparts. She comes off as a Sarah Conner or a female John Wick type of character. She shows that she only has one passion and that is violence.The film does have a myriad of problems. There are many questions raised throughout the movie especially with Betty Gilpin's character and her sidekick. Betty's character doesn't really give us a lot of insight to what is going on in her head. She doesn't come with a lot answers about her past. And when her sidekick seemingly betrays her we don't really get a direct answer if he really did or not, but neither of these questions match the very strange and unorthodox ending we get that really only acts to confuse the viewer even more to what is going on here.In conclusion ""The Hunt"" isn't a perfect film, but it is a solid and fun movie with tons of violence, and a fun twisted look at the conservative and liberal parties that could act as a warning of a very real future that could happen if we don't change our way of thinking.",The Hunt
216,garethvk,Not Exactly What You May Think,5,11 March 2020,"The new film ""The Hunt"" has arrived after being delayed due to world events and controversy over the films content and themes.The film involves a group of people who wake up gagged in a field and soon find themselves being hunted by a group of unknown individuals.
After a bloody and brutal initial encounter; the remaining individuals head out into the surrounding area and soon becomes a situation with far more questions than answers.One of the Hunted is Crystal (Betty Gilpin) deduces that things are much more complex then they seem and things take a turn in a new direction.
At this point in the film I was thinking that it was lacking any real tension or suspense as the characters were not overly developed and it made investing in their outcome difficult. The film then changes direction and looks at events of the past and also explains more about the Hunters and their motivations which is somewhat unexpected.The film is a very difficult one to review as people will expect it to be an Action/Suspense film based on the trailers. That is really just a small part of the story which is actually closer to a Dark Comedy with heavy political overtones.Those overtones are likely to be very controversial and may put people off from seeing the film. During my post-screening comments I said that I am going to need some time to wrap my head around this film as to if I liked it or not. It is easy to dismiss it as propaganda but it is an interesting hybrid that regardless of where you stand; does make you think.2.5 stars out of 5",The Hunt
217,chrisrowexxx,Ignore the strange USA reviews.,10,28 March 2020,"I'm British and although our country can be a mess I don't get the whole USA class system or moral values, this film was delayed after real life tragedies. However all I see when I see those stories is idiots running a country allowing guns, people cannot be trusted as proven constantly, it worries me this being delayed like it somehow is an accurate representation of a culture, if so USA are doomed, anyway enough politics.So the film, it was an absolute joy to watch, although I'd position it as a horror comedy myself, as if not intentional there were some good laughs, characters were great and famous people dying early was a welcome throw off. The script and mini twists were fun, it seemed extremely refreshing for a genre that's lacked creativity and focused on revenge or straight up cliche horror thrillers. Some messages go over my head with the right wing left wing stuff but I can't honestly get why people are looking deep at this film, it's daft fun, clever and flies by. I couldn't stand the lead in GLOW thought she was abysmal but she was outstanding here, mannerisms and cold emotionless delivery mixed with bits of genuine emotion were balanced perfectly, she was just awesome, I'd borderline this as an iconic performance if this got a cult status.The only downer is maybe the insistence yet again on woman goodie vs woman baddy, think all that's getting ridiculous in general however it worked well here, arguably the best female fight scene for years. For me a role is for who's best, man or woman, casting worked great, dynamic was good, two ladies stole the show and gilpin could be the ultimate final girl. Emma Roberts cameo was probably the most surprised I'd been for ages.

225,Criticalstaff,Nice premise but bland execution.,6,18 June 2020,"The appeal of this movie is in its premise. Modern politics being the epitome of divisiveness there are not a lot of works that dare 1) touch it and 2) do it in such a manner that is satisfying and justified.Larry David used the MAGA hats as a punchline, but did not really address it. Space Force is built on showing the chaos of the current administration but is rather toothless. The Hunt is built on Qanon meets the Hunger Games. What if the liberal elite did actually hunt down deplorable Trump supporters?
This lead the film to become an action movie, with the characters, except for both Hilary Swank and Betty Gilpin, turning slowly but surely into caricatures of Republicans and Democrats.The execution of this movie, the translation of the premise into something meaningful fails. The political commentary is too jumbled and lazy to have any weight. The action/horror journey of the hero is not that unique or interesting. If you take away the politics, she is just trying to survive this convoluted situation, and her approach is mainly to remain calm, focused and not to engage with the political arguments. The movie sets up this premise but it does not let its main protagonist be involved with it. Ultimately, the choice of having an apolitical protagonist, which the writers thought would absolve them from being biased or partisan, leads to a character who is outside the story.The movie is not devoid of technical competency. As a thriller, it is captivating and the various set pieces are somewhat clever. Visually it is more mature and engaging that the Hunger Games. On the same note, the acting is great and there are many good comedic actors, and you get a sense that the movie started more as an outright comedy. The Hunt is ironic rather than fun. But mostly the film goes for a dramatic tone.Modern political discourse is very passionate, and sometimes brutal/violent. It invites a response or commentary. It invites an equally strong response to the violence of its message. The problem is not so much what do you say, which side you are on, but rather how do you say it. The Hunt for all its irony and humour does not really emit an opinion/message. Instead, its confusion might go against its assumed pro-liberal stance. The liberals are all judgmental and sadistic. They have all the characteristics of villains. They are vapid, hypocrites, and on top of that they are incompetent. The right-wingers are merely victims, who appear to be right about their wild hate-filled conspiracy theories: the Hunt is real, the migrants are crisis actor, the text chain at the beginning is never explained. Not only that but the Deplorables appear as compassionate because they help each other, they are the characters the audience roots for.

Also, it gets completely unoriginal and then tries to win us over by throwing cliche plot twists that we saw coming, or dumb flashbacks that really weren't necessary with a rushed third act, the only reason why it lasts any longer than it already does is the fighting scene, which was pretty awesome and reminded me of a Kill Bill vs Black Mamba scene, it's really one of the ode films where Once you think you figure out the type of route it's going for, it goes the complete other way, it loses you, it's one of those films where you find a lot you like but there's just as much that you didn't like.",The Hunt

And why do all the bad guys immediately expose themselves as bad guys when trying to blend in.
But ignoring that badly written stuff there is a movie in here somewhere a poorly directed and paced movie with really random stuff happening that kills characters a bit too fast for my taste but still has kills and decently made action so I'll give it 4 for that because I suppose it's guilty pleasure generic horror stuff.
The reason I'm giving it the exact score id give any b rate sci fi movie like sharktopus for example when this movies production is very much superior in every single way is because the comedy is just not funny apart from the odd line by the main character and it feels like they wrote it to be funny and put a lot of effort thinking about it unlike sharktopus which is just funny and effective with barely any effort it's not good by any means.
This review has gone off the rails a bit sorry about that I was trying to be informative but whatever I'll summarize.
This movie is not funny, not good has a few fun scenes but what makes a horror comedy movie and especially a thriller is the writing which is so poor I couldn't even laugh at how bad it was it's that next level bad.

236,gregoryroman-88635,Almost a Really Good Movie,5,19 April 2020,"There were some decent aspects to this movie from a purely entertainment perspective, but by and large it felt a bit rushed, and too many of the ""hunted"" were dead within the first 10-15 minutes. Also didn't get the final scene where Gilpen & Swank spend 20 minutes kicking the crap out of each other.

239,RetroRick,insightful critique of the political divide & elite values by those with elite values,7,14 June 2020,"Pretty good & entertaining satirical take on the modern post- Clinton-Trump election political divide, played out on a rather familiar action-horror set-up. That's to say the set up isn't original but the take, & the ultimate rationale, is. While the film does a fair job of caricaturing both liberal elites & ""ignorant"" ordinary americans they may surprise, the message we get at the end of the film is that our fears - at least when they become incarnated in certain types of theory about the people at the top - may be to an extent self-fulfilling. Is that true? Maybe in part but with respect to the one of the main dynamics of the story, I don't recall elite conspiracy theories (true or otherwise) ever having got any one into actual trouble. What they actually tend to do is to serve to confirm people's existing biases. While the film partly acknowledges this, it's self-critique is ultimately limited for this reason, something reflected in the final assertion of innocence at the point of the final showdown with the villain of the piece: liberal elites are bad, but conspiracy theorists.....well, they kind of deserve their fate here, and that's one of the reasons, that there's little sympathy on show for most of the 'victims' on show here. Indeed, in purely causal terms, the denouement shows us that the elite are the victims, de-humanised in self-defence.The best part of this film though, apart from the lead actress, who is very good in her role, is the satirising of liberal elite attitudes, the capacity to simultaneously show unstinting compassion for minorities & political correctness, at the same time as a considerable capacity for aggression towards anyone who offends against their values.Ultimately though, this is self-criticism. The makers of this film, are liberals themselves, critiquing themselves while extending limited compassion to those who offend against our new shared values. This is even reflected in the fact that protagonists are both female and feature in the film as hard as nails action stars while the males are all entirely dispensable & generally pretty negligible quantities.Pretty unobjectionable good fun overall though",The Hunt
240,catdogmanfish,So many missed opportunities,4,14 July 2021,"Is this a liberal movie making fun of conservatives? A conservative movie preaching the danger of liberals? Does it really matter? This movie could have been really good, but it just reeks of misdirection and bad writing. First of all, why even have the political commentary running through the film? Lose it, it just bogs the movie down and when someone is shooting at you what does it matter what their or your political ideology is? People don't talk like the people in this film. It's like the writer of this film watched a political satire movie or show and took notes on what the characters say. There are brief moments where something clever is done with the filmmaking but it is quickly followed by a terrible scene with choppy dialogue or a lazy shot. I've been waiting for ages for a good modern adaptation of the Most Dangerous Game, guess I have to wait longer.",The Hunt
241,MK_Ultra_,The jokes on everyone.,9,26 March 2020,"This just in, this films message is purely, and sadly missed by many---and that's the irony in all of our lives. We are all missing the point as we go to our proverbial corners... regardless if we are looking for truth or burying our head in the sand.This film starts in what appears to be a standardized ""Purge"" film...but something feels quite different if you peel back a layer during the late first act, which is purposely trying to project with it's over the top level of gratuitous violence. It's actually kind of a fun romp if take it for what it actually is; the table setter for a bigger picture.I knew little about it coming in---purposely---first hearing about it on a news blurb of a Trump rally mention...and knew something was up or something was done to put a party or class of citizen in a bad light, or the satire was missed...or, what ended up being a combination of. Seems comrade Trump was picking the wrong battle, once again---hence delaying and ultimately leading to its ""straight to VOD"" release (and can understand some of the risk with a theater release in the real time and with the political climate that exists)
I can also understand because it comes across as something it isn't...this is satirizing itself, us, all sides, all corners, all classes and what we come away with is a masterful look as just how vulnerable we all are to our own actions and thoughts.The missed points seal that deal.Watch this twice.

I liked it a lot, very funny in the opening (not the opening airplane scene) but the scene with people in the open field mouths gagged and the old store scene with actress Amy Madigan as Ma and Reed as Pa. Very funny and nicely done. The lead actress, Betty Gilpin is great. I like to women heroes and Betty looks good in the role and she is hot too.Over all this movie idea is a taken from the action film, ""Hard Target"" starring Jean C.

244,josenelias,Far from the potential.,5,21 March 2020,There's a funny idea in the movie where the role of the hunters and the hunted is inverted in terms of ideology. This could have been the funniest part of the movie. Unfortunately it's not an explored and developed idea. I'm imagining the hunters almost unable to communicate due to the political correct speech and constant admonishment for he use of several words. There was a hint of this but not enough. The movie feels like a miss opportunity and an excuse to play on gratuitous violence and a couple of jokes.,The Hunt

Its a satirical political Battle Royale style movie.
Its amusing without trying to hard to be funny but it keeps you well engaged with a story twisting and turning in front of you. Acting is top notch and
a big thumbs up to Betty Gilpin for a leading performance.
The Hunt is a really entertaining, light hearted thriller that will leave you wanting more.

247,terrencepatrix,The message...stop trying to find a message in everything!,6,20 March 2020,"This movie was written to basically call everyone an idiot if they base their whole lives around politically based ideological garbage. It's saying that regardless of being far right or far left you're still basically the same breed of moron and that it's the people living in the middle, who are actually trudging away just living our lives, are the actual badasses. Well not me specifically, but the general ""we"". The people who ignore the extremes of politics and just get things done. This movie portrays that in the least subtle way possible and I thought it was pretty hilarious.There is almost no plot to this movie, which I'm sure will turn people off, but that's honestly what I liked about it because as commentary it speaks to political discourse that we see every day. It's all crap on both sides. Just buzz words and stupid conspiracy theories with both sides trying to paint each other into a box with very specific ideologies. Then we have the protagonist, a woman we know nothing about, nothing is ever explained about her, and she just takes over everything. It's all a very hamfisted analogy for modern society but I thought it was hilarious.The plot is dumb, the characters are disposable, you never know what's going to happen next, everyone is insulted by the end, and Betty Gilpin does a hilarious job of just being bizarre. She also shows off some of her skills she's developed from starring on GLOW and her body is crazy tight in this. This is overall just a silly, ridiculous, popcorn flick with gratuitous violence...which is exactly what we need in an overly charged political era. It's a 6 because it's no masterpiece or anything, but it's plenty enjoyable.",The Hunt

250,FixedYourEnding,Great watch but I wish it was a little bit more serious,7,30 March 2020,"To the credit of the writers of ""The Hunt"" manages to escape the mold of your average man-hunter movies and surprises you with sudden twist that you, the viewer do not expect. At the beginning we see an attractive girl, you figure she is the hero- no she isn't, she gets killed etc etc. The hero protagonist is actually Crystal (Betty Gilpin) and she is absolutely wonderful in that role. Hilary Swank appears towards the end of the movie as Athena and doing a great job as well.Some people find the whole premise of the movie as funny. I personally prefer movies to be on the more serious side, with the occasional joke serving as an ice-breaker. The whole president vs the elite idea didn't really do it for me, but the movie was still enjoyable. I wish, however, that the ending was different. The character of Crystal is ex-military, smart and brutal, but I preferred she would be smart enough not to kill Don, the manipulation by Athena was obvious.
I wouldn't mind him helping her in the last scene. Yes, he is white, kinda old, slow and not too smart but that doesn't mean he cannot help the protagonist (meaning he can still serve a positive part in society) the shot could easily be a fake to fool Athena (and the audience) but well... a missed opportunity.Overall this movie is better than average. It is very gory even if it's on the humerus side (grenades exploding bodies etc) you should still keep the kids away. Exact score: 67 / 100",The Hunt

I have not been this entertained by a movie in a long time.Originally scheduled for release late last year, due to media spin about a movie most of the complainers hadn't seen, Blumhouse Productions delayed the release, while they waged a quiet counter-campaign.They were right, to do so. This movie IS NOT what the hue-and-cry suggested it is. To be sure, ""The Hunt""is about political leftists hunting political conservatives (aka: ""Deplorables"") for sport, but this is satire; tightly scripted, brilliantly executed, and with every trace of polemics themselves lampooned for dark...very dark...laughs.""The Hunt"" is above all funny. If you have the sense of humor for it. It is also grisly; filled with flying body parts and graphic violence worthy of the horror movies Blumhouse is rapidly becoming famous for. But all of that is in service to political satire from which no point on the spectrum escapes unsoiled.Best of all is the direction. Delightful twist follows carefully delivered surprise again and again. And just when I though I had the algorithm figured out, Director Craig Zobel gently pulls the rug, and I laugh at myself for thinking I could anticipate any of it.""The Hunt"" is rated ""R"", and it earns it. As I said, the violence is graphic and real. The language is as legitimate as angry people arguing for their lives, and their beliefs.I would not say that the movie gains any special benefit from being seen in a theater, but I have a feeling this film is going to be a HUGE hit, and if you wait for a home release, you may experience people spoiling it for you. At the very least, you will be an outsider, listening to people rave about ""The Hunt"".I give it nine stars.Nine very shiny stars.",The Hunt

They try and add some dark humor elements but none of that matters because it falls apart because it's so utterly unbelievable. I mean the premise of the idea is always unbelievable to begin with but this one isn't good.Here's why it doesn't work.-It's entirely unbelievable from top to bottom- Game, set, match.This is the single biggest killer. If you watch another movie that's done the premise better like Surviving the Game it at least remotely possible even as remote as it might be and it's better acted.The graphic violence here doesn't really add anything to this. Adding dark humor combined with the graphic violence leaves it seeming less political and more like a campy b grade horror comedy film. The plot works in a darker grittier film but here it just comes off as silly. If I want silly humor then I'll watch Shaun of the Dead.Now I have nothing against attempting to do a horror/comedy/satire. Rideshare is a movie that did a good job of it. It didn't try and be more than it was. The Most Dangerous Game works in theory if you look at the loose plot outline, but movies like The Thinning carry a political element to it better without rehashing as much of a rehashed story.It doesn't help that the end is also formulaic and predictable.If you want The Most Dangerous Game watch Surviving the Game, it's at least remotely believable and better acted. If you want some sort of humor with a hint of social commentary disguised as a horror watch Rideshare. 2003's version Texas Chainsaw Massacre combines humor, violence and horror better if you want more violence. If you want a darker take on political thought without all the b grade horror campiness watch The Thinning or The White King.",The Hunt

286,Instant_Palmer,Polarizing & Mordant Satire - A Like-It or Hate-It Film,7,31 March 2020,"'The Hunt' tries hard to please, and it succeeds at providing some very cleaver moments throughout the film. For the low dollars invested, this Tarantino-ish production delivers a good ROI for the audience.Lead actress Betty Gilpin carries the film over the finish line merging excellent girl-power action skills with a laconic-droll comedic performance.A competent supporting cast make their contributions before their inevitable demise takes them out of the picture.Looks at first to be heading towards a political agenda, the film quickly makes its true intent clear on such - it satirizes today's hyper-sensitive, and highly polarized and opinionated right vs left social-media/blogging environment.There is thankfully really no in-your-face thought-provoking messaging involved here...just an effort in having some fun, supported by a witty script and direction/editing that keeps the film moving at just the right pace.Be advised, this film is WAY too violent, gory, and inappropriate for children.The film grows on you mostly due to Gilpin's performance, but the screenplay deserves applause too.Overall, I liked this film a lot more than I anticipated I would.Give this film at least 30 minutes before making the call to continue or not.",The Hunt
287,heatherlynn19862005,Surprisingly Great.,10,11 June 2020,"Don't watch this if you can't handle fun, a serious amount of gore and no nudity.
I did not read about the movie beforehand, my husband said it was simply about people running and being hunted. I expected the whole drama of staying alive. Nope not just that! Satire fun and had my attention the whole time. It has been awhile since I've had a genuine laugh during a movie and this is one of those hunch over laugh types. Really surprised me and the main characters facial expressions had me rolling. A+",The Hunt
288,Her-Excellency,True to the adage: 100% of Americans think 50% of Americans have lost their minds.,9,21 March 2020,"Much more enjoyable than expected.The beginning of it is funny enough, but it is the ensuing few scenes which are riotously HILARIOUS and make it worth watching- I literally laughed until I cried.Toward the middle of the film, there is a wide gap where the laugh-out-loud moments are slowed and further and further apart, but still bring a smile or giggle here and there. The ending while good, is overshadowed by a preceding fight scene that is one for the books. It was really, really well done.The best part of the entire movie though, and what makes it stand out, is that if a person watching has more than two brain cells, the dialogue is spot-on close-to-perfect in mocking BOTH SIDES of the political divide. And here, is what I think people are missing: NEITHER side is depicted as being 'better' than the other. Or worse. It has fun at the expense of everyone and it doesn't do it in any overtly mean way, but in a way where we can nod and nod and nod and laugh ... at ourselves ... no matter who we are or where we stand.Lastly, a horror film - it is not. Somewhat gory, yes. A ""horror"" film? no.8.6/10",The Hunt

I couldn't take to the moments of comedy though they put upon us, comedies aren't easy to pull off but Still this film was ok, at times I was having a little fun with and the lead actress Betty Gilpin is as badass as any female character in a film.",The Hunt
292,thomasmitilis1995,WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE I'M HUNTING HUMAN BEINGS AT MY MANOR?,6,5 June 2020,"PROS:
~The film is a satire that includes both sides of the political spectrum. It points out how extreme some people can be with their ideologies. The commentary about the internet trolls and the conspiracy theories are on point.
~The stronger political comment of the film is about a specific group of liberals who are the supposed villains of the movie. There are many people (mainly wealthy) who constantly talk about the the poor and the minorities with such a passion but in reality they do nothing. They are the same people who are the most passionate supporters of the woke culture but at the same time they demonstrate their privileges whenever they have the chance. The flashback conversation is an indicative example of these behaviors (the comment about the black dude is perfect). Other examples of this pretentiousness is the dialogue between the old couple in the store or the scene where the elite hunters are all together. The dialogue in these scenes is on the nose and cheesy but that's the point of a satire.
~Betty Gilpin is awesome as the main protagonist. She is a badass , her comedic timing is on point and her facial expressions are perfect.
~Apart from the political messages, the movie works as a guilty pleasure and doesn't take itself very seriously. There is a lot of gore and brutality. The blowup of the characters of Roberts and Hartwell is creative and the disorientation about the protagonist is interesting.
~The film makes some bold decisions about the fate of some recognisable actors. The first act is so entertaining and you have no idea who is going to live or die. As a result Emma Roberts, Iken Barinholtz and Justin Hartley is among the most familiar names that have an unexpected end.
~The fight in the end is well choreographed and the wide shots make it more effective.CONS:
~There is obviously a hesitation from the filmmakers to cross the line in some parts. The film is too safe in its attempt not to offend anyone and makes general comments. The film should be edgier and sharper and not take the easy path. The film could have choosen the supposed liberal superiority or the conservative ignorance and sticked with one behavior until the end. It is strange why this film was postponed because there isn't actually a controversy.
~In the final act there is a revelation about the ideology of Gilpin's character. It's a wasted opportunity that the film never explores the reaction of Swank's character and her possible fault about the true beliefs of her opponent.
~It's questionable why the character of Hillary Swank isn't shown until the final act.",The Hunt

You can actually understand the stand the movie is making, specially by not taking itself too serious, which is always a good starting point for a satire.The cast was amazing, as the acting was one of the best aspects of the movie. I loved Betty Gilpin as our protagonist and Hilary Swank as the opposite. The only scene they share together is actually very well made and it served perfectly the satire they are aiming for by shooting for both sides.It's a over the top satire, but to it worked really well in this scenario.",The Hunt

The narrative toys with audiences on who the main protagonist is until star Betty Gilpin makes her entrance in a hilarious and blood soaked sequence. From then on, it's all high octane excitement as the hunted becomes the hunter. Gilpin delivers a magnetic star making turn; her athleticism coupled with a wry acting style makes her what many of today's action movie heroines are called, but are not: Kickass. The introduction of Hilary Swank in a dramatic expository sequence late on in proceedings just kicks up the excitement another notch. The snappy dialogue is smart and knowing; mixed in with the action is loads of black humour. It's not always you get to see a full on fight to the death ending in a discourse on Animal Farm. This is a cracking action film by Blumhouse, who are trying to broaden their productions beyond horror films. An instant cult classic.",The Hunt

299,ksgillihan,It's not about what you think it is.,6,15 March 2020,"Seeing the early outrage for this movie, I expected it to be an anti-Trump or anti-conservative film. It's really not at all that way. The two opposing sides of the coin are both shown to be ridiculous in their extremes. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really seem to have a point. We have a group of conservative people chosen to be hunted like animals but the majority of them are killed off very quickly. The heroine of the story then goes on to kill everyone who was trying to kill all of them. There isn't any character development for her and there also isn't any explanation as to why she can just mow through people like grass. They briefly state that she was a soldier at one point but they don't say anything else. The movie just ends and it left me wondering what the whole point was?

It's completely pointless and divisive. A Disappointing mess from the poorly written script and beyond. Underutilized the best actors. Stupid obvious twists. Stupid unlikable characters. Stupid filmmakers. A waste of talented craftsman's efforts. Just awful with nothing redeeming. It's uneven tonally and has no clue what it wants to be. Every scene and actor plays in a different way. It's not cohesive at all. It's a muddled mess. Near Total fail, where the mediocre technical aspects outweigh and surpass the painfully executed content in every moment. Worse, it's just boring and as it progresses into the third act the exposition shows how little mastery the writer and director have over this art form. It actually starts out with a captivating first scene or two and swan dives into a free fall of hot garbage from which it never recovers.",The Hunt
306,BestBenedikt,"Entertaining and somewhat brave, but ultimately nothing more",6,22 March 2020,"After being delayed due to the controversy it sparked off last year THE HUNT can finally see the light of day now, although it may not be the best timing after all.Let me start off by saying that the excessive satirical approach taken by Craig Zobel's film about people hunting people by reason of their political views is definitely interesting, its biggest positive being the intent to avoid one-sided political preaching. But it's also blatantly obvious that the movie is not as smart as it thinks it is.Just like everything that Damon Lindelof has ever written THE HUNT is heavy-handed and literally beats you over the head with its message. It constantly fires on all cylinders and some of it hits the mark, some doesn't. Despite being expectable, it's still unfortunate that the film is too superficial to have any subversive potential.With that being said, the movie definitely works as pure entertainment, not least because of its tight pacing. And it's most of all nice to see that something like this got made by Hollywood and actually snapped up a theatrical release - even though the film seems to be cursed by now with the current pandemic dooming it to financial failure.",The Hunt
307,lukas-ingel,Satire worth your time !,7,9 October 2020,"The Hunt is a movie which has some serious moments, but is overall pure satire.
So you could imagine my surprise reading professional and non-professional reviews critiquing that The Hunt is nothing but elevated stereotypes.
Excuse me, Sir and Madame... That is quite literally what satire is.The movie follows a very dark, surprising and gory humour. I could imagine that you would have to be into just some of that to enjoy this, since that's about 85% of what you'll get.
The rest is a cleverly written portrayal of a character (Betty Gilpin's) who is unbiased, straight-to-the-point and tired of excuses, both others' and her own - something very refreshing to see when it comes to politically based movies.
As much as The Hunt uses extreme examples to showcase some of the ridiculousness on either political side in America, it boils it down to a character who can bring all of us down to earth and just have a pretty good time!As for why my rating may seem low considering I clearly enjoyed it a lot... Well, it's just that. It's very entertaining and has some of it cleverly written, and I'll probably watch it again with some friends, but it *is* sort of a popcorn movie.
It's not a 10/10 blow-you-away or some extremely well-made, high quality production that will leave you with eye- and eargasms nor a deeply serious movie meant to provoke a lot of serious questions and make you think really hard politically speaking etc.
That's what it seems a lot of people have misunderstood when it comes to it.
The Hunt is a good time worth a bit of your money if you can't catch it somewhere on streaming in the future, and along with the entertainment, it may make you think ""wow okay, maybe we *should* just take a step back from the politics, and watch what we are doing right now"".
Bonus: The way they chose to film the main antagonist throughout the movie, without giving it away, is incredibly effective and serves very well in the end. You'll have to see it for yourself, it's some simple but inspiring filmmaking that shows once again that all that you need in order to build up anticipation and leave a great impact is actually being creative with your framework.",The Hunt

Dark humor comedy poking fun at everybody and anybody, regardless of the political conviction. Superb female lead character who won me over in first 10 minutes - without even being on screen that much! Especially this sends a birdie to disasters like Disney's Star Wars.

319,warren-87235,A Good Mix of Action and Dark Humour,8,22 July 2020,"That a film like this managed to be made in the current political climate, is actually nothing short of amazing. That's not to say it's especially daring, but to even _attempt_ being in the middle, in Hollywood, is dangerous (I'd be surprised if some of the actors don't have difficulty being cast in other major productions going forward, just for daring to sign up to this).To quote Roddy Piper and Keith David in They Live...
""I'm walking a white line - I don't bother nobody, nobody bothers me. You better start doing the same.""
""White lines in the middle of the road. That's the worst place to drive.""At it's heart, this is a familiar story. Elites use working class people for the thrill of the hunt. Just think Jean-Claude Van Damme's 'Hard Target' from '93 (and even then it wasn't an original idea), with a dash of politics.It's not a perfect film, by any means. You have to turn your brain off at some of the logic. For example, if they weren't supposed to get on the train in the first place, why would one of the hunters already be in disguise onboard? There certainly wasn't time for the hunters to have guessed what the hunted individuals would do at that point, let alone be prepared to set themselves up for the ruse. Also, the 'gas station' ruse is flimsy. Even just a simple hint that the hunted were driven in that direction would have helped, but leaving the starting location and taking the correct path appears to be blind luck, despite being an integral part of the hunters' plan.These flaws can somewhat be excused, though, since this _is_ played as a dark comedy, rather than a serious action movie.Betty Gilpin is great as Crystal, the main 'hunted' character, who goes from doing her best to survive, to turning the tables on her hunters. She doesn't shy away from doing to them what they planned to do to her. She knows that if she walks away, chances are her fate will still be the same, just further down the line. That itself is another layer to the character. At one point she could have walked away, potentially escaped and blown the whistle. However, she refuses to be the victim.Hilary Swank is also superb, albeit with less screen time, as the villain of the piece. She plays her cold-hearted character with conviction and no hint of absurdity, which is why it works so well.I've read others complaining that Crystal is a 'Mary Sue', the term used to describe a character who requires no effort, no training, and is immediately good at anything they need to be (The most commonly touted example being Rey in the Star Wars sequel trilogy). On the surface this may seem a fair complaint, but it's all about context. The 'hunted' are meant to be strangers. We do not know _anything_ about their backgrounds, so they may be skilled or unskilled and we can only learn as events progress.Secondly, Crystal only ever appears skilled in combat and survival. There is no hint of abilities beyond that. She doesn't magically know how to fly a plane, or hack a computer. The 'Mary Sue' complaint is more appropriate when used against a character who can out-perform practised experts in _multiple_ areas, without any indication of how they may have gained those skills.However, we do learn a little about Crystal. Our first glimpse implies her survival abilities, as she quickly creates a makeshift compass to orient herself, whilst those around her wander, dazed and confused. Later, she also states to one character that she was in the military and saw active service, even though we never learn to what extent. Given the context of the story, it's more than enough.I've also read complaints about the ending, as though it's a cop-out, implying she was mistakenly brought there. However, the ending is actually quite ambiguous. She may reveal that she was there by mistake, but we are left to wonder if she is merely putting Hilary Swank's Athena off-guard. Later, she confirms the mistake, but it must be remembered that at this point Athena believes, as she lies dying, that she has succeeded in also taking Crystal with her. Crystal could well have maintained the lie, to avoid giving Athena the satisfaction of thinking she had succeeded in killing the last 'deplorable'. Instead, Athena dies believing she has failed in that respect.Either way, Crystal has stolen that satisfaction from the villain in her final moments. It's then up to us, the viewer, to decide if she was telling the truth or not, which is what makes it all the more fun.Overall, the film does feel a little short, as though the creators were a little wary of taking their character portrayals any further. Doing what they did was daring enough, but if the satire had gone any deeper they may have been left without any careers to continue.Essentially, they got away with it by making this more of an 'elites hunt working class, dark-comedy action movie', and leaving the satire as a relatively mild surface layer that all but the most partisan can laugh at. But, as stated, that balancing act is itself an achievement in 2020.All-in-all, if you don't mind some graphic over-the-top violence in a darkly comic context, along with some political and societal satire, then The Hunt is great fun.",The Hunt

The storyline has been done before but nevertheless, quite good anyway.
I liked how they made the hunters out to be a bunch of rich, dumb, spoilt SJW's who couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery yet still thinking they're the worlds elite.
The story did lack depth as it hinged on the hunted going back to the very beginning to find the other hunters just sitting around waiting. Picking most of them off at the beginning of the hunt and arming them didn't make much sense to me. If it was just for target practice, why goto all the bother and if was a hunt, get out there and hunt them, don't just sit in your bunker.

I want more, genre is unimportant.The rest...I'm sad, because of the press it got, I dont think any of the people that need to see this movie will actually see this movie - and those that do, I'm not sure their takeaway will be 'you morons are squabbling over crumbs and petty insults while about forty wealthy families try to cook the world just enough to kill us all'.It's also a bummer, because after lampooning representation, this movie is INCREDIBLY WHITE- and while that's *explainable*, it's still another film finding a way to mostly employ White actors.Anyway, it's pretty good, I think most people will enjoy it, and Betty Gilpin is transcendent.",The Hunt

UNCLE!! ENOUGH ALREADY!!,The Hunt
331,mulcahyj-07545,Expected 1/10 on reading concept which elevates this to 8/10 after viewing. Very enjoyable.,8,16 November 2020,"I came across this movie without any knowledge of it's apperant controversy before release. I just read the basic concept and it didn't sound original at all. But I gave it a chance and after a few minutes picked up a few shocks from the start. I didn't expect them and will reveal nothing here. Even before Betty Gilpin, one of the talented actors that gave me a feeling to give it a chance, you are dragged back and forth as to what to expect for a good quality level. It starts at a gripping pace for me which didn't let up. Some reviewers are not happy at the pace the film goes in the middle section. If it kept up to it's opening scenes the film would have been over after fifteen minutes. It had to present you with a well constructed plot line, which it does very well, or it would have collapsed. But even with the foot of the accelerator there are enough twists and uncertainty of to what was actually going on. It surprised me so many times I had a constant feeling of uneasiness which is very hard to do with the high levels of very dark humour.
The film is obviously meant to not be taken too seriously but also maintains a gripping plot which the makers deserve a lot of credit for. Sometimes films like this blow it approaching and concluding it. This film doesn't.It does include stereotypical characters but they are essential for the storyline. It seems to have upset people with both left and right sides political views simultaneously which was obviously the intention of the makers. If they are really upset and can't see the silliness it pokes at both side as I say simultaneously then the intentions of the makers are spot on. If you are offended take a few steps back and think about the whole movie not just what offends you. If you still don't get it well there is no hope for you! Go and watch something bland or what makes your opinions feel right and people on the other side of the spectrum must be horrible. I can't think of movies on both sides that will do that for you which are of any good substance similar to this off the top of my head to help you sorry.Betty Gilpin is excellent in this and you feel a lot of determination, apparent indifference at times and dark humour in her character. The mystery character is obvious and not a surprise so I am not spoiling the plot but she is essential for the film to progress and conclude.
Warning! The gore levels are incredibly high. But the dark humour did not make them nauseating and were essential for the feeling of the plot. They are very brutal though so if you can't stomach that kind of content probably best if you didn't watch. Or give it a few minutes and you may accept it with the humour which is done very well and actually made me laught a lot.It is a pity this didn't get a cinematic release. Whether that was because the awful times we are going through or the controversy attached to it I don't know but for me the quality is so high I think it may have done well. But even on television I found it very dark humouress, decent plot holding it together and some great acting quality so a 8/10 for me. It is one of those movies I WILL watch again in the future.Brilliant. 8/10.",The Hunt

335,zanghi_james,It's a Revenge film with Detestable characters on both sides,6,1 March 2021,"Look, I'm just gonna come right out and say it. I'm a Liberal Democrat. I was ecstatic when Biden won. I heavily support the LBGTQ+ community. I think racism is appalling and a real problem to our country. I know climate change is real. I also just watched this film and I am glad I didn't pay a ton of money for it.The way the script is written is okay, but the characters are all detestable and unlikable...both the Hunters and the Hunted. The Hunted people, save for Betty Gilpin, are all people who should be either high-ranking members of QAnon, and the Hunters are all liberals who become what people hate about liberals. Instead of using their money and worth to help educate those who don't understand, they decide to hunt them down. It's essentially a Purge spoof, which is ironic, since both are produced by Blumhouse, and both this film and the Purge franchise are an allegory to Trump's appalling administration as President of the United States. I didn't feel sorry for any of the characters in this film and only until the big twist at the end with Betty Gilpin's Crystal character did I understand her.I'd say if you want a much better production by Damon Lindelof that targets hatred and ignorance, I think you should give his Watchmen limited series a chance. The only really enjoyable thing about this movie, and that is a stretch, was the fight scene between Crystal and Athena. Other than that, this film is really just a one-time-watcher which will gather dust on my shelf.",The Hunt

It pokes fun at two sides of the political spectrum. The violence is enough over-the-top it won't give anyone nightmares while somehow being funny when a girl shoots herself in the head, committing suicide. You have to see that to believe it, that's certainly nothing I ever imagined I could write.All in all, if you are overly politically sensitive and lean to the left you will probably hate this movie after the first fifteen minutes.

345,camachoborracho,A double nothing-burger with cheese,2,29 August 2020,"I just saw this piece of garbage and can say with confidence that this is easily one of the worst movies ever made by a major studio.Not for the reasons that everybody is talking about in terms of supposedly controversial politics, but mainly because there's not a single likable or relatable character and the writing is atrocious.None of the characters were like real people. Given that every single one of them was a stereotype, a cardboard cutout that served only to be killed in a gory manner, or gave cheap ""funny"" 1 liners you didn't care at all when they died. This goes for both the ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" characters. Plus, you hardly saw most characters as most were only in 1-2 scenes before being offed in a gory manner. The problem with this film is that there was nobody to relate to, as the girl in yoga pants we are following gets her head blown off, then the nice guy who was next to her and the film follows for a few minutes helps someone before being blown up, then another guy's character gets shot in a trap, and finally there's the main character / survivor who is unlikable and nasty to everybody whom she encounters, and none of the character motivations for the evil characters or good characters made sense.Now, I can excuse a dumb film with thin characters and a weak plot if it is at least fun, but it wasn't even a fun film. Sure, it moved fast but you had zero connection to anybody and it was pretty much just a gore fest. It is nothing but a thinly veiled hack and slash. It barely even had coherent dialogue.It's pretty nihilistic and had no point to it, mainly senseless violence, and only in that sense was it offensive. Given that, I wondered why this film was even made. Fortunately, I didn't spend money on it (despite my not supporting Hollywood, I got this as a legal free rental).

I was so miffed in learning of her inclusion, I nearly turned it off as I knew how the movie would end. The irony is through the first two acts I was completely engaged, even shocked at times.

The camera work, sound and special effects are all good, sometimes very good, but nothing great. The script is good, and necessarily hammy at times.What this movie does exceptionally well is make fun of nearly everyone who gets caught up in today's divisive politics. The liberals are over the top. The conservatives are over the top. Cliché after cliché, and they all seem silly. And they should: Clichés only become real after they are manifested too often in the world.The more subtle point is Crystal, the protagonist of the story. She represents the rest of us. Just an average person caught in the middle. She doesn't have a side. She doesn't deserve the injustice of her circumstances. She trudges on against the adversity. She's endowed with her own, potent wisdom, jaded by a world-weary point of view. She's just trying to survive. She's bemused by the insanity of the game, yet sober because her well-being is at stake.Crystal is an avatar for the average American who simply wants to survive, avoid ruin, and maybe have a chance at happiness, despite the crazy people with megaphones and power trying to do them in.",The Hunt

This could be considered a rehash of other films and literature destroying people of power and those who are heavily energized in the dirty world of politics (that we can all agree, is extremely dirty and divisive). It's good to see a movie that has social commentary on everything not just one side of the spectrum. That could also go for everything else that can spark up conversations. It's just nice to see Hollywood take a punch in the face for once for trying their hardest to talk down to us like children -- as well as influencers and celebrities with so much money that they can speak what they want freely without consequences while the little man burns.This movie takes a sharp poke at liberals and conservatives equally because everyone is allowed to speak up about it unless they know they won't be banned off of a big tech social media website.

She's jonesing for a cigarette in the woods while a half dozen wealthy pretentious woke urbanites hunt deplorables for sport...she being labeled as a deplorable it's game on.Very similar to Surviving the Game (1994) with Ice-T, Rutger Hauer, Charles S. Dutton, Gary BuseyThe style is from a graduate school of Quentin Tarantino, the dialogue and action are low key but spasmodically intense.Every sentence of dialogue is memorable and Betty Gilpin shines and so do others like Ethan Suplee and Hilary Swank.The story is about politics, class and societal doxxing camouflaged under a thin veneer of sarcasm, cynicism and cartoonish violent action, probably why so many find it offensive and score it so low.You can say it's a parody and dismiss it as laughably ludicrous but I believe it's more a reflection of the divisiveness that seems to be amping up yearly.On the surface the fable is cartoonish but under the surface its raw and unforgiving just like Crystal and those that profile her and judge each other.The hunters are armed with an arsenal of assault rifles, bombs ,drones and bows...you know that wont end well when facing someone that's been ground down by life, they must have never watched the original RamboDisgusted and bewildered Crystal ranking ...gas station

The political dimension of the movie is really misguided , unnecessary and witless, it would have been interesting if a bit of thought had have gone into it. Instead of skillfully satirizing both left and ring wing supporting americans, we get cliched characters who garble some cookie cutter right/ left wing buzzwords like snowflake or red neck before being shot or impaled.

I thought this was going to be a piece of crap, but it was funny (at the right times and in the right dosage), interesting, appropriate messages, and nothing too stupid.

385,KingOfHungary,Garbled mess of tone and genre,4,19 April 2020,"The Hunt is like if you get a dozen writers to write parts of a movie but don't tell them the tone or genre, and don't let them collaborate, and then smash them all together with little regard. It's an awkward, tonally confusing, and misses most marks.
There are funny parts that work and are humorous, but the trailer is misleading to who the film will be concerning, and the lead actress gave a very, very awkward and odd performance. She constantly exhibits odd and strange facial tics, weird conversations, weird way of talking, awkward movements, and none of it is given context, it's just considerably distracting away from the story.
It's a huge missed opportunity of a story and a frustrating watch, because it never keeps on one tone of style, and switches genres without warning or smoothness. There's also a part in there that discreetly ruins the entire film in on itself, when you stop and think about it after the movie.",The Hunt

Without much build up were are dropped right into the action. Characters come and go quickly as the hunt commences.Soon we begin to focus on the central character of Crystal played deliciously by Betty Gilpin (She of Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.).Crystal is a whip smart country bumpkin who proves herself capable of evening the odds against the organized hunters.Overall the supporting cast is full of familiar players we haven't seen in some time. All turning in decent performances.There's a depth and style here that's owed to Nick Cuse's script and Craig Zobel' direction. Hank Amos' stunt coordination makes this on of the very best action movies in this genre.It's worth watching the rest of the movie to stick around to see the climatic girl fight between Betty Gilpin and Hillary Swank.",The Hunt

The acting is average all around with Betty Gilpin being the standout of a strong female lead. There is humor to be had, but not much with just a lot of quick quips here and there. The film starts off great, but then fizzles away with pacing issues...Bad: The writing is messy, and the middle drags. The story just does not add up to much and lacks depth and production.Overall: The movie tries to be political but never quite works out. The advertisements and political uproars are unnecessary. The film has a unique idea, but the low budget world does not come together.2.5/5",The Hunt

403,wiredarp,Way better than I expected,8,27 April 2020,"I was expecting your typical B level 'people being hunted as a game' movie, of which we all have probably seen far too many times. This one manages to stay fresh, by staying different and unpredictable. Its not overly long, or overly complicated (it feels like more could have been done towards the middle to flesh it out a little), but it manages to inject some contemporary humour and a sense of fun that it never loses. It's a bit like Cabin in the Woods in feel, so if you like that movie you'll probably like this one as well.Those who have rated it down for political reasons have really missed the entire point. The movie's political side is more about how extremes on all political sides are harmful, which is hardly an inaccurate message, although of course unpalatable if you happen to be an extreme who expects all movies to conform to their personal beliefs.Plot wise there are lots of holes but it never breaks the suspension of disbelief.Good acting and pace, some actually funny black comedy scenes, and a kick ass main character make the whole thing some amusing fun that keeps you uncertain how its going to end right up till the last moment.",The Hunt

The Hunt is a great black satire that skewers right and left in equal proportions. Betty Gilpin is great as Crystal, one of the people being hunted, and the only one with the skills and common sense to survive a world populated by conspiracy theories and entitled elites. The political commentary is en pointe and refreshing, and the comic timing works great.

But I could tell it was a very fun movieInternetBy the end of the movie, it was open-ended for audience to think is Crystal a wrong target (maybe or maybe not), but it wasn't the point.This murder spree happened only because of one joke, and this joke told us that we're all facing a contradiction under a freedom of speech.

She (and Hillary Swank) MADE this movie. The show is a flat out comedy and you find out within the first 10 minutes of how ridiculous the comedy is going to be. The director and writers wanted to be very clear: this movie is meant to be laughed at.I'm not a huge fan of most R-rated comedies, but that is usually because of their lame, boring, and lazy attempts to use sex, gore, and language to catch my attention. The gore and language in this movie reminded me of ""Deadpool."" They used it cleverly to tell the story, to catch attention when you needed to be paying attention, and to make you laugh when normally, you wouldn't. Kudos to them.The acting is actually fairly decent throughout the film. It's what you would expect - good enough to laugh at rather than cringe at, which I was surprised by.Listen, if you want a good laugh and find the political climate right now as ridiculous as I do, this movie is worth your time.

Amazingly, this is the most positive portrayal of conservatives in a film released during the past 2 decades, simply because the protagonist is smarter than she seems, yet it still has a ""Planet of The Apes"" feel when the conservatives are up against the elitist liberals. I don't want this review to be hidden due to spoilers, so I'm keeping details slim, but the movie makers actually did drop enough hints to fully confirm who is a leftist spy and who is not. Further, it's hard to imagine Crystal would so competently navigate Manorgate if she truly had no prior knowledge about it, as she claims. In one scene, Crystal's suspicions are aroused merely because she is questioned about her behavior before she arrived. In wars this bloody, people on both sides likely would lie to eachother if that lie might, for instance, get their opponent to put their gun away, or get their opponent to call somebody who might help them.",The Hunt

If you are on the fence about watching this movie and reading these reviews to help you decide, my advice is to definitely watch it. It's not long, moves quickly, and has an interesting story.

The story was a bit thin though, and accomplished nothing particular.I have nothing against Betty Gilpin as an actress, and this could also be a script or direction problem.But her performance as main protagonist in this movies is extremely bad!Uncharismatic, Irrelevant, with what looks like the emotional range of a pinecone; and apparently her only skill is the ability to wear a tight tanktop.I can understand the character she is playing does not want to be in her situation; but something is wrong when I get the feeling that the actress doesn't want to be in the movie either.",The Hunt

It's just the right amount of comedy and horror.It is basically a take on The Most Dangerous Game. Alot of people wake up, with no memory of how they got there, and then begin to get hunted. It's got some good gore, and the kill count is high.I think the best part is the final girl. I don't know why, but I just love her accent. And, even though the movie has it that the whole tweaker thing was a mistake. She basically is a tweaker. Gotta love that, the only sane people in America right now.

It didn't bother me, and I hate all those f##kers. I'm equally overjoyed seeing left wingers or right wingers bite it. (lol) Though, I think, despite what they say in the movie, that it really was more about class warfare. It was all rich people hunting poor people.

It moves at a good pace, the violence is brutal but cartoonish in its execution, the gags are solid and go down brave but potentially dangerous routes. I was fine with them. But it wouldn't surprise if some might offend the SJW cinema-goers.

428,slackline70,"Ironically, the most 'offensive' movie is the one that doesn't take sides",10,4 April 2020,"First off, I HAVE actually seen the movie.Second, I fully expected it to be another of those annoying, one-sided films where the Hollywood establishment attempts to divide the entire world into good guys and bad guys based on which of the two idiots everyone voted for in 2016. Never mind that Hollywood elites are the worst personal offenders of the socioeconomic and environmental causes they constantly lecture us on. They're also woke, so it's cool.So I watched The Hunt out of curiosity. Exactly what about this movie is so much more offensive than so many of the other movies born out of the Hollywood Hypocrisy genre we've seen of late?Twenty minutes in, however, I realized this wasn't your typical movie to come out of Hollywood in which the filmmakers' personal political views are on full display in sledgehammer-to-the-face obviousness.Halfway through, I couldn't even tell which side the movie was on.For starters, it seemed chock-full of caricatures from both sides. Specifically, what both sides like to believe everyone on the other side is. Lots of stupid, bible-thumping gun enthusiasts with beer bellies and racist attitudes; and just as many pretentious, judgmental hypocrites who are obsessed with their own self-righteousness to the point of violating the very principles they claim to champion a thousand times over.It wasn't until the last fifteen minutes that I finally got which side this movie is on - and exactly why some who have actually seen it find it so offensive.The answer - to both the question of what side the movie is on, and to why this movie is so 'offensive' - is that IT'S NOT ON ANY SIDE, OTHER THAN BOTH SIDES HAVE BECOME JUST PLAIN NUTS!!!!I mean, at least 'offensive' movies like Fahrenheit 9/11 had the courtesy to allow both sides to feel vindicated. If you're on Michael Moore's side, you can simply believe every word, and revel in your own sense of self-righteousness. If you're on George W. Bush's side, you can view it as a hack job typical of the other side, and revel in your own sense of moral superiority.The Hunt, on the other hand, has the audacity not to take a spoon-fed approach to who is right and who is wrong, and tell it in a way neither side wants to hear - you're all a bunch of nut jobs who need to get a life, and you're only going to get worse if things keep going the way they are going.First time I've ever given a movie a 10 out of 10.",The Hunt

I really enjoyed the mysterious female lead character. I loved her in Glow and admire her full figure physique. Her kills are awesome! However, her background was never explained. We know why everyone else was picked for this hunt but she was an accident of mistaken identity. That's about all we know other than she was ex military. I feel like there should have been some explanations as to how she was acquired and so underestimated by these rich idiots. Overall I enjoyed the politically correct or incorrect views and obnoxious self indulgent yuppies being slaughtered by some random soldier that wasn't even supposed to be there!😂 If they ever make a sequel or even better a Netflix or HBO series based on this film I hope we learn more about this ""Snowball"" character and see an awfully more amount of killing dumb white privileged vegan yuppies!",The Hunt
430,DeadeGuard98,"A Rumor, A Victim And The Internet",8,6 June 2020,"😱 First Impressions:
It goes without saying that a film centred on ""strangers waking up and being hunted"" is like the new trope of the horror genre. The only difference lies in why they were brought there. So I actually went in with little to no expectations and just looking for some entertainment. Political controversy aside, it's a mighty heck of a good time.
Pros:
😋 I love the comedy-horror; often times those thriller films do not really go together because one will typically outshine the other. But here it is pulled off with flying colors because of the choice in casting. Actresses playing Crystal and Athena were absolutely made for their respective parts. I laughed more times than I could count!! Their line delivery were on point too.😋 The wacky change in hero/heroine in just the first 20 min alone subverted all expectations! I had a really fun time trying to guess what'd happen next though once I got what the film was doing. Even there is an element of blindsiding to the story- admit it when you first saw the group chat, you thought they planned it from the get go too~ That was a twist I wasn't anticipating either.😋 There is a clever commentary somewhere about the political situation in the States. I don't really follow much but I can see the clear divide between Conservatives and Liberals, rich and poor, educated and illiterate... Also the whole premise of the film is a testament of the blatant effects of how things end up blown out of proportions on the Internet and how they have very devastating real life effects.Cons:
😪 This ain't really a con- but there is a lot to theorize. One, could the Hunt actually be real? I know they said that it's only as real as the manor conspiracy believers made it out to be.. Therefore, they willed it and were actually hoping for it to be true. But why would they joke about such a thing then. It really bothers me, hahahah! Then you have the ""Don"" being one of them (which is most likely just a psychological trick to get them both on edge) and the whole ""Crystal"" being one of two women similar in name only. It's a headscratcher alright but I need answers (I need things to laid out for me)...😪 Now a real con. The plot of the film is actually quite petty- like the whole point of the film was to prove to people that unadulterated comments especially in the eyes of the public can have repercussions. How do they do that- by actually bringing to reality the one thing that they were trying to disprove to begin with... Near the end, it was even pointed out and ridiculed too by Crystal. Then, the whole clever political, racial and class statements the film was attempting to raise awareness can be said to be flawed or lose their punch as well because of the presentation in it being a comedy and all. Just pointing that out, but I'm just here to pass the time though, doesn't really bother me~😇Verdict😈
I was blown away by the sheer, devilish cleverness in the film's story and direction. The two leading ladies are phenomenal and of course the catfight at the end is the highlight!! The twist of the film was unthought of but for good reasons because of how it is basically a self-fulfilling prophecy that the writers conjured as they hit a dead end. Though, it's laced with actual political satire and undertones of the US- they simply become passing elements to the film's action and jokes that the latter easily overshadows.",The Hunt

I'll take it.,5,10 July 2021,"The Hunt: A highly polarizing filmReleased on March thirteenth, the controversial hunt has been received poorly on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, despite conservative's fondness.Where can I watch it?As of July 14th, 2021, the film is free on HBO Max and Hulu. Though, if desired you may pay for the film on YouTube, Amazon, Apple TV, Vudu, and/or Google Play.How is it controversial?Before release, it was revealed that the script described scenes in which a liberal called republicans deplorables. This resulted in, the president tweeting about the movie, saying it was made in order to inflame and cause chaos.But, according to the director, he did not create the film in order to cause controversy.''That was not the goal'' said Zobel ''Instead, the film cowritten by Lindelof and Nick Cuse, was intended to send up Internet conspiracies and the country's ideological divisiveness, particularly ''how people rush to assume something about someone, or assume they understand the beliefs of people that they don't know just based on them being ''on the other team.' ''What is it about?The film is about a group of 12 conservatives who find themselves inadvertently participating in a game, where they will be hunted and killed by wealthy liberals.The would-be victims wake up in the middle of the woods, with gags in their mouth. Soon after, however, the group finds a box, filled with guns and (for some reason) one pig. But their confusion ends soon after and is replaced by adrenaline, when they are shot at.

I know this is supposed to be a comedy of some sorts, but still, all the characters feel odd and devoid of any humane feelings. I mean hunting people for sport and getting hunted should bring up some kind of emotions, but this is not the case with characters in this movie. The main hero acts just like it's another day in the office while steamrolling through any resistance she encounters. Same goes with the baddies, they just act like nothing special is happening. Even hostel movies showcased similar situations with greater finesse. In addition, the movie in general is not that smart that it likes to think.

I suppose what we are subjected to for about the first near-thirty minutes was to set up what was going on, so that in essence was thirty minutes of pointless development, considering what happened to everyone in those first thirty minutes or so.
Only when we do finally get a central character are we able to focus on someone, but we know nothing about her, what motivates her or anything. She's just 'smart' so there's that.
From there, we are subjected to more people who it's irrelevant to try to focus on them. So we got a central character? But we still don't understand why this is happening to her.
When we DO get some understanding as to why all that has transpired has done so, what it basically comes down to is texting, tweeting, emails, if you don't like what was said, well, it was a joke. But you're taking it too seriously.This then means it is unfair to penalize someone for what they posted online, yet we still do, and often under the pretense it is a 'hate crime'.""But it was only a joke!"" one character bellows.From there, you're able to look at everything that has transpired and you are half-going, so was all this really necessary?

Who did/didn't deserve to die? What message, if any was the movie trying to convey, or was the goal simply over-the-top satire where everyone is bad; or worse, a mixture of good and bad.

Apparently she has 38 credits , but I have only seen her in the smaller role in the TV show Nurse Jackie, and if I remember correctly, she did that just great, so I don't think she's a bad actress but sure as hell this was a miscast. So this could have been a 8-9/10 but since she has such a big part and killed it (not in the good sense) it goes down several steps. They should have gone with Hilary Swank as the lead instead.But if we focus on the other parts, the first 30 minutes really have some original ideas and surprise moments.

The actress, Betty Gilpin reminds me of actress, Shauna Macdonald who played Sarah in 2005's The Descent. They both look alike but more importantly are the strongest ass-kicking characters in each of these films.I was also surprised to see actor, Justin Hartley of ""This Is Us"" star in this but good to see him step into an entirely different role for him, including Hilary Swank. I think that for what this film was/is, it's better than I expected, and it's worth the watch.",The Hunt
492,debdabootchic,I loved it!,10,14 March 2020,It's been awhile since I've come out of a film feeling satisfied! The was a great mix of thrill a bit of comedy and blood and guts lol it grips you from the very beginning and you think you know how it will play out and it goes slightly in a dif direction!! I can't wait to see it again!! 10 thumbs up!! Enjoy!!,The Hunt

495,jenkinscammy,So good that I changed my rating after a second watch!,9,21 July 2021,"Betty Gilpin is AMAZING! She might be my newest all time favorite action star, and it's this movie that put her there! I hope she gets more leads like this one!The difference is, Glipin doesn't play the part of a female action hero. There's no overt sexualization, no love interest, no playful banter.She plays Crystal; Crystal is an action hero, period. This part could have been written for Bruce Willis or The Rock. There's a political element to the movie, the message being 'extremism is dangerous', I think.Our hero is stoic, tough, resourceful. Street smart. A good tactician and an expert in hand-to-hand combat, of course! A natural leader.Crystal keeps her own counsel and we don't learn much about her in the first half of the movie. About 45 minutes into the movie, she finally grabs the limelight for some exposition - and we get one of Aesop's fables. Her retelling is masterful, like an homage to Quentin Tarrantino.A few minutes later, the third act begins. We know where this story is going. We've seen it before, we know the outcome - but the ride is so fun, so full of twists and turns that we forget.The ride ends EXACTLY where it should end. It's neither too soon nor stretched. As quickly as the action had spun up, it spins back down and it's over.I gave it 8 stars on my first rating. Then I came back to submit a full review and gush on Gilpin's performance. I love this movie!",The Hunt

Its not trying to win oscars, its just entertaining and thats what we pay for as far as im concerned. Those of you that give it a bad rating should stick to your melodramtic movies.

It's bloody yet funny, the dark humor is hysterical so you'll find yourself laughing out loud unexpectedly and many Stars I had no idea were gonna be in this movie! Its wicked fun in every sense of the word! Many twists, like the movies above, that you never see coming. I can 99% of the time predict who the bad guys are, who'll die next and how it'll end unfortunately. But this has awesome twists and turns that blew my mind! I was on the edge of my seat and adrenaline was pumping just the way I like it, baby!! This movie pulls it off from beginning to end and you're gonna luv this ride!!!!

511,garysaunders1214,Exactly what a misinformed main stream media believer would think,2,21 October 2020,The theme of this movie is if you post negative things about rich people they will hunt you down and kill you.

PROPAGANDA! Will Hollywood ever make movies again without the obvious brainwashing!,The Hunt
512,edward-bukowski,entertaining thrill kill joy ride,10,15 March 2020,"The Hunt is an entertaining thrill kill joy ride if you like action thriller films with diverse characters going ballistic with any weapon available, from composition to conflict, climax and denouement this film is a roller-coaster ride, the dramatic structure, (Exposition) is conveyed and executed, (pun intended) flawlessly.
The concept behind the film is ingenious as well, it proposes what if a group of elitist radical members of one political group decided to kidnap and then hunt members of the diametrically opposite political group?
The hunt is an action packed thriller overflowing with surreal acts of violence, topped off with layers of sarcasm, dark humor, political satire and a splash of cliché dialogue that is entertaining and well placed.
A group text at the beginning of the film reveals that The ""deplorables"" as the hunted are referred to as, are Trump's underclass, The term ""Basket of deplorables"" from Hillary Clinton's reference to Trump supporters in her September 9, 2016 presidential election campaign fundraising event where Hillary Clinton deemed half of trumps supporters to be a ""Basket of deplorables"" I state this to say that this film takes a stab at everybody, (pun intended) equally.
It's a mix of Surviving the Game (1994) The Hunger Games, Battle Royale (2000) nihilism, a little of The Most Dangerous Game (1932) and The Cabin in the Woods (2011), basically a group of twelve disparate souls deemed to be deplorable by a group of elitists wake up in the middle of what is seemingly nowhere, ostensibly Arkansas, or not, and are picked off, one by one, by unseen assailants. The tables are turned by Betty Gilpin's character Crystal whom can only be compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch in the film Predator (1987) as she too is an ass kicking and don't care to take names fully automatic human weapon of destruction, she is the one ""deplorable"" the hunters did not count on being so adept at not only fighting back but taking the fight to them.
It's basically a satire skewering folks on both sides of the political divide so it has a little something for everybody to laugh about, don't take it too seriously or let it offend you after all it's meant to be entertainment...",The Hunt
513,gavinbshort,Decent from Start to Finish,7,15 April 2020,"I had the expectations that this was going to be your standard hunt kind of story. Dozen random people getting murdered in the middle of nowhere by some rich family... I was wrong for the most part.In fact, the characters (Emma Roberts & others) who I expected to play main roles throughout the film were actually killed off pretty early. It also felt like the hunters thought they were doing right by killing the innocent. Maybe even to say that they had very far left political opinions that needed to get rid of the people that didn't agree with them through a twisted game of violence.Overall pretty solid movie! Deaths from start to finish with small twists throughout. Not so much a horror but I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking for a thriller / action movie.P.S. If you watch ""it's always sunny in Philadelphia"" .. it Was kinda hard to watch Glenn Howerton without thinking that Dennis was about to crack a joke.",The Hunt
514,JeopardyLeyton,Hilarious indictment of social media,9,21 September 2020,"This movie is basically what the world would look like if the conspiracy theories your Uncle posts on Facebook were actually true. And it's ridiculous and hilarious. To me, the 'liberal elites' and the 'conservative deplorables' in this movie basically represent the stupidity and illusory nature of social media and the heroine represents real life. She focuses on whatever's in front of her, while all the other characters have allowed themselves to be whipped up, by glimpses of other people through the lens of social media, into a fantasy land of outrage that has no basis in reality or recognition of the complexity of life or human beings. In turn, this mistake leads them all to create the brutal, unforgiving reality for themselves that they were ostensibly so keen on preventing through their righteous anger. It really is funny, and it's clever. If you're offended by it, then its definitely a movie for you :-)",The Hunt

I caught it about midway at first, and immediately thought the heroine's acting was cheesey. I later realized that was basically how her character ""was"" 😆, and seemed to be quite fitting. The faces she made went right along with her lackadaisical attitude. She also (at times, particularly during the kitchen floor close up) seemed to give off a Michelle Pfeiffer vibe. The one goof I caught was the shape of her blood stain near the end. When she was on the floor, the stain was closer to center, visibly darker, and larger; but when she got up, it was much smaller and lighter...All in all, a different sort of film for this genre, unexpected and a breath of fresh air.",The Hunt

We found something new each time we rewatched. Betty Gilpin, a new face to us, was perfect for the lead although her Southern accent was off a bit; Her dead pan facial expressions and cold callous approach was spot on hilarious at times. Pigs, jackrabbits and box turtles -- lol! We finally got it! Not a spoiler but an Easter Egg if you will. Took us a second watch to catch it (and there are others) but when Crystal May Creasey (reference to Man on Fire but spelled with an ""E"" maybe, maybe not) kneels by the pond, breaks her name tag apart and rubs the needle in her hair to statically charge it before putting it on a leaf in the water to get her bearings ... first clue. First names matter, last names matter and middle names matter. Just sayin'. Enjoy this movie because it would have killed it at the box office were it not for Covid-19. So many little dry one liners, so many little ditties here and there -- I've recommended it to all of my old Airborne Paratrooper buddies but I'm warning them in advance to just ignore Don's hat because those are not Jump Wings. He must have worked for a package delivery company or something. I'm honestly surprised Hollywood/Universal let this one go to distribution -- and even more surprised they let the good guys, well, ummmmmm girl ... they let the good girl win. They should do more of these karma kickback on the elites type movies. Even more ironic given the times we are living-in at the moment. Anyone else wondering if this is based on a true story? j/k ... oh, except one more thing. ""Snowball"" is the new Rosebud and no, we're not talking snowflakes -- they are not the same thing. Is this a cautionary tale about blue vs red or a different take on a Purge-type walk in the woods? You decide. Watch and enjoy! Some of us will be patiently waiting and hoping for a sequel.

I loved watching her in action, and her character and her story was definitely the best part of this movie for me.It is indeed violent. The action is awesome. The acting is pretty decent. The writing is a bit cheesy (I did not expect anything else). It is at times funny. I really enjoyed the last 15 to 20 minutes.Stereotypes abound. One could indeed be offended by this movie when it comes to the very, very basic ""why"" of how it starts off. (This movie did not give me any time to feel offended and I knew what I had decided

Either that and/or they're tied around their own political stupidity. The film mocks liberals showing them as hypocrite and also takes a knock at conservatives. The true message is don't judge a book by its cover. This film is an amazing satire of action and basic truth of the American people. I am American and can honestly say this works on so many levels. The film itself is really fun and I can see it becoming a cult classic. Kudos to Betty Gilpin and Hilary Swank and the writers and team that made this gem. Must watch!,The Hunt

Betty Gilpin, as Crystal, is a combination of Uma Thurman (Kill Bill), a humming Kristin Wigg (SNL), and a pissed-off Bruce Willis. Crystal just tries to survive in this twisted tale.Spoilers:
This gory send-up of ""liberal-elite"" thinking vs ""deplorable"" thinking surpasses the satirical horror of Cabin in the Woods and the Scream/Saw movies. As a centrist, I didn't feel offended one way or another. Crystal has no allegiance biases and is just trying to survive.The ending fight scene with Athena (Hillary Swank) is equal to those of Tarantino's Kill Bill and Carpenter's They Live. There was even about 10 seconds which reminded me of the Guy Pearce/Robert Carlisle Ravenous ending.Director Craig Zobel ran a tight ship, expertly melding screenwriters Nick Cuse/Damon Lindeloft's succinct script with cinematographer Darran Tiernan's expert cinematography.I generally don't like horror/gore movies but this extremely dark ""comedy"" send-up was entertaining.

551,DrWilhielmWonk,Never reaches its potential,5,22 March 2020,"On paper the story line of a ""liberal elite"" hunting deplorables could have been great. And it's not without its charm, funny quips, and some (literally) explosive scenes. But the much of it is sadly wasted in a mindless story of splatter killings that makes the average porn movie seem like Tolstoy.It's hard to feel any sympathy for anyone in the one-dimensional character gallery, which are completely awful on the left, and fairly horrendous on the right. Perhaps then aside from the main protagonist on the right - a pretty blond played by Betty Gilpin - which doesn't talk or ask many questions, but an efficient killer that slaughters all opponents. Academy award-winning Hilary Swank also does a great job in a surprising role.A key issue with the plot is that it misses the target. There has actually been several politically motivated killings in America. The ADL reported in 2018 that at least 50 murders were committed by right-wing extremists, while 0 (= zero) where committed by left-wing extremists. Overall, the average has been that 75-80% of the extremist killings in US has been by right-wingers, 20-25% by muslims, and 0-1% by left-wingers. Taking this into account makes the black comedy almost criminally stupid.",The Hunt

553,tempura-2,But it's all true!,9,15 July 2020,"Not sure why, actually I do know why.
It was canned and pushed under the rug. The problem is what this movie represents, is all true and I can prove it.
Release a movie, doesn't pass Hollywood woke muster, gets canned and buried. Was that a marketing strategy? If it was, then the critics canned it and the movie theaters that pulled it are part of a massive marketing conspiracy, proof there is no independence among access establishment critics. If it wasn't then, it's because they are...access establishment critics that all think alike and this movie indirectly exposes that. Not just triggered but checkmated!
Finally, watch the movie and you realize, it's all true. Woke corporate elites acting and behaving like insane fools over proper pronouns and identity politics, how far will they go? They look down on the rest and with broad stereotypes. That broad brush crossed over the middle ground of person that barely pays attention to it all; A not so average American, a bad ass one.
With righteous vengeance brings justice and ultimately; A little bit of balance back into the world.
Every American should watch this. It's a parody, but a parody works if it pulls directly out of what is observable in the woke corporate world today and specifically Hollywood and the power they yield. It's a simple concept, but there aren't many movies coming out of Hollywood inspired by real world immediately identifiable current events within our culture? In fact the complete opposite is occurring which is also parodied.
Why? Because it just exposes the whole elite class and it's exactly how they think! You can just imagine Hollywood producers spending why too much of their time worried about ""proper representation"" and ""diversity and inclusion""; The film be damned!
Then this movie managed to be made, it's a shame and of such wasted opportunity there aren't more. No one likes these woke corporate people except their own woke corporate circles, actually not sure about that either. I think they also hate each other and themselves.

None of the action or ending was believable, but it was somewhat funny in spots with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor (dark satire).

Many more terrible looking blood hits are slapped on, most likely because they used all of their blood hit budget for 1 headshot scene near the end of the movie, which was well done.

This movie was great, from reading a few reviews I've gotten the hint that it made a little controversy, I had no idea. I didn't know squat about the movie until my girlfriend showed it to me. I have since shown it to many friends, most that never heard of it and all of them loved it. Let me start by saying that I like when a movie tries to take a more realistic approach.Yeah there are a lot of good movies out there that are all action and explosions, with a chiseled protagonist that handles everything like a boss and looks good doing it, and some of those movies are pretty good. This movie doesn't follow this common cinematic formula, just for Ex when our protagonist In this film swings from a decorative ceiling fixture that doesn't hold her weight and she crashes on her back, breaking a couch high table. She then proceeds to literally GASP for air very authentically for someone who would likely have very well knocked the wind out of themselves.Our hero isn't a popular Hollywood A-list beauty, she doesn't act like any hero we've seen so much of in most movies. In fact she's kind of a weirdo, in a way that really connects with you and your friends chuckling on the couch at the humorous moments of the film. We can all be a bit goofy even if only sometimes, which to me makes her one of the most realistic protagonist I've ever seen.This film is action, good action, the kind you feel isn't being stunted. It's goofy at times but hardly unreasonably so, it has serious undertones (Which, if this film was controversial, this was probably why). These undertones, even if you don't believe in them can easily be made sense of. From beginning to end, this movie was entertaining, and while I'm sure I've missed a lot of gems as of late, this film is one of the best I've seen in many years.

584,EddieSixx,"Excellent, unexpected, and guaranteed to trigger radicals on both sides",9,5 December 2020,"I read another review that talked about how half the country thinks one way, the while other half thinks another. This film isn't about a 50-50 split. In fact, the vocal minorities on the extremes are the people who this film skewers, and makes no apologies for doing so. It is that 10-20% who are going to be triggered, not the rest of us in the middle who see their hypocrisy and hate-fueled rhetoric for what it TRULY is - anger, condescension, fear, ignorance and narcissism. This film has a much deeper meaning than many have noticed. Yes, it is an action film, with gory sequences and some snappy dialogue. But at it's core it IS a political statement, and for once not a preachy one. More of an exposé of the idiocy of the extreme left AND right, and how those very few (but very outspoken and visible) people try to create hatred among so many of us in the middle. If this movie upsets you or you find yourself picking a side, it's likely because you are a part of that insidious radical group, on either side.

I was very upset at this once again happening to an anticipated film or show much like the Deathwish remake and the punisher series. I still held out hope that it would be released eventually and luckily they had the guts to do so. In fact their recent media spots have only exploited the controversy of the cancellation/delay and it may work in favor of Blumhouse. For all we know this was just a smart media ploy to bring attention to the climate we are living in.The film itself is an absolute intense wild ride full of action, brutality, and some undeniable Sociopolitical commentary that does a great job at showing just how radically extreme things can get with people's morals and beliefs on both sides of the spectrum . The violence is purely gratuitous and no holds barred. The planning is never what you expected to be an actually very well written. The conclusion is very smart and will have many people shocked and maybe even triggered but I think that's the whole point of a film like this.The cast is very well put together with some familiar faces They all do a decent job though many don't last as you will see.

588,sneakychicken,misleading - I blame the description,1,22 March 2020,"My main complaint about this movie is the wrong description followed by the wrong expectations. It said 'action horror thriller' when in reality it should have said 'dark political comedy slasher'. Now, if it was the second I would probably (definitely) have chosen not to watch it because I was not in the mood for that (if I was - it would have gotten a better rating). So because it is listed as an action horror thriller, I'm going to rate it as such.For starters, this 'thriller' has no thrill to it, because they've chosen to tell you what's going on from the beginning. Everything is obvious and predictable, there is absolutely no mystery regarding who is who in this movie. Snowball is the only somewhat exciting character in this , and only because she's cuckoo.
They cover up the face of the main antagonist to reveal it in the finale to what end? In the actual horror movie it would be someone from the victim group who was killed / disappeared in the beginning. Here I'm like 'uh whatever, I still don't know who that chic is and I don't even care'. None of the characters have any backstory, only bits and pieces here and there which don't make up for a solid picture. The only unexpected plot twist is that I expected Emma Roberts to be the main protagonist (spoiler alert: she's not, if you're wanted to watch this movie because of her you will be vastly disappointed).The political part I kind of understand, but can't relate because I'm not from America. Still, it's the fault of no-backstory plot that makes it so faceless and unrelatable - there are ways to make a film more understandable for a wider audience, which were not used here, so people either get it or they don't.The overall impression of the movie is just... meh. Mediocre humor, dumb scenarios (people running towards the box no problem, then running towards the shooters, then running away from them and suddenly stepping on bombs and falling into traps that majestically weren't there before, etc.) and faceless characters.

Was I disappointed.That said, other reviewers have pointed out that the film takes shots at both sides but neglect to say that it eventually comes down on the elites side. There are a few nuances other viewers have missed. The 12 were chosen because they spread a false conspiracy story about some liberal elites. The ensuing uproar cost the elites their jobs and ruins their lives. This seem a bit far fetched but we will let that slide.Our heroine, mistakenly believed to be a deplorable, is a stand-in for those of us caught in between two crazy fractions.But the film can't be completely fair. Yes, the elites are portrayed as pretentious buffoons. (The bit about the posion sda is hilarious). On the other side, Don is a stark raving bigot. Even-handness? Not so much.

Everybody dies except of one person who was not even supposed to be there, she got kidnapped by mistake.The idea is great, this could have been a great, great film with a powerful massage.

595,AGuyNamedJake,Finally A Strong Female Character Who Earns Her Strength,6,12 September 2020,"""The Hunt"" is a dark comedy, sadly tarnished by uneducated critics who, around the fall of 2019, tried to prevent the film's release because they feared its political message. And many of them had yet to even see it.*insert eye roll here*But ""The Hunt"" isn't a dangerous message to our culture any more than ""The Interview"" was a threat to North Korea. They're both fun movies with their own themes and issues, and if someone wants to be offended by that... well, it's a free country. Go ahead!The film follows a group of people who were captured by some rich elitists to be hunted down in a ""Hunger Games"" style deathmatch. Betty Gilpin plays the heroine and she fully commits to her character's reluctant hero type, restrained, rigid, and with the eyes of a trained survivalist who has been backed into a corner. The rest of the characters are basically stereotypes, but it works for the kind of satire the movie is trying to convey.In a society overrun with female heroes great at everything they do right off the bat without much learning, growth, training, or mentorship (ie. Captain Marvel, Rey Palpatine, Mulan), the approach ""The Hunt"" takes with its heroine is refreshingly down-to-earth. She's not the best and brightest. She starts off surrounded by seemingly stronger people and throughout the course of the story relies on her cunning to learn, develop, and survive. She reminds me of Samara Weaving from the decent ""Ready or Not"" and Kaya Scodelario from the even better ""Crawl."" Gilpin comes off as someone content with who she is and the writers wisely don't turn her into a political flagpole for some feminist agenda. They just let her be, and what she be is badass!And, yes, it's apparent that the hunters are the violent liberals and the prey are the reactionary conservatives, but it's a cartoonish stereotype pushed to the extreme for entertainment value--and one that I would argue isn't entirely incorrect. But throughout the movie, both sides of the political line are thoroughly made fun of, so I don't think it can be said that this movie makes one side out to be the fool any more than the other.It's political satire at its most violent. And violent it is! There's plenty of boobytraps and explosions and gunfire that result in all kinds of human messiness. Arrows, knives, grenades... oh my!Ultimately, I don't think the movie is as clever as it thinks it is, but it's fun, gory, passable entertainment. It's also nice to see a strong female character who isn't the bestest most strongest woman ever just because of her gender or race. She has to work hard to succeed. And, in the end, isn't that the lesson we should all take away from this?",The Hunt

Perfect funny film, well scripted fantastic pacing just fun. Betty Gilpin Was fabulous, never seen her before but she is such a great actress, acts with her face so much I was laughing at all her sceneS, great comic timing. On second viewing you I could see a lot of small touches by so many of the cast.
Loved it, go in with an open mind and I'm sure you will enjoy. I scored it ten because I can't think of a single criticism worth mentioning.
The script is tight, the paint is great, the writing and conversations seem realistic like they are not in other movies. Little comic lines have me laughing over and over.",The Hunt

Watch the final scene between Gilpin and Swank where the dialogue and action will remind you that Tarantino made a great movie or two.",The Hunt
599,msantos1116,Entertaining black humor flick with just enough gore,7,6 October 2021,"I heard about this movie in early 2020 and was looking forward to its initial release, but apparently it was pushed back due to various reasons. There was a theory floating around that it was postponed due to the presidential election, or maybe that was a conspiracy theory used to market the movie, since the plot is based on baseless conspiracy theories.At its core, The Hunt is a dark comedy with a short run time that satirizes elements of what some may call a ""class war"" in America. It pits elites against conservatives and packs in the stereotypes. The elites are out of touch billionaires that feign to care about the cause-du-jour (climate change, AIDS, Haiti crises, etc.) and the conservatives are mostly gun-toting, hunting, poor ""deplorables"" that love to give light to conspiracy theories on the Internet.I found the movie to be pretty clever and entertaining. There is definitely a lot of over-the-top gore and pretty much everybody dies. The cast is eclectic, with a lot of familiar faces from your favorite movies and TV shows. Glenn Howerton of It's Always Sunny, ""Kevin"" from This is Us, Hillary Swank, Emma Roberts, and many more are featured.I recommend The Hunt for a quick, entertaining watch.Crystal (the main character) gives a pretty funny monologue that expands on the fable of the tortoise and the hare.",The Hunt
600,grainonbeach,Cuts Both Ways,7,27 June 2020,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I liked this satirical movie for what it is: it is a spoof that makes fun of BOTH the Left and the Right.I can see why some viewers would dislike the movie, if they didn't get the hints at the beginning that it was a parody (e.g., the way the man was stabbed in the neck with a PEN was a big clue), or felt the message was delivered poorly.These lines (toward the end) really hit home:Crystal: ""You don't really care about the truth, do you?""
Athena: ""Of course I do. The only difference is that I'm right.""Athena represents the quintessential ideologues' attitude. They claim they care about the ""truth,"" but refuse to look at facts that refute their narrative, and steadfastly believe they are ""right.""I am acquainted with people like that, and these people can be seeds of evil, if they have influence, by disseminating half-truths to incite outrage and hate.The entire dialogue near the end between the two women before they fight epitomize the struggle between rationality and ideology. Here, Athena is the ideologue/extremist while Crystal is the voice of reason. Ideology is deaf to reason. This exchange hit the mark.As I had accepted that the movie was 'fantasy' from almost the beginning, I found many of the unrealistic scenes amusing, as they were exaggerations of the tropes representing the attitudes of the Far Right and the Far Left.If the viewer is on the Far Right or Far left, s/he may not like this movie because it probably hits too close to home in showing the hypocrisy, hubris, inaneness, and self-righteousness of their side, be it Far Left or Far Right.My rating is somewhere between 6 and 7. I'll round up to 7.",The Hunt

The basic story has been done dozens of times; a group of humans are hunted by other humans. This time, you slowly get to understand what motivates the hunters and that maybe some of the victims kinda deserved it. Also throws in some George Orwell's Animal Farm.Bunch of blood and gore but largely cartoony. Also several surprises and a few 'didn't see that comings'.

The fact that some folks found this to be a partisan movie, that might be politically irresponsible, somehow only makes this movie more ironically hilarious to me. The characters were well brought to life (those that survive long enough), the story was entertaining to follow, and the acting was both superb in the physical and emotional sense. If you don't like this movie because of ""the politics"", there's a chance you may be the one that needs a pinch of work on a less aggresive approach, and the limitations it might bring to posterity.

Its not an original story but its done extremely well. It a rip off of Predator, Hard Target, Hot Fuzz and several others but the results ARE amazing and very sarcastic.

607,chris-politz,"Not sure what everyone else watched, but I loved it",10,10 October 2021,"Great film. Fun, funny, and ridiculously insightful.Feel it candidly and satirically updated Most Dangerous Game for an era of ""divisiveness"".I purposely put ""divisiveness"" in parentheses, because that division is crafted for the polls by both parties in our current political system.The lefties and righties were exaggerated in their stereotypes to give us extremes on both ends. Whether it's the gas station attendees spouting off NPR bs, which even I, a long time NPR listener accept they are as full of it as any other media. Or the game player men who constantly jump to paranoia and mansplaining to the lead. So it's there, strongly, the fact that both sides are pulled through the mud kicking and screaming. Perhaps I'm a lover of chaos and appreciate watching both sides fling their hypocritical slants and glorify violence at one another.For F sake Dangerous Game is an extremely violent premise. Why shouldn't The Hunt be likewise.The conclusion of the film adds up perfectly. Liberty vs Crystal laying on the floor passing their preconceived notions aside talking about George Orwell's Animal Farm and who is the most like Snowball. Perhaps if they talked they would find they are more in common. Perhaps that Blum and Lindelof's point. Stop following the lemming path to divisiveness and accept we are all more similar than we are promoted by our TVs to believe.This is a first time for me to see Betty Gilpin in anything. Really appreciated her. Easily the most kick ass take no name character I've seen in a while. I can easily count on my fingers and toes women so like her in Texas where I'm from that I would definitely not doubt their abilities to lead with or without military background in this situation. My best friend Jennifer being one of them. I may of liked the film because I could see many of them doing the same thing.The only thing that hurt this film was Covid. It's going to get its cult legs.Also appreciate the Janet Leigh start, meaning, if you recognize a star don't fall too in love with them.Going to recommend this to everyone.5.3 stars is what it was graded at when I wrote this. I'd gather it's not logically for violence because it's obviously going to be violent by premise alone. I'd think it's grade is based on confirmation bias seeker thinking this film craps on their political team. Let's face it. Both teams suck. I think that's what the film is saying.As for violence... again.... If it's Koreans in Squid Game (which I highly recommend) or Hunger Games, which both hit we are cool with it. I perceive these characters are too real and the setting is now in our current day. Which makes me ask: why is it ok for kids and Koreans to violently kill each other but this one gets the knee jerk.Best part, if you hate red, definitely watch. You'll side with Crystal not for a political slant because in her own words ""I don't have time for that."" You'll side with her because Gilpin kicks ass, and for the most part even though she's lead she says next to nothing, except for when it counts... and her dialogue reads like... Jennifer, which means she's real.Thoroughly entertained.",The Hunt

The heroine, rather predictably (in fact, knowing nothing about the flick, I predicted all of it to 100% perfection) is a case of mistaken identity. The elitists were victims of Twitter. This is completely laughable. In reality, conservatives are the victims of all media. Elites were somehow forced into hunting the dreaded Deplorables by the Deplorables. Elites were forced to arm themselves to hunt. They were forced to drug the bad people and put them on a plane to fly to a foreign country thereby contributing to global warming while blaming their victims for it. The warped mind and illogic of a leftist elitist knows no bounds. Hollywood is so far gone, cannot seem to get anything correct (right) anymore. So I guess we are supposed to believe that all the men (especially the Deplorables) got what they deserved. Also, don't screw with an innocent woman especially ex military woman.

618,sirjrcalvin,Disappointing for Reasons I Didn't Expect...,1,14 March 2020,"This film caught my eye last year when is stirred up controversy for being ""hyper-violent"" and full of ""dangerous social stances."" At least, that's what the media outlets claimed. Controversy is usually something I am drawn to, so I vowed to see this when it came out.I went in, expecting something hyper-violent, with some controversial, thought-provoking commentary on the political state of the country, or the skewed idealism of being extreme anything, etc. I expected some sort of point, even if it was a bad one.Unfortunately, the film delivered only violence. If that's enough to entertain you, you'll enjoy the movie. If you expect any more that that, you'll walk away wondering how that could have been worth the ticket price.What bothered me is that there were no characters in the movie. Instead, we got caricatures of extreme liberals and extreme conservatives killing each other for an hour and a half with no actual reason or point for it. We follow Crystal, (our protagonist?), as a silent, untouchable super soldier, which is perhaps an attempt to mock the Mary-Sue trope? None of the characters ever represented real people. Every single person in this movie had as much nuance and depth as a political Reddit comment.The entire film feels like it was written and shot in about an hour. Would recommend renting if you want an hour and a half of violence. If you are looking for more than that, skip this one entirely.",The Hunt

It constantly keeps you on edge, subverting expectations frequently, in ways that haven't been done before. It was unique, clever, and very entertaining. It brought to light some of the ridiculousness of the political climate, making fun of people on both sides. My theory is, that's what makes it isolating, although if more people could get out and see it, I'm sure the reviews would go up.There is clearly something brewing in the air.
Between this, and Joker, a revolutionary time is on the brink. Elites want to keep this movie quiet, because there's so much truth to it. Open your eyes, look at how we're being taken advantage of. Let this movie in. Despite the painful truth of it, it's really, really fun.Shout out to the director, and the lead actress. I'd give her an Oscar if the Oscars weren't so calculated.

633,debrecenisrac38,The screenwriters did not disappoint,8,21 March 2020,"Well,I wasn't let down by this movie, because the writers behind it studied up on the subject material. First, there's a bias that's true for any large country that mainly speaks one language, the set of ideas brought forth by its citizens will rarely get challenged on the inside by those who didn't grow up there. It's nice to call America a melting pot, but it's not exempt from processes that happened here in Europe, namely the innate need to create one language. Lincoln's logs aren't controversial, even though the style was imported by Finnish settlers, who descendants today carry Anglicized names and wouldn't understand a lick of Finnish.That's where Europe comes in. The downside to having one large country with one majority language is that both the majority and many people of color tend to imagine all white people like the way WASPs do, but we don't. Way before the Cold War necessitated a long physical barrier between the Western and Eastern half of Europe, while Western powers fought over colonies in the world wars, the later Eastern Bloc just fought to eradicate each other, not unlike the later Yugoslavian Civil War. I'm guessing choosing Slovenia which was largely spared of fighting, but FLOTUS is from there, would have been too much on the nose, Croatia is a better fit. Frankly, Gary's ruse to infiltrate himself among refugees would totally not work in real life. For one, Arabic dialects are different and some slang is region specific. Imagine it like using an Alaskan fishing slang in Louisiana, both are English speakers, but so far away that they'd likely be not familiar with it. Linguistics aside, being a refugee on the Western Balkans route is no cake walk, and the levels of xenophobia is high. For the record, xenophobia means anyone not from the region, so the depiction of being somewhat hostile to Americans is accurate, y'all the face of globalism.I think Crystal caught on the ""diplomat"" being fake, because having served in Afghanistan, she probably was assigned to humanitarian missions, therefore knew that it's the UNHCR's job to get people out of refugee camps if they have no papers. In fact, they were lucky, in real life they'd probably detained in a normal jail, and fingerprinted until their identity can be confirmed. I'm glad they dispelled the myth of ""I'm an American, I'm entitled to my phone call"". It's also rare that a member of the diplomatic corps travels without a chauffeur or at bare minimum a translator.From a writing standpoint I loved how they presented a Texas Hold'em style of plot presentation where they could expect us being familiar with the visceral gut reactions online, and not need to elaborate further what connected the targets and hunters. However, there is one thing I didn't see in other reviews, and that's the mention, how not everyone who supports a great cause does so out of the goodness of their heart. The hunters were just sorry they got caught in a possibly Sony-level intrusion, deep down they had no connection to the people they allegedly felt offended for. To put it differently, this is the typical ""I'm willing to make a donation so your kids don't go hungry to school, but my property value would go down if I allowed you to live anywhere near me"".That brings me to Athena. There might have been a general idea why she started to train, but in the hot second she saw Crystal, her hurt pride over losing her CEO position kicked in, and she didn't bother to check if they got the right person. She wanted a punchable face, a negative outlet. A flesh and blood person to own, to enact revenge for the slight she suffered.It's a touch of genius to bring up Animal Farm, not just because it's quoted less, than 1984, but because he wrote it after experiencing first hand how Stalin's paranoia, that manifested in the Great Purge reached Spain and plenty of innocents got caught in the crossfire. Snowball was George himself, cast out for now opposing them.",The Hunt

Would love to meet a deplorable like her.I suspect that the radical left will be upset at this movie because it pokes fun at things they are so serious and radical about. It does make fun of deplorables, but deplorables wear the stereotypes like badges of honor- I know I like being part of the no-nonsense, down to earth, peasant that lives by, ""Live and let live"" and ""Don't tread on me.""Of course, there is much more in the movies than I am discussing. Also, questions raised that need answering from a sequel- but, I don't want to write any spoilers.If you are a proud deplorable, you should love this- as long as you own who you are. If you are a self acknowledged elite- white shaming, virtue signaling type, you will hate this movie, unless you can laugh at your ideologies (but, people like this are serious about what they feel, so I doubt they will like it).Too bad that theaters have been closed and thanks to Universal for doing the VOD!

I decided to watch this movie on the basis it was free and i had heard it was good.. Well, considering i watched Hard Target in the 90s with Jan Claude Van Damme and Lance Hendrickson all about ""humans hunting humans"" for sport which is a brilliant film in my view i thought the hunt would be as good.. How wrong was i.... Killings are very brutal but comical, storyline is absolute trash...and i wasted an hour and half i wont get back again..!! Rubbish... Dont waste your time...",The Hunt
647,ricardoschtiegmokwena,FAILED ATTEMPT AT HUMAN HUNTING SPORT TYPE FILM,4,10 June 2020,"The Hunt is a premise/remake of The Most Dangerous Game in 1932 and
Surviving the Game later in1994.It starts off really well & then it loses itself.It becomes predictable with an unrealistic hero which just ruins everything.The choreography is poor and fake . They needed more time! The script becomes predictable even Hilary Swank fails to rescue it. The humor was out of place as it confuses the movie & makes you not to take it serious.When it starts off its like a horror thriller then half way towards the ending it becomes an action comedy.
So where are we really?The idea was there but then got messed up along the way.The story goes back & forth .When its just about to climax on the audience it descends backwards again with no direction.Almost as if the writers did not know what to do next.The idea of 12 strangers waking up in a place not knowing where they are and find out that they are being hunted for sport is intriguing .One of them becoming a rogue warrior and killing the hunters off one by one deserves an explanation.Yes she served in Afghanistan but how does it link to the theme of the script?How come she survives & wins a fight against her rival who stabbed her four times and not to forget suffering a broken arm.Unrealistic!
Hilary Swank's character was supposed to win the fight.But then the ending would be flawed ; so then it goes back to the poor writing. These are all things that mess up this could of been great film.The dialogue is cheesy.*Watch it for mindless entertainment if not looking for anything serious.ScorecardCinematography 7Dialogue 4Actors commitment to the role 4Screenplay 5Direction 5Sound score 6Casting 6Film Title 7",The Hunt
648,AlihasanAgha,Is It Really Worth 1 Hour 30 Minutes?,3,25 June 2020,"Often people talk about how it is great going into a movie absolutely blind and this movie served as a harsh reminder that blindly watching a movie is simply gambling.
The movie started off at a decent pace, counting off gore packed kills right off the bat. The earliest death sequences are also the most original in my opinion with respectable visual and audio quality creating one of the few pulling factors in The Hunt. Well designed eyeball popping, satisfying action sequences through (most) of the movie. Sound effects were also dramatic and did grab attention. However a tool that kept me intrigued was the swift shifts between main characters a few times early on, leaving viewers guessing who the plot was going to follow. Although with a budget of 14 million USD there was a lot of wasted potential. It was good to be reminded occasionally that it is a movie that does not shy away from graphically blowing people up which also sadly was a death sequence which was repeated one too many times.
The plot had a very promising premise which could have been utilized far better, shoddy writing left multiple plot holes throughout the entirety of the film, obvious, notable holes which would at-least irritate the audience. Personally with the stupidity and over whelming desperation to be funny combined with flimsy writing and character building i felt as if my intelligence was insulted. It felt like the film makers had a dire need to force cheap, weak humor down the audiences throat, sure a couple times there were genuinely funny scenes, but not enough to save the rest of this movie which after the first quarter decided that it would now waste as much screen time as possible with aimless, hollow shots, adding very little to the movie.
The cast was actually well picked, including Emma Roberts, Hilary Swank and Betty Gilpin. Betty Gilpin was a good choice and did make a large amount of unbearable scenes slightly better.
What would the worst offense of this movie be, you may ask. The anti climactic, dry ending. The movie began with some glimmer of hope, some sense, which slowly deteriorated throughout and ended without a bang, just an unremarkable fizzle.
Despite a great budget, a great cast, a great premise, this unfortunate workmanship may not be worth watching. Apart from its few reasonable jokes and even fewer reasonable plot points, decent but widely spread action based sequences and main character switching, only 8 million USD at the Box Office, The Hunt was sadly a forgettable swing and a miss.",The Hunt

Political satire is an understatement, this is THE political satire, from start to finish. When I was in high school we read ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and I've always loved it, so this was a really cool twist on the classic short story. The main protagonist is AMAZING and really nails her role.

Being battle-hardened and stoic, makes Crystal a particularly challenging quarry for her captor Athena, an affluent, demented, Leftist fringe-radical.

First off, so many movies have been drawn in comparison with this one, let me give it a try as well. Hostel in aspects for overseas death counts of Americans through sport killing. High Tension in aspects of a strong female lead who is smarter than her counterparts. Us and Get Out as far as political satire with an unlying message. And This is the End when it comes to five minute cameos from A listers. Emma Roberts, Ike Barinholtz, Justin Hartley, Ethan Suplee, the guy from It's always Sunny, and Hilary Swank...all great. Loved the movie and I wished it was longer at the end...the way you want a movie to have you feeling when it ends. Ethan Suplee looked incredible btw, keep it up on the health transformation! The lead did incredible as well, her acting was on point. The script was funny and witty and full of great lines. Direction was great too! Loved it and felt it was a breath of fresh air from the basic horror/thriller genre.

The Hunt whet my appetite as the stories are similar - people being snatched for rich self important folk to hunt them down in the countrysideI knew before I watched that it was always in the sights of a comparison with Hunger Games, so I left that out of my thinking.Anyway, this one really misses the mark in its attempt to place women as the lead in a combative movie. I've seen this a few times now where movie makers are desperate to show that they aren't prejudice and of course women can be the Army vet, silent type, badass; but why oh why do they almost always do this whilst also scripting the male characters as generally stupid - and why do they always leave them in full, unblemished, makeup?! It's like someone's looked at all those movies where women didn't have a great time and said 'instead of trying to make things more equal, why don't we make another total imbalance the other way around'.Main actor played the role quite weird as well - sometimes pulling faces like she was trying to divide Pythagoras Theorem by a Conference Pear.",The Hunt

I can't wrap my head around why such amazing actors, like Emma Roberts, are barely featured. Why even have them as such small characters?
As a person who isn't a big fan of dark comedies, this certainly wasn't my cup of tea. I was expecting a horror movie, therefore all that I watched was just silly in my opinion.",The Hunt
671,horrorbladesreviews,An unsettled movie that just couldn't really figure out what it wanted to be...,5,13 July 2020,"It's rare that politics finds its way into horror films, when it does, it's often poorly executed. This is no exception. The concept for this film is great, on paper it sounded really interesting but all of that is let down by the addition of political views that really didn't need to be there in the first place. If The Hunt left the politics to one side and stuck to the raw idea and structure of the film's premise then this could have been pretty wonderful. I'll give credit where it's due, the political skews on this made for some great publications and advertising.The movie poster shared quotes cut from different reviewers, ""dangerous"" and ""shows hollywood for what it really is, demented and evil"" were among these quotes. From what I read, I expected to view something truly disturbing and sick. All I got was a fairly light hearted take on a battle royale with little substance in-between. The horror and violence here is not offensive, it's the politics that has so many triggered.The Hunt doesn't take itself too seriously, which I think is a shame. Betty Gilpin is the star here, she delivers a really great performance that'll get you rooting for her throughout. Her ""Don't give a damn"" attitude is really refreshing in this production. It attempts to make fun of internet culture but comes up short and is even cringeworthy at times.The introduction to The Hunt is probably the best part of the movie, for the first 15-30 minutes it's gory, has a heavy body count and will keep you guessing who is the main protagonist is. After that it, it gets a little repetitive and lacklustre. The movie relies on politics and comedy instead of the plot. There's quite a few plot holes in this film. The majority of the characters lack personality and are boring.It seems to me that people rate this one so highly because of how it takes shots at left and right wing politics. Adding real life conflict doesn't automatically make a film great, just because it's relatable. Strip that down and people would be rating this a lot differently.The opening scenes, gory nature of some of the deaths and Betty Gilpin's performance should be enough to keep you occupied throughout the duration of this one. Just don't believe the hype.",The Hunt

Action: yes okay, it was there, but it seems to be very forced because of the very thin story.
Apropos story: well, with the playing time you don't need to expect much, but the whole plot seems unbelievable, because the background of this hunt is not discussed.
Splatter is there, of course the movie lives from it, but that's why over 18? I can't quite understand that.
I can't think of anything to say about the pig.
The film has a tipping point that would have had the potential for real tension (Crystal finds out where it is). Unfortunately, the film drifts too fast into the predictable again.
Maybe I don't really understand the satire at this point, but the level of humour is rather limited.",The Hunt

Betty Gilpin, the tall blonde from Glow, or whatever that awesome, women's wrestling show on Netflix was, completely nails her performance. She alone made it worth watching, but there's also a slew of other actors, most you'll easily recognize but maybe not remember their names outright, that hand in fun performances. As for the plot? Don't listen too much to the harsh reviews. Yeah, it makes fun of liberals and conservatives, but it's just a satire, so try not to get too offended by a movie that's MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE for getting offended, on both sides.

She may not be a massively huge Actress, but she's a favorite for a lot of us. She was great in American Horror Story.The Hunt wasn't quite what I expected, but it was entertaining. Some people are complete nutcases and there's a surprising comedy in many parts. They work quite well.But don't bother betting on who is gong to survive. It's literally a free-for-all and anyone you thought was going to be a hero dies in the first 15 minutes. Some people are really badass and awesome in it. There's a lot of violence and gore too, so delicate people should have their vomit bands handle.And yet...not much plot. It could have been way better without the first 2 twists and not killing off some people who could have made it all so much better. If you look at the trailer carefully, you can actually see who lives and dies first.Me at the beginning of the movie:Yay, Emma Roberts!Oh, damn it. Seriously?!Yay, Justin Hartley!Whyyyyyy?!Huh. Hilary Swank!Wow, surprisingly kick ass.Rest of the movie:That must have hurt!Where's the plot??Watch it for some entertainment and maybe take a shot of Vodka every time someone died.

678,thepalestfire,Conservative... liberal... who cares when they are all idiots?,7,13 March 2020,"The makers of The Hunt most feel prophetic. The pre-release uproar over it could serve as a companion piece. Some of the conservatives who prejudged this one might have a hard time swallowing the message of this film as its theme mirrors such ignorance (truly a lack of knowledge; it isn't a jab) among conservatives and liberals alike. Which is a shame bc they probably would have enjoyed seeing the jabs themselves and liberals. The latter group gets the brunt of the caricatures and satire, but it's pretty evenhanded.As for the film itself, well, it's a mixed bag. The script and its star are the real highlights here. I won't mention the latter anymore bc part of the fun is not knowing who the protagonist is. The only major problem of the film is the directing. It almost feels like two different movies. The first half is clumsy and rarely hits any of the marks it is going for. Thankfully, the script and some of the actors can get us through this part. Then halfway through something magical happens. We get a scene that is just three actors sitting in chairs talking. And all of sudden the film seems to know what it is. A coherent tone and visual style shine through to the end. And to top it off we are treated to one of the best female on female fights since Kill Bill.All it all, it's good fun that takes swipes as where we are as a society.

694,jbf-5,A fun satire featuring a unique super heroine who just doesn't give a damn,9,5 May 2020,"Major spoilers alert.This film is great escapist fun that also satirizes the our bizarrely extreme cultural divide. It is refreshing to be able to bring gonzo humor and over the top gore as a way to step back from the mindless anger and group think. On top of that, Betty Gilpin's brilliantly played Crystal Creasy is something unique to film. While ostensibly written as a familiar Mary Sue able to kick any ass and beat down any threat, Crystal is a sardonic participant in a mad mad world. Highly intelligent yet without affectations, she really does not give a damn why everyone is trying to kill her. She is also the one character in the movie who does not comfortably fit into the extreme left or right stereotypes in spite of all the superficial appearances to the contrary.I also credit the writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof for being willing to subversively skewer their own. Their sharpest barbs are reserved for their fellow Elites while the Deplorables are mostly just one dimensional cartoonish characters rarely provided with more depth than the aptly hilariously named Yoga Pants or Shut Up Gary.On the other hand, the elite hunters characters are fleshed out with many little details and conceits familiar to those who travel in similar circles. Athena babbles on tritely and unoriginally about the singular importance of cutting tomatoes with a bread knife and using Gruyere in her grilled cheese sandwich speech which takes place in the mansion she keeps insisting is NOT A MANOR! She and her compatriots toss off Animal Farm Snowball references as a sort of intellectual adornment, insult, and shibboleth while revealing that they understand next to nothing about a book they were probably once forced to read in some boring English class.The film's conflict originates with one of the Elite characters being found out sleeping with his wife's oncologist which leads to his dismissal from his charitable foundation. Another talks about his dubious devotion to a peasant lover he has inconveniently knocked up. They all look down on the hired hand Sargent Dale who is only allowed the smallest modicum of respect for having a small part in the Bruce Willis movie Tears of the Sun - ""why is the sun crying?"". Even the choice of having the action set in Croatia in something of a inside joke as that has recently been a preferred destination for the fashionable set seeking to avoid the common company of the hoi polloi.The movie starts with a turtle and ends with a hare mirroring the awesomely twisted and violent bedtime story that Crystal says her mother used to tell her. That story serves as a sort of explanation of her uniquely detached outlook and her singular ability to spot deadly threats based on the smallest of tells.At the film's conclusion, Crystal echos the story arc of the Napoleon Animal Farm character. She transforms from her deplorable self by donning Athena's signature red bottomed stiletto pumps, slipping into her stylish black dress, commandeering her plane, while tossing back Athena's prized champagne and caviar.Why it's a Cinderella story!Highly recommended if you have a sense of humor and can enjoy a stupid fun movie.",The Hunt

I really liked how the filmmakers played around with the concepts of our current political zeitgeist, and its a lot of fun to see how they play with it, and provide a satiric commentary in the movie, targeting both sides. Both sides take hits, and also learn they have misconceptions about the other, and gain a newfound respect for their ""enemy"". A rare horror gem with wit, satire, smarts, and fun at the same time.

My fiancé and I were so distracted by her facial exressions throughout the entire movie that we just couldn't stop laughing. Seriously though- it was bad.

Why attempt to keep it a secret before showing her face? It was lined up to be a big reveal then just felt all a bit ""so what?"" when it happens.We then have the 12. The reason they are there is touched upon for a couple of them but never really explored. You have some of them who cinema goers may recognise who just get killed off way too quickly, although some of the deaths are executed pretty well.But everything just feels like it gets lost inside a good idea. When it gets to the end following one big confrontation and moves into a one to one confrontation, you kinda feel like it doesn't actually matter... Then there is one major gaping plot hole around the text message and then the setup of the events of the film which just doesn't make any sense at all.It's bang average and should have been either a full blown thriller, or a hilarious black comedy, but it falls way short of both and just never really delivers anything it should.",The Hunt

725,karaokekid-588-175168,THE HUNT FOR IDEOLOGIES,7,13 March 2020,"The first thing that immediately hits you in the first 8 to 10 minutes, of the Craig Zobel film, ""The Hunt"" is the fact that a dozen or so ""deplorable's"" are being hunted as fair game, in an open field. Wait, stop the presses, please, ""deplorable's"" as in the amous line uttered by then Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary cycle? Ah, apparently yes.
(In full disclosure, the Clinton reference was neither said or implied)
So here it is, Twelve strangers wake up in an empty field, not having the vagus idea of where they are or how they got there. Actually, In the murky shadows of dark urban lore or an internet conspiracy theory, ruthless elitists have gathered at a remote location to hunt ...... well, ah ..... those with with politically conservative agendas, shall we say, for sport.
The hunters on the other hand, are portrayed as being polar opposites of their hunted game, liberally charged people, whose embrace of climate change, gendering and other pertinent issues of the day, actually have fueled their anger and hatred for those not like them. But their master plan to eliminate their right-wing prey gets a fly in the ointment, when one of the hunted, Crystal, played brilliantly by Betty Gilpin, turns the tables on the hunters. Gilpin provides some great action scenes, whose Chuck Norrisesque moves seemed to come in quite handy, as her character quickly emerges as the leader of the band of ""deplorable's"". Hillary Swank plays the villain, Athena, an angry liberal who is hell bent on revenge against anything Conservative. But it was actually veteran actress Amy Madigan (Field of Dreams) who this author thought turned in a brilliant performance as Ma, the owner of a supposedly redneck country store, flat out in the middle of rural Arkansas (Wait, isn't all of Arkansas rural? 😎) Madigan played the part brilliantly and surprisingly covertly, and we'll leave it at that.
Sadly, the film used epitaphs and coined phrases, to aptly highlight our current socioeconomic and political differences, as we sit smack dab in the middle of an actual 2010 Presidential race. The use of the terms rednecks, snowballs, illegals, etc. put sort of a shameless spotlight on social issues of the day, and reminded me just how wide the divide is in our country. But the entire premise of the film I guess was exactly that, and what the film was supposed to portray.
I give this a rating of 7, with heavy on the violence and gore, almost Tarantino like at times. As for the ending, it is prolific and leaves us all with a great message, regardless of what side of the aisle you sit on.",The Hunt

728,zacharylennard,Controversial Film That Is COMPLETELY Misunderstood,10,30 June 2020,"Before I get into anything, I will say that the first 15 minutes was a little bit too much. The first 15 minutes matched with the controversy that the film is still receiving to this day.Let's start with the marketing: Before the first trailer for this film made its way online, it was being shown only in theaters alongside Crawl, an alligator horror film. I saw Crawl in theaters and the trailer was shown in the previews. There was really nothing wrong the trailer in my opinion, however, the trailer made the film seem like a full fledged horror film with serious acting dialogue. To be honest: I thought it was going to be a political horror film. That is what I truly thought it was. After the film, I did some research and realized it is a Satire. For those that do not know what that is, it's defined as something that should not be taken seriously. I saw that a slew of promotional materials were being shown throughout the United States right after the Trailer made its way online, I will get to that in a moment. The marketing for this film made it seem like there was a unknown conflict between the filmmakers and the distribution company, which is Universal Pictures. Before the trailer made its way online, horrible shootings have occurred that literally scared people, then the trailer made its way online. That wasn't necessarily the studio's fault, it was mainly bad timing. That is when the controversy started. Before I get into the controversy itself, I honestly thought it would have started when the trailer was only being shown in theaters. That wasn't the case because even though Crawl was a critical darling, it did not do well at the box office. Not a lot people went to theaters to see Crawl. There's that. Back to the controversy. It was receiving backlash on all fronts, and I mean all fronts, not just the Republicans. The Democrats, Liberals, Socialists, and virtually every political party and it's associations had essentially made this film look like it is promoting violence. The only reason why I didn't contribute to any of the backlash is because 1.) I cannot judge something without seeing it, something that the majority of people that still need to learn. Don't judge a book by its cover. And 2.) I actually went ahead and researched the film before all of this happened. Even though I didn't have the whole story, I had more insight than those that were putting hate on the film. I defended this film and I still am. Even the United States President targeted the film as promoting hate, and he hasn't seen the film, nor looked into the film. I almost sided with the backlash. I truly did, not because of its interpretation the marketing was making what the film might be, but because it shouldn't be released due to the horrible timing of the shootings and the online release of the trailer. I truly almost sided with the backlash, just because of the terrible timing and bad luck. Thankfully, the executives at Universal listened and (at the time) indefinitely delayed the film until further notice.Sometime into 2020, the marketing started back up and Universal Pictures learned their lesson on what they did wrong and were now marketing the film as a satire. Only a few changed sides and gave the film a chance. What I thought was accurate, which was taglined in the trailer is by quote ""The Most Talked About Film Of The Year.........That No One Has Seen Yet"". Universal was going full throttle using the satire and the controversy for the marketing and promotion of the film. In my opinion, it honestly worked.By the time the film released in theaters, it didn't really have a chance at all, not because people were going to give the film a chance, again, some people actually did change sides, and I still think it might've done well at the box office, but because of the worsening conditions of the pandemic, known as Covid-19, or Coronavirus. The film was only in theaters for just the weekend before theaters started shutting down on Tuesday. Not great optimism for opening weekend results. By the time the film was released, people were not willing to go to movie theaters because of the Pandemic. I was actually able to see the film in theaters because everything worsened for the film industry. That just leaves............the film.Now here's my thoughts about the film. I thought the action was well done, the plot was decent, the acting was excellent, and the lead actresses, Protagonist Betty Gilpin and Antagonist Hilary Swank were just phenomenal. Obviously, even though the director and producers won't admit it, yet, the film went through multiple reshoots, probably as a response for all the controversy. I know this because the dialogue in the trailers were changed in the film and scenes were edited out of the film that were shown in the trailers. The only thing if I had the power to change anything, is the first 15 minutes of the film. The filmmakers could have made every opportunity to make the first minutes of the film not offensive in any way, but I was offended by that first opening scenes, and I'm not even a Republican. That's how offensive that was. My most hated line from the film is ""For the record a**hole, climate change is real."" That line alone almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I am not joking when I say that. Thank God gears were switched and changed as soon as Betty Gilpin, whose character is named Crystal, appears on screen in the gas station. There was great action sequences throughout the film. I even thought it was cool that she was able to tell that something was off before something bad happened. I was rooting for her in theaters, mainly because I was the only one in the screening. I would have rooted for her regardless.Granted, the satire could've have used more work to have a remote impact for the film, I will admit that. I will admit that the on screen deaths were in a way, cartoonish styled as well, however, besides the first 15 minutes, the film was great. This film will probably be considered one of the most misunderstood films of all time. And for those that never give things a chance because of how public perception twists the situation without having the full context (little pun for a scene in the film), I hope that you do give this chance. I will understand that the first 15 minutes will be rough, I understand that completely, but those minutes are very vital for the plot the film is trying to convey.Spoiler Alert for those that don't want to see the film without giving it a chance but may after I say this: The Republicans win. You're welcome.",The Hunt

But I was watching, thinking I know him, I know her, didn't realise she was in it and then, they simply were not in it anymore. This movie had no problem killing off the actors and actresses that us as an audience did know. which for me is very scream like with the Drew Barrymore opening sequence. which I loved.The action is more or less all the way through the movie. The end fight scene as well was totally awesome. I mean c'mon what man doesn't want to watch two females fight, and boy was it a fight.There was an element of comedy all the way through, honestly it had a Tarantino Vibe about this movie.

But the Hunt adds a great measure of fun in it's foray into the genre.It's looted w/ political undertones as a vehicle for plot but not too the point where it's preachy.

737,lxm_gsx,Could be better,6,6 April 2020,"I'd say it's entertaining enough, but could be better.The movie was actually doing really great at the start of ""The Hunt"". Emma Roberts woke up first, got plenty of scene time, found the key, and just when I thought she would be the lead character, she got shot. Then I thought the guy could be the one as he got the scene time and rescued the lady in the trap, but he got blew up and he, Justin Hartley, was not even credited. That was a fresh experience.So in the gas station part I was still wondering if it's the first act and there could be a second game with serious characters, the serious character, Betty Gilpin, showed up. They killed off too many characters too soon, so from that point I knew it's gonna be Betty versus whoever hides behind, which is way less interesting.There were enough entertaining scenes though, such as the lady that fell into the trap twice, the ""poisoned"" soda, the one seconds truce between Gilpin and Swank.

And a very exhausting and tragic thing.Logic aside- hatred prevents love. And loving each other is supposed to be what it's all about.Call me preachy but this just reminded me how much hate is in the world and how little genuine compassion and love is left in it.As a commentary on politics I realize it's supposed to be poking fun at all sides and giving an outlet for the animosity both ideologies feel for each other- but that doesn't make the animosity right.Here's an idea everyone- instead of killing each other how about we forgive and actually make an effort to get to know that person we hate so much?Why not actually try to be the neighbors and friends we're supposed to be for one another?And not argue, quarrel, and try to kill each other.Instead keep the focus on helping one another, producing, and genuinely loving each other.That's the world I want to live in. Not this selfish, money-driven, fear-based, apocalypse-berg you all have turned it into.How we treat each other and the choices we make create the world we live in.So let's make it a good one.

Expected a standard horror flick. I created an IMDb account just to write this review as catharsis after watching - I don't know how to describe this.Starts off fine, if unspectacular. The captives all get armed and ""The Hunt"" begins, as captors start firing upon them. I didn't think it was that well directed or acted, but it was fine.The real car-crash starts when three of them ""escape"" the perimeter fence and find a roadhouse. The roadhouse is run by a ma & pa couple, who it turns out were actually part of the hunters all along. The film fairly suddenly turns this into a liberal v conservative thing? The hunters are liberals and the hunted are conservatives and there's an avalanche of the standard taunts thrown out before the liberal ma & pa kill the conservatives.Another escapee enters the roadhouse and is told by them that she's in Arkansas. Between a bloodied dollar note and something about the price of cigarettes by state, she figures out ma & pa are hunters too so grabs the shotgun hiding below the counter (without hesitation) and kills them. She then goes outside and inspects their car. She finds out their Arkansas number plate was fake, she tears it off, to reveal that the ma & pa were Croatian for some reason? Are Croatians all liberal?A few more minutes, she meets up with another escapee, and the film seems hellbent on doing this as a liberal v conservative thing. I lasted forty minutes before switching off. Two stars simply for the laughing disbelief I experienced in this time.I don't know where they were going with the political coda of this, I don't really care. I don't mind my horror films going a bit silly, but as a non-American, the idea of hunting down a mainstream political group is as absurd as having people go to war over pineapple on pizza. That some people seem to so readily accept this pigeonholing and the figment of plausibility says something disturbing about American society to me.",The Hunt

The quirky hipster humor just does not do it for me, maybe if I was renting an apartment in a gentrified neighborhood in the city I would think it was hilarious or maybe if I had a degree in liberal arts I'd be in stitches, unfortunately I do not and this movie did absolutely nothing for me.6.99 on Amazon Prime that I would've rather just flushed down the toilet, total failure this movies was, sheesh.",The Hunt

The violence could have been utilitarian, but keeps missing its own purpose.And the plot.Is so thin and full of holes.I mean, our heroin kills all the villains but one in their hole, and goes after the endboss. This endboss is filled with hate and frustration, but dít not join in the hunt?

Betty Gilpin is brilliantly awkward. Maybe the movie is not for everyone's taste, but it delivers to those who are looking for something bloody, funny and brainy. Yes, as many reviewers have already mentioned, there is an obvious political satire at play, but this divide between left and right, which many reviewers are talking about, is not accurate. Indeed, there is a divide, but I didn't see anything ""left"" in the movie, and I am not sure I saw something ""right"" either.",The Hunt

It's succeeds in the slim And dangerous margin, achieving humor, where a miss could lead to rage. In this vein, it is one of the few movies coming out in the last few years to actually elevate movies from mere entertainment into true art.

802,flib1,Doesn't have the bite it should,6,1 April 2020,"Betty Gilpin does a fantastic job as the lead and the action scenes are shot competently.
The only criticism of the pacing I have is that they seem to burn through most of the ""hunting"" in the first sequence and then afterwards we're relegated to a cat and mouse largely featuring just the main character.
Personally I'd have preferred it if they prey were whittled down more slowly, which might be reason for my main problem with it, which is...
It's not got quite as much satirical bite as it thinks it has.
The liberal team is largely satirised by having them utter the kind of things right wing pundits claim liberals say.
There's a couple of lines that are pretty funny, but largely it's fairly uninspired.
And whilst there's an attempt at doing the same thing to the conservative team, there's not really any of them left after the first half an hour for any of the characters to interact, and the only two that are aren't what people expect.
So in that respect it seems a little biased towards making fun of the liberal camp.
But again, it doesn't really go far enough into really ripping into any position, it just seems content with throwing out a few worn out tropes and hoping people find that satirical enough, when it really isn't.
So in summary, it's a decent enough film, the action is well handled, the fight scenes nicely done.
The satirical side could have been a gold mine in the right hands, but this part just comes off as lazy.
It barks but it doesn't bite.",The Hunt

I am not a nationalist, but simple googling or writing an e-mail to your Croatian friend would have done the job. The registration plate on the car is so wrong, couldnt they just google ""croatian registration plate""?!
In the train scene, writings on the box say this end up, the Croatian says ""ovde zavrsite"". ""Ovde"" is not even a Croatian word, and techinally the translation is ""finish here"". It would be good i they just used google translation, but their level of laziness was even bigger than google translate.

How much of the movie actually features anything resembling a hunt? Answer, the first 30 minutes if that. After most of the stupid and irrelevant cast are done away with in gruesome and visceral ways, the rest of the story features a woman with a barely-intelligible Southern accent spouting utter gibbersih that could only have come from playing a game of consequences.
I know the film is played as a black comedy but the amusing bits are played so heavy-handedly that any tension which may have been suggested by the plot(itself derived from ""The Most Dangerous Game"")is lost.
I am certainly no prude but the gratuitous use of the F-bomb becomes tiring and unfortunately, there are far too many films that make use of this expletive. Come on guys, give us an intelligent script without recourse to cursing...it can be done!
The fight at the end would ensure Bruce Lee remains unturned in his grave. Just how much injury and battering can these women take without becoming severely disabled?

It's not the worst attempt at political horror satire ever but it both failed to be funny and scary, it wasn't even surprising. Even when the Big Bad was revealed it was so uninteresting that's when I started to doze off.The American political atmosphere is utterly bizarre to those of us outside the US and sadly the absurdity of the film didn't really compliment that, just made it even more uncomfortable. I couldn't tell whether the creators wanted to make us sympathize for people who'd be happy killing others with their guns if the tables weren't being turned on them, but they sure made me hate all the catchphrases and conspiracy theories even more than I usually do!The real shame of it is that I think the actors did a grand job with what they had and there were some real stars who given the opportunity with a better premise and script could have been truly funny AND frightening.Lastly, the effects weren't just low budget they were cringe af.",The Hunt

The democrats are waging a war not only with themselves BUT also with everybody else - in this movie you can see that in their interactions with one another. They are never in agreement - the ""black"" vs ""african americans"" ; the cultural appropriation of the Kimono per example; the not inclusing of a black republican because well he is black and so on, the ""guys"" gender stuff. They are depicted as a snake that eats his/her own tail.The republicans - the ones who are being hunted are what you expect from a normal news media - rednecks who are either racist, homophobes and every other bad thing you can imagine - no redeeming quality whatsoever. They are there to be killedThe Refugees stuff was very entertaining...Spoilers NOW:
Our main character as we find out, well we don't find out, what political party she is but we know that she is representing the middle ground. Those who are undecided; un-interested and so on.In the end we find out that she is there by mistake and so she is the battleground of right and left and yet she had to suffer. This represents how the far left alienates not only the republicans but other moderate democrats.In the end, this movie could have been made as a propagana against the far-right or far left but in my humble opinion is a critique of every spectre (more the far-left) maybe as warning because some of those actors for what I can understand are democrats.Either way, I enjoy the show.

She truly brings her A-game to this film, similar to the way Samara Weaving did in Ready or Not. The supporting cast - for the most part - serves their purpose quite diligently. When I watched the trailer, I was drawn in to the film by names such as Emma Roberts, Ike Barinholtz, Justin Harltey, etc. but when the film started I was hooked by Betty Gilpin.This is an excellently made action/""horror""/thriller film that effectively adds in a bit of comedy every now and again. There's even a point in the film where one of the characters literally says ""No More Glass"" mid-fight scene because so much glass had been broken prior to that.The film has you hooked from start to finish and - for the most part - keeps you guessing until the credits start rolling, potentially even after.All in all, I give this excellent work of art a solid 9/10",The Hunt

It's some action/thriller/comedy deformity.The script is just so ridiculously lazy that it seems to have been drafted directly from the mind of a pubescent teenager with a superiority complex. The idea isn't fundamentally bad, but the plot is being made with cheap tricks and surface level observations. So black and white that the only provoking aspect is how unprovoking it is.The movie aims to take a humanitarian stance and is trying to say that 'were all the same'. It holds on to this belief by dumbing the characters down, rather than to face obstacles and tackle them in a clever way.

867,ken-gcritique,"Film critique: Dystopian universe of ""The Hunt"" or (Analytical approach to symbolic reduction on the principle of Orwell 's ""Animal Farm"")",10,6 November 2020,"Why is the critical thought of The Hunt divided into two extremes, to the extent that it ignores - or simply does not see, or does not want to see - some of the universal messages that the film carries and successfully displays, compared to many other unsuccessful and ambiguous messages which are controversial or unclear? But are they? And also, why do some of critics superficially view this film as a incoplite political satire, a poor or loose representation of the ideas of films like ""The Most Dangerous Game"", Ready or Not; or nothing more but the senseless bloodthirstiness of a man, disire to ""Hunt"" and kill; or the failed attempt to refer to Orwell's Animal Farm, etc?""This movie setting ''liberals against conservatives'' was initially pulled from release after being attacked by the President. But the movie is smarter than its critics"", writes Caryn James. So, watching this film one-sidedly is truly ungrateful, and many of the critiques out there do not see or do not want to see the power of universal messages.
Trump, who didn't specifically mention ""The Hunt"" by title, tweeted that ""the movie coming out is made in order ... to inflame and cause chaos.'' Which was probably the main reason for divided values, terfore, the result of mixed score might be mostly politically motivated.In essence, frstly, The Hunt has some great initial ideas, some of which are a bit misrepresented; secondly, some of which are somehow incomplete and unspoken, and thirdly, some of which are ambiguous to the point of complicating the analytical procedure and causing problems for the critical mind. Keeping all that in mind, these two ideas are clear - a call to constant critical thinking and questioning our reality, and even the truth of the information we are buried with in the modern world. That is, that we should never, and at no time, take for granted any of those informations out there. And the second: humanity's aspiration for power, totalitarian control of chosen or selected individuals, constant warfare and the destruction of others in one dystopian universe in which two ideological extremes escalate to the level of maximum intolerance leading to the manifestation of the inner destructive nature of man.Therefore, the idea of a fighter for survival - a primordial idea - in an endangered situation, is woven into the protagonist called Criystal (Snowball), but without her, subjective, tendency to think and ask questions about it. She is persecuted, but unquestioningly kills her persecutors. (The authors here leaves viewers in a quandary, who probably ask themselves the following: Why doesn't the hero seeks the reson of his persecution? Why doesn't she look for the answers? However, what the hero knows, seeks and represents, viewers can later find as a confirmation in Crystal's story about the ""rabbit"".Namely, Crystal, as a protagonist, functions in the film as someone who does not belong to either side. She was mistakenly chosen to be the victim of persecution, and all because of one wrong letter in her last name. That mistake later leads the persecutors to their death, because she is a skilled warrior that kills without questioning. The killing in the film is also symbolic: in reality, people die in terribly different ways - people who blindly follow false information on social networks, who are being ignorant proponents of conspiracy theories, racism, etc. But in a figurative sense, their ideology is what dies, and the message of the film is actually the death of the ideologies to which these people are attached.But the killng can't happen in America, the land of law and democracy. For the killing to be allowed dislocation of space must occur. So the space in the film must be neutral as well, the persecuted realizes later that they are in Croatia. (Dislocation of time-space from the normal framework of the United States to Croatia - as one of the Balkan countries affected by the war - states that not only the reality is called into question by this displacement of space, but also that everything is allowed in a war-torn area).Crystal, at one point, tells the story of a boastful rabbit who lost a race with a turtle because he accidentally fell asleep, only to later kill an entire family of turtles, and than sat down and ate their dinner. Don, at that point, asks Crystal: who is the rabbit then, is it Us, or Them? However, she gives him no answer, she looks at him quietly and than look's at the forest, couse something is coming out. (A that point, he asked a wrong question, couse he did not understood the point of the story. Nither did we, at that point) But, at the moment later, suprisingly, a dressed pig comes out of the forest. Dressed pig personifies humans, and it comes as the answer to Don's question: She is actually a pig who intends to destroy other pigs. The symbolic representation of the pig is ambiguous: abundance, power, relaxation, happiness... However, as the film refers to the Orwell's Animal Farm, that will lead us to a symbolic reduction to other meanings: the basis of the Communist Party, or pig--Napoleon as a representation of (Stalin), and on the other hand, Snowball (Crystal), as a rebellion pig. This means that she is neither, nor a rabbit nor a turtle, but a pig that intends to kill other pigs. The symbolic representation of the rabbit, in the universal sense, signifies rebirth, and it happens at the end of the film. Snowball (Crystal) becomes Rabbit at the end, her transformation into a rabbit symbolizes new life, freedom and procreation.Forest, acording to Jung: is a mystical, wild, frightening and numinous place, which in mythologies around the world is inhabited by archetypal figures of the unconscious, or mythological creatures such as gods, demons, giants, dwarves, nymphs, witches, fairies, gnomes, various monsters and wild animals...The fear of the forest in analytical psychology is, in fact, the primordial fear of the frightening, dangerous and irrational forces that dwell in our unconscious - in this case totalitarianisam. Universlay, forset represents the place of sin, lust, contempt, deception, and Crystal understands the game very well, so she embrace the ultimate destructive element of it, and goes back to the forest in order to defeat the evil.To see a more complex, symbolic representation of this film, and truly
percive its universal messages - it is only possible if we simultaneously view the film as a form of artistic expression of ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings and messages that refer to some active topics in our devided society, such as: conspiracy theories, political situations, rasizam, missinformations, humans and its act of depresonalization into pigs, or descent at animal level etc.Artists, or movie makers, indeed have a complete freedom in organizig, exposing, or deconstructing our reality, then justifying and making senseless ideas at its own discretion. Even a no meaning is a meaning on it's own. That is a nihilistic tendency of Modernism, and later Postmodernism - incompleteness, confusion of readers or viewers, intertextuality or referity, meaninglessness of meaning, dekonstructions and depersonalization, devastations of other texts, books or scripts of other movies, ect.Zobel says that ""this movie isn't controversial, that wasnt the point, and it's more like satirical action-thriller, then it is a horror. It is not even an anti-Trump movie, but anti everybody movie..."" ''It is more like what we believe about one another. You say things in casual conversation or you use violent language talking about the other side. Let us show you what that looks like in practice.""As Damon Lindelof says: ""The film they are talking about is not the film that we made. This film is not only about the elite hunting normal people for pleasure and sports, but at the same time, the film is about crazy conspiracy theories, it is about believing anything, it's about not understanding the other side, it's about the idea of the other side. I acknowlege that we live in divided times. But i also acknowlege that people don't like being devided. Ironicly, The Hunt was sort of designed to create a space where we could laugh at ourselvs, more ourselvs than one another.""With all this in mind, the film is well designed in a technical sense: camera work, screenplay, acting, and it constantly keeps a smile on the face.",The Hunt

I'll give the filmmakers credit for some surprisingly sudden deaths (one of the bigger names in the cast dies in the first five minutes setting up suspense throughout the rest of the running time). I wish The Hunt took more chances with its timely story instead of becoming another Most Dangerous Game update. The film pokes fun at both sides of our fractured nation but the liberal characters are far less appealing and the hero(anti hero?) seems non partisan when her true identity is revealed.

886,frenchie-mac,Underwhelming and uninspired,3,6 December 2020,"This movie started off with an interesting, yet over-used opening. Having felt eager to watch The Hunt I have obviously put my expectations way, way too high.The lazy writing and cliche storyline made the movie progress at a snails pace. Though, some kills in the movie were smart, and temporarily engaged me with the story, the rest of the film had me wishing I was watching something with a bit more substance.All in all, if I had to recommend this movie, it would be only because you have quite literally nothing else to watch, or you enjoy making bad decisions and wasting your own time.",The Hunt

More gory than it needed to be, still, with costuming, sets and motivation they get it all right. Has a sense of humor about itself, it's clever and means something. I get at the end why all these actors wanted to make it happen.",The Hunt

The left are portrayed as the right see them, and vice versa.No room for subtlety here, where the cartoon stereotypes and cartoon violence are perfectly apt as the film takes square aim at the cartoon opinions found on Twitter and in comments sections these days.None of the film bears any relation to reality, and yet it doesn't come close to how bizarre most of the widely-supported conspiracy theories are that you will find online.Hopefully, this film may plant the seed that such extreme beliefs may require a little more consideration.

If you're looking for a comedy-satire this is for you. If you're looking for something along the lines of ""Surviving The Game"" save your time and money.

892,johnsonbe3,Betty Gilpin stole the show! Great satire about people bias.,10,22 March 2020,"The Hunt is a satirical action/ horror starring Oscar winner Hilary Swank and Betty Gilpin from Netflix's GLOW. When you think of Hilary Swank, you think of great performances like Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby. You can add this movie in her great career, because she is fierce, scary and probably give one of the funniest performances of her career in this movie.Betty Gilpin stole the show as Crystal, one of the 12 ""deplorables"" who definitely wasn't tolerating this madness when these hunters try to hunt her and the others because of their political beliefs. Gilpin performance was the funniest throughout the entire movie with her humming, quirks, laughs and facial expressions.The fight scene between Swank and Gilpin is intense reminiscent to Tarantino's Kill Bill and John Carpenter's They Live: Gritty and hilarious!This movie is considered to be controversial because you have the left hunting the right. The theme of the Hunt from what I observed is that both political sides in this country think they are superior by saying which one is the best, but in reality, both sides of spectrum are neither better. I also felt like that Gilpin character Crystal represent the middle between both sides because, she wants to live and enjoy her life despite the fact she have to kill these hunters.I really enjoyed this movie with the action, humor and political satire. This movie is like watching Hard Target mix with The Hunger Games. It's unfortunate that I had to watch this movie, but it's cool that I pay $20 to rent this movie!",The Hunt

What if both extremes of each political faction did battle?The result is kind of perfect, in that a non-extreme individual is pulled into the craziness of both factions and how the voice of the non-extreme are often muted within the furor.Most of us are on neither extreme and are caught up in the assumptions of the extremes, fighting an internal war we can't agree with, regardless of our general political opinions...",The Hunt

It reflects the prejudice of people on the left and right and the damage caused by demonizing those who oppose your ideas.The Hunt is a wonderful satire of people who prefer to live in their own bubble and conclude anyone on the outside is less than good. In this case, the left gets their turn to be the villain and the girl from Mississippi gets her chance to challenge the stereotype.Reading Animal Farm ahead of time will add to the enjoyment and your understanding of why the left must cancel people. (The right does too, but the right isn't supposed to uphold liberal values). They cancelled Orwell when he left the bubble, fought in Spain, and returned with a narrative which challenged the notion the left held the moral high ground.",The Hunt

903,matijazic,Movie lost in political MESSages,3,23 March 2020,"I got interested in this movie because I thought it would be something along the lines of Hostel, Saw, Cube, House of 9 or similar movies. Ratings seemed decent, had a good cast and an interesting plot. By all criteria, I should've gotten an entertaining movie. Instead, I got... this.This movie, while desperately trying to appear intelligent and opinionated, is completely hollow and unfunny. The movie has a desperate need to preach but has nothing to say. It's like a spoiled child who just wants to be heard and to be noticed. It's not a thriller, it's not a comedy, this movie tries to define itself as it goes along and never manages to go further than being a mess.My initial disappointment turned into curiosity when it was revealed that the plot takes place in Croatia because that's where I'm from. The movie got pretty much everything wrong: the license plate, the sign ""this side up"" on boxes was translated as ""finish this"", the military tags were bogus... all simple things that could've been done right if only they invested 2 minutes into a simple google research. Sadly, the same half-assed effort was put into developing an engaging story, dialogues and character development.The ""croatian"" military and other people do not speak anything comprehensible and it's awkward watching these actors trying to imitate sounds they've heard elsewhere. The way non-US countries get depicted in some movies is nothing new and it's always interesting to see how people without passports see the world outside USA.For me, the first third of the movie was spent crushing any hope for a good movie, second third I was hooked looking at mistakes they are making trying to portray Croatia and final third was reserved to satisfy my morbid curiosity of seeing where career of Hilary Swank has gone. She's first shown late in the movie but it doesn't feel like it's because of plot or exposure reasons, it felt like it was because she limited by contract how much time she has to appear in this mess to get paid. Betty Gilpin keeps an expression of annoyance and discomfort throughout the movie, it is hard to say how much of it is acting, but her presence is one of the rare bright spots of this movie.",The Hunt

917,jlilley-56459,"Unpredictable, hilarious and clever!",9,15 April 2020,"I watched this film for the first time last night and loved almost every minute!The Hunt is action packed from the opening scene and provides viewers with a great doss of gore, hilarity and unpredictable outcomes. This film felt like a mashup of several violent and political movies before, reminding me of 'The Purge' (from the same director) meets 'The Hunger Games', with a side of Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' action.You never know what to expect, with the arguably most well known actress (Emma Roberts) being killed off within minutes and the typical 'alpha male' character which is set up to seem like a possible love interest dying quickly after.The political comedy is clever, taking shots at both sides of the spectrum at the appropriate time during the movie. I found myself agreeing with points on both teams, it certainly gives you a few minutes of reflection.The initially confusing middle of the film taking the action away to a refugee camp is both clever and dull. It provides the political backdrop of the movie with a chance to demonstrate the real hardships that actual refugees face, suggesting what the average American will never face, but it feels forced and could have been cut, keeping the film to pure action and gore!Some of the characters could have been explored further and this is lacking mainly due to the quick and rapid deaths of most of the 'hunted' within the first 15 minutes. However, more time could have been spent on the liberal elite chasing down their victims and toying with them. One scene shows an 'elite' trying to make a victim understand why they are being hunted, yet 8/12 deaths are simply quick and don't seem to serve the same purpose of ""understanding why you are being hunted""? There are some great characters on the liberal elite side who could have been developed further.The ending reminded me of the classic fight at the end of 'Kill Bill' for its quirky and fast action, to its unrealistic yet amazing carnage.Overall, The Hunt is fast-paced, clever and deadly, offering the audience more than they bargained for. A sequel with more players and more action would be a good direction to go!",The Hunt

947,thnovmbrman,Presidential election meets animal farm action packed horror film!,5,9 April 2020,"I rented the home preimer of the 2020 thriller/action the hunt. Let me tell you, the writers of this movie managed to take things we find boring such as the 2016 presidential election and take a modern twist on them. 12 deplorables are kidnapped and taken to a remote location were they are hunted for sport. The plot of the story manages to intertwine the 2016 USA presidential election. Along with George Orwell's Animal farm. Action packed but equally as absurd!
The hunt foreshadowing 🚨spoilers🚨 >!The Hunt does a excellent job of foreshadowing. The movie uses terms like deplorables, and manorgate. This is because the 2016 presidential election Hillary Clinton's used the phrase ""Basket of deplorables"" to describe trump supporters. The entire idea behind the film is mirrored off the political spectrum in USA. The left side says the right side will believe anything the media releases. Left side being Democrats and the right side being Republicans. I agree with the idea however I feel as though any point that the hunt was trying to make as a view is over shadowed and obliterated by the amount of gore and violence it has throughout the entire movie. The movie makes a reference to animal farm by building this conspiracy involving manorgate (details to come) for those of you that have read animal farm are aware of Mr Jones of the Manor farm! Manorgate conspiracy theory involves a group of left wingers who had a conversation leaked involving a joke about rounding up ""deplorables"" and hunting them for sport. The jokesters involved lose they're jobs as the deplorables have taken this seriously and are scared for there safety. As a result they're off and come up with the idea to make the conspiracy theory true. They round up the deplorables who were involved in spreading the rumour that ruined there lives and give them what they asked for.!< All in all this movie came off as a little bit of a disappointment it was missing the wow factor that separates good movies from great.

With bad writing, underdeveloped villains, and an overtly political message, the movie doesn't lend itself to just being a fun watch.

952,codeman-11411,Thoroughly enjoyed it.,10,23 April 2020,"I thought the movie was great. Original and humorous. And while political stances were used to set up the plot and some of the humor, I think that's all it was. I didn't see any political message or anything so I suggest just giving it a try even if you are sensitive to such things. The one argument I can understand against this movie is about it's classification. Those looking for a strict Action, Horror, Thriller might be disappointed to see it's unserious and humorous nature. I would describe the nature similar to The Cabin in the Woods if you've seen that.",The Hunt
953,raithenor,It's not 50/50,9,28 April 2020,"I read on ""Vox"" (whatever that is) that ""The Hunt"" failed because it wasn't a true satire. I agree with their analysis, but not the verdict.I liked ""The Hunt"" because it turned out you couldn't stereotype Crystal. She was just ""Crystal,"" and you didn't even know that much about her other than the fact she wasn't going to let the jackrabbit win. The movie isn't a satire about the political divide, it's just plain humor in a playground combat arena that proffers the background concept that anyone that simply knows what they want and how to achieve it never has to take a political viewpoint, or take a backseat to one.",The Hunt
954,mrguyg,Stupid movie.,2,29 April 2020,"This had to be the worst movie I have watched in at least 20 years. Predictable and unimaginative and not at all suspenseful.

For me, this movie is one of the best horror movie I've ever watched this year. So fun, funny, intense, and bloody. I highly recommend this movie. You've got to see it to believe it. Right from the start you can't tell where this movie is going. There's some violence but it's easy to watch as you're on the edge of your seat hoping the hero will succeed. I've never seen a movie done like those before. It's a first for this genre. I give it an easy 10 stars out of 10.

I was hesitant to watch it because of all the negative hype, but it was nothing like what I had heard. Yes, its kinda political but in a jokey way, and they take shots at both sides. If you're offended by this movie, you should probably take a step back and ask yourself why. The bad reviews I've read seem to be from people on the left who maybe didn't like being the ""bad guy"", but honestly, they're reading into it too much. The most offensive part was some insulting from Hillary Swank's character toward ""rednecks"". Just watch it...",The Hunt
961,mackharder,Pretty refreshing,10,14 September 2020,"This was refreshing and entertaining. I think liberal Hollywood, Netflix, HBO, late night talk shows, etc often forget that half the country is republican and they constantly alienate them with their anti-conservative programming. It's really a massive untapped market because all we ever get is liberal beliefs shoved in our faces. This movie was entertaining, I don't feel super anti-liberal even still as it still somewhat judgmental of who republicans are. Kept you guessing on who exactly the main character the first half hour. This is 2 hours and it really seemed shorter. Goes by quick. I guess that's a testament to the level of engagement.

The movie is overall great, and it manages to keep the viewers attention throughout the movie with different plot-twists and character development.

The lead actress was cast perfectly and she her dedication and quirkiness make you want to see her journey through.

She really feels like a soft spoken lady from some redneck town, who just does not give a hoot about any of this political nonsense.The whole movie plays on silly stereotypes and assumptions, some are only enforced, while some are bent in a way that you really see how silly they are.In the end you'll be cheering on this action packed lady as she confronts the final boss.Don't turn your head to this movie just because of the current political propaganda.

For the life of me I can't figure out why this was classified as such. Honestly, if you can watch The Walking Dead on cable, you'll be fine with this! I've seen a lot more suspense and horror on TV shows. I have a feeling the mis-classification had effect on the overall score of the movie.So this movie attempts to capture the vibe of The Purge and Hunger Games series, riding that wave to a box-office hit. Sadly it wasn't nearly as original, coping many idea's directly from those movies. However this movie was decently entertaining. While not a terrible movie, it was predictable and by the end of the first 20 min you could easily see the direction the story was going. (and predict how it would end)The acting overall wasn't awful but the script it's self is lacking. The heroine seems to know too much and be able to survive everything thrown at her which makes the movie further unrealistic.The special effects were overall enjoyably decent (for this genre) with lots of explosions and body parts flying. The special features help illustrate the efforts of the production staff in selling the story, but overall don't make up for the poorly written script.This was entertaining but I am glad it was only a rental movie and I didn't pay real 'movie theater' prices to see it. The political overtones (which were announced 7 or 8 months before I saw the movie) are probably the biggest reason anyone would watch the film and that 'drama' is really the reason the movie will have any future.",The Hunt

1000,jay-whitney-168-6304,I Like Dystopian Satire with Pointed Sarcatic Humor. This film fits the bill with a cherry on top!,10,23 March 2020,"I enjoyed this satirical movie with its exaqggerated commentary about something truly delusional and ridiculous in today's America. I confess that I share the outlook it paints about today's ""Deplorables"" and ""Elites."" I have already risked being banned by Facebook, ""unfriended"" by friends, family, and acquaintances alike, having profusely (and profanely without swearing) commented on its insipid divisiveness.I found this film's premise to be inspired, although I mean inspired by the contemporary dystopian, highly classed societies depicted in the ""Hunter Games"" and ""Divergent"" franchises, and movies such ""The Island"", other influential mythologies from the past concern displayed through exaggeration can include ""Logan's Run"" and its age as class stratifier, Orwell's ""Animal Farm"", and more parallel with the new (1995) Outer Limits' Season 4 (1998) Episode 2 called, perhaps coincidentally, ""The Hunt"". The discrfiminating factor in this society to have their ""deplorables"" hunted by the ""elite"" is that they were androids who had become sentient, but since they were ""only machines"" they could be killed for sport. Even that resembles an older P. K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" which was of course immortalized for the deplorables amongst us who cannot or refuse to read, as ""Blade Runner,"" with young Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer as examples of the two sides of their statistical discriminating universe of ""right to live free"" or ""right to kill for having such a ridiculous desire.""This movie is an indirect comment on this appalling situation, and given Hollywood's inherent stance within the movie's antagonist ""elite"" commuity, it is no wonder Universal delayed giving a voice to the ""deplorable"" protagonist population (some ""deplorables"" are math, philosophical, computer science, environmental, technology [... &c.] visionaries having already made the ""elite's"" presumptious and unwarranted manifest hubris a great and natural and inherent source for its obvious and gratuitous , and makes an obvious source of ironic material for the screenwriters.Here one will find guns and violence as the exaggeration of something that should remain ideas and words. Stratifying and separating classes into the ""deplorable"" prey vs the hypocrite ""elites"" hunters exaggerate something that should be a mutual growth of shared ides. Even though this film was easy to write, some will feel it ""needed to be said"" in another voice and others may predictably and regrettably wonder what the point is.",The Hunt

I can understand cutting out one or two fast, but at least 6 out of the 12 are wasted within the first few moment. It led me to think, ""is this a situation where they can come back to life, or are they already legit dead?""

But what makes it different is the way story is being told. Most of the movies of this kind are being filmed from the point of view of the guys being hunted but this has an another angle; it tells the story from both perspectives, the hunters and the hunted. Captivating indeed. There are twists. I personally believe that story could have been better although the idea was great. Ending could have been better too.

1012,authoress_angie,Don't Be Fooled; This Isn't a Horror Movie,1,13 June 2020,"This movie is listed as a horror, thriller, and action movie. Don't believe it. If anything, this movie is more of a dark comedy. I expected it to be edgy and filled with moments that would keep me on the edge of my seat. The trailer definitely makes it seem that way. Unfortunately, there's nothing remotely scary about this movie (unless, of course, you count pointless gore as ""scary""). Seriously, can you tell me what's horrific about a man cracking an offensive joke while shoving a grenade down another man's pants? The only thing scary about this movie are the terrible attempts to be funny. The main battle is purposefully goofy. All the ""horror"" moments (like a woman literally being blown in half) is made comical. Said severed woman, with her organs strewn about, is totally coherent and calls another person a snowflake while laying in a pit of spikes. It's an over-the-top, bloody comedy. The only thing that remained true is that it's listed in the action category as well, and there are quite a few action-packed sequences in this movie. They're stupid and over the top, but action filled nonetheless.This movie is made to look like a mix of ""Animal Farm"" and ""The Hunger Games"". Instead, it's bland and extremely obvious. After the first ""twist"", you literally see everything else coming. Even that first ""twist"" is easy to guess. I kid you not when I say that every single person in the movie (with the exception of the head female role) is a hidden antagonist. Those nice elderly people in the gas station? Baddies. The nice guy who was taking you back to America? A bad guy. That guy you were working with in order to survive? A bad guy. It's the same shocker moment used multiple times, and it's just annoying after a while.The antagonists in this movie are cringe-worthy. There's a scene where they're literally sitting together discussing the ""likes"" they have on their social media accounts, talking like idiotic teenagers. The ""good guys"" have their moments, but most of them are frustratingly stupid as well. The only main protagonist is a jerk who is thrown into the cliched category of the indestructible survivalist. She sees every little thing coming. She knows the people in the gas station are working against her because of the price of the cigarettes she tries to buy. Let's be honest...how many people know the price of cigarettes in a state where they don't live? It's unbelievable. She also knows that the car she's about to approach has a bomb strapped underneath it within five seconds of approaching the vehicle. They try to give her an explanation as to why she's so good at these things, but it's still so cheesy that I couldn't bring myself to believe it.Don't waste your time on this movie. Don't believe the trailers you saw for it. None of it is true. It's just some political movie with over the top goofiness that tries too hard to be funny, but fails miserably. If you want a good horror/thriller movie, this isn't the movie for you.",The Hunt
1013,biguk,Just a bit boring and easy,5,27 June 2020,"The Hunt is a straight forward plot. A group of people kidnapped and released into the wild and hunted down by rich, over confident snobs. But it's just a bit rubbish.The first 15-20 are great, but when the shooting starts the plot goes out of the window. Everything is far to easy for the protagonist, and she completes are mission with relative ease. You never feel like Betty Gilpin is in any danger against the group of gun toting rich A-holes.It's a shame really this could have been a great watch, but I finished it thinking I'd wasted my time. I wanted a deeper plot and and more character development.",The Hunt
1014,andrejtrepic,I swear I could hear my IQ dropping while watching this,1,8 April 2020,"So many mistakes in the movie that it looks like screenwriters, the director, executive director had a massive hangover when they decided to do this!",The Hunt

1017,simon8783,I can honestly say this was the worst film I think I have ever seen,1,25 July 2020,Ridiculous plot which was meant to be darkly funny but was so shocking bad. How it was billed as some kind of horror/drama is beyond me and how Hilary Swank agreed to be in this pile of dung is amazing.,The Hunt
1018,hypr-aktiv,Excellent thrill ride,10,23 March 2020,"I can't believe the hate, great action flick. The film swerved into Some interesting themes and pokes fun at all sides of the political spectrum. It's an edge of your seat wild ride. Not an amazing work of are but supremely entertaining.",The Hunt
1019,h-angie2104,Not what I expected,7,22 June 2020,"So I went to the movies with a friend of mine just because we hadn't been to the movies in forever and I was in a horror movie kind of mood and we though ""why not watch this one"". We had no idea what we were watching and to be honest I'm still no entirely sure. It wasn't scary like we were hoping but we still had a lot of fun watching it. It was very dumb and pointless for the most part but that's exactly what made it such a laugh. Tears were flowing due to the absurd scenes and facial expressions. So it's not what i expected, but I'm glad I watched it.",The Hunt
1020,Archangel7877,Red vs Blue,1,12 March 2020,"This film was originally stonewalled because of its heavy political reviews and it looks like Hollywood simply wants to continue dividing our country. If you support this film, then you are only further dividing this country yourself as well.This is a ""blue vs red"" no matter how you put it and it is extremely sad that in today's time, we as a nation, could even consider watching something like this...In short, to make a movie about deplorables is just sickening and full of hate.You can find the archived historical reviews and insights from the film and see that it truly was and is currently a dividing movie for our nation.",The Hunt
1021,stiley,Not so exciting for those outside US,3,6 June 2021,"Based on the score and reviews, I was expecting a clever action thriller. However, for the movie to function, you really need to live and breath the strongly polarized US political situation. Now I understand that the movie toys with the roles of liberals and conservatives. But to the average European, none of it works. The jokes won't land (btw, it should list comedy as a genre), while the action and acting are were not good enough to save it in my opinion. It just doesn't hold your interest at all. I've seen it compared to the likes of You're Next or Ready or Not, but this is not fair, since those movies stand splendidly on their own. I have to add that I adored Mare of Easttown series from the same director. So clearly he has talent. If this movie worked for you, then great. Perhaps it managed to get some laughs out of the tense political zeitgeist. I just wanted to offer a different kind of view as an 'outsider', so please don't hold it against me :-).",The Hunt

1025,marganw,Betty Gilpin.,10,28 March 2020,That's it. That's pretty much it. Betty Gilpin is breathtakingly great in this movie. Give her all the awards and all the roles. My goodness.,The Hunt
1026,rogers_t,Yea for different,9,2 August 2021,"I loved this. It continually kept me off balance and guessing what was going to happen next. Betty Gilpin is awesome. Yeah the kill scenes are gross, but that's what we've let our world become.",The Hunt

1032,taravalis,Oxymoron,2,3 May 2020,"Beside mindless fun, there is one thing I simply could not get over...This film is an oxymoron par excellence... For a wanna-be edgy movie that talks about educated high-class bourgeois killing off the ""uneducated rednecks"", the makers of this film showed to be the latter.
Every single ""Croatian"" reference in the movie, spoken or written, was absolute childish gibberish. Never mind the weird portraying of the Croats as ""paprika eating mustache men"". But, were you so cheap not to find and pay a translator?You can quote Orwell's Animal farm all you want (which is, btw, an obligatory reading for ten year olds in Croatia), trying to make some (outdated) philosophical claims and add ""value"" to the film. But please, stop being so ignorant and actually find that one Croatian pal you met as a tourist on our coast, and ask them to translate things for you. This goes to all of the people in film industry out there - I've heard/read more gibberish European languages in films lately then I have in nursery rhymes.Now, you can invite me to your ""manor"" in Croatia.Justice4Yall",The Hunt

1037,theminerinreal,Trying way too hard,3,2 April 2020,"Yeah I understand that it was supposed to be politically satire and all, but the ""comedy"" is pushed too hard and it actually takes effort to have fun. The story is there just so that people can follow linearity. The action is enjoyable, but it's surprisingly rare. Production value, acting, writing, directing... all of these are looked over just to make the movie ""satire"". You don't have to sacrifice quality in order to achieve satire. Also, there is no sense of comedy in the movie, it tries to take itself seriously. It isn't even categorised as a comedy. I don't see how anyone would have fun with this, go watch something else.",The Hunt
1038,bendermoriarti,"Unfunny comedy, politically correct silliness.",2,4 June 2020,"Movie tries to be politically relevant by gender swapping the Rambo-type stoic lead, making any and all men fat, stupid, bigot or a combination of the above. This guaranties some ""funny"", ""witty"" one-liners from the Rambo wannabe that made the movie barely watchable. The final face-off was good on the choreographic department but well, a lot of suspension of disbelief is needed to invest yourself in the fight scene. Don't waste your time, you have been warned.",The Hunt

1048,aliloux,A fun ride for people with a sense of humor,8,28 March 2020,"If you're willing to throw your stupidly extreme political biasis away you can enjoy this film for its innovative way of introducing the main character, terrific action sequences and spot on comedic timing. Betty Gilpin elevates the movie with her performance and Carries it as a voice for the centrists or people who don't subscribe to the extremes of the American political spectrum showing the constant battle for what it is; just idiotic point of views taking themselves way too seriously while she just navigates the storm carelessly, all in the satirical context of the film",The Hunt
1049,peter-hills-1,Really fun film. The 1 star idiots are dragging this down.,8,25 July 2020,Fun from start to finish. The plot's fairly lightweight but if you're after an hour and a half of easy-gore and funny bits then you'll love this film.,The Hunt
