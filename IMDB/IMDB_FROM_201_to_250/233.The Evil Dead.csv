0,Leofwine_draca,"The ultimate in raw, independent film-making",9,9 July 2016,"Sam Raimi's acclaimed horror debut is certainly not for the faint of heart. As the advertising slogan goes, what many consider to be ""the ultimate experience in gruelling terror"" is a gripping, frightening, gory roller-coaster ride through all manner of unbelievable and scary happenings. I actually think the first half hour of this film is the best, just before all hell breaks loose and the special effects guys have a field day. The first half hour is the set up, an atmospheric sequence full of dark shadows, spooky cellars and the eerie isolation of a remote cabin in the woods - the film manages to tap into the same fears that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT later exploited.The amateur nature of the film means that the acting can hardly be called ""refined"", although most of the youngsters manage to make their characters likable and convincingly portray terrified people. Favourites include Cheryl, who is the first to get spooked out and who draws a picture of the book of the dead; Scotty, the joker and natural leader of the group; and Ash, who overcomes being a wimp in the first half to become a shotgun-wielding executioner in the second. The amateurish aspect does have its strong points however, as the film exudes a kind of ""raw terror"" in which the viewer can really relate to the characters and their situation.The graphic gore content certainly earned the film a notoriety - it was very nearly classified as a ""video nasty"" - and of course it got heavily cut by the BBFC. Seen uncut, it's a surprisingly nasty and gruesome little film where the gore may not be convincing but is certainly disturbing. Watching a zombie biting off its own hand from which a white liquid then sprays is one of the most horrible things I've watched. Other ""highlights"" include a scene where a zombie is dismembered with an axe and the body parts continue to wriggle like jelly, a woman getting stabbed in the ankle with a pencil, an eye-gouging, a zombie getting its face burnt off in a fire, and the celebrated ending in which the final zombies suffer total meltdown - achieved via some natty stop motion animation for total disgustingness.It's rare when a film manages to combine both old-fashioned atmosphere and new-fangled gore so successfully, but this is a milestone in that aspect. Black comedy is also thrown into the brew to lighten up some heavier moments, such as when Ash tries to give the mortally wounded Scotty a drink - but the poor man is unable to swallow. The demon/zombie creatures themselves are covered in a crude blue makeup but achieve their desired scariness by having some horrible looking blank yellow eyes which really makes them look sick. Their mocking of Ash also provides some chills as they sing ""we're gonna get you, we're gonna get you!"" and laugh at his situation. Two scenes involving the zombies stick in my mind; the first ""shock"" moment where a card game is interrupted by a girl suddenly possessed, and the scene where a zombie smashes up from the basement taunting Ash with the words ""It's your sister Cheryl!"". These guttural demon voices have to be heard, but they're just another highlight in a film full of great, memorable scenes.In the film's most notorious scene, we see an innocent girl run out into the woods - to promptly get tied up by a number of branches and shoots and then suffer a supernatural sexual assault. In a startling display of bad taste and misogyny, we watch as the possessed tree first strips the heroine of her clothes and then attacks her with a branch. Followed by a brilliant sequel and a not-so-brilliant second sequel, THE EVIL DEAD really is a sick modern classic and a must for all gore fans. And on top of that it's darned scary with it. A true horror film then.",The Evil Dead
1,SnoopyStyle,Raimi has some fun,7,3 January 2014,"Five friends go to a cabin in the woods, and find the Book of the Dead in the cellar. Along with the Book, they find a tape recorder with a professor reciting the Book. It brings unspeakable evil from the forest, corruption in their wounds, and evil possessions in the friends.Director Sam Raimi is having some horror fun in this one of his earliest films. No expense is spared in splashing as much fake blood as possible... for a low budget movie. There are some good moves, but the plot is fairly minimal. There are two interesting things introduced. The first is the Book bound with skin. It's a good looking prop. The second is the tree rape scene. That has to be the most memorable scene from this movie. Also it introduces Bruce Campbell and then there is the copious amount of fake blood. The cleanup must have been insane.",The Evil Dead
2,kosmasp,Last house in the woods,7,29 August 2013,"If you look at the budget Sam Raimi had to make this, it is incredible what the end result it. Of course having a good friend with the name of Bruce Campbell always helps. That's some value right there for almost no money at all. But Sam puts Bruce in every one of his movies, so I'm pretty sure he made up for the thin salary on this one. On the other hand, Sam likes to put Bruce through some ordeals and this movie is not different in that approach.The movie though is straight horror. The sequels became much lighter in tone (especially the third one). It's also one of the movies that hasn't been released completely uncut in Germany! I won't spoil anything, when I say the two key scenes that are missing involve a pencil and a tree! If you've seen the movie, you know those scenes are pretty horrific and make the movie what it is too. Make up is great and the camera on the water device Sam came up with is just one of his technical ingenuities!",The Evil Dead
3,gavin6942,A Film Student's Dream,8,6 April 2013,"Five friends travel to a cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.While I am not going to dispute the greatness of this film, and I would not deny it is a modern horror classic (among the very best of the 1980s), I find that the best way to critique the film is as though I was watching it at the time.At the time, Fangoria wrote that the film ""might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films."" They were right. Watching it as though it had just come out gives you that feeling that these guys (none of whom were known at the time) really brought something new to the table. Stephen King saw it, the horror community saw it, and there it was.And you have to give Raimi and friends credit. This was ultimately a gamble. Sure, they made a test version (""Within the Woods""), but here they laid it on the line and maxed out their credit to see their dream work (not unlike Kevin Smith and ""Clerks"" a decade later). It could have flopped, and they could have spent the rest of their lives waiting tables to pay off their debts. I think they deserve credit for that.But there is another way to see the film, and that is through the lens of thirty-plus years. In retrospect, the film holds up well with critics. Martyn Glanville says it is ""one of the great modern horror films, an even more impressive when one considers its modest production values."" True. And yet, I feel like it has lost a bit of something.There will always be an ""Evil Dead"" versus ""Evil Dead 2"" debate, and while the atmosphere of the first is more dark and horrific, the second has a good pace, equal or better effects and a ramped-up sense of humor that has made it the bigger film... and done in such a way where you can watch it without seeing the original, perhaps making the first film obsolete. Throw on the franchise addition of ""Army of Darkness"" and now the 2013 remake, and the brand might have lost its luster (just a tad).What is perhaps most interesting is the cultural impact the film had, even for those who never actually watched it and probably never will. Bruce Campbell launched a successful acting career (and an almost stalkerish legion of fans), Raimi made other great movies and was given the Spider-Man franchise. And then you have the Coen brothers, who got their start on this picture in the editing department. Few directors have had a bigger impact on film over the last few decades than the Coens. And they have this film to thank for that.So, for me, I recognize ""Evil Dead"" as the classic (both ult and otherwise) that it is, despite my preference for the sequel. Where I really see the film's strength is not in its horror, though, but as a homework assignment for film students -- any cinematographer who does not learn a trick or two from Raimi is not even trying. The angles, the zooms, the colors...",The Evil Dead
4,lee_eisenberg,This is why Sam Raimi deserves a star on the Walk of Fame.,10,14 August 2005,"ALRIGHT! This is what started it all! From the moment that Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his friends are attacked by the title characters, you know that you're in for something cool! I loved every scene in this movie. Continuity errors, you say? WHO CARES?! The point of ""The Evil Dead"" is to have the evil spirits tear people apart, and then to have Ash turn his chainsaw on them. Granted, you probably shouldn't let just anyone see this movie (that scene with the roots is particularly inappropriate for little children), but for anyone mature enough, this is THE movie to see. It's probably the only horror flick besides ""The Shining"" that has pre-WWII music for its soundtrack, and I would like to assert that it puts Bruce Campbell on the same level as Jimmy Stewart, Al Pacino and Tom Hanks.",The Evil Dead
5,jboothmillard,The Evil Dead,8,17 June 2005,"If you were looking for the best example in the ""video nasty"" market, or possibly the bloodiest movie ever made, look no further than this hilarious and over the top gore fest from director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man). Basically five friends, Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), his sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), Scotty (Richard DeManincor, or Hal Delrich) and Shelly (Theresa Tilly, or Sarah York) have rented a cabin in the woods for a vacation. Soon after arriving they explore, and they find the Book of the Dead along with a tape recorder with a Professor reading the incantations from the book, and unknowingly they have released the Evil Dead. Cheryl is first to suffer the consequences when she is lured outside in the dark, and she is pinned down by the possessed trees of the forest to be brutally raped before managing to escape and get back inside. Then not long later, while playing with some cards, Cheryl turns her head to reveal herself as a possessed zombie like monster warning them they will all die, and stabbing Linda in the ankle with a pencil. The four friends manage to lock the now evil Cheryl in the cellar, but then Shelley is next to be turned when something smashes through the window and possesses her. After killing Shelley with an axe, Scotty and Ash think it is a good idea to leave, but Scotty returns with severe injuries that mean he will eventually die. Unfortunately for Ash he goes to check on Linda who has become possessed by the evil spirits, she does go back to normal for a moment, but quickly turns again, and trying to kill him he is forced to stab her with a dagger. Ash can't bring himself to cut up his girlfriend with a chainsaw, so he buries her corpse in the soil, and just a moment later she rises from the grave to try and kill him. After defeating the possessed Linda by decapitating her with a spade, he goes to the cellar to get a gun and shells, and after a quick scuffle with an escaped Cheryl he barricades the doors and windows. After getting more shells and having the pipes burst with blood, Ash has to contend with the now dead and possessed Scotty, who gets his eyes gouged out, and Cheryl comes in to beat him with a fire poker. Ash notices the Book of the Dead on the floor, and he manages to grab and throw it in the blazing flames in the fireplace. This causes the bodies to fall apart and decompose with mounds of flesh, pussy liquids and blood, leaving Ash as the lone survivor, but the film ends with something speeding at him and he screams in terror. Also starring Ted Raimi as Fake Shemp. Campbell makes good as the one who endures all the violence, and the giggly creatures go overboard with their torturous intent, it is both violent and funny at the same. It should also be mentioned that the camera is surprisingly inventive as it weaves through the cabin and woods, but everyone watching will lap up the high amount of blood and guts spewing, an essential horror (comedy). It was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",The Evil Dead
6,Woodyanders,"A pretty crude and rough, but undeniably effective little 80's splatter horror shocker",9,17 April 2006,"Okay, we all know the plot to this one backwards and forwards, so I'm not going to bother with an unnecessary synopsis here. Instead, I'll just give this endearingly ragged early 80's splatter horror indie landmark all the props that it deserves. Granted, Bruce Campbell's acting leaves a bit too be desired (he's much better in the second one), the make-up f/x are pretty primitive, and the production values are a tad chintzy and cheesy, but there's no denying the sheer infectious abundance of pure brio, passion, energy and enthusiasm which permeates every last gloriously gonzo frame. Sure, money can buy slicker production values and fancier special effects, but all the money in the world can't and won't compensate for a severe dearth of heart and soul. This is the secret to this admittedly scrappy movie's remarkably enduring cult appeal and grungy charm; you can tell everyone involved in this deliciously demented delight put their proverbial all into the film. Moreover, the roughness of the film itself gives the movie a substantial raw, rattling, unrelenting power and intensity that a bigger budget and slicker execution would have only detracted from. Yeah, it's got its faults, but said flaws aside it still does the kick-you-in-the-gut jolting and startling trick to this very day.",The Evil Dead
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Skip This, And Watch The Sequel Instead",4,8 March 2007,"Here's a film ""series"" in which I much preferred the sequel over the original. This is the first one of the Evil Dead movies and it lacks the humor and general interest that Evil Dead 2 provides. ED2 also is much tamer in the language department, has better thrills and more entertaining action-horror scenes.This one has 30-year-old-looking actors playing college kids, one of them blaspheming every few minutes, and most of them give an amateurish feel to the whole movie. After a slow start, when the gore starts, it comes in buckets. Sometimes there is so much it's almost laughable, so stupid and ludicrous. Actually, this whole film is so bad it is unintentionally funny in a number of spots. Bruce Campbell didn't speak much in this movie, either. Maybe he was just learning how to act. By the second ""Dead,"" at least he had the facial expressions down pat.",The Evil Dead
8,Tweekums,The classic cabin-in-the-woods horror,8,15 February 2017,"When five students; Ash, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, his friend Scotty and Scotty's girlfriend Shelly, go for a weekend away in a remote cabin in the Tennessee woods they anticipate having a good time it soon becomes apparent that they will be getting something very different. Things get slightly creepy before they even get into the cabin and this quickly escalates when they explore the cellar and find an old book and a tape recording made by a previous resident; an archaeologist. It tells how he found the 'Book of the Dead' on a dig in the Middle East and how reading a certain incantation summoned evil spirits; the recording includes the incantation and soon evil forces are making their presence felt. Cheryl hears something and goes into the woods to investigate; here she is grabbed by the trees and raped! She manages to get away but it later becomes apparent that she is possessed by an evil spirit; a spirit that is determined to possess each of the others. Before the night is out they will experience a number of grizzly terrors as they are attacked and more of them become possessed.This low budget horror has become a cult classic; helped by the fact that it was banned here in the UK for many years as one of the so called 'video nasties'. No doubt this also added to its scariness as I was constantly expecting something horrible to happen! There were plenty of good scary moments as well as some fairly gruesome scenes and the infamous 'tree rape' scene is genuinely disturbing even if nothing really offensive is shown. The story is simple, which isn't a bad thing in a short horror film. The effects are distinctly low budget but still effective; frequently the creepiness is provided just by unusual camera angles, lighting and a few strange sounds which keep the viewer on edge. Director Sam Raimi did a great job creating such an atmosphere. The cast does a decent enough job, most notable Bruce Campbell in the role of Ashley. They are perhaps a bit old to be playing 'college kids' but that hardly matters as their age doesn't affect the story. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to horror fans at is a classic of the genre.",The Evil Dead

10,BA_Harrison,"A relentless, gory masterpiece.",10,25 November 2006,"Sam Raimi may be working with mega-budgets and A-list stars these days but, in my opinion, nothing he has done has surpassed the brilliance of The Evil Dead. In terms of originality and verve, this movie certainly surely tops any of his Hollywood blockbusters.The premise is simple: five people vacationing in a remote Tennessee cabin are attacked and possessed by ancient spirits. Despite this simple plot, the movie manages to be thoroughly engaging from start to finish and delivers plenty of scares along with tons of inventive special effects.Raimi spices up the visuals with a bagful of directorial tricks including improvised steadicam shots and unusual POV angles. Such techniques can become tiresome if overused, but Raimi keeps a tight rein on proceedings and uses these shots where they are most effective, rather than just for the sake of them. Great editing and imaginative sound design add to the overall brilliance of the film.The gore effects are, for the most part, very good. The more outlandish and extravagant gags towards the end are the least impressive (the Plasticine stop motion is kind of shonky) but, considering the budget, this can easily be forgiven.The cast are uniformly excellent, with a special mention going to the young Bruce Campbell as Ash, whose brilliantly physical performance carries the latter part of the film pretty much on its own. He convincingly portrays a character that is pushed beyond snapping point, but who claws his way back to fight the evil forces that surround him.In the early 80s, The Evil Dead was caught up in the whole 'Video Nasty' debate, and subsequently banned in the UK. As a teenager, I treasured my beat up old pirate copy of the film, but have since bought the full uncut version on DVD and the original Palace VHS release (which features great cover art!). This brilliant film never deserved to be vilified in the manner it was, and is thankfully now recognised by cinephiles as the highly influential and truly marvellous movie that it is.",The Evil Dead
11,paul_haakonsen,A timeless classic...,7,10 January 2016,"""The Evil Dead"" is one of those movies that are important to the horror genre, and it would be a sacrilege if you enjoy horror movies and isn't familiar with ""The Evil Dead"".And while the effects, for most parts, are primitive and crude then the movie transcends time and will always be an important milestone in horror and a movie that can be watched again and again. If you have grown up with only grandiose CGI effects then you will most likely not see the charm in the effects in Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"".Story-wise then it is one that is easy to follow and one that is interesting from start to end. It is about a group of young people who venture into the woods to stay at an old cabin. Here they find a grim book and unleash an ancient evil by reciting the passages in the book.It is also no secret that this is the movie which made the face of Bruce Campbell a household face, well or at least amongst fans of the horror genre.I have watched ""The Evil Dead"" countless times and will be making frequent visits to it in the future. And yes, this original 1981 version is far better than the 2013 remake.",The Evil Dead
12,Quinoa1984,"The only horror movie, make that movie period, you will ever see a possessed tree limb act as a dildo.",10,22 April 2002,"While that first line might be a bit of a stretch, it gives a bit of mind about what to expect from Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, a horror movie so vulgar, so gorish, so unexplicably twisted, that it's incredibly ingenuous until the last shot.  Even for a low budget film noticably shot practically on a shoe string from a corpse, it's balsy.  The story starts off, and in times steers towards, the area of horror cliches, and yet by the time(s) we see the demonic characters, and the blood that goes along with it, it's accepted with the territory. The Evil Dead is to me one of those horror pictures like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or or Night of the Living Dead that goes to show that within the muck of endless B horror films that those with little money to spend can concoct something that shows craft (and good old chills) triumphs over money every now and then.  And if you happen to view this as a comedy, it goes for laughs in certain spots as well, albiet twisted to a crazed T. A+",The Evil Dead
13,BandSAboutMovies,Great!,8,5 June 2021,"Yeah, I have no idea how we haven't covered this yet.Actually, we try to avoid movies that everyone has seen and said things about, because I often worry, ""What else can I add to the conversation?""In truth, I'd seen Evil Dead II before the original and preferred the comic take on the same story. And Army of Darkness takes that goofiness, mixes in some peplum and Harryhausen and gets even cooler. I've ever seen - and been coated with gore during - the stage play. And we even talked about Within the Woods, the proof of concept that sold this movie.What can I say about this movie that's new and different? Do you want me to say something like, ""It's a less claymation version of Equinox?"" Because, yes, I absolutely believe that to be true but I'm still pretty amazed by what Sam Raimi and his skeleton crew were able to get out of this movie.How great is it that Raimi's career started here, mounting a camera to a board and running through the woods chasing people to try and get the perfect shot? Evil Dead is infused with a heavy metal energy and blows through 85 minutes like a band blasting as many songs as it can in one set so it can rock your face off.Where the later movies lose their edge slightly - there's no way Ash is getting killed - everyone in this movie is fair game. It feels dangerous and unhinged, as only the best horror movies can be.I mean, it must have worked out. They're still making sequels and video games and toys, after all.",The Evil Dead
14,Coventry,A movie everyone should respect !,10,10 September 2003,"A few nights ago, a couple of friends and myself watched The Evil Dead again. It was like the 68th viewing for me ( I think...lost count somewhere around 50) but it still only means one thing to me: PARTY !! Many feeling can occur when watching this delicious masterpiece by Sam Raimi. You can either adore it, be frightened by it or be disgusted by it. But it always leaves a big impression on you and I can't imagine anyone would hate it. And there is ONE feeling that everyone should have towards this movie...RESPECT ! Mostly respect regarding the achievement of Sam Raimi. This guy was 21 years old when he made this film and that's impressive to say the least. I'm around that age at the moment and I sure as hell haven't pulled it off yet...I strongly doubt I ever will, actually. No, when you're able to come up with such an original and dared idea for a horror film, you belong to the greatest minds in the film industry. Sam Raimi did it and his further career only confirmed his status of being a genius with every single movie he directed afterwards. Tons of respect towards Bruce Campbell as well. Sure his performance in this movie is far from great, but at the time, he did it because of his friendship with Sam Raimi. And because The Evil Dead became a big hit, his career was launched too and he certainly grew as an actor. Bruce Campbell is now in the favorite actor-list of many B-movie fans...And I'm one of them.Then there's Tom Sullivan...responsible for the make-up. What a fine job he did. The Evil Dead gave a whole new meaning to the word ""gore"" and we have this man to thank for that. Most nowadays horror films still can't live up to the standard of Evil Dead...not even close. The plot of this film is as simple as can be...but it works. Five friends drive to a small cabin in the woods to spend a small vacation. They find a tape recorder with a message...Out of curiosity, they play it and pure evil is rised in the woods. One by one, they become possessed and turn into horrible demons who try to kill those who're still alive...That's it !!! And that's all there is needed to create a fun and very original horror movie. The same story already came out in 1978 as a short film called ""Within the Woods"". It was meant to fund money for this film and it's great B-movie fun as well. If you're a big fan of The Evil Dead trilogy, it's certainly worth searching for.Anno 2003, Sam Raimi has grown out to one of Hollywood's favorite directors. He became immortal in the eyes of the big budget audience with his movie Spiderman. The sequel of that one is in production while I write this. I'm sure it will be as decent as the first Spiderman was, but I'd still prefer to see Evil Dead 4 coming from the brain of Sam Raimi.A fun trivia element to finish this review with : If you're watching the end credits of the Evil Dead, you'll see Joel Coen is credited as Assistent Editor. Coen now is a famous director as well and may be considered as the best director alive. Back in 1981, he and Sam Raimi were close friends and even shared a studio when they were in collage. Joel Coen made his debut in 1984 with Blood Simple. One of the best cult movies ever made...Join us....",The Evil Dead
15,michaelRokeefe,A true horror classic.,8,4 June 2005,"Director Sam Raimi and good friend Bruce Campbell set out to make a real scary movie...although filmed on 16mm, THE EVIL DEAD is good enough to be your next nightmare and a hell of a lot better than your run of the mill slice and dice. Campbell plays Ash Williams, one of five college friends set out to have a wild weekend in the woods. Two guys...three girls journey to a remote cabin, of course in the middle of the woods. And the woods whisper ""Join Us"". The group stumbles upon a book and a tape recorder belonging to the previous inhabitants, warning of evil spirits lurking in the woods. When the dead come out to play, the newest victims turn into horrid ghouls. Ash, who at heart is a cowardly pansy, turns out to be the macho, macho man to the rescue. It takes courage, a shotgun and a chainsaw.When the flesh-eating demons start their attack, the blood doesn't just ooze; it splatters, gushes and flows by the bucketful. And there is the scene where one of the girls is beckoned into the woods only to be attacked and raped by a...tree?! Cheap special effects galore decorate this vacation to a little north of Hell. The comedy was unintentional. It is a product of bad acting by actors with little or no experience. But still, Raimi as writer and director has stumbled upon something here. THE EVIL DEAD more than deserves its youth restricted rating. As if it really matters, other cast members are: Betsy Baker, Hal Delrich, Ellen Sandweiss and Theresa Tilly.",The Evil Dead

17,Theo Robertson,It's Not That Good,4,7 March 2005,"It might seem rather morbid now but a prolific topic of conversation in 1983 were video nasties . I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON in particular came up in conversation with colleagues and friends on a regular basis but perhaps the most talked about video nasty* was THE EVIL DEAD , especially the scenes featuring "" The woman and the trees "" and "" That bit with the pencil "" . After finally seeing it that year I was very disappointed . I found it dumb , badly made and badly paced and basically a waste of time .I saw it again last night when it was broadcast as part of Channel 4's "" Banned "" season and my opinion of it has improved , but only very slightly . This might be because I have become impressed by director Sam Raimi's work over the years most especially A SIMPLE PLAN and THE GIFT , two very intriguing thrillers and feel he'd probably be better sticking to that genre instead of making yet another sequel to SPIDERMAN . Despite the director's later success THE EVIL DEAD is still very flawed . It might have literate roots that other so called video nasties lack ( HP Lovecroft is an obvious influence on this movie ) but it's still basically a bunch of teenagers go into the woods and get killed in a graphic manner type plot . The characters aren't characters at all they're just cyphers to drive the plot along and the acting is poor . They're is some humour but I'm uncertain if this was deliberate on the part of Raimi . Compare this movie to its sequel and tell me what one is actually trying to be funny THE EVIL DEAD is a movie that would probably have become totally forgotten if it wasn't for the director's later success . It remains rather watchable though which is something you can't say about most other cheap and cheerless horror movies from the period , but it's no masterpiece either * Yeah I know THE EVIL DEAD isn't a "" video nasty "" in the true sense so don't message me to point this out",The Evil Dead
18,Hey_Sweden,Join us!,8,31 July 2012,"One could easily describe this landmark horror film as The Little Horror Film That Could. Made for a meager $375,000 by a troupe of Detroit buddies in the woods of Tennessee, it still stands tall three decades after its release. Led by writer / director Sam Raimi, the crew set out to take the films' viewers on a hell of a ride, one that gleefully gets in ones' face and delights in over the top carnage and mayhem. Fast, fresh, and frequently funny, its old school practical effects (including stop motion animation) remain a treat to watch; the film may indeed be a little ""rough around the edges"", but that merely adds to its charm.The story has five young chums - two guys, three gals - travelling to a cabin in the mountains who have their fun interrupted when by poking around some artifacts left by the cabins' previous tenant, they unleash the demons that had been dozing in the area. Once the demons start possessing this hapless quintet, it becomes clear that there's going to be plenty of bodily dismemberment going on.Raimi and company aren't afraid to dispense with good taste here, as witness the notorious scene with a lecherous tree limb. The atmosphere is completely authentic and the performances totally committed. Bruce Campbell may be the breakout star of the production, as poor, tortured Ash, but everybody here delivers an entertaining performance. ""The Evil Dead"" shows some real imagination and ingenuity, and takes only the barest of breathers in between its assaults on your senses.The film has a healthy respect for horror films of the past, and as an appreciable in joke, features a ripped up poster of Wes Cravens' ""The Hills Have Eyes"" in the cabins' basement. It's films like this that prove that old adage that the independent productions are great for forcing their makers to be creative, and everybody involved gets an A for effort (buffs will note that Raimis' friend Joel Coen was the assistant editor here), from composer Joseph LoDuca to cinematographer Tim Philo to makeup effects creator Tom Sullivan.This remains great fun from viewing to viewing, and its two sequels kept up the tradition of imbuing the horror genre with a riotous sense of humour.

Bodily dismemberment.In terms of plot this is pretty lame--there are a few lapses in logic that are annoying. Characterizations are nonexistent and the acting is bad (even Bruce Campbell!). But the film moves like lightning with some very imaginative direction by Sam Raimi. And when the evil dead attack after the first half hour, the movie goes barreling out of control. Tons of gore, blood and violence are thrown in your face with great sound effects and some truly gruesome makeup. Also it's kind of funny--notice how many times Campbell is covered with blood but his face is clean and his clothes dry in the very next shot!This was made back in 1981 on next to no budget by a bunch of college students. It's incredible what they achieved with so little to work with. Also there are two or three incredible tracking shots that I can't get enough of!This was dismissed by horrified film critics back then (I remember one reviewer was so disgusted he requested that every single print should be burnt!), but it slowly grew into quite a hit. It's now considered a modern day classic. And Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell jump started their careers with this.So ignore the plot and concentrate on the imaginative direction, gore, special effects and sound. For horror movie fans this is a must.WARNING: There is a very tasteless sequence in which a woman is raped by a tree!",The Evil Dead
20,LeonLouisRicci,Seedling for the Sequel,8,16 April 2013,"No budget Gore-A-Thon that put the Director on the map and made lovers of Independent, cheaply made Exploitation Movies not only take notice but Canonized this as the Second Coming of the Zombie/Living Dead Genre.There is so much youthful energy here that its exuberance is exhilarating. Not so much in its scariness as its audacious anxiety. The setting is ripe and the Spirits turn nasty and ripe in no time. The Camera moves all over the place and the Makeup and Special Effects are Cartoonish creations of sublime slime.It is a ""fun"" Film that only asks that you have as good a time watching this over-baked overture to the Horror Film as the makers did serving it up. The only recommendation is to eat after the Movie because you may find your dinner appearing on the screen partly digested and thrown back at you with relentless, reckless abandon.

21,poolandrews,"Fabulous, visually impressive low budget horror film.",8,3 December 2004,"Five friends, Ashly 'Ash' Williams (Bruce Campbell) his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), Scott (Hal Delrich), Shelly (Theresa Tilly as Sarah York) and Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) have rented a cabin in some woods in the middle of nowhere. They drive up to the cabin, through the woods. That night, as they eat dinner, the cellar door slams open. At first everyone assumes it to be an animal, but to make sure Scott goes down into the dark cellar to check. When he doesn't come back and doesn't answer when the four remaining friends call him, Ash also enters the cellar. Along with Scott he looks around and finds a shotgun, a tape player, a dagger with a carved handle of skulls and the Necronomicon, the book of the dead, a grotesque looking book that's bound in human skin and written in blood. Back up top they play the tape, it's a spoken translation of the text contained within the book of the dead. Once played the evil dead are resurrected and awoke from their ancient slumber. Later on that night Cheryl thinks she hears someone outside her window, having gone out to investigate she is attacked and raped by possessed tree branches. She manages to make it back to the cabin, no one believes her but Ash offers to take her back to town. However it soon becomes apparent that they can't leave as the only bridge has been destroyed. Back at the cabin Cheryl becomes totally possessed by the evil dead and she stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil. Soon more of the friends are possessed until only one remains, will anyone survive? Can the friends be saved? Can a way back to town be found? Will that chainsaw in the work shed be used for bodily mutilation, or is it just for show? Watch it and find out, now!Written and directed over the course of four years by Sam Raimi, who's now hot property in Hollywood following the success of Spider-Man (2002) and it's sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004), Raimi makes a cameo appearance in this as one of the hitchhiking fisherman near the start of the film. I love this film, it's so energetic, features loads of over-the-top gore and is just great to watch on a pure fun entertainment level, and it's no surprise Raimi has gone on to enjoy the success he has. The direction from first timer Raimi is full of imagination, style, vigour and as many clever camera tricks he can get away with and his budget would allow for. I love the 'dead cam', we get a P.O.V. shot from the evil dead as they twist and turn their way through the woods, with trees falling down in front of them as they pass over them. A cool looking shot where Ash buries Linda in the woods, the camera is placed in Linda's grave looking up at Ash as he shovels dirt into it, Ash chucks the dirt onto the camera lens, bit by bit the screen goes black until finally only Ash's face is visible through a little section that hasn't been covered, god knows how this was achieved but it works really well and looks like a lot of effort and thought went into a short scene. A great throwaway shot where the camera is positioned under Ash looking up at him as the soles of his shoes are visible on each side of the screen. Or a shot which follows Ash across the room from above his head, the camera speeds along to keep up with him and the beams in the roof coming into shot as he walks under them, and they make a whooshing noise as they quickly enter and leave the shot. And a shot where Ash walks on screen, but the image is upside down and the camera moves towards the back of his head and over it and turning 90 degrees it comes to rest on a shot of his face the right way up. Or the way Raimi can make someone walking up a wooden staircase to the cellar interesting, he puts his camera behind and underneath the slats of wood that make up the staircase and follows Ash as he walks up them from this cool angle, the film is visually excellent and a joy to watch, throughout. The acting is just OK, except Campbell who is as likable as always. The script by Raimi is also great entertainment and manages to pack the screen with a feast of blood soaked set-pieces. Although variable in quality the effects include, zombies, dismemberment, stabbings, decapitations, eye gouging, staking, shotgun blast wounds, burnings, beatings, bitten off hands and a pencil stuck in someones ankle, the blood flows freely in this one! There is also some slightly unconvincing stop motion animation at the end, but like all the special effects in this film, I've seen a lot worse and they really aren't all that bad, just not comparable to todays multi million costing soulless CGI. There a couple of shots here and there when it's obvious that a double was used probably because the original actor or actress was no longer available, in particular the fight Ash has with the possessed Linda after she emerges from the grave he buried her in, her hair style is totally different between certain shots! The only nudity is when Cheryl is raped by the possessed trees, another cool sequence. I love this film, get past a slightly slow first 20 minutes and your in for a highly entertaining and action packed gore fest, watch it as soon as you can! Highly recommended.",The Evil Dead
22,CinemaSerf,"""if you go into the woods tonight, you're in for a bg surprise...""",7,31 October 2020,"Right, so we all head off on a weekend trip to stay in a remote cottage. When we arrive, having crossed a distinctly dodgy bridge, we discover a ramshackle shack. Me, well I'm not getting out of the car, much less staying the night in the place. They are braver than me, though, so in they go for a night of Trivial Pursuits... In the basement, they discover a real-to-reel tape recorder with some tape that reveals that the previous occupants had discovered that the whole place was riddled with a Sumerian curse which the dozy pillocks proceed play aloud - I'm definitely back in the car; but by now it's too late and all hell breaks loose. What gets me is the choices they make under pressure - outside is the last place they want to go - without a Gattling gun anyway - but yet, off they go - in the middle of the misty, dark, night - and guess what...! This has suffered from the ravages of time; the effects are just silly now (think Ray Harryhausen with his first year chemistry set and some Fairy liquid) - but it is still quite scary; and that's largely down to Sam Raimi's style of storytelling: he uses close ups, light and sound to create tension and suspense and Bruce Campbell is actually quite decent as the hopelessly out of his depth ""Ash"".

24,zardoz-13,A Cheapie Creepy Classic!!!,10,7 April 2013,"Miraculously enough, Sam Raimi and his long-time friend Bruce Campbell struck pay dirt with their first feature-length film. A low-budget but ghoulish horror movie, ""The Evil Dead"" takes place in the Tennessee hills where five college students are heading off for Spring Break. This quintet hole up in a dilapidated cabin and discover a tape recording along with an ancient but enigmatic Sumerian tome. Before long they find themselves surrounded by demon-possessed fauna and experience evil first hand. The reel-to-reel tape recording that they uncover contains comments from an archaeologist about his research and his experience with demons. The ""Naturon Demonto"" stands for the Sumerian Book of the Dead. The unwitting students unleash the demons when they utter some incantations. Those dreadful creatures come after them with a vengeance. Cheryl thinks she hears something outside and ventures out into the dark. The woods rise up against her and vines pin her spread-eagled to the ground while a tree thrusts its bole itself into her. This has got to qualify as the most outlandish rape in cinematic history. Things wax progressively worst, and Cheryl's brother Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to lock her up in the basement. Indeed, he has to festoon the trapdoor with chains. Nevertheless, Cheryl can raise it far enough to look at the occupants in the room. Eventually, all the females become demon possessed, and the guys really have their hands full as they defend themselves. This 85 minute horror epic swirls horror with humor. Happily, Raimi doesn't take himself seriously, and ""The Evil Dead"" is a black comedy of sorts. The success of this chiller spawned two sequels, ""Evil Dead II"" (1987) and ""Army of Darkness"" (1992). One of the eeriest of shots occurs when we share the perspective of evil and are flying through the woods. Reportedly, Raimi achieved this steady-cam effect by mounting his camera on a 2x4 and running through the woods with Bruce Campbell on the other end. What makes this movie so memorable is the spirit that Raimi infuses the film with, its skewered cinematography, the breakneck pace, and its humor. The 2013 remake changed the names of the characters and alters several events.",The Evil Dead
25,grantss,A classic zombie movie,7,27 February 2016,"A classic zombie movie.A group of friends - Ash, Cheryl, Scott, Linda and Shelly - head out to a remote cabin. The cabin has an eerie feeling and they soon discover some items left by previous occupants. One of the items is a strange book...I'm generally not a zombie movie fan (unless it's a good zombie- comedy, eg Zombieland, Warm Bodies). Zombie movies tend to be very unoriginal and predictable and usually consist of hordes of zombies chasing humans around, Benny Hill style, for large portion of the movie.However, The Evil Dead is different, and much better. Writer- director Sam Raimi builds the tension well and, even though you know there is zombieness coming, you don't know when, or how. Even once the zombies start appearing, it is not your usual random chase and fight scenes. The atmosphere is genuinely tense and scary.Production values are pretty poor, but that helps the movie, in a way. The cheap special effects heighten the sense of decay and abnormality of the situation.The movie made Raimi's career. Just a pity the follow-ups, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, didn't have the same originality and unpredictability, degenerating into zombie clichés (though they were still better than the average zombie movie)The movie also launched the career of Bruce Campbell, who starred as Ash. He would appear again, as Ash, in Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness.",The Evil Dead

27,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A worthy contender for 'greatest horror film ever',10,14 January 2006,"I don't know why it took so long for me to watch this film... I think it's the fact that I've always been told that it's a gore-fest and not really anything else. I can tell you now; I have been grossly misinformed. This is one of those films that everyone who's into the genre should see. If you as much as 'like' horror, you should see this film. Look past the less-than-stellar acting, the dubious dialog and the thin character writing, and you will see one of the greatest horror films ever created. The plot is hardly worth mentioning. The pacing is top-notch, you're not bored for a second through the entire film. Not one second, throughout the whole film. Seriously. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are daftly written, and so hard to tell apart due to vague personalities that I was never completely certain how many men or women there were, or who was who(well, apart from Campbell as Ash, but his face is a pretty recognizable one). The dialog, as mentioned earlier, is quite dubious. Just about all characters(including the demons/Evil Dead, in-between moans and 'join us') get at least one really bad line. Delivery isn't exactly perfect, either. The effects, though some cheap and a few outdated(but not noticeably so; none of them looked fake or were easy to figure out) are very good. The real strength in this film, however, is the buildup to the horror and the editing. The way ""The Evil"", this unseen, abstract force of true evil is hinted at through the film... impossibly effective. The POV shots originating from said force are incredibly creepy. The editing is tight and excellent. The cinematography is by far some of the best I have seen in my entire life. A few shots were off, but there is no doubt that Raimi knows exactly where to put the camera or how to move it, even when he doesn't have the money to get a hold of expensive rigs. Now, as mentioned earlier, many have told me that this is a gore-fest... while everything I have put in my review up to this point still stands, let me make one thing clear; there is plenty of gore in this film. For better or for worse. Plenty. Limbs are torn off, bodies are maimed and blood is dripping by the truckloads. However, even if you don't like gore, if you don't care for blood and violence, you should watch this film... if you are into horror and you can take the gore(which is graphic and intense, make no mistake about that), you should definitely watch this film. One to watch for everyone who is into horror. I recommend this film to every horror fan who believes he can stand the violence and gore, and to everyone who is into both horror and gore... you've probably already seen this film, but if you haven't, go do so now. You won't regret it. 10/10",The Evil Dead

If so, I can't take them off. But it's not that alone. Sure, it was low budget and they did what they could special effects-wise, but that doesn't explain 70's and 80's horror movie stupidity.

But it's not just the blood and guts that terrifies here. it's Sam Raimi's accomplished direction and his fearless ability to make the movie so damn WEIRD that makes it such a good entry in the horror canon.A bunch of kids are staying in an isolated cabin in the woods and conjure up a bunch of demons from beyond. Sounds pretty standard. But Raimi directs with such a unique style -- cartoonish and campy in a way, yet utterly terrifying in spite of, or maybe because of, that approach -- that I wound up watching this film with one hand poised to cover my eyes at any moment, and I don't scare easily.I am not among those that think the film's sequel, ""Evil Dead 2,"" is a masterpiece.

30,Uriah43,A Splatter Film,4,25 October 2012,"I bought this movie recently under the mistaken assumption that it was a zombie film. At least that's what a zombie site on the internet said. Needless to say, this is NOT a film about zombies. At least it's not about zombies in the traditional sense. It's more about demonic possession. Regardless, this is a great low-budget film for those who enjoy the splatter film genre. Gore hounds will simply love it. Horror fans might like it too depending on which style of horror they prefer. But this isn't Hitchcock or even Stephen King for that matter. Like I said, it's a splatter film and because of that it revels in graphic special effects and violence. Now, some of the special effects are very good. Unfortunately, some of them are downright silly and (in my opinion) lowers the film's value. Likewise, the acting is essentially non-existent. But that's not through any fault of the actors necessarily. The fact is that there simply wasn't any room for acting or much dialogue due to the huge amount of brutal action and special effects. And while I recognized Bruce Campbell, the rest of the actors were completely unknown to me. Not that it really mattered of course as nobody was going to win an Academy Award for their roles in this movie anyway. It did however manage to win a Saturn Award for ""Best Low-Budget Film"" and that is certainly quite an achievement. Even so, the fact that it is a low-budget film doesn't necessarily mean that everybody should overlook the obvious faults and pretend they don't exist. Things like dialogue, plot and character development are important and shouldn't be dismissed because the special effects are so plentiful or gory. After all, it doesn't cost much money to write a script. It also doesn't require much imagination to improve on a plot that consists simply of 5 young adults going to a cabin and (all but one) getting chopped up in graphic detail. For that reason, I thought this movie could have been better. But that is just my opinion. One thing I do know though is that this movie isn't for the squeamish or the faint-of-heart. But it is sure to satisfy a certain niche who loves this type of film. And that's perfectly fine.",The Evil Dead

Which led to me finally opening the book of the dead.View on the film:Running out of the woods and into the cabin, writer/director Sam Rami & cinematographer Tim Philo make every penny of their low budget spring the dead into life. Circling round the cabin,Rami and Philo unleash an ultra-stylized chill,where extreme close-ups of eyes are stabbed with razor sharp edits (assisted by the Coen brothers) of lightning-fast first person tracking shots picking up the pace of the spirits.Drenching the screen in lashings of gore,Rami stubs the grisly splatter Horror with wickedly dark slap- stick Comedy chops,that gives the film a wonderfully peculiar comedic atmosphere.Locking on the soon to be unlucky campers with devils eyes,the screenplay by Rami skilfully trims needless exposition to cut into the heart of ""the cabin in the woods"" campfire tale,via drawing a thumbnail impression of the five,which gives just enough details to their relationships.Holding back on Ash's iconic chainsaw action for later films in the series,Rami leaps round the setting with an infectious merry go round atmosphere,hitting the gang with Gothic chills that explode into grand guignol extravagance twisting the relationships of the gang.

32,anaconda-40658,Introduction Bruce.,6,16 December 2015,"Evil Dead (1981): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Hal Delrich, Betsy Baker, Sarah York: Innovative low budget horror film about the final form of pain, which is ultimately death. This film takes it further with a possessed forest that possesses people into a zombie like state. It opens with a car load of college kids heading to the mountains to a remote rundown cabin. The moment they arrive to a bridge that nearly crumbles beneath them they should have turned back. At any rate they get acquainted and find the book of the dead in the basement. From there the words are enacted and all hell breaks lose. One of the females ventures outside and is raped by vines and possessed tree branches. This is a highlighted moment and perhaps the most disturbing scene in the entire film. This is truly weird and soon enough the other three women are possessed and acting weird. One of the males attempts to flee and is attacked and barely makes it back. Bruce Campbell is the only actor with anything to work with and he is constantly blasting giggling female zombies with a shovel to the head and burying them. This does not end well but director Sam Raimi is innovative with passable special effects that are more applause worthy than not. This is a satire of the classic Living Dead films that contains a few laughs and promises greater things for Raimi. Score: 6 ½ / 10",The Evil Dead
33,kannibalcorpsegrinder,One of the genre's undisputed classics,10,12 November 2015,"Arriving at a remote cabin in the woods, a group of friends find a strange book in the basement which unleashes a horde of demons which possess the group one-by-one and forces the lone survivor to battle them off to survive the terrifying ordeal.This here is easily one of the all-time best horror films ever made. Among the numerous outstanding qualities on display is the startling amount of high-quality suspense featured here, which makes for a truly chilling and utterly unnerving experience which starts almost from the very beginning. One of the most innovative aspects of this, the demented and bizarre camera angles here flying around the woods at inhuman speeds at truly obscure angles that gives a great idea of the forces at play here, and the continued usage of the tactic all throughout the first half to show the creatures out in the woods chasing after the ones inside or sneaking up to the cabin makes for a stellar, stand-out series of scenes which makes for quite a nice time here by building to quite a dynamic fever-pitch along the way. As well, the later scenes in the woods where the incessant rolling fog coming through the woods enhances matters so that the scenes around the cabin where they begin whispering in demonic voices or of them approaching the destroyed bridge off in the distance are just plain chilling and creepy, effectively making a clichéd situation all the more uneasy here with the lead-in from here to the film's second half where this really picks up. Firmly entrenched with the possession angle and featuring the group coming under the influence one-by-one, this becomes a series of demented, creepy antics here with the possessed popping out of the darkness, crashing through the floors or appearing sane before turning into a glowing-eyed demon throughout this section makes for some utterly chilling, jump-worthy sequences that are surprisingly demented. Aided by the chilling, creepy cackling they do in that eerie sing-a-long voice while tormenting him in their demon make-up, it all creates a remarkably nerve-wracking experience. Still, none of this here is possible without the film's utterly over-the-top and graphic gore gags here, with the requirement that the body must be dismembered to be freed of possession means there's several graphic depictions here id dismantling the corpse, along with the wounds inflicted here to hold them down in the first place which requires all sorts of stabbing, impaling and setting on fire, which doesn't include the vicious antics committed against the friends while being terrorized, the blood-splatter let loose in the basement or the graphic meltdown at the end which ups the ante quite well here. While the effects don't hold up at all and the story's a mess, the positives are far more worthwhile which make this one as enjoyable as it is.Rated NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence, Rape from an inhuman source, Language and Brief Nudity.",The Evil Dead

35,Aaron1375,The woods are full of the dead...,8,4 October 2007,"Yes, this movie would go on to spawn two sequels, both of which had a bit more comic tone, however this one is almost pure horror. Albeit, with a couple of humorous scenes. The story, two couples and one sister go into the woods for a nice relaxing retreat. They end up at a cabin which is a bit run down, but not to bad of shape. Strange things happen and then they discover a secret in the basement that unleashes the evil dead! What ensues you ask? General mayhem and lots of gore. In fact this is the first time I have seen the movie in some time, I did not remember how bloody this movie got. This movie features a very young Bruce Campbell and some rather pretty girls and one other guy. They all do rather well, however, the real star is the unique style of the film which was kind of a new way of doing things back then. Basically, the foe or monster coming at a person basically being shown as the camera's point of view. Very effective...what else do you get, lots of body parts being chopped here and there and something else that is rare in horror movies a guy who is the lead and lasts the longest rather than a female. Granted there are still some of the same stuff you see in other horror movies. You will also probably say to the screen ""don't do that!!"".

36,Wuchakk,"Low-budget cult horror classic has a great first half, but a redundant second half",6,12 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 1981 (but not until April, 1983, in the USA) and written & directed by Sam Raimi, ""The Evil Dead"" chronicles events when five Michigan State students travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. Havoc ensues. This is a cult classic movie and the famous director's first full-length feature. It only cost $350,000 to make and was shot in 1979, as well as the first weeks of 1980. Bruce Campbell makes for a quality protagonist and there's a good trio of girl-next-door types (Ellen Sandweiss, Theresa Tilly and Betsy Baker), but Raimi only really takes advantage of these feminine resources with Sandweiss as Cheryl. The first half of the movie is great, which involves the five students' arrival to the cabin and the initial possession/attack sequences. It's atmospheric, well executed and compelling. The second half, however, is redundant. While each new attack ups the ante it's basically more of the same in the same setting (the cabin). Don't get me wrong, the second half is effective chaotic & chilling horror with loads of cartoony gore, but it's too one-dimensional with no meaty subtext to chew on. It's just people being attacked by hideous creatures, one after the other. This simplistic approach CAN work, as witnessed by 1972's ""Gargoyles,"" but in that movie the initial gargoyle attacks led to a captivating confrontation in their hellish cave complex in the last act. The latter half of ""The Evil Dead,"" by contrast, is just one attack after another in the same general setting. This might work for 11-14 year-olds who are wowed by cartoonish gore and constant diabolic thrills, but it doesn't work for more mature people who require some element of mindfood or, at least, variation to keep interested. Another negative is the final gory sequence which is decidedly low-budget and cartoony, albeit creatively and expertly done on a film student level. THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 25 minutes and was shot in Morristown, Tennessee, with additional work done in Michigan. GRADE: B-/C+",The Evil Dead
37,The_Void,The very pinnacle of schlock-horror!,10,14 October 2005,"I've got to tell you right off - The Evil Dead is my favourite horror film of all time - so you can expect a praise-filled review here! I have seen this film at least one hundred times since I first saw it at about the age of ten, and to this day, I can still stick the DVD in the player and guarantee myself a good time. The Evil Dead may be low budget schlock at heart, but there's very few A-class films that I can say that for! The notorious shocker that started the video nasty debate in the eighties is as good now as it was then, and that is all testament to the imagination and dedication of the talented team of amateurs that conquered their budget restraints to put the film together. I'm sure that Sam Raimi and co. didn't know that they had a cult hit that would still be much loved twenty five years later on their hands during filming - but really, that only adds to the cult value of this masterpiece. The plot is brilliantly simple, and it follows the story of a group of five friends that go for a relaxing holiday in the Tennessee Woods. However, their holiday turns out to be anything but relaxing when Ash and Scottie, with the aid of a tape recorder, unwittingly unleash the aptly named 'Evil Dead' from it's slumber.Looking back at the video nasty list now, the vast majority of them are tame by today's standards. This is either down to the change in views of what is and what isn't acceptable, or simply because the films were so atrociously made that they're impossible to take seriously. The reason that The Evil Dead sits at the very summit of that illustrious list, therefore, is because this is every bit the film now that it was then. The film is grainy on purpose, and the gore effects, while obviously cheap; are potent, relentless and disgusting enough to still cause a stir today (the fact that the uncut version wasn't passed all that long ago shows that!). The Evil Dead has become the benchmark for schlock horror films, and this is shown by the fact that almost every film in this vain to be made post-Evil Dead has benefited in some way from the film. That's not to say that Raimi hasn't taken influence from some classics himself. The claustrophobic sets and camera angles echo those in Night of the Living Dead loud and clear, while on famous sequence involving a spade has been taken straight from the Hammer classic 'Plague of the Zombies'. However, Raimi has implemented all of these things into his film in such a way that it feels fresh - and there's nothing wrong with regurgitating elements from other people's films if you can make good of it.The claustrophobic way that Raimi uses his camera helps the film implicitly, and when coupled with the isolated setting that the central location is in; we have a great base for a horror movie. Considering that he was an amateur at the time, Raimi's use of the camera is extraordinary and more than gives many of the established horror film makers a run for their money. The idea to put a camera on a motorbike ('Raimi-cam') is brilliant, and those shots give the film that extra 'x factor'. Seeing the camera roar through the woods is actually quite terrifying. This also gives the film a very nervy atmosphere, as you never know where the evil is going to strike next! The most infamous sequence in the film has to be one that sees Ellen Sandweiss venture out into the woods, only to be violated by the trees. Raimi has said since that this sequence was the mark of an amateur filmmaker, and I agree with him. However, this sequence is an integral part of the film as it helped it to gain a lot of it's notoriety, so I guess it's important if only for that reason.The characters are thin in a typical schlock style. Characterisation doesn't matter, however, as the focus of the film is always on the atmosphere and gore - but nevertheless, the ensemble of amateur actors perform with gusto, and their heart definitely helps the film succeed. Consider the women of the film. They give it their all when their characters are turned into evil demons, and there aren't many 'a-class' actresses that would be able to do that! Of course, on the acting side this film is famous for one man over all else; B-movie god, Bruce Campbell. His performance as Ash was what has made him a cult favourite. Bruce portrays his character with comic brilliance; using a range of facial expressions to portray fear, exhaustion and a sense of loathing towards his situation. Bruce develops the character of Ash as the film goes on, going from a wimpy young man, to a resourceful 'demon-slayer' using all manner of items, including axes, planks of wood and even his girlfriend's necklace to dispatch of his foes. Don't get me wrong, he didn't deserve an Oscar (that was part II!) - but if it weren't for him, this wouldn't be the film that it is.On the whole, The Evil Dead is a film of such paramount importance that it is fundamental viewing for anyone who considers themselves a horror fan, or any young filmmaker wanting to make an impact in cinema without the benefit of a lot of money. Many people refer to this film as 'just a fun flick' or 'so good it's bad', but I cant agree with that. Considering what went into making, and the end result - The Evil Dead is one of the greatest films ever made.",The Evil Dead
38,mm-39,Horror turns into a comedy!,5,14 June 2021,"I heard The Evil Dead is one of the scariest movies ever made! My sister told me so back in the 80's and as a teenager and I refused to watch. Recently on cable as an adult I decided to watch The Evil Dead. The Evil Dead stars out scary as a group of young people ride to a cabin. There is a evil wind, strange events, etc for a strong scary build up. Regrettably the Evil dead is turns into a comedy of laughing, gross over exploding, which becomes laughable, but not scary. The Evil Dead is a bit squeamish , and bit of tension for a few scare moments which turn into something I would say What? Are the makers on drugs? The Evil Dead looks great with clothes on, but naked and raw disappointing. A lot of hype for a 5 stars movie.",The Evil Dead

In the end, when I've seen the last scene, I remembered: it was my first horror movie! I was then, at a fateful age of 5, after turning in my bed and crying with fear for 3 days, that I've decided that if you can't beat them, join them! I've been a fan of horror movies ever since!Now, I got the film because I've seen the wonderfully funny Evil Dead 3 and I just watched another Bruce Campbell film and wanted more. I wondered how funny will the first two Evil Dead movies be. This one is not really funny. It is a horror classic, with young people going up in the woods, fighting demons resurrected by ancient Sumerian incantations (from an audio tape).For an 1981 movie it's not bad. It's gory and the ""special"" effects back then are hilarious: lots of colored plaster and red paint. A true horror fan should watch this at least for his resume :)",The Evil Dead

This cult-classic is not only Raimi's, but also THE most violent Horror flick I've seen. The film is gruesome, gory, brutal, bloody, name any word that is related to blood, and even then you'll be out of words, because this film is not a river of blood, but a country of blood!Apart from the unforgiving gore, 'The Evil Dead' offers only some engaging moments. The film begins superbly, but as soon as the blood starts to dip, it goes hay-wire.A story about 5-college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a wooded area. Their vacation becomes gruesome when they find an audiotape that releases evil spirits.Sam Raimi surely knew what he was getting into, he knew the violence will alienate a large chunk of people. The faint-hearted have never visited this classic to date, And I guess they made the right decision.It's a challenge to watch a Horror film, but watching 'The Evil Dead' is far more challenging. It not only offers chills, but also mind-numbing violence. The fact remains, 'The Evil Dead' will be remembered forever. Destroy it, or praise it, it's a piece of cinema that is sure not to be forgotten!",The Evil Dead
43,StevePulaski,Unapologetically gory and surprisingly very amusing,8,7 April 2013,"The Evil Dead and its two sequels have achieved a small, but loyal cult following in the field of horror, showcasing likely some of the goriest brutality on film in the eighties. It follows a group of twentysomethings, Ash (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), his sister Shelly (Sarah York), and his friends Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) as they embark out to a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. They stumble upon ""The Book of the Dead,"" which is inked in blood and bound by flesh, and unleashes a number of demons and evil spirits that quickly begin to take over the cabin and the souls inside. It's up to Ash, the cool-guy hero of the group to defeat the spirits and save his friends.The plot is, without a doubt, as standard as standard can get. At the end of the day, we come for the scares and the gore and that's exactly what we'll receive. Buckets and buckets of blood are utilized; one of the best scenes involves Ash puncturing a demon's eyes with both his thumbs, with huge amounts of blood quickly oozing out. Yet even with all this constant, flashy violence and gore, the film never veers off on the course of being sadistically exploitative or depressingly nihilistic. Its gore and violence isn't meant to be taken seriously or offensively. There's an aesthetic and tonal cheeriness to this material that is widely unexpected - especially in the eighties, when it seemed many horror films attempted to be as bleak as they possibly could be.Director Sam Raimi (who would later become known for not only his Evil Dead trilogy, but his Spider-Man films) knows how to employ terrific tactics when he works on horror movies. His presence and involvement with the 1980's horror film Intruder, while one of his more obscure films, definitely replicates a style that he would soon become affiliated with. Here, Raimi always seems to be trying something new, specifically with the camera angles. Consider the POV shot we get of someone (or something) gliding through the forestry near the cabin, even going as far as to colliding through the windows of the cabin. The trick to these scenes is we never know exactly what the POV is of, but we don't need to. We know it's not good, since it zips by at an unusual, lighting speed and makes the characters scream when they come in contact with it.These scenes work because Raimi largely knows when to utilize them and how to have them work accordingly with the cinematography. Shot on a roughly $350,000 budget, much of the atmosphere is presented through a lens concerned more with naturalism than polish. The presentation of the picture feels rawer and purer than many other horror films of the time period. This is yet another horror film that contributes to the thought that smaller budgets make better horror films in general.There isn't a whole lot to The Evil Dead. As a horror film, it features the obligatory faceless characters, little development, and devotion to smaller events that may or may not lead up to a grandiose finale. And yet, it works mainly because it aspires to be a bit more ambitious in the regards to its film techniques and gore usage. It's a delightful blend of black comedy and riveting horror excitement, which is a combination that is depressingly underutilized.Starring: Bruce Campbell, Betsy Baker, Sarah York, Ellen Sandweiss, and Hal Delrich. Directed by: Sam Raimi.",The Evil Dead
44,Smells_Like_Cheese,Been watching it for 6 years and it still scares me,10,13 May 2002,"I thought for a budget of $50,000, they did a damn good job of making a scary movie. The Evil Dead has become one of the most popular cult classics of all time, especially to horror fans. I remember how I accidentally came across this movie, I just had a gift certificate for Blockbuster Video and just bought this previewed, I thought at first it was kind of cheesy, but it did terrify me. I showed my friend this movie and we went on the internet and couldn't believe all the websites dedicated not only to this movie, but I found out there were two other sequels. 5 friends go on a camping trip and are just looking for the most part to just relax, party, and have a good time together. But there is something wrong when Ash's sister is hearing and seeing horrible and scary things in the cabin. She is loured out into the woods by a creepy voice and is raped by the spirits in the tree's, sorry, I don't know how else to say it. But when the guys decide to have a little fun and play a tape from the previous owner who studied spirits and demons, they raise The Evil Dead. One by one the friends are possessed and kill each other.This is an incredibly disturbing and fun gory flick to watch. I couldn't believe it when I found out that this movie was made with a small budget. Who knew? I bet Sam didn't and he probably didn't expect the success he has today. I think that's the fun part of movies, sometimes people get your art and sometimes they don't, but you can have a home run sometimes and life has it's little surprises.10/10",The Evil Dead
45,blanbrn,"A cult classic of blood, guts, and evil possesion.",9,4 November 2018,"Finally after all these years watched ""The Evil Dead"" and indeed it's a cult classic horror film that proves a low budget and cheaply shot film can deliver fear and frights in under 90 minutes! Look for some of the early work of veteran character Bruce Campbell.The story is simple a group of Michigan college kids travel to the rural Tennessee woods to stay inside a wooded cabin to do the usual of partying and have sex, however the discovery of an old cryptic like book and audio tapes change the game plan! It turns out this is now a demon party of possession as evil spirits invade the woods and enter the cabin.Most of the scenes are gore and wicked with blood and just downright scary! As the dead are trying to overtake the living one by one as their rotten souls now inhabit each and every body in the cabin and along the woods. Overall a cult horror classic one of the best ever made with plenty of blood, gore, guts, and horror fun.",The Evil Dead
46,MovieAddict2016,A look at the series before it turned humorous - and it's the best!,9,9 March 2005,"Stephen King named it the most ferociously original horror film of 1981 and it topped the video rental charts of that year  but then censorship reared its ugly head and Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" was brutally chopped and heavily criticized by the more conservative folk of the times. In the UK it lay at rest for many years, considered ""dangerous"" and unsafe for viewing due to its excessive gore and infamous tree-rape sequence. In the US (where distribution seemed less controversial  see also ""A Clockwork Orange"") it faced a similar but less consequential fate. Nevertheless the cult base grew and today ""Evil Dead""  released on DVD tagged with an NC-17 rating  is hugely popular amongst film and horror buffs. Its star, Bruce Campbell, was as unlikely a hero as cinema had ever had  a fearful, cowardly guy who doesn't have it all together and isn't a big macho, gung-ho leader type. It is hardly surprising then that Campbell would be the only actor to establish a successful career afterwards.Filmed on a $350,000 budget with a cast of no-names, its influential directorial work, excessive violence and infectious attitude would proceed to inspire a legion of upcoming directors  even Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez paid their respects to the film with their cheeseball vampire flick, ""From Dusk till Dawn,"" which is a lot like the ""Evil Dead"" series  both start out as serious, dark films, and later turn into comedic self-satire.""Evil Dead II"" was less a sequel and more a remake  made with a larger budget and what Campbell himself referred to as ""splatstick"" humor, it referenced the Three Stooges whilst still maintaining the gore level of the original. Then ""Army of Darkness""  the most commercial and childish of the trilogy  became almost totally humor, Campbell's character ""Ash"" Williams turned into a chainsaw-wielding one-line-spewing tough guy-comedian, and the grim nature of the original seemed lost in the chaos.Suffice to say no one can criticize the ""Evil Dead"" series for lack of creativity or imagination. Looking at ""Army of Darkness"" it's hard to imagine it even relates to the original at all  ""Evil Dead"" is a serious (to some extent) horror film whereas ""Army of Darkness"" involves time-traveling and the concept of having a chainsaw for a hand. Groovy.The plot is too familiar  a group of lovestruck teens head out to the woods for a bit of alone-time. Once there they stumble upon a mysterious tape recording and the ""Book of the Dead""  once the passages inside are cited aloud, the undead will rise from the earth. So how unfortunate that the tape recording conveniently cites the passages and all hell breaks loose.The plot doesn't make much sense. We're led to believe these demons that lurk in the woods are at rest yet when our heroes arrive at their cabin, strange goings-on occur before the Book of the Dead is even found. There's also something else that makes absolutely no logical sense whatsoever, but revealing it might ruin part of the story.Doesn't matter. This isn't a thoughtful horror film. Continuity is not favored either  shots rarely follow each other in a cohesive manner. The greatness of ""Evil Dead"" is not its professionalism  instead, the opposite - that for such a low budget, Sam Raimi was able to construct such a chilling and gruesome horror tale unlike any other (at the time, anyway)  he didn't shy on the comic book-style violence, nor was he willing to sacrifice keeping the audience unsatisfied by slowing down the pace. This is a fast, brutal movie. Bruce Campbell is admittedly more comfortable with himself and the character of Ash in the sequels, but the overall scary nature of the film  its serious horror and lack of over-the-top humor  is more to my personal taste than watching a grown man playing Three Stooges with a couple of skeletons in a graveyard. That's not to discredit the sequels (""Evil Dead II"" is almost as good as this) but if I could only pick one, I'd go for the first  and best  of the bunch. A must-see for film buffs, horror aficionados and anyone who likes a good, creepy, unique film. (It's the only time you'll see someone raped by a tree - honest!)",The Evil Dead

48,Red-Barracuda,This is how you make a movie on a shoestring,7,24 October 2011,"The Evil Dead will always remain a great example of what kind of cinema can be made on a minuscule budget. Its a testament to what can be achieved if the filmmakers have imagination and ingenuity. It was infamous initially as one of the most prominent members of the video nasties in the UK. This was probably in part due to the fact that it was the most popular videotape of the year back in 1981. Like many films from that famous list, its really quite difficult now understanding why it was deemed so dangerous. Undoubtedly, this is a very violent film and that is certainly the main source of its notoriety. But its just so fantastical and non-realistic that it makes you wonder if the moral guardians of the day had the slightest sense of humour. Yes, this is a splatter movie but its also a pretty kinetic piece of cinema. The Evil Dead is certainly one of the best examples of imaginative filmmaking on an ultra-low budget.The Dead films are one of the best trilogies out there. The chief reason for this is that they change a little each time in a successful way that keeps the formula fresh. This first instalment is an out-and-out horror film, part two is a comedy-horror par excellence and the third adds a fantasy dimension to proceedings. All achieve what they set out to do. For me, the second film is where the series peaks, as it is the best combination of its two major strengths - the horror and the humour. Star Bruce Campbell and director Sam Raimi were the twin strengths of the second and third instalments. But the original film is really unquestionably Raimi's film. Campbell hadn't perfected his knockabout comedy persona here, so its the visual invention of Raimi that the film derives its main strength from. There is a great eye for detail here such as the ominous thump of the swing seat on arrival, the malevolent POV camera-work of the unseen demon in the woods and the scary demonic girl in the cellar. Fair enough, some of the special effects towards the end are a little ropey now but what can really be expected for a film made on such a shoestring? All in all, this remains a very remarkable little movie that deserves its cult reputation. When you consider that everyone involved in making it was in their early twenties it makes it even more impressive bearing in mind how original and non-derivative it is.",The Evil Dead
49,KineticSeoul,High achievement!,7,7 May 2013,"This is a bizarre, crazy, scary, creepy and even humorous horror film that was highly original when it came out. It's not just another cabin in the woods horror film with slasher stuff going on but more. With the very small resources they had this is actually a really cool achievement. As a matter of fact this is sort of like a student film in a way...Well somewhat. And Sam Raimi breakthrough film or maybe that is ""Evil Dead 2""? Anyways this is a cult classic horror movie that is most definitely worth checking out for cult horror film fans. Or horror fans in general, it just still holds up today and the old cinematography adds to the eerie and crazy vibe. Choosing Bruce Campbell to play the main protagonist Ash Williams was a excellent idea. He brings out the amusement in this movie with his crazy facial expressions and the way he gives his dialogue really adds to the humor. He is just a goofy but cool character. This is a horror classic that shouldn't be passed on.7.6/10",The Evil Dead
50,thesar-2,The Original Book of the Living Dead,7,4 April 2013,"If not for The Evil Dead (1981), The Cabin in the Woods wouldn't have a spot on the GPS. Or, dozens of other movies, for that matter.I understand this is a cult hit, for many, many years. While I never was a huge fan –in fact, it took me a LONG while to finally see this (my first viewing was probably in the late 1990s,) I still appreciated its upbringing. Seeing it today, in 2013, I think I appreciate it even more.The movie is pure craziness. It contains no sense of realism, the characters act like they know they're in a B-Movie and the ""joke's on them."" And the special effects, while fantastic for the budget they had, didn't always hold up today. Lightning from Plan 9 from Outer Space-type movies, anyone?We have three girls and two boys headed towards a secluded cabin in deep woods when all hell breaks loose following a playing of a tape-recording of words from the Book of the Dead. From those words spoken, or replayed, craziness ensures, such as possession, Exorcistrees and, ah-hem, a wooden rape scene. Man, the dead play back.Despite the maximum level of insane carnage, there is so much to appreciate here, from both an independent film lover and all horror connoisseurs. The cinematography was actually very well done – you can tell this young film maker/unknown at the time: Sam Raimi, had a future. The special effects and gore, in spite of the low budget, was beyond what it could've been. Like Raimi, you can tell these people knew what they were doing, even with the dollars they had to spend. And the cast gave it their all, with what they were given and the direction from a newbie, albeit someone who knew what he was doing.That all said, in regards to the cast, unfortunately, as good as Bruce Campbell was, he will eventually, following this, of course, have even better charisma and show much more of his eventual talent. He just wasn't as developed here, as I would've liked to see of him.And, the movie isn't perfect, and some of the scenes, ideas don't add up, such as a small Doctor Who'ish cabin that seems to have more rooms than the White House. But, if you just let yourself go, and remind yourself of the timeframe and budget, you can have a good time. And best of all, (SPOILER – sorry, but it has been 32 years, for the love of the dead) it was refreshing to have a male hero at the end of a horror tale. As much as I loved Halloween, or the numerous horror franchise films to follow, such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, the heroine is always the take-down-the-villain character. For once, it's nice to have it be a male.At any rate, it is recommended for horror and low-budget 1980s fare fans out there.Side Note: I have listened to very few audio commentaries in my lifetime, to my dismay. But, one of the all-time favorites of mine, and most hilarious, was one of the 150 DVDs re-releases of The Evil Dead and it was a solo-Bruce Campbell commentary. I cannot state which DVD it is on, but I was laughing so hard with his words on it. It was one of those: Press play on the commentary, and if it picks up, continue. Well, it did ""pick up"" on minute 5 and Bruce never let up. He was absolutely uproarious. Not to miss his, if given the chance.",The Evil Dead
51,cherold,Not as much fun as the sequels,4,5 September 2010,"I wound up watching the Evil Dead series backwards, starting with Army of Darkness, which I loved, then Evil Dead II, which I barely remember but recall liking and finally Evil Dead, which I stopped watching 30 or 40 minutes in.Evil Dead is known as the movie with the least humor, and that is true to the extent that it lacks of the slapstick of the others, but at the same time I can't help but suspect that the whole movie is a goof, because it is so dumb. It begins very well, squeezing a lot of atmosphere out of a minimal budget, but when the horror starts the effects and makeup are laughable and the whole thing is very over-the-top and campy. I don't feel like anyone was taking this movie too seriously.I'm not a horror movie aficionado. I liked Army of Darkness because it was really funny, but as a general rule I do not watch horror movies.

52,sol1218,The House where Evil Dwells,8,8 August 2006,"**SPOILERS** Shocking and terrifying horror movie that uses it meager $350,000.00 budget to the fullest extent to scare the living hell out of it's audience. Far better then the many multi-million dollar slasher/splatter films that it's, or their, constantly compared to.Five college students take a ride out in the heavily wooded wilds of Tennessee to spend the weekend at a cabin that they rented and things start to go bad even before they reach their destination. Crossing a creaky bridge the car almost falls through the rotted woodwork and barley makes it to the other side. At the cabin the students brother and sister Ashley or ""Ash"" and Linda Williams, Bruce Campball & Besty Baker, together with friends Scotty Cheryl & Shelly, Richard DeManincor Ellen Sandweiss Theresa Tilly,find the place a mess. Cleaning up the place they unearth a book and tape recordings, together with a reel to reel tape recorder, that belonged to the cabin's previous owner.All this time we get to see and feel that there's something evil in and around the cabin that's just waiting to get unleashed. It's the strange book and weird sounding tape recordings that the new occupants found there that serves as the trigger or linchpin that set. the evil spirit, it into motion. Reading from the book that seems to be a hand-written copy of the notorious Satanic Book of the Dead, Necocomicon, the students then play back the tapes, that they found along with it. The tapes has the owner of the cabin explain what happened to him when he deciphered the books mysteries that must have drove him either out of his mind or in his grave or both. The former cabin owner gives out, on the tape, this eerie and blood-curdling Cathulhu chant that activates the evil that surrounds the cabin. That brings the forces of hell out of their long sleep and into the open taking over the bodies and minds of the unsuspecting students. One at a time it turns them on each other until the cabin, and the area immediately outside of it, turns into a mind-numbing and horrific slaughter-house.Not for those that are weak of heart ""The Evil Dead"" has an unrelenting drive to it that's never-ending. Not giving you a chance to catch your breath even once the unearthly and evil action once it's starts going and never ever stops. Even the ending, when the horrible night in the cabin is finally over, it sets you and the lone survivor of this massacre up for a nasty surprise with a jump-out-of-your-seat final.Even though some of the scenes with the Evil Force taking over the students bodies may be a bit overdone, especially in the make-up department, they still jolt you right out of your skin. You start to get the feeling, like those in the movie, that there's nothing on earth that can stop the Forces of Evil unknowingly released by the students. That's until those who released them are overcome possessed and finally consumed by them.",The Evil Dead
53,Robert_duder,The patriarch of epic indie Horror,8,17 April 2013,"I literally laugh out loud when I hear someone say...The Evil Dead? That movie is terrible. OF COURSE IT IS!! It is deliciously, brilliantly terrible. It is gory, and even creepy at times and then flips flawlessly over to being downright hilarious. But in my opinion the true brilliance of The Evil Dead is when you look at it from a film making perspective...which I don't usually like to do...but this movie was essentially done on a shoestring budget with hands on special effects and gore. The cast went through gruelling conditions to bring this movie to life (no pun intended) It is the quintessential indie film. It proved and still proves that a horror film made independently by then ""unknowns"" can still be immensely successful. The story is incredibly simplistic, for the most part it is said that Sam Raimi didn't have a real script but had all the ideas in his head. There is nothing about this movie that you can say is ""brilliant"" except for the sheer fact that it was made by an incredibly talented group of young people. The script is silly, the gore is gratuitous and over the top, everything about it is simple but the film is legendary and incredibly fun to watch for horror fans.Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly are all okay in their roles. They are a little campy in the beginning and a little stiff in line delivery but then once they're all possessed and part of the ""evil dead"" is when they all really shine especially Sandweiss and Tilly. They put their heart and soul into the movie and basically signed themselves over to Raimi and let him do whatever it was he did and they deserve kudos for that. Did they make or break the movie? No. Honestly they felt like fodder for the demons and didn't really stand out. This is perhaps the reason why The Evil Dead made Bruce Campbell a legend. We all know him now as the King of Camp but in The Evil Dead he is truly giving his very best ""serious"" performance. Yes some of it is laughable but he is so dedicated and fun to watch and there is absolutely no doubt that he has this charisma on screen that makes him riveting. He carries this movie on his back and does so perfectly. The guy is covered from head to toe with every manner of disgusting body fluid that you can imagine and he looks classy while doing it.The Evil Dead is the most fun because it tries so hard to be serious. Those who are squeamish will certainly find the gore hard to watch. Those of us who are die hard horror fans will see the dark humour in how over the top everything is. But it is is a horror film through and through. The atmosphere that Raimi created (again on virtually nothing) is brilliant. The entire setting in the cabin, the dark and creepy woods, the infamous ""woods raping scene"" is all simply twisted and disturbing and even the humour in this film is (I think) entirely unintended and comes from watching these guys have a lot of fun making a horror film. But unlike many independent horror film makers (especially nowadays) this group of people headlined by Raimi and Campbell are incredibly talented and went on to much bigger things. The Evil Dead is not for everyone but it is a classic without a doubt and true horror fans and fans of film making have to appreciate it for what it is and what it has become. The remake currently in theatres is stone cold brilliance...but for a variety of different reasons. 8.5/10",The Evil Dead
54,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An iconic 'video nasty' admirably made on a shoe-string budget.,8,22 February 2018,"'The Evil Dead (1981)' had a very low budget and it certainly shows. Yet, despite this, it looks and feels very convincing. Some of its dialogue is hokey, its acting can be hammy at times and a couple of its scenes almost provoke laughter due to their slightly campy nature, but the overall experience is charmingly entertaining. It's built upon a mix of genuine horror and trash-induced bemusement, with some moments causing full-on unease and others provoking unintended chuckles. This contrast is arguably what creates the uniquely off-kilter vibe of the picture, though. The filmmaking on display here is really creative, too. It's admirable that, essentially, a group of people raised some money, went into the woods and made a film, despite all the issues that befell them. This homemade feel adds to the flick's overall allure; you can almost feel the passion coming off the screen, which (ironically) gives it a soul so much warmer than any studio ever could have. It's well-made (especially considering its shoe-string budget), gory, iconic and can be pretty tense and suspenseful, too. Plus, it's just downright distinct; in many ways, there's nothing quite like it. For the most part, it pulls you into its world and doesn't let you out until its credits roll. Even when it lapses slightly, it's still a really entertaining time. It's ambitious and effective, especially for something made by a rag-tag team of friends who decided to make a movie. It's actually quite inspiring; if they can do it, so can you. 8/10.",The Evil Dead
55,ThomasDrufke,Cult Classic,8,19 September 2016,"It's always fun to go back and watch films with a mass-cult following. Perhaps no horror film in history has a bigger cult following than The Evil Dead, and rightfully so. Director Sam Raimi and the small cast made one of the most intense and original films to date.Sometimes it's hard for myself to go back and watch horror films from decades ago, especially those with a smaller budget. Most of the time the lack of sufficient funds to edit horror pictures make the end product a lot less re-watchable. With The Evil Dead, the one-setting and minimalistic story actually adds to the film and makes it all the more terrifying. Yes, 5 friends spending a night in a secluded cabin in the middle of the forest with little lighting is unsettling, but with Raimi's amateur directing style, it's horrifying.Of course, I mean amateur with the best intentions. This was essentially a film funded using what we call 'kick-starter' now, with a bunch of his friends. Bruce Campbell being the one friend who went on to do extensive acting. Although Raimi didn't have the proper funds necessarily, there's actually a lot more skillful directing than you may think. You imply just have to look at the effective camera placement in suspenseful sequences to know this guy had a future in the filmmaking industry.The first act of the film is played out a lot like an old Hitchcock suspense thriller. It's all about ""what you don't see"" that make the hairs raise on the back of your neck. Until the film changes into a contained gore fest for the last hour which is among the best slasher pictures of the 80's. The dialogue and acting isn't all that great but it makes for a solid B-movie atmosphere, which was common for plenty of horror films of that time. It's great on its own, but the story behind the making of the film certainly certifies this as one of horror-cinema's crown jewels.+You can already see Raimi's talent+One cabin, one forest, one friend group+Atmospheric -Dialogue8.2/10",The Evil Dead

57,ericstevenson,Holds up,8,21 August 2016,"I ended up seeing ""Army Of Darkness"" first and being blown away by how massive it is. I guess it's only because of that, that I am not giving this a higher score. The movie did take awhile to get really good. It's still pretty worth it when it really gets there. It's weird, because I thought this was going to be the movie that had the most iconic scenes like Ash losing his arm or everything in the room laughing. Yeah, I was a bit disappointed. Still, I definitely liked this movie.In terms of its reputation as one of the goriest films ever, it's nowhere near as bad as ""Caligula"" or ""Cannibal Holocaust"". Maybe it didn't come off as too scary for me. It's still great to see these impressive sets and costumes hold up. The stop motion isn't bad, but I never really was into that. I still love the atmosphere that this film creates and how it really is ahead of its time in terms of character development and playing with the horror movie tropes. It's quite unpredictable and is worth your time if you're a horror movie fan. Yes, boo me for liking AOD more, but I still acknowledge this film as the launch of a genre. ***",The Evil Dead
58,lesleyharris30,"For a very Acquired Taste,",5,15 November 2015,"The Evil Dead is a very mediocre movie with a rather poorly written storyline than never really goes anywhere, but a talented cast. It definitely has its moments, Bruce Campbell shines in the lead role, his first performance of the iconic character Ash Williams, he has an undeniable screen presence that it both natural and dedicated, I'm still interested in watching the sequels mainly because of Campbell and the fact that the humour is more evident in them, there is a bit of comedy in this that I quite liked, but there wasn't enough for me. As a horror, I found it to be very light on thrills, it never really had me at the edge of my seat, the low budget dosen't help, the actors never really feel like zombies, just people wearing poor make up, and the long sequences of them killing one zombie is a ridiculous scene, it's just load and obnoxious, I wasn't sure how they wanted me to feel, it was too funny to be scary and too scary to be funny. The plot never really goes anywhere, that's my biggest problem, it lingers for about 70 minutes, there comes a stage where watching people just kill zombies again and again becomes tedious, even if they're doing it in a new and different way each time. Has its moments and I'm certainly interested in watching the sequels for the sake of Campbell, if you're a die hard horror fan you'll probably love it, but The Evil Dead wasn't for me.

60,CuriosityKilledShawn,Join us!,8,7 October 2006,"Released in the years before cable TV and before video cassettes made low budget schlock available to the average viewer, Evil Dead found its audience with the midnight movie horror festival crowd. No way did it get a nationwide release. Privately owned cinemas bought prints and slowly the film spread from coast to coast and even made its way to Britain. But by this time videos were gaining popularity and it was released on cassette at the same time as a very limited theatrical release.Critics and censors dismissed it as trash and not long afterwards it was relegated to the video nasty bin and banned. As silly as this may seem, that was the logic of the BBFC. The fact that it is inventive and well directed was lost on them. And until recently only cult audiences appreciated its value. With Anchor Bay's new DVD we can all finally enjoy the uncut, definitive and best-looking presentation possible.Originally released in 1981 as The Book Of The Dead, this was a feature length re-make of Sam Raimi's short film, Within The Woods. The plot (excuse) and story (violence) involves a quintet of friends, enjoying a few days of quiet at a remote cabin in the Tennessee woods. These are not Friday the 13th goofballs who want nothing but sex and skinny-dipping. They are realistic. And it all goes nicely until Scotty (Hal Delrich) finds an ugly-looking book (with a face) and an old reel-to-reel tape recorder in the basement. The tape is of an archaeologist explaining how he resurrected demons that took over his wife in the very same cabin. The professor is nowhere to be found, but the haunting burial rites and incantations written in Sumerian text in the ugly book, The Necronomicon Ex Mortis-Book Of The Dead, are on the tape also.Sheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) freaks out. She hears a demonic voice out in the woods. ""Join us!"" Foolishly going out to investigate, she is raped by a tree. Although this particular scene isn't so hard to watch, the film still has the power to disturb and make you squirm.Once Sheryl returns, all hell breaks loose and Raimi has a helluva time firing torrents of blood of varying colours throughout the cabin. Limbs are hacked off with carefree abandon and poor old Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to take them all on at once.The supernatural hijinks were repeated to a much lesser effect in the sequel, but here Raimi creates an atmosphere of dread and whatever that force is out in the woods - it's scary. It does have some humour, but first time around the filmmakers obviously wanted horror first. You'll wince a few times, no doubt. The raw tone goes hand-in-hand with the low budget and Raimi's bizarre, hardcore cartoonish style is much in evidence.More time is spent building character. Ash loves his girlfriend and a simple little scene between them makes us totally root for him. He is still to become the hapless buffoon, as he will repeat in Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.At the very least, Evil Dead is so popular that it can no longer be regarded as a cult movie. It's not a classic. Not yet. But it is highly regarded and definitely worth several viewings.",The Evil Dead

After their exploration of the cabin, they found an audio tape and an evil book from which they read some pages and they release the evil. The friends are helpless and trying to stop the evil before it's too late for them.I liked this movie because it had a simple and very interesting plot with many surprises and plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Sam Raimi who is also the writer, it was very good with much suspense and many good scenes. I also liked the interpretation of Bruce Campbell who played as Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams and made the difference in this movie and I also liked the interpretation of Betsy Baker who played as Linda. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Ellen Sandweiss who played as Cheryl and she was equally good.Finally, I have to say that ""The Evil Dead"" is a nice movie with plenty of suspense and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it either you are a fan of horror movies or not.

66,poe426,EQUINOX redux...,10,15 January 2002,"EQUINOX (1971) is a creepy, almost documentary-like low budget fright film that begins with four college kids going out into the mountains for a picnic. They stumble across an imploded cabin (the home of a professor, played by the late fantasist Fritz Leiber) and find a book whose pages are made of human skin. If our intrepid quartet can't keep the book from falling into the wrong hands, there'll be, well, Hell to pay...
EQUINOX appears to have inspired Sam Raimi's fright-fest, THE EVIL DEAD: the parallels are, uh, Legion... But, whereas EQUINOX (available for years on video tape under the oddball title, THE BEAST) features towering, ape-like split-screen creatures, stop-motion animation, and forced perspective shots of ancient castles and the like, THE EVIL DEAD relies primarily on some extremely effective makeup fx. THE EVIL DEAD is intense, and there certainly are some shocking scenes, but the series began to slide into self-parody with the second installment (which I liked, nonetheless), and finally into outright cornball slapstick humor of the Three Stooges variety. It's a shame Raimi didn't stay the course: there are few enough ""legit"" fright films as it is; by opting for the dim-witted kiddie crowd, Raimi denies us a series that might well have rivalled George Romero's Living Dead trilogy in terms of sheer terror.",The Evil Dead

The story itself it's actually a bit too simple, and somewhat cheesy from certain perspective, but it's the way in which it is told what makes this so special.I've seen many horror films during my whole life, but very few of them were so thrilling and fascinating as this movie, keeping an unique level from beginning to end, having some of the most memorable scenes that I've ever seen in any movie of this kind.""The Evil Dead"" is a great film, which can be easily compared with horror classics from the eighties, such as ""The Shining"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Hellraiser"".

68,TheMovieDiorama,The Evil Dead is possibly the craziest horror film I've seen.,7,28 February 2018,"If someone asked me ""Luke, describe in 400 words what happens in The Evil Dead""...I would probably struggle. Basic plot is basic. Group of teenagers go to remote cabin in woods, discover book of the dead, play a tape recording speaking some dead lingo and then creepy stuff happens. I've seen the remake a good few times, this is my first watch of the original and actually I would probably rate them the same for different reasons. An advantage that the original has, is Sam Raimi. Wow. Probably his best film. He does lack some technical finesse but the inventive POV camera tracking shots through the woods were incredibly effective. When Ash climbs up the stairs in the basement, when he walks through the cabin...extremely well crafted camera techniques that heighten the experience. His writing was also good, not the best but better than your average horror. There are hints of personality to our characters, particularly Ash, but I don't think it was enough to make me care about them. A slight dark comedic undertone within the script but it's extremely subtle. The star of the film is the makeup design. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. Blood is spewing out everyone eventually, bodies start to decompose in rapid stop cuts (great editing during those scenes) and when the teenagers start to become possessed...some of them looked damn terrifying! The prosthetics were innovative as well, particularly the infamous tree rape scene which had been originally cut in several countries (I wonder why...). Let's face it, in 1981 no one ever saw anything quite like this in terms of gruelling horror...it was bound to be cut and edited to make theatrical releases in different countries. This isn't so much a scary film, more aimed towards the gore sub-genre. Some of the characters felt way too calm given the circumstances. Seriously, who would be relaxed if they disembodied their friend? An effective and inventive gory horror that just lacks technical finesse and memorable supporting characters.",The Evil Dead

The Evil Dead movies combine demonic horror, splatter, gore and elements of comedy with great skill and I guess every director who ever made a horror-comedy movie after did watch those two movies.

I can commend the production for its ability to use what little financial resources were available to their fullest.  The film is effective in that it does create some good, honest scares.  It utilizes some interesting special effects hitherto not seen in film.  Bruce Campbell is very good in his role, and the other actors are not too terrible till make-up gets hold of them.  Some of the night sequences are very chilling and atmospheric as well.  But(and you probably knew this was coming)the film is wildly overrated as some kind of cinematic masterpiece.  It is NO masterpiece.  It is your basic take some teenagers out into the woods, let them play with black magic, and finally kill them off in crude ways.  This is one gory, unrealistic film.  That's fine if that is what you like.  But I found myself yawning in some stretches through the repeated, pointless, senseless, brutal gore.  And let's talk logic...at one point one demon-faced girl is knocking wildly on the door to get to Mr. Campbell...while only several feet down is a window that had its glass smashed in.  She got something against windows?  Evil Dead is not a bad picture.

75,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Who says you can't laugh at a movie that's still scary?,7,25 July 2011,"You might never suspect a relationship between horror and comedy — which means you've never seen a Sam Raimi horror film. Although some of us have drawn a line in the sand between the two genres, those who haven't will appreciate if not love ""The Evil Dead."" Raimi recognizes that horror is kind of an absurd genre in itself and that our capacity to fear and to laugh exist on the same spectrum. If you let yourself experience both on the wacky 85- minute ride that is ""Evil Dead,"" you're bound to appreciate the way he plays with both.Undoubtedly inspired by ""Night of the Living Dead,"" the film centers on five young adults who decide to stay at a cabin (arguably a shack) for a weekend in the middle of nowhere Tennessee. After experiencing some strange activity they come upon a book and a recording of a man reading incantations from it. These incantations awaken flesh-possessing spirits that live in the woods.Rather than an ""us against them"" horror film where a group of people have to avoid getting picked off one by one at the hands of something(s), the film takes more of the zombie angle with characters ""turning"" into evil undead creatures. The cast is also small, so the events are character-focuses and more intense. Bruce Campbell leads the way as Ash. There's no real way to describe Ash, except he's more of a softie for a leading character.Part of the great/annoying part about ""Evil Dead"" is how the main characters never act like you want them to. You want to scream at them to hurry up and grab something that can be used as a weapon and pound the crap out of the possessed undead people. Because the characters are a bit hollow and we've been exposed to films like this before, we have no sympathy when a good character turns. They need to die and die fast, but the characters remain hesitant because technically these possessed gnarly creatures are their friends. Consequently, Ash is a dumb sucker that probably deserves to die with everyone else in the cabin.That said, there's an odd pleasure in that kind of psychological toying with our minds. Raimi executes horror with strong build up and off-the-wall payoff. We writhe until the last second and then the zombie guts hit the fan time and time again. And he never completely lets go of the leash; everything goes back down to an eerie calm and builds back up again until the climactic scene. Although for all intents and purpose ""Evil Dead"" is a camp-fest, that technique suggests Raimi's interest lies in keeping us spooked.All things considered, any film that can depict a woman being ""raped by the woods"" (yes, the collective entity of ""the woods"") that still manages to leave a good lasting impression deserves its cult-classic status.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Evil Dead

77,Anonymous_Maxine,A modern horror milestone.,9,5 May 2008,"We have a tendency to look back and glorify the old, great horror films, like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby and Night of the Living Dead, etc, automatically hailing them and lamenting the depressing thought that films like that will probably never be made again. Rob Zombie recently eased that fear a little bit, but in Sam Raimi's early career, he was making gritty, grimy horror films that reminded us that the old days of horror can still be brought back to life. For every I Know What You Did Last Summer or Hostel or other idiot teen slasher I think back to the days of Raimi's early horror films and just wonder what happened.Here's something interesting, in modern times, there are more and more high budget horror movies coming out, with a noticeable decline in quality as the money gets bigger. I wish someone would notice that one of the best things about The Evil Dead is that it was made on a shoe-string budget. Like Chaplin's favorite part of his career, the early years when he would just go to the park with a bench and a girl and a big oafish guy and just bang out a film, Evil Dead gives the feeling of being just a bunch of friends who went out to the woods and cut themselves off from society for a while to see what they could come up with. And they came out with a classic! The plot, of course, focuses on (you guessed it) a group of friends who go out to the woods to camp. The opening of the movie, the drive through the creepy woods, is one of the best examples of mood-setting that I can think of. You can almost feel the trees closing in around you as the hapless friends drive through the woods, teasing each other about the scary woods.There are several scenes in the movie that will immediately put off a lot of viewers, such as the infamous tree love scene (not my favorite either), but the fact that the movie doesn't try to please anyone is what allows it to cut loose and just be a real horror movie. Trying to please a wide audience is the worst thing that any horror film can do, because that's what gives you those stupid sophomoric teen thrillers.Bruce Campbell, in the first performance of his best role, Ash, is surprisingly geeky in the first Evil Dead movie, at least compared to the hardened badass that he was to become in the two sequels, and considering the fact that he is generally remembered as being the coolest horror hero imaginable. But I think that may be what makes the trilogy work so well. A good story should show character change, and through the course of the trilogy Ash becomes something completely different from what he was when we met him in 1981, and Campbell fits the geek and the hero exceptionally well.Raimi understands the cartoonishly excessive blood and gore will reduce the real scariness of the movie and make it almost into a bloody comedy, so he uses that idea to its maximum potential, causing us to laugh and squirm all throughout the movie, although the real scares are few and far between. The sound effects, camera work, costumes, and vile liquids spraying forth across the screen, however, are horrible enough, and it's clear that Raimi and the cast and crew are having a lot of fun with the material, which is one of the many reasons that it's so easy for the audience to have fun with it, too.It should be noted that, because of the shoestring budget, they had to be truly creative in their effects and filming. Much of the camera work is done using very crude techniques, and the creativity involved creates a feel that the biggest budget could never approach. There are dollies and slides and other devices that are handmade from things like pieces of wood and duct tape in order to get the necessary shots, and the effect is brilliant. Can you imagine? They actually used duct tape to film this movie! Outstanding! Strangely, Raimi took a four year break from directing after the Evil Dead, before finally following the movie up with the astonishingly bad Crimewave, the badness of which just strikes me as a real mystery, given the talent involved in making it. Luckily, he almost immediately followed this disaster up with the first sequel to Evil Dead, which plays like a sequel and a remake at the same time. It serves as a testament to the success of this early effort that it was basically remade Evil Dead II, and now is set to be remade again in 2009. Let's just hope that, now that he's a Hollywood director, Raimi can still capture the same attitude and gritty goriness of his early career!",The Evil Dead

It was also the most violent, gory and cheesiest horror film I have seen inthe last ten or so years that was highly entertaining.  A group of collegekids go fooling around in some old cabin and discover the Necronomicon. Yes, they find the book that H.P. Lovecraft used to love to write about. A book made from human skin and contains a bizarre language and horrific images.  Evil Dead was the movie that raised the bar on shock and gore.Not only did this movie launch the career of Sam Raimi but it made BruceCampbell a B-movie legend.   Made on the cheap but it brought in a lot ofmoney and in the process became one of the most talked about horror filmsof all time.  Several years later, armed with a bigger budget, the same teamproduced a semi-sequel/remake that eases on the horror and amps up theblack comedy.  An essential film.Highly recommended.A+",The Evil Dead
80,jamesrupert2014,Grisly low-budget fun,8,21 September 2021,"A group of friends vacationing in a remote cabin awaken demon forces that slowly, and disgustingly, take over their bodies until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left to messily defend himself. Director Sam Raimi's debut, the film is one of the great gore-fests of the 1980s and is good fun for fans of the frequently over-the-top genre. Considering the film's relatively paltry budget, the special effects are quite good, especially the dead-white eyes sported by most of the cast for much of the second half of the film (supposedly very uncomfortable appliances). There is also some good stop-motion sequences (mostly involving oozy dissolution) towards the end. Raimi buddy/regular Campbell makes a good suffering, terrified hero and the rest of the largely amateur cast (and fake 'Shemps') are fine in undemanding roles (both pre-and post-possession). Raimi establishes his highly kinetic style early on and once the blood starts splashing there is little let up. A fun, shamelessly excessive gore-pic that inspired a lot of substantially worse horror films. Followed by a couple of sequels in the 1980s and, decades later, a tongue-in-cheek horror TV series (Ash vs. The Evil Dead, 2015) that finds the tenacious survivor still struggling to stay alive (and human).",The Evil Dead
81,Polaris_DiB,"Fun small, more fun large.",8,29 October 2005,"Even though I own this movie on DVD, I had to catch it on a special midnight screening last night so that I could finally see it in all it's big-screen, publicly squeamish glory.I'm not saying it needs it, but on the big screen this film is so much more obviously amazing. The crazy angles and tracking shots are very involving and basically disallow the viewer from not getting trapped into its story.Especially nice about this movie is its fun. The makers obviously never wanted to let up, so it just delves right in and never stops. Not only does it not matter that a lot of the events in this film are unexplained, most of the time nobody thinks even to point that out. The movie is so true to it's own desire to just immerse and never come out for breath that it is wonderfully self-secure. It only gives a few tidbits of why things are happening to give the audience some foundation so as not to just float away in a random haze of chaos.On a smaller screen, the effects don't seem very special, but on a wide-screen, they are quite good and still very fun. The entire movie is by no means the greatest horror film in existence, but everything in it is good and just as good as it needs to be.I'd say all horror fans should see it, but especially if there's a showing in an independent theatre nearby. Then buy the DVD anyways because how else can you say you own a film where a woman gets raped by a tree? --PolarisDiB",The Evil Dead
82,strong-122-478885,And Dawn Breaks On Yet Another Wonderful Day In Hell,4,18 February 2014,"Yep. The trees in this film were certainly 100% wood, alright. And, on a whole, I'd say that they made much better actors than did the likes of that complete piece of wood, Bruce Campbell.(And, yeah, that goes double for the rest of the incompetent twits in this troupe of second-rate amateurs, as well!) OK. You can call me ""Mr. Jaded"" if you like, but, from where I was sitting, this original version of The Evil Dead (that's ""TED"", for short) certainly didn't come anywhere near to living up to all of the preposterous praise and over-baked hype that's been heaped upon it over these past thirty-something years.And, hey, excuse me if I've suddenly forgotten how to laugh, but I'd sure like to know what the heck people are talking about when they refer to the so-called ""comedy"" factor of TED.And besides TED being a notorious film for delivering far too many red herrings for its own good, it also had a terrible knack for giving away its ""shocking' surprises long before they actually took place.Like, for instance - Always well before any horrific moment occurred, there was a noticeable, dramatic rise in the volume of the background music. And this, of course, would immediately clue the viewer in that something definitely ""not nice"" was most certainly coming their way.As you can well-imagine this nonsense totally ruined the overall effect of any intended surprises & shocks.All-in-all - The original Evil Dead was something of a major disappointment, in my books. I didn't hate this movie, but, with that said, I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they were freaking-out on acid or else at the fall-down stage of being drunk.Hey!

83,Stevieboy666,My favourite Video Nasty,10,24 July 2020,"Two guys and three girls go for a short break at a cabin in the woods, only to release an ancient evil. Demonic possession and death soon follows.
I can remember The Evil Dead being banned as a Video Nasty back in the 1980's but thankfully a friend of mine had it on tape. We would often sit and watch it whilst indulging in some under age drinking. Very happy memories! Thankfully we live in more enlightened times and the film has been available uncut since 2001
This in my opinion is a low budget masterpiece, quite probably my favourite horror movies of the decade, and that's quite a statement! The pace is fast, the acting good. The film is scary, atmospheric, violent and very gory but there is also a degree of humour. I loved the Hills Have Eyes poster hanging in the basement. I have lost count of how many times I have seen it but it's one of those movies that I never tire of, absolutely love it. Personally I think it's better than part 2, and far, far better than 3. Raimi and Campbell's best film,the best film on the Video Nasties list and one of my favourite horror movies of all time.

84,dee.reid,"""Evil"" Indeed!",10,15 September 2003,"As a birthday present to myself (and to gear up for the upcoming Halloween movie season), yesterday I bought the ""Book of the Dead"" edition of Sam Raimi's 1982 horror classic, ""The Evil Dead."" I had rented it the night before and much to my mother's dismay, I instantly fell in love with it. ""The Evil Dead"" concerns five friends, including Ash (cult favorite Bruce Campbell), as they go on a vacation to the mountains. They spend the night in one of those spooky log cabins and as you know, trouble's a brewing. One of them, discovers the infamous ""Book of the Dead"" and as the plot requires, they read from it, not knowing that doing so would be opening up a Pandora's Box of ghastly horrors. One by one the friends are possessed by the malevolent forces that had been lying dormant in the woods, leaving only Ash to fight them off.""The Evil Dead"" is truly a classic in every sense. It's not scary at all, but does have quite a lot of tension. I would guess that if this is scary to any degree, it's not because of atmosphere really, but more because of the horrific makeup used and the incredibly gory special effects. All of this is lightened up by a really dark sense of humor that would become more apparent in the later sequels.Sam Raimi really knows how to direct a good horror movie and of course would try to shake off this image over the next 20 years, which would lead him to directing last year's ""Spider-Man."" The hand-held camera shots, up close angles of Bruce Campbell in later scenes, is all genius movie-making.""The Evil Dead"" is a great horror film, don't miss it. 10/10",The Evil Dead

87,robfollower,Enjoy your stay... you'll be Dead by Dawn! Join Us .......,9,6 October 2021,"There's no denying the cult status of this 1981 horror gem. The Evil Dead is super low budget and almost humorous and the spectacle that it is. Enjoy your stay... you'll be Dead by Dawn!I saw this film on VHS repeated times during my collage years . It was always a sure bet to freak me out on those wild Saturday (Not so sober nights) in my my wild days.I never got to see this film in the movie theater . But do to the 40th anniversary special event ; Premiere Date: October 15, 1981 (Detroit, Michigan) the movie was released in limited cinemas across the nation ! I made sure to take advantage of this Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror on the big screen it was a sold out theater .Some interesting history on the production of the film.A bunch of friends got together at an abandoned cabin in the woods to shoot an independent horror film for under $375,000.The writer/ director Sam Raimi and the star was a buddy of his from High School , Bruce Campbell. They found themselves with part of a movie complete and a lot of the cast and crew already gone. So the intrepid Sam, along with his big brother Ivan, his little brother Ted and, of course, Bruce Campbell set out to finish the film by getting their friends and family to stand in for the vanished actors (they were credited as ""Fake Shemps"", in a great ""Three Stooges"" reference). There was even a long stretch of filming in which the only actor available was Campbell himself. It took so long that Bruce goes through a number of lengths of hair during the run time of the film.When they finally finished the film, using every trick the young film makers could pull out of their sleeves, at last the film known as Book of the Dead debuted in a local theatre in Detroit. Then producer Irvin Shapiro went and changed the name of the film to The Evil Dead! What else could go wrong?Well, from that point, apparently very little. As soon as The Evil Dead hit theatres it made its money back and then some. They picked up a very positive review from Stephen King and distribution deals out the wazoo.The Evil Dead does have a good deal of humorous moments like the sequels . But the original is the scariest . The way sparse and daunting horror should be ! There are very scary moments here as a result of the brainstorming of Sam Raimi and friends.The way it was written where ultimately the women are possessed by ""Kandarian demons""and come after to kill there boyfriends to flip the script was total genius.The practical effects and make up of the possessed girls was outstanding given the budget . I will never forget the first time I saw the character ""Cheryl"" levitate that scene freaked me out and resonated my scare-o-meter for years to come.The sounds in this film contribute greatly to its horror. The relentlessly laughing demons with the little girl voices and the impossibly contorting bodies are very frightening, especially when they turn their psychological magic toward taunting Ash into insanity.The Evil Dead is a serious horror flick. A true independent film with an inventive cast and crew that helped it to become in my view on of my favorite horror film of all time ! 9/10.",The Evil Dead
88,GiraffeDoor,Bringing the artistic credibility of gore back.,9,5 March 2019,"Once upon a time there was the idea that horror movies were just festivals of gore and shock with no actual frights.Then came some horror movies that didn't have any gore in them at all. But they didn't think to replace it with anything so they didn't even have the one redeeming character of the other type.This is why The Evil Dead is so refreshing. It's not another generic gorefest but neither does it have a phobic attitude to a little blood and viscera.The texture of this movie...it's almost cartoonish in it's camp usage of the macabre, with its cackling demons rapacious flora. It's pretty terrifying being confronted with this hellish little world that went from just another camping trip to worse than a nightmare. There is a...rawness about this movie. Maybe it owes something to its troubled production somehow, but you can feel the pain the characters are going through in an unpretentious meditation on reality as you know it going completely insane.A welcome antidote to that breed of horror that thinks we won't notice its cliches just because it does them without splatter.",The Evil Dead
89,Lechuguilla,Cabin In The Woods,5,5 April 2015,"The premise is simple. Five generic college students arrive at an inconspicuous cabin in the woods for a few days of vacation. Unbeknownst to them, the cabin and the surrounding woods are home to evil beings that are dormant ... that is, until the kids find an old book and tape recorder filled with zombie gibberish. The story is set mostly during one night. Dense fog obscures one's vision outside the cabin.The first-half plot isn't bad. The camera takes the POV of unseen entities, darting here and there. And the kids spend a lot of time exploring the cabin and its cellar, waiting and listening, as eerie sounds put them on guard that something isn't quite right. The music, too, adds to the sinister atmosphere.But if the first half conveys a pleasantly spooky atmosphere because of what we do not see, the second half's plot plummets to stupidity because of what we do see. No longer hidden, the evil makes itself visible, in the form of nightmarish images and gratuitous gore. The film thus loses its suspense and mystery.The second-half plot trends repetitive as the same fate befalls one kid after another. And the gore continues to escalate. Nearing the film's merciful end, I started getting a headache, as the gore got progressively more annoying.The film has no thematic depth. And since the underlying premise presumes a supernatural explanation, we can't apply logic to any story element. Acting is largely irrelevant. The credibility of the film thus lies mostly in sound effects and special effects, which are nicely crafted but over-used. I would have enjoyed the film more if the zombies, or whatever they're called, had been less visible and if the gore factor had been hugely reduced.",The Evil Dead
90,jimbo-53-186511,"Mostly on point, but fails slightly in one key area",6,12 October 2021,"Five friends travel to a cabin in a remote woodland area. Upon arrival, they find a tape recorder in the cellar and out of intrigue they decide to listen to the recording. Unbeknownst to the friends, after listening to the recording, they have unwittingly released some undead demons who begin to pick the friends off one by one...The Evil Dead has a classic horror set-up; there is the isolated setting providing a claustrophobic atmosphere and several suspense-filled moments. I did particularly like the film in its early stages when some supernatural presence captures one of the friends outside the cabin and subjects her to a terrifying ordeal (this was one of the best moments of the film in my opinion). I've always had the assertion (particularly with horror films) that fear of the unknown or what you cannot see is more frightening than what is known or that which you can see. That's what made the first half of the film work so well; it was intriguing, mysterious and pretty creepy and it's a shame really that the 'supernatural presence' outside of the cabin was not used to better effect.The reason I say this is that once the possessions begin to take place and the demons begin to attack the living the film loses some of the suspense it so admirably built up and became a bit silly and cartoonish. Despite the best efforts of the costume and make-up department, the undead do not look particularly scary and for me that took away some of the viewing experience.Although The Evil Dead weakens slightly in the second half, Raimi does still manage to provide many tense scenes and some of those involving the undead are quite good (although many are predictable). The film is short and gets going fairly quickly so is never boring. As I've mentioned, a lot of effort has gone into the costume and make-up with the undead, but I only wish that cinematically it was all a bit more worthwhile - like I say it all looks more silly than scary which is a great shame.Despite some of its flaws, The Evil Dead gets more right than wrong. It's suspensful from start to finish, but loses some of its edge slightly in the second half. What lets the film down is the goofy undead which to me were not particularly scary.In my opinion, this film works better as a suspense thriller, but the problem is that this is not how The Evil Dead sells itself.",The Evil Dead
91,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""We can't bury Shelly, she's a friend of ours!""",10,31 October 2017,"When I first ever watched this, I was just left kind of bewildered and queasy-headed because the endless barrage of over the top screaming and chaotic action was a bit overwhelming, it was quite the ""gruelling"" experience indeed.. But on subsequent viewings years later I really grew to love this movie and appreciate its place in cinematic horror history as an important landmark of which the influence has been quite profound and it's among my favourites now. It just has a lot of what I personally tend to go for in a good fun horror movie; it's fast and doesn't stop once it really gets going, it's has loads or rich eerie little touches and is brimming with the most fantastic classically scary atmosphere, I mean being set in a secluded cabin in the desolate woods in the middle of nowhere on a dark and stormy night, it's got one of the best kinds of atmospheres that a horror fan could wish for, and that cabin and those woods were a perfect setting as well as a pitch-perfect setup for when the really crazy demonic s**t starts to go down. All of that stuff is incredibly well established and built up before it actually starts to happen. It has characters that you actually feel for a little, Eileen Sandweiss' rising hysterics as Shelly who somehow can sense that they've unleashed something terrible upon themselves by hearing the incantation is very effective until she's the first to get possessed, and Bruce Campbell was so young and wet around the ears, the Ash in this is a bit of a wimp until he starts trying to fight back after he gets put through he wringer, and boy does he ever! It also has a lot of over the top splatter gore especially at the end when everything's all crooked and he gets hosed down by the blood pipe and the projector turns red and explodes, all the gore is used really well. You can tell it's a low budget picture but it just works such wonders with the mood and camera-work that the grunginess and bare-bones aspect of it just adds to the overall feel, and like with a lot of the cult horror classics from back in the day, the quality and charm shines through the dingy cracks and it all works out so amazingly well despite itself. Again once it starts rolling and they're all completely f****d after hearing the tape recorder's forbidden words of certain doom, it becomes a real ride into madness and terror, but it also always has a good sense of fun about it too somehow, people die and get dismembered but it never comes off as too much of a sickening horror movie, with the possible exception of THAT scene! In the exuberance of its more lively moments there's a certain subtle knowing goofiness there. But it's still way more of a serious horror movie than the second and third movies, and I personally think it's better than them for that. The possessed are so cool, I love how automatically demented and vicious they are, far from being mere angry unquiet spirits, these vile entities really do seem like utterly insane toxic dead souls from some unimaginable nether-hell who's only care is spreading death and destruction! My favourite malicious corpse is Linda, her giggling and clown-like facial distortions are so creepy and in comparison to the other demon zombies which are mostly mindlessly violent she/it is more a jovial sort who is so happy to be among the corporeal once again after an eternity of ancient slumber, although when push comes to shove she's just as bloodthirsty! I love the explosive use of stop motion effects work used in the climax as the demons dissolve into green putrescence as the dreaded book burns. It does look crude and even kind of s**tty, but is still more importantly an awesome blast at the same time, not unlike the movie as a whole really! This movie is to this day such a glorious horror romp and it still has the same raw visceral and spooky macabre magic that deservedly made it into a beloved classic, one that is positively to die for!

92,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Horror classic,10,26 October 2015,"Sam Raimi's hyperactive, crazed The Evil Dead is a benchmark zombie flick, a milestone in the realm of practical effects, and just a bloody damn good time at the movies. And I do mean bloody, as gallons upon gallons of blood, puss, and all manner of other goo are spilt, and slabs of latex gore are flung around for nearly the entire hour and a half running time. Now iconic Bruce Campbell plays Ash, a hardware store clerk on a remote getaway with a few friends at a cabin in the woods. Upon entering the dilapidated base,sent, they find a seriously no touchy looking book, which of course they open anyway, reading some of the strange words within. The book is the Necronimicon, containing ancient incantations which bring the forces of evil to wild, screaming, laughing, projectile vomiting life. No sooner have they spoken the words, something makes its way from the woods to haunt them relentlessly. The POV shots of a fast moving 'something' tearing it's way across the underbrush towards the cabin are now iconic as well, and a telling sign of the delirious horrors to come. Corpses start to come back to life, and really mean that. These aren't shambling, sluggish undead, or rage virus fast ones either. They're the film's own brand of demented zombies, spastic lunatics that howl, cackle, speak in tongues, spew bile everywhere, cavort around like chickens with their heads cut off (which happens) and generally liven up the movie with their nonsensical antics. Oh yeah, and there's a scene where a girl gets rated by a gropy tree (!). It's all filmed in a hazy, jagged manner, unpolished and sketchy as hell, making us feel like this really is happening in so,e weird corn of the woods to these hapless people. Ash doesn't get his classic chainsaw hand or shotgun in this one, you'll have to wait for the sequel for that, which is just as awesome and amazing as this, but slightly more expensive looking. This is the ultimate cabin in the woods movie, a nerve shattering exercise in go for broke, kamikaze horror that doesn't let you catch your breath for a single second, either from screaming, laughing, or screaming with laughter.",The Evil Dead
93,drownnnsoda,"Low Budget, Campy, But Severely Impressive.",9,11 November 2006,"""The Evil Dead"" has been hailed a horror classic for many years now, and I can understand the hype behind this gruesome little low-budget shocker. The story is rather simple: a group of five friends are driving up to a secluded mountain cabin to spend a few days. They arrive at the old, rundown little cabin in the middle of nowhere, and while investigating around the property, they find a creepy book with a tape player in the cellar. The kids decide to play the tape around the fire, and unknowingly, they release an evil force. Soon after, the friends begin to become possessed by an evil entity that turns them into grim, deadly zombies. As each of the friends begin to turn into the horrible monsters, Ash (Bruce Campbell) is the only one left, and must fight against his friends-gone-zombies. Can he survive the night? While this movie has a large amount of flaws, its unique originality make it so rewarding. There's continuity errors all over this movie. We see the tubes used to spew blood from the zombies, things change in-between shots, and you can obviously see that the moon in the background of some shots is clearly a matted image. So, what gives? This movie is still an excellent piece of horror despite all of the errors. It's amateurish, yet it's not. Had the filmmakers had more resources, this movie would've been perfect in nearly every way. But I think the low-budget feel that this movie has is part of its campy charm. The budget on the film somehow manages to not bring down the movie in the least. The camera-work in this movie is highly impressive, and I can understand why Sam Raimi became such a big director. He knows how to make a movie, and does it well and with style.The acting in this film, like everything else, isn't perfect. It's decent enough, but nothing even remotely award winning. Bruce Campbell is the lead character, and is likable and has the audience rooting for him throughout the movie. The special effects in this movie are sometimes laughable but oh-so-messy. The blood and makeup effects are really corny looking, but despite that this movie is unbelievable violent. I can see why it was given an NC-17 rating. Even though the violence may not be entirely realistic, it's pretty nasty stuff. The atmosphere and setting in the movie is perfect - the secluded cabin in the woods is a perfect backdrop for the story, where almost everything in the movie takes place. I really liked the cabin setting, it was claustrophobic and worked greatly in the film's favor.Overall, ""The Evil Dead"" is campy, violent, and often funny in some respects, but it remains an important film in the horror genre because of its originality and craftiness. Its campy and unbelievable violence is a treat for horror fans, and even if that's not your cup of tea, the movie offers a handful of genuinely frightening visuals and situations. While it may be amateurish, it's also very atmospheric and unique, and just for that, it is a deserved classic. 9/10.",The Evil Dead

Everything starts out with a group of young adults in a car heading out to a secluded cabin in the woods, as you can guess, things get pretty bad from there on. I loved the classic, creepy atmosphere all throughout the film, it contributed to the overall dark feel. The cast does a good job here, I really enjoyed their performances. Bruce Campbell in particular stands out, very enthusiastic performance. The makeup was oh so well done, i loved the scary evil look the people had to them when they became possessed by the demonic spirit.

Two things are missing from the previous DVD's are the deleted scenes and an amusing featurette with Bruce Campbell from the ""Book of the Dead"" edition. The latest Blu-ray edition, Blu-ray has an strong Pan & Scan (1.33:1) and an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer. The disc has an new Dolby Digital 5.1 HD Sound. The Blu-ray only new special feature is the running commentary track by writer/director:Raimi, producer:Robert Tapert and actor:Bruce Campbell. It doesn't includes the two original running commentary tracks. You better keep your Elite DVD or the Anchor Bay DVD with bonus features. The bonus DVD includes most of the special features of the Ultimate Edition. ""The Evil Dead"" is a major cult classic, for over 25 years that critics and especially fans of the feature make it special until this day. It's not for everyone but Raimi has plenty of imagination and skill makes it worth seeing. Followed by two sequels. (**** ½/*****).",The Evil Dead
98,EVOL666,A Masterpiece Of Low-Budget Horror Film-Making,9,17 October 2005,"Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD is one of the best examples ever made of what can be done on a small budget. Acting is great, FX are great, story is great, and even the cinematography and style are great. The story is pretty simple: some friends go to a cabin in the woods and find a strange book and some tapes in the basement. Turns out the book is the fabled NECRONOMICON, a tome that was created for the purposes of black magic and summoning demons. When the campers start fooling around with the book and tapes, they unknowingly unleash the demonic hordes! THE EVIL DEAD is truly a horror classic. Bruce Campbell is excellent as ASH (a role he reprised for EVIL DEAD 2, and ARMY OF DARKNESS). The gore and other FX still hold up to this day, and is still a blast to watch. If you haven't seen this one, you know nothing about horror! 9/10",The Evil Dead

I guess Edgar Wright got it from here. Also, now after watching this for the first time I realized that Cabin in the Woods is full of Evil Dead refrences. I can also see the things Evil Dead took from other movies etc. Psycho and it is used in a cool way. Visual effects were bad in scene or two but they stood the test of time for me and were so realistic and raw. Make up is also well done. Bruce Campbell carried the movie and was the highlight of the film. The score is also perfect and haunting. I felt unsettling most of the times and on the edge for the most part. Very smart to pick one location for the whole movie and spend the rest of the money for effects and other stuff.

101,slokes,The House Is The Star,7,11 November 2014,"While it's not the first film in the ""Evil Dead"" franchise to recommend to a non-seasoned viewer, ""The Evil Dead"" has pride of place for being the first of the films, as well as for being so visceral and intense.Five young people journey to a mountain cabin near the Tennessee border for a weekend getaway, only to accidentally awaken malevolent spirits of the dead by flicking the ""play"" switch on a recorded recitation of ""ancient Sumerian burial rituals and funerary incantations."" One by one, they are done in by the grisly ghouls, until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left to deal with the supernatural menace – or die trying.Billed as ""The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror,"" ""Evil Dead"" is markedly different from what you expect having seen the first two sequels. There's no ""groovy"" catch-phrase in this one, and the terms ""deadites"" or ""Necronomicon"" aren't mentioned. (The ""Book of the Dead"" here is called ""Naturon Demonto."") Humor is mostly in the eye of the beholder; on the surface this is a ""video nasty"" that lives up to its name with exploding heads and a straight-faced, unforgettable depiction of tree-rape.I'm not on board with the idea of this being a classic. But it is a good horror film, directed by Sam Raimi with real flair and engaging depth-of-field camera-work. After a slow opening 22 minutes, the film kicks into high gear and never lets up all the way to the end.The film proved a bit of a slow-grower. A sluggish box-office performer when released in 1981, it has since become a bigger deal culturally than ""Chariots Of Fire,"" the year's Oscar-winner for best film, as well as other big 1981 hits. Great, no, but it has a kind of greatness about it.""Why are you torturing me like this?"" Ash cries out at one point.""We're going to get you..."" the spirits answer, singing tauntingly.What makes the film work so well as I see it is not the acting, which is frill-free minimalist work to put it kindly, but rather the sense of location. The strange house, more a shack really, is a thing of wonder, with various rooms tricked out with odds and ends that suggest more than we see. There's a bit of a ""Snoopy's doghouse"" effect going on here, as the house interior seems way too spacious and crammed with accouterments to match the exterior we see. There's even an attic visible in some exterior shots which never comes into play in this movie.Why are the kids so insanely willing to stay in the house when things start to go so wrong? The car steering wheel suddenly acts on its own, the bridge they drive on to the house gives way as they pass over it, a pendulum clock stops in mid-swing, a woman's hand becomes possessed as she sketches, and a trap door bangs and flies open by itself. Perhaps it's some moonshine they drank that was lost in the editing, or some pot-smoking which was scripted but never filmed. The end result is you never really care about these dumb characters, who seem more like lab rats than people. Without the same level of humor that buoys ""Evil Dead 2"" so brilliantly, you don't care as much as you should.But that's more a quibble than a fault. The positives outweigh the negatives, especially in terms of the brilliant sound design by Joe Masefield (which adds immeasurably to the spooky mood throughout). They are further enhanced on the DVD thanks to dueling commentaries by Campbell and by Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, who play up their different views of what went wrong and right with what apparently was a grueling production.The end result was worth the struggle. ""Ultimate Experience,"" maybe not, but ""Evil Dead"" is a solid stab at shock horror that will leave you breathless, and quite possibly wanting more.",The Evil Dead
102,fertilecelluloid,The ultimate horror flick for teenage boys,7,20 October 2006,"This is the ultimate horror movie for teenage boys and a good place to get a horror obsession off the ground. It is well shot with a plethora of crazy angles and wacky point of view shots, it ladles the blood on thick, it has the King of Goofy (Bruce Campbell) in the lead role, and it's not afraid to be nasty. The special effects are more enjoyable than realistic and the rural setting works a treat. The film, shot on 16mm and blown up to 35mm, had a big technical influence on many directors and broke new ground in terms of horror-comedy. Campbell, as usual, delivers a tongue in cheek performance and wants us to have as much fun as he's having. Director Raimi went on to very big things (""Spiderman"", for example) and followed this up with a more technically polished sequel. My only complaint is that Raimi steers well clear of any female nudity. He should have known that teenage boys eat that stuff up. Bigger boys don't mind it, either.",The Evil Dead
103,dworldeater,"""Join us""!",8,20 May 2020,"Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is a very original splatter flick for it's time that would be a great start to a series and very influncial to loads of other filmmakers. Pretty serious in tone, 2 couples rent a cabin in the woods and discover The Necronomicon and awaken The Evil Dead. Very different for its time this gory fright film delivers on both scares and horrific make up f/x. This has very little comedy and moves at a slower pace than the other entries in the series. I must admit, I prefer Evil Dead 2 with more Bruce Campbell, the introduction of splatstick comedy. Evil Dead 2 is pretty much a reimagined version of the 1st film that does everything the 1st film does better. But, that is only my preference and opinion. Having said that, The Evil Dead is still very good and the most pure horror movie of the lot. A classic.",The Evil Dead
104,Witchfinder-General-666,The Epitome Of Horror... And Ingenious Film-Making!,10,7 February 2009,"There are good Horror films, there are great Horror films and then there are masterpieces that every Horror fan, no, every film fan MUST see. Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" of 1981 definitely belongs to the latter category. If a survey was held among true Horror fans, this film would certainly be one of the most frequent titles in the top ten. And for good reasons, as this low budget masterpiece is one of the most awe-inspiring, creepiest, scariest and simply amazing Horror films ever produced. The amazing fact aside that Raimi and his crew shot this with an incredibly low budget, ""The Evil Dead"" accomplishes what hardly another film has. This is easily one of the scariest, creepiest, simply terrifying Horror/Gore films ever made. Even though this is one of the films that epitomize the term Horror, however, it is also witty and hilariously funny at times, which is something unique for a film as scary as this one. At the time of its release, the film was heavily bashed by critics for its extreme violence and gore, and censored and banned in several countries. If anything, however, the repulsion of censors and some critics helped the film achieve an instant cult-status. Director Sam Raimi instantly became known as a Horror master, the leading man Bruce Campbell became one of the most celebrated Horror/B-movie cult-actors, and ""The Evil Dead"" has since long been recognized as a milestone of the Horror genre.""The Evil Dead"" takes place in a world of the all-mighty H. P. Lovecraft whose amazing literary work has been the base of many brilliant Horror films. And nothing does the man's genius more justice than a cinematic masterpiece like this film. The film follows a group of friends (two guys and three girls) who want to spend a fun weekend in a remote log cabin in the woods. When they find a tape in the basement of the house, they play it out of curiosity and subsequently awaken evil spirits which possess them one by one...I do not want to give away too much, but I will say this: ""The Evil Dead"" is an absolute must see for everybody even slightly interested in Horror. As mentioned above, this film epitomizes the term ""Horror"" and is extremely creepy and purely terrifying from the beginning to the end, and yet it is also funny - a combination which is, at least to this degree, extremely rare. As opposed to most films, this film's extremely morbid sense of humor does in no way lessen the constant suspense, but goes perfectly in hand with it. The gore is not only extreme, but also extremely well-made. By the time of its release, this was one of the goriest American films ever, today it proudly stands as one of the most celebrated Horror/Gore films ever made. Bruce Campbell is the ONLY choice for the leading character Ash here. Campbell has long become a cult-figure and one of the most popular Horror actors, and while the man is great in every role he plays, he will always be Ash to his fans. The film is impressive in all regards, especially visually (even more so regarding the low budget). The brilliant cinematography contributes a lot to the films incredible scariness, the makeup is incomparably creepy and the gore effects are amazing. The film's sound effects, the voices,... there is simply nothing about this film that is not scary and simply fantastic. The film spawned two sequels so far, which are both very good, but for me this terrifying and ingenious original is still the greatest. Another sequel is planned for 2010. I've personally seen ""The Evil Dead"" countless times and I sure intend to see it countless more times. I could on praising this film forever, but I'll end this comment with a recommendation: If there is a poor soul out there who hasn't seen it so far, do so immediately. ""The Evil Dead"" is an ingenious masterpiece, and no one interested in Horror or film in general can afford to miss it. 10/10",The Evil Dead
105,TOMNEL,Night of the Living Dead meets the Excorcist...and this is better than both.,9,2 June 2008,"This is a very silly movie...not as silly as the two sequels it spawned, but it's still silly. The violence is very over the top, and the villains of the film are creatures inhabiting the bodies of the characters, brought to life through black magic. The girl in the Excorcist said some pretty crazy stuff when she was possessed, and the characters here are just as rude and over the top. It's actually sometimes hilarious. At the same time, this is one of the most nerve wracking scariest horror flicks. You have no idea what's going to happen at any moment, and you feel for the protagonist Ash (Bruce Campbell) who's going through Hell trying to get out of this abandoned cabin.Five kids go into the woods to an abandoned cabin, and after playing back a tape recorder, and evil force is unleashed. They try to survive as these strange spirits try to kill them off and possess their bodies. In order to kill the possessed people, known as deadites, their heads must be dismembered, leading to a lot of gore, and some violent and scary scenes.Evil Dead, more than any other movie I've seen, has such a perfect mixture of slapstick and horror. These creatures are so vile and nasty, but at the same time somewhat humorous in their over the top nature, and the extreme gore effects. Someone could be chopping another person's head off, which would normally try to be scary, but here it's so over the top and the camera work is so fast it becomes comical. It's a really great mixture of humor and horror.Overall, this is a great movie, which spawned off two sequels that were actually superior to it.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. R for language and violence.",The Evil Dead
106,caspian1978,A Horrific Masterpiece,7,13 January 2005,"Sam Raimi proved to the world that he could not only direct a movie but that he could create a product that was not only original but that could scare the hell out of you. Since the 1981 release, Bruce Campbell has found work on many film projects due to his break out performance in the Evil Dead. Raimi, has gone on to direct many films. Both have earned much of their career based on this little horror movie, that has been re-produced / recycled by thousands of ""wanna-be"" film makers world wide. This is not your typical ""zombie"" film, let alone your garden variety horror movie as well. The Evil Dead is one of those black comedies / horror movies that overwhelms the audience to either be scared out of their wits or won over by the movie's story and over the top characters.

107,aidanratesmovies,Impressive low budget horror flick dulled down by thin plot,7,27 March 2020,"Although at times it's often over-the-top nature and peculiar storyline can be generally amusing, Evil Dead suffers most from dragging out its plot till it wears thin, and becomes dull in the process. All the performances in the film, besides that of Bruce Campbell, vary on being generally okay to mildly cheesey. Bruce Campbell doesn't get his time to shine in the film in comparison to the others in the franchise, but his performance is well done, as he clearly shows the most emotion and does it the most well throughout the course of the film. At times, the action and gore is certainly over the top, but the thrills can be particularly interesting to watch, especially on how far the scene is willing to go to illustrate a point. However, this can also be its most fatal flaw, as the film at time becomes rather frustrating, trying to span out the time in the film with the events in order to make a proper time cut. In the end, the film seems too long, even though its runtime is less than 90 minutes. It's a shame because of the pacing, and its campy nature doesn't seem appreciative enough to capture my attention, to what it could have been if it were shorter, or more likely, had more going on. In the end, The Evil Dead is a horror classic that has not aged well for the modern viewer. It can be amusing at times, but fails to deliver on all accounts, and seems more like an interesting idea dragged out, than a complete film itself. It can be impressive for its low budget, but in the end, doesn't have enough material to truly capture the eye of those watching. Its ending however, does leave more room for hope though, and will hopefully lead to improve on the sequels to come.

If you've ever had any interest in making movies, then you've probably taken a look at this one, because ""The Evil Dead"" is a masterpiece of low budget filmmaking. The techniques they use throughout the film aren't only inventive; they work well and to this day they look pretty darn convincing and grueling.The pacing is great; the schmaltzy acting (which gets even better, by which I mean more ridiculous, in ""Evil Dead II"") is wonderful; the hectic camerawork is simply astounding; the special effects still look pretty awesome even today; and most impressively, this was all done by a bunch of college kids for $350,000 in a cabin in Tennessee.""The Evil Dead"" straight up rocks",The Evil Dead
110,mrdonleone,Evil Dad,9,17 March 2003,"In my life I saw 2 movies who scared the sh*t out of me. The first one was CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, in '79. The other was EVIL DEAD, a few years later. Although HOLOCAUST is even harder, EVIL DEAD still is one of my favourites. The story is origineel, and it's perfect directed by Sam Riaimi, who also directed movies such as THE GIFT (with Keano Reeves). Bruce Campbell is excellent as Ash, a man who doesn't know what danger's ahead. Remarquable is the fact that a member of the Riami family also plays a role in the movie. Really scary music. This movie is a must for every horror freak like me, but still I've got to say that you've gotta be careful with the UNCUT-version. At the backside you see Ash without a leg, but that scene isn't in the movie on that particular tape. Be sure it's really UNCUT before you buy it, is my advice.

111,a_chinn,The original Ash vs. Deadites,10,17 September 2018,"Classic low budget horror film that I love and can no longer objectively review. Directorial debut of Sam Raimi (""Army of Darkness"" ""A Simple Plan"" ""Spider-Man""), film debut of cult favorite Bruce Campbell in his most iconic role as Ash Williams (although his Elvis in ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" is my personal favorite), and the filmscore debut of prolific composer Joseph LoDuca (""Xena: Warrior Princess"" ""Spartacus"" ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""). The film was produced by Rob Tapert, who'd go on to produce many more films and TV shows with Raimi. Ash and his group of friends in their 73 Oldsmobile head to a remote cabin in the woods and inadvertently wake the evil dead when they read aloud from the Necrocomicon. Demonic possessions, evil trees, and all sorts of weirdness ensue. For such a low budget film, it's manages to to be visually inventive (particularly the evil spirit POV shots through the woods), shockingly gory (but in a fun over-the-top way), and also works wonderfully as a black comedy. ""Evil Dead 2"" does feature better special effects and is much more consistent in tone, staying consistent as a dark horror comedy than this first film, which at times wants to be a straight horror film and at other times wants to be tongue-in-check, but those are minor quibbles for a film that's terrifically fun and wildly inventive. A must see for horror fans, but maybe not a film for all tastes.",The Evil Dead
112,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Low Budget Masterpiece,10,23 December 2019,"This film I have an interesting past with. I saw Army of Darkness first, then had my mother pick up Evil Dead 2 before finally seeing this one. I don't think my video store had this so we bought it on VHS as the reason why. It is an interesting way to watch it as both of them are more comedic where this really has much more of the horror. I've seen this quite a few times now, with the last time being in the theater on 4K. The synopsis is five friends travel to a cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.We start with a group of friends in a car going to a cabin that is in the middle of the woods. The man driving is Scott (Richard DeManincor) with his girlfriend sitting next to him Shelly (Theresa Tilly). He is kind of a jerk and likes to play jokes on those around him, some of which are not that funny. In the back is Ashley J. Williams (Bruce Campbell) with his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker). Campbell's sister is also along Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss).Odd things happen from the beginning. The wheel to the car locks and it is aimed right for a truck that is coming. It actually rips out of Scott's hands. He blames Ash for it happening, but he tells Scott that he just took it in for a tune-up. They have to go over an old bridge and along a narrow path to the cabin. There is a porch swing that is hitting the shuttered window until Scott takes the key down from the door frame and it. It then shots moving by itself.They unpack and start to settle in. Cheryl likes to draw and is doing of a clock. Something is calling to her to join them from the woods and then her hand is taken over by something. It makes her draw a rough looking book with a face. They then have dinner when the door to the cellar flings open. They all look into it and Scott goes down to see what caused it.Ash calls out to him, but he doesn't respond. He then takes a lantern to go find out what is happening. The cellar is dark, damp and weird things are hanging from the ceiling. He goes into a back room and Scott scares him. They find a table with a shotgun, shells, a book that has a face and looks odd as well as an old tape recorder along with a long knife with skeletons on it.This stuff is all brought upstairs and they start to listen to the tape. The voice is a professor who found this text while doing a dig and has come here with his wife to translate it. The book is the Book of the Dead; it is bound with human flesh and inked in human blood. It contains ways to summon demons and things to this nature. The tape upsets Cheryl and she shuts it off. Scott wants to hear more so he fast forwards it and plays it again. He ends up to a point where the voice is saying a incantation. We then see something wakes up in the woods. Cheryl screams to shut it off and a tree crashes through the window.Cheryl goes to her room and something is calling to her. She goes outside and is attacked by the trees. She does make it back to the cabin and demands that Ash take her into town. They soon learn they're trapped when the bridge is destroyed. They go back and Cheryl becomes possessed. She attacks them and in turn possesses others. Can this group find a way out of this nightmare and survive?Since I've already given my history with this movie, I'll get into this. This is more horror than the others ones and even though I know what's going to happen, it still creeps me out. What is insane though is how low of a budget that writer/director Sam Raimi had to work with though. They went far with what they had to bring this all to life for sure.I should also state that some of the movies that terrify me the most are possession films. I might not be able to necessarily stop a killer, but I have a fighting chance. When it comes to films with demons like this, I wouldn't know what to do and would probably either die or become possessed before I could. This also does bring a bit of issue I have here. Not enough to effect my rating, but my problem is that there doesn't really seem to be a rhyme or reason for who becomes possessed. Cheryl gets attacked and I understand her. Same thing for Linda and Shelly, but Ash is attacked in similar ways and he seems to be able to resist. It doesn't get explained either.Something else I do like is the Book of the Dead. They don't use the name Necronomican yet, but that's what it ends up becoming. I really like the concept of this book that contains ways to bring these demons to life. It is spooky that they're just living around us, not bothering us and they seem to be upset when their slumber is disturbed. I also like that after what the professor did, they're subtly roaming the woods and messing with these people. I do want to know if the incantation needs to be read every night to attack or what. That's something else that is not fully explained either.I do have to say that the pacing of this is really good as well. It doesn't take long for creepy things to happen and we get to meet the characters around it. This is interesting as well, because we get to know them through seeing fear of what is going on. With a runtime of 85 minutes, it doesn't outstay its welcome and the horrific elements are evenly paced throughout. As I said, it never gets boring either and I like how this all ends.That brings me to the acting. I will admit, it is quite amateur and I have to commend them for going out to do what they did here. Campbell isn't the Ash that we know and love yet, but you get glimpses. You can also see that he would go on to do great things as well. I like him here as our lead. Sandweiss I thought was fine. She's kind of hysterical, but I almost think that is due to her being more in tune with the supernatural without realizing it. She is also easy to isolate. DeManincor is a jerk and I think he does well. He got a reaction out of me, so I have to give credit there. Baker and Tilly are both fine. I did find Baker to be pretty attractive. Everyone also does really good when they're possessed. It is so creepy if I'm going to be honest.That will take me to the effects, which for the budget look really good. They were all done practically. Some of them were clever and still gross me out. The blood we get looks good and I like that the possessed people have almost black blood. I think this is an interesting choice to kind of differentiate. There is a bit of an issue that the blood and gore on characters isn't also consistent, but that's fine. There's a lot to keep stretch and someone who has worked as a Script Supervisor, that can be tough. It is also shot very well in my opinion.A grip that I do have is with the 4K version only. They added a new soundtrack to it. I heard on a podcast about it and now that I've seen it, I agree with them. I don't like it. I thought going for almost not having a soundtrack over most of it was actually creepier for me. I can't hold this aspect against the film, as my DVD is different there. I just wanted to bring it up if you happen to check out that version as well.Now with that said, this film has a lot of nostalgia for me. I can recognize that this low budget effort has flaws, but I'm going to overlook them. Many of them don't really affect anything so there's that. The demons here are creepy and even after knowing how things play out due to multiple viewings, it still works. I like the Book of the Dead that is used here. Like I said, there are some inconsistent story parts. The effects though looked good and the pacing is effective to a solid ending. I don't like the soundtrack that is added for the 4K and prefer the original way we got it. This is definitely a classic and I believe this to be a great movie.",The Evil Dead

The Evil Dead is one of the greatest and funniest horror pictures ever made and an inspiration to filmmakers everywhere. It's an undisputed classic. Shot in 1979, it's still just as effective today. The gallons of blood, the flying body parts, the evil laughter, it's all in good fun. And, yet, it's all horrific. The movie works so well largely because of four factors: the genius of Rob Tapert, the stylish direction of Sam Raimi, the crude make-up of Tom Sullivan, and the facial expressions of Bruce Campbell. Everything is forced to blend together seamlessly. It's all beautifully and brilliantly done. The Evil Dead is a cult favorite for a reason.

It's the perfect example of an unexpectedly popular cult movie shot on an extremely low budget. It's an independent movie legend, that has spawned tons of fans and imitators, and it still remains an impressive little movie to this day. Despite a small budget, Sam Raimi and his crew work with a lot of great special effects, especially during the film's gruesome finale, that is packed with gore and stop motion. ""The Evil Dead"" certainly has technical flaws and some strange editing decisions throughout, but these flaws help add to its charm. It's not a perfect film, and if it was perfect, then it wouldn't be nearly as good or entertaining, believe it or not,I would also like to mention the film's dark sense of humor. Or, at least I think it has a dark sense of humor. Honestly, I can't tell whether or not the movie is intentionally or unintentionally funny. Some scenes feel so slapsticky and over the top that they must be comedic, and the fact that the film's sequels take these comical scenes to a whole new level feels like proof of this being an intentional horror comedy. The sequels may be funnier, but that doesn't mean that the original doesn't have its laugh out loud moments.Despite dark humor being sprinkled throughout ""The Evil Dead"", it remains mostly serious throughout, and at times is genuinely frightening and intense. It is nowhere near as goofy and funny as its sequels, and has the capability to actually shock and scare me at times, unlike ""Army of Darkness"", a movie that I also love, but still doesn't remotely scare me.",The Evil Dead
116,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A very strange break into film for Mr. Raimi,6,21 March 2013,"Every famous moviemaker has a start somewhere. Some have greater beginnings (Steven Spielberg), while others are not truly recognized and are left with a strong cult following (Clive Barker). For Sam Raimi, he has the luxury of both. Not only did his first theatrical film gain popular momentum, but it also has such a large fan base that it spawned two sequels and a remake, not to mention it made the name Bruce Campbell a family name. Sam Raimi is a lucky man, but I was actually surprised to see that his first film was not what so many viewers have praised it to be. For me, it was scraping the surface of entertainment.The Evil Dead (1981) story, written and directed by Sam Raimi himself is about five friends who decide to spend some time in a cabin secluded in the woods. Little do they realize that not only does the cabin contain a deadly secret but the entire area surrounding it is in need of some serious pest control. They should've called the Ghostbusters (1984),...oh right, that company was established three years later. Anyway, this dark secret has the power to unleash deadly spirits that can inhabit any host when read from a mystical book.The thing I found the most troublesome about this movie was the fact that for everything I wanted to give full credit for, ended up only being partial credit. For example, I found the makeup effects noteworthy because it made the victims of the demons look really supernatural. However, what I could not take were the voices of the possessed victims. Either screechy and raspy, or deep and gurgley, I would prefer to hear one kind of demonic voice. At one point, one of the voices sounded like an upset stomach. I'll admit that it did make the possessed victim seem more unnatural but it still was hard on the ears.But for a film with such a low budget, it does get creative with its practical effects. At some parts of the film, it even uses stop motion animation. One of those scenes is the vine-raping scene. Unfortunately, this is a particular part of the film I really wish Raimi did not include. It's one thing if the character gave consent for this kind of thing but watching a rape scene is a tad bit too far on the ""entertainment"" description. I just felt uncomfortable watching it. Why would anyone consider it fun to watch?As for blood goes, audiences will get their fill of grossness. It's not a bloodfest but it is nasty. Just nasty. Bruce Campbell's character can't escape having buckets of blood thrown into his face every ten minutes. But here's where I get frustrated again. What is Raimi's icon? Is it Ash (Bruce Campbell)? Or is it the demon spirits that inhabit his friends? For most horror films, the antagonist is the icon that represents the franchise but in this film, I can't figure it out since the audience will never get to see the demon that inhabits Ash's friends.Lastly, the score produced by composer Joseph LoDuca, (his first theatrical score to be exact) was half hearted too. I know LoDuca can produce good work because he did it for the Xena and Hercules TV show. Did he just not have enough equipment in 1981? The only two times I hear an actual tune is in beginning and ending. This proves he knows how to make themes in music. But besides that, LoDuca relies way too much on the strings to make any kind of music. And majority of the time, I enjoy the strings. The problem is that LoDuca arranged their music to create either scratchy or plucking noises. That doesn't create tension. Besides of the fact that they were only used for mainly transition scenes. The score was barely there to begin with. This was a project I was really looking forward to enjoying but instead for every good part, there was a counter. It's by no means awful but for all the praise that it's been given, I was expecting more.",The Evil Dead

Maybe it was just part of the trends, maybe the 1980s was just when people wanted to see horrific gore, and there was a lack of options.Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's bad. I don't feel like we get a proper explanation of what the hell is happening, so no expectations is really built to be subverted, but I certainly wouldn't want this movie to explain anymore than it did.I'm honestly not sure exactly what to say about it: it's a ""don't mess with dark forces you can't possibly understand"" trope with a bunch of blood, gore, and weirdly designed possession.Part of what I enjoy about (even paranormal) survival situations like this is the idea that their is / was a way out of it, if the characters can figure it out. This is more of just someone blew up a dam, and now we're going to die from a flood.I just feel like this movie could have been a lot more, and I'm not going to remember this, but I had a good enough time watching it.",The Evil Dead
118,alexanderdavies-99382,It has a gruesome sense of style.,6,10 September 2017,"The zombie horror film owes a considerable debt to the masterpiece, ""Night of the Living Dead"" from George A. Romero. That was the movie that instigated a brand new kind of horror in cinema. ""The Evil Dead"" took the subgenre to a whole new level. The success to down to Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell. It takes a short time for the film to really warm up but once it has, there is no let up for the viewer. The bloody and gruesome set pieces are fast and furious. A group of friends are holidaying in a cabin, amidst the American countryside. An ancient evil is unleashed upon the holidaymakers as hordes of the undead besiege the cabin and the characters attempt to protect themselves. In spite of the excessive bloodletting, I wouldn't describe this horror film as being particularly frightening. It is still very watchable all the same. The direction is good on the whole. Naturally, the budget was low but it is almost non-existent here. Bruce Campbell is the only person who went on to have any kind of career as an actor. A number of scenes were either trimmed or removed completely before the American Film Censors would allow ""The Evil Dead"" to be released. A influential film.",The Evil Dead
119,Sandcooler,That...was cool,9,18 January 2006,"Sam Raimi did something directors rarely do, give the audience what they want. There's no lengthy build-up, that's a start. It can be important to care about the characters, but endlessly postponing action just makes me mad at everyone. Then there is blood and gore, and while being over-the-top is often seen as criticism, it's actually quite difficult to achieve this flaw. You can make any amount of people die horrible, violent deaths, but most of these movies just look like the director got bullied at school. Doesn't apply to ""The Evil Dead"", this is really just cool. It's up-tempo HG Lewis really. Incredibly entertaining almost from the first minute until the last, never has a horror movie been more deserving of a cult following. It's kind of a guilty pleasure, just not one I feel particularly guilty or ashamed about. It's not something new, it has never been overly original, but it has never been done better either.",The Evil Dead
120,Matt_Layden,A Horror Masterpiece - I Love This Movie.,10,20 July 2009,"This film is the definition of a horror film. It's a classic and I will never, EVER, get tired of watching it. If there is one film that I could have on a desert island, this is it. If there is one film to turn a person onto horror, this is it. If there is one film that got me into film-making, this is it.First, let me say Bruce Campbell is great, even though he is basically a chump in this outing. It's Scott who is the 'bad-ass', chopping up his possessed girlfriend with an ax. Seeing his transition from film to film is great, but here is where it all started.The film is scary as hell. I know there are people out there who thought it was too cheesy to be scary, but these are probably the same people who think Jason X is one of the greatest horror films of the last decade. Seeing Ash's girlfriend sit on the floor laughing in her high pitched tone is scary, the cabin is scary, the deadites are scary.The Evil Dead is still fresh, exciting and frightening as the day it was made. This is truly ""The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror"". Forget Spider-Man, this is Raimi's true baby. The camera work and what they did for the time and the budget is mind blowing (to me anyways). I credit this film with being a huge influence on me wanting to make films. I love the camera movement in this film, every small subtle thing works perfectly and all the obvious in your face Raimi style angles are great to see for the first time (which are still used to this day in his films).While the film is not as gory as it's sequel, it does have more cringe worthy bits. The Tree Rape scene is enough to make people's skin crawl. Or how about the 'original pencil trick'. I cheered in The Dark Knight and cringed my face in The Evil Dead. How many people still talk about this film today? Hundreds of thousands. It's been a huge impact on horror (see Cabin Fever).I always wonder about what I would do in this situation and it always ends up being the same, sitting in the corner with a shotgun and shooting anything that moves.

We're gonna get you.""The Evil Dead is ultra low-budget, ultra gory, and ultra entertaining. I recently saw the Night of the Demons remake, which has a similar premise to this movie, (group of young people trapped in a house with demons and forced to try to survive until dawn) and I hated it. It's impressive how Evil Dead did right what Night of the Demons failed at miserably so many years later (and with the advantage of a bigger budget, I'm sure). As the number of survivors in this horror flick fall to one, Ash (Bruce Campbell) is driven close to madness as he's forced to fight off the nightmarish attacks of his former friends, who have all become possessed Deadites. The demon-like creatures aren't content with just trying to kill him, they seem to take great joy in torturing him mentally as much as possible The special effects and make-up are extremely well done. The Deadites all look quite gruesome, and there's a great sense of foreboding atmosphere before they even appear. It bears repeating how great all this looks, considering how low of a budget it had. Even if it wasn't as entertaining as it is, it still would be worth seeing just as an example of what can be done with creativity and not very much money.",The Evil Dead
123,philip_vanderveken,This is still an intense and powerful movie.,7,1 April 2005,"Today we have an enormous revival of the horror genre. I guess there isn't a month in which no new horror production is released. Even though this genre seems to many young people as something new and exiting, the ""older"" people (starting with people in their late twenties and early thirties) know better. We grew up with horror classics like 'Halloween', 'The Evil Dead',...The story starts with the five youngsters driving to a cabin in the middle of nowhere. In this cabin in the middle of the woods, they find the Necronomicon and the taped translation of the text. Of course they are curious and they start playing the tape, not knowing which evil this will release. One by one, the teens become deadly zombies, except for one. Now it will be up to him to survive the night and to battle the evil dead. Even though I'm not a huge fan of gore, I still appreciated this movie. Especially the beginning of the movie is still very intense and powerful. Most of the time these movies haven't been made with a large budget, but that doesn't mean that they don't offer any good fun. 'The Evil Dead' looks rather amateurish, but that's exactly what makes it more believable and good. It seems like these five young people have filmed their own adventures. The only remark that I could have is the special effects. I know that this movie was shot in 1981 and with a small budget, but the special effects sometimes really look pretty bad. Still, this is a classic in the genre and nice to watch. I give it a 7/10.",The Evil Dead

It has some inventiveness with camera angles and jump-scares, and its staging and setting is impressive. While the general workmanship is below par the 16mm film guage suits the grubby, low-budget intensity.
There isn't much depth to the story, and it has a predictable ending. It is crude in the way it shows women as objects of violence and there doesn't appear to be reasoning to the demonic forces, but the black comedy moments and tongue-in-cheek tone are good compensation.

127,Howlin Wolf,"At the time, it mixed old and new shock tactics to stunning effect!",9,12 March 2005,"If you're a young, talented and ambitious film-maker; how to get people's attention? Well, horror's always a reliable genre in which to make your first big 'splash'; being as it doesn't have to be entirely dependant on 'flashy' effects, if you're on a tight budget. Some 'innovative' camera-work always goes down nicely, too. (how many subsequent films have copied John Carpenter's ingenious 'edge-of-frame' technique in ""Halloween"", for example?) Oh yeah, getting your film banned at least helps in the 'notoriety' stakes, too; so often as it is the clinching factor in persuading otherwise indifferent audience members to have a look and see what all the fuss was about.... all requirements eagerly met by the joyful enterprise known as ""The Evil Dead""! There's plenty of the traditional spooky music and dark foreboding spaces, but brought to the table for the first time in 1981 were audacious camera moves and a no-holds-barred approach to piling on the gore! I'm sure it felt fresh in its early days of release, and surprisingly, it still feels fresh today. This is 'Grand Guignol' horror that has no time to linger in admiration over its gruesome handiwork, due to its breakneck pace. I'm now prepared to forgive Raimi the first film of his that I saw, (""Darkman"") thanks to the fun I had watching this. Little details make me eagerly await the chance to catch the other two entries, also - the first minor cameo from the 'chainsaw', for example! It's a simple plot - basically just watching Bruce Campbell slay the ranks of the undead - and even the OTT nature of what's gone before is stretched by the 'Claymation'-like explosions of the finale; but such largely irrelevant quibbles are almost wholly redeemed by the unforgettable nature of the last shot. It's best to experience that for yourself; but bear in mind when you watch that you're seeing elements that have since become mainstays of every notable scarefest within the last 20 years.

129,punishmentpark,'Join us...',9,31 December 2013,"Again, a film of which I'm certain I've seen it before - probably a long time ago - but manages to blow me away as if it were the first time. Sam Raimi's much acclaimed feature debut is a gory, filmicly orgasmic shocker that is built around a simple, but effective given. There was only one little part of the gore that was too obviously fake, which was a zombie face (I think it was Cheryl's) that too clearly a mask. Effects-wise, of course, you'll have to accept this film as being a product of the eighties, but for me that is no problem; this is a rare one that even scared the bejesus out of me at times. Of course, horror icon Bruce Campbell shows why he deserves to have become just that, but also the rest of the cast is utterly convincing. And then, the direction: Sam Raimi proved to be nothing less than a grandmaster at a young age (though I'm not that curious about 'Oz the Great and Powerful' or the Spider-man trilogy), using fantastic angles, music, zooms and such for maximum horror pleasure. I can't leave you without mentioning, nay praising the 'tree' scene, wherein a beautiful young female is being... just go see it, and see for yourself if you disagree (I just read, shockingly, that there are indeed people who didn't like this...!); then, and only then, you could try the remake - I haven't made up my mind about it, yet...A big 9 out of 10 for this justified classic.

130,KUAlum26,A marvel what some college film students can do on a shoestring budget,9,31 October 2009,"SPOILER(S) POSSIBLEThe first ever full-on film project by budding filmmakers Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert(then called Bobby Tapert)would prove to be a work of endurance and love and also one of the more entertaining horror films made in the eighties.The plot is painfully simple: Five young adults from Michigan drive off into the woods for a camping vacation,using a seldom-used cabin as their haunt. They uncover a tape recorder and a crusty,dusty and blood-and-flesh-coated ""Book of the Dead"" or ""Necromonicon"",inadvertently incant the chant that awakes a limitless supply of malevolent spirits in the woods,and then one by one get picked off until a lone survivor is left to fight to escape. The story isn't much of an accomplishment:it's the whole physical undertaking that's the real accomplishment.On a small budget that was probably getting smaller as the shoot continued(I don't know the exact amount of time of filming,but it probably lasted at least a year),the filmmakers and stars(all of 'em,most famously budding star Bruce Campbell as the conflicted but can-do Ash)had to make the most of a limited set,claustrophobic settings,gallons of viscous fluids,endless supplies of cakey make-up,a limited amount of lighting(probably NOT an accident,there) and probably a mass-produced amount of fog to create something that has both the feel of a creepily eerie film about the undead and yet had the effects to back up the type of slasher horror pic that the producers were aiming for.The first of an intriguing trio of horror/comedy films that Raimi,Tapert,Campbell and company would crank out over a period of just under fifteen years(and,after seeing this film in full,I'm not sure if anyone involved originally intended to make any sequels),the atmosphere and noticeably cheap effects may turn-off your pickier horror film snobs,but anyone with a sense of adventure and high tolerance for gore will be reasonably pleased--if not greatly impressed--by this first effort film.

131,pyrocitor,"A clever blend of ironic cliché and straightforward, unsettling horror - well deserving its cult infamy",8,25 April 2009,"There remains a perpetually unmistakable veneer to the sect of films known as ""cult hits"" - classics to certain select groups of people without being necessarily enjoyed or even known by a mass audience. It would be difficult to find a more fitting example than maverick director Sam Raimi's feature-length debut, The Evil Dead, decades before the Spider-Man films. In fact, apart from a vaguely distinctive style and cheeky humour, the two bookends of Raimi's career to date could hardly be more different on the surface: Spider-Man a mainstream, big budget action blockbuster and The Evil Dead a shoestring budget, schlocky horror comedy, tailored only really to appeal to a select fan base sharing a gruesome sense of humour. But most prevailing between the two, at the risk of delving into sentiment, is the passion and heart Raimi instils into each, regardless of their exterior trappings or financial investment. Despite being an ultimately small and unassuming film, The Evil Dead goes about its business in a remarkably self-assured and efficient fashion, just as fundamentally constructed to entertain as a certain friendly neighbourhood superhero. Given the general association of such horror fare with a sense of ""so bad it's good"", it is easy to forget just how grimly effective Raimi's film is, or how much of a cornerstone for 'do-it- yourself' film-making and macabre special effects. Masking its microscopic budget with chilling use of a single forest location (decades before The Blair Witch Project), Raimi's film opts instead for horror atmosphere turned bludgeoning object, complete with a pounding dirge of an ominous musical score and frantic cinematography, zooming along the forest floor as if precipitating the tension to unbearable levels. Similarly, for all of its deliberately campy excesses, it becomes increasingly undeniable just how genuine a knack Raimi's film demonstrates for full-blown fright, with an overwhelmingly Gothic ambiance and eerily effective mastery of horror conventions, extracting surprising scares from even the most familiar of set-ups. Indeed, rather than trying to fight the inevitable onset of cliché, Raimi instead cheerily incorporates them into his film and simply uses them for his own purposes, a welcome synergy of time worn technique into an ultimately unique concoction. Similarly, Raimi shows an innate awareness of viewer expectations as well as genre conventions, and gleefully takes pleasure in inverting just about everything which doesn't contribute to the continuous sense of creeping horror turned symphonic chillfest. Many sequences which should be terrifying are instead turned morbidly funny, many seemingly innocent sequences are twisted into being frightening, the film's sole romantic part is rendered completely un-romantic, and the fleeting moments of typical horror gratuitous sexual objectification are completely de-eroticized. However, Raimi appears equally determined to work in just about anything possible geared towards making his viewers squirm, and the film delivers in spades on the gruesome violence and disturbing gross-out effects front - no matter how intentionally campy and relatively cheaply they are done, the sheer gut reaction generated by them is the mark of a true genre pro.The film also marks the breakthrough performance of soon to be B-movie superstar Bruce Campbell, and his enormously enjoyable work in The Evil Dead demonstrates exactly why his popularity would subsequently rise so vastly. Campbell manages to encapsulate the tone of the movie within his performance alone: on the surface serious and slightly nerdy, but with a thinly veiled quirky and goofy sense of humour on the underbelly, managing to not only amplify the shudders and screams of the rest of the film but bring a very welcome comic charisma to it as well. The rest of the cast appear to be giving almost wilfully bland performances, making their subsequent encounters with the demonic exactly the sort of abrasive difference needed to infuse the picture with a true shock value. As such, while most of the actors may spend most of the picture doing nothing but screaming and howling, they do it with considerable energy and aplomb, as well as a slyly ironic sense of humour making their presence all the more appealing. While likely too ironically cheesy, terrifying or wilfully gross to appeal to a mass demographic, The Evil Dead nonetheless merits its reputation as one of the defining early cinematic meldings of horror and comedy, as well as a foundational text for the school of schlocky, 'do-it-yourself' horror productions. Infamous in its cult success, the film marks a rare exception of living up to its hype, and should prove near essential viewing for any horror enthusiasts who have yet to experience it. -8/10",The Evil Dead

Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today, especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories.  They do someone elses work.  But not Evil Dead.  This was Raimi's baby from the outset.  When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns.  They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget.  Halloween was made for $150,000 and Evil Dead for $50 000.  So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so.  Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew.  And that was, how to create atmosphere using the camera.  And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that.  There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin.  Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing.  This shows the cabin as being menacing.  It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin.  And that we are in for a hell of a ride.Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more.  Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel.  We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things.  And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there.  What a brilliant concept.  A book that is evil.  I have often wondered about such books.  We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times.  But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language, and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say, well they won't be around much longer.The Evil Dead is a miracle.  It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be.  If you want to truly experience a frightening experience, rent this film, it knows what it wants to say.  And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid.  Be very afraid.  You may never look at the forest the same again.",The Evil Dead
137,gedikreverdi,The trees are alive Ashley,6,16 July 2021,"It's absurd in a good way, fast-paced, funny and gory. As for the first act i felt like the cinematography, editing and acting are a bit off. But then it got so good. The trees in the woods attacked Ash's sister and she managed to get back but possessed and they locked her up in the cellar where they found the book and the tape recordings. She's peeking through the door all the time and making jokes. The other guy dismembered the body of his girlfriend and buried her body. Then Linda who was sleeping woke up possessed and laughed at Ashley hysterically. The lover boy wanted to chop her down in the basement with the chainsaw but couldn't do it and buried her. At this scene she helped him carry her into the grave very openly as a dead person and that was hilarious. Then she dug herself up and attacked. He beheaded her with the shovel. When the book started burning by the fireplace, the guy and his sister started decomposing. He got to throw it into the fireplace and they started decomposing very fast and became nothing but a blob of mold and so on. He got out when the dawn broke but the thing attacked him from the forest too.",The Evil Dead
138,ElijahCSkuggs,"No budget, no problem.",9,13 June 2007,"The Evil Dead is one of those films that will stand the test of time on many levels; special effects(crude but vicious), shock value and controversy, acting, directing, and music. Each of these traits, along with very nice pacing and suspense keeps the original ED leagues above the filler that Hollywood regurgitates every year. Bruce Campbell, the every man's man, stars as Ashley Williams, a guy who decides to bring his girlfriend and some other pals to a remote cabin in the woods for some rest and relaxation. Through some bad luck, demons are evoked from an ancient slumber and begin to wreak havoc among the group; pitting friends against friends, and then eventually, everyone against Ash. The acting is great, especially by said Campbell, whose square jaw and rubber face ensure him as the horror genre's Jim Carrey. Sam Raimi's film is a compilation of stop-motion gore, claustrophobic terror, and innovative camera angles, and realistically, never has someone done so much for the genre with so little. Of course The Blair Witch Project was well done, but it hasn't had the success and constant imitations that Raimi's little film has. A fun time all around, especially for movie goers who aren't afraid of a little blood and hurt. It's a cult classic, but with such huge notoriety and fame, this film has evolved into mainstream status. And for good reason.",The Evil Dead
139,mattymatt4ever,Good low-budget entertainment,6,7 January 2003,"I've said this before and I'll say it again, I always feel more of a connection to films that are made on low budgets than the big studio flicks, because I'm an aspiring filmmaker myself.  Watching a movie like this inspires me, especially since I've always wanted to make a horror movie. Is it a great film?  Of course not.  Once the movie hits the 20-minute mark, the notion of plot completely disappears.  But I loved the special f/x, which immensely surprised me, knowing the budget was only $375,000.00.  I didn't expect the gore to be so elaborate.  That's right, there's tons of gore (some say that to today's standards, the gore would be considered tame, but I say it's still quite extreme), and it doesn't look cheesy at all. The blood looks real, the make-up effects are great.  I could tell Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert put their hearts and souls into this project.
I'm so glad I purchased the DVD, because it (along with ""Evil Dead 2's"") contains one of the most amusing and insightful commentaries I've ever heard.  Sam and Rob both have an incredible sense of humor.  And I was fascinated by the way they described the production of this movie.  First of all, I assumed it was shot in either 2 or 3 days.  This movie proves that continuity is for sissies, because it's packed with continuity errors and I didn't notice a thing.  The film was actually shot over the course of many months.  They seemed to have lots of fun making it, though it was a grueling process, since there were no stunt people (actors were getting scrapes and bruises all over the place), they'd stay awake for hours and hours and it was freezing cold outside.""The Evil Dead"" contains a few scares and the gore effects are often fun to watch (this was before the invention of CGI and I felt impressed knowing that not one effect was genered via computer), but I still wish it could've had more plot.  After all, we're basically watching one character after another get killed and come back alive again, and all that changes within the repetition of this pattern is the way they get killed.  The film needs a little more closure.  But at least Raimi doesn't pretend this is a work of high art.  In the commentary, he actually pokes fun at a lot of the film's peculariaties.  But he experienced much joy in making the film, and watching ""Evil Dead"" allows me to share some of his joy.  This is truly the work of an earnest, committed filmmaker who luckily went on to direct bigger movies like ""Spider-Man"" and ""A Simple Plan.""My score:  6 (out of 10)",The Evil Dead
140,Fernando-Rodrigues,A Hallucinating Night!,6,22 August 2021,"It aged very badly, but it is still possible to see it as historical material and analyze why it became a B Cinema classic. Everything here is chaotic and over-the-top, definitely one of those films so bad it gets good.",The Evil Dead
141,ODDBear,The king of low-budget horror,9,13 June 2009,"Ultra low-budget horror movies simply don't come any better than this. Wonder kid Sam Raimi concocted a really scary demon flick here and with the use of some incredible camera work, very inventive make-up effects and surprisingly good special effects he made one of the best horror films of the eighties.The woods scenario had been used a lot, even demons had made many appearances but this flick makes it look so fresh and insanely creepy you forget all that stuff and really sink head first into this nightmarish vision. Granted, the fog machine is used way too much and Hal Delrich as Scott is incredibly bad in his role, but still, all this works in the film's favor. Bruce Campbell is very subdued here compared to his Ash in Dead's two subsequent sequels but even this early he shows leading man potential and why he is one of horror's true cult legends.Some scenes here are creepy as hell and it's got a few very nasty shocks in store, even for seasoned horror viewers. Raimi hits all the right notes here; there's a creepy basement, fog bound woods, blood and guts in big doses and there's even a chainsaw here. As said, make-up effects are really spectacular and the gory show still impresses nearly 30 years later. Humor is also well placed and delivered; though this flick is indeed a horror film as opposed to the more comically driven sequels.I really don't know what to say more about ""The Evil Dead"" that hasn't been said (and written) many times before. If you're one of the lucky few who hasn't seen this horror masterpiece; stop reading now and go watch it.",The Evil Dead
142,phubbs,The Evil Dead,8,21 November 2013,"The biggest cult film ever? well maybe. Back in the good old days of the 80's this film was seen as the biggest splatter fest flick ever here in the UK, it was banned in some countries and labelled the number one video nasty, top of the hit list. There was just no way in heaven or hell you would get to see this as a kid back in the day, it was just as bad as porn...if not worse!, will someone please think of the children!!.Well those days are long gone now and the film is looked upon as jokey and tame! a horror comedy with an iconic central character and bucket loads of hammy gory visuals. What is interesting for me is the fact this first film wasn't suppose to be a horror comedy, its not a horror comedy at all. Its only since the sequels that the franchise kinda leaned that way, this film was an all out horror which was suppose to scare people, and back in the day it did just that.The main hook with this film is obviously the effects, its a horror film, ergo its effects are the main crux. The effects in this film are in places bad, they look cheesy, badly animated with dodgy editing. But the key thing to remember is this was because of budget restrains and limits on technology...but mainly lack of money. All the effects were made as best as they could make them, using every penny, every drop of fake blood, every piece of material gathered and utilising as much imagination as possible in both camera usage and illusion.This ultimately makes the effects terrific despite the fact they do look very dated and highly dubious now. The films visuals are a success because of the fact Raimi and co had to be creative to get them done, they had to think out of the box with little money. This is why some older films work so well as they couldn't just sit back and rely on CGI to do it all for them, they had to really work and show real craftsmanship to make it work. All the blood, bone and goo may look corny in places but its real, its really there and basically that will always look better than CGI.Of course back in the day the effects were seen as reasonable slick to a degree but still hokey, they weren't groundbreaking by any means. But the flair, creativity, ingenuity and sheer amount of gore was groundbreaking. Worst bit in the entire film for me? when a possessed 'Cheryl' stabs 'Linda' in the ankle with a pencil, oh my god that sound effect when the pencil punctures her foot!. I think it was the sound of an apple getting pierced?. Then the fact she twists and pulls on the pencil opening up the wound!! that always makes me wince.The plot is so damn basic it hurts, plus what we see half the time is so stupid you can't help but laugh. Why would anyone want to spend time in a tiny remote cabin like that firstly, secondly when things get creepy why does one girl wander off into the dark dark woods alone? errrr hello?? and then there's dumb ass 'Ash' falling for the old 'help me I'm OK' trick from his possessed friends. Did I mention continuity errors like Ash's hair?. Have to remind myself this film is very dated and was the first of its kind of sorts, this is the original horror in the woods.For me its not as strong ever since the comedy themed sequels but its still a powerhouse of originality no doubt. The gore isn't shocking these days but more of a really good example and lesson in how to go about creating your own special effects. See what can be achieved with a little thought. Its not even particularly scary these days either, that ship has sailed now for most adults methinks, but its not about that, its just the cornball horror ride you get out of it, the thrills and the fact its such a classic now.8/10",The Evil Dead
143,aciessi,Groovy.,7,17 January 2020,"Looking back, this was the humble beginnings of a horror icon and a beloved franchise. But back in the early 80's, this thing was pretty outrageous. I would have paid money to see people's initial reaction during the first run of The Evil Dead. The story, by itself, is your typical cabin-in-the-woods creeper with a supernatural twist. The curse of the necronomicon. Old H.P. Lovecraft never saw it coming. From there, the film turns into a cross between The Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead, with the gore cranked all the way off the dial. It's gross, man. But it's all done practically. Scratch that.. it's all done way on the cheap. That's what gives this it's charm. It's so bad it's good. Minus the tree scene, which is just not good at all, but we won't get into that.

144,CharltonBoy,Very Dated.,5,16 June 2003,I remember when i first saw The Evil Dead 20 years ago in a bar in Spain and i remember the excitement i felt when i watched the film.It was like nothing i had ever seen before and was talked about by all my fellow teenage mates. In a funny sort of way i wished i looked at films now as i did then but then i wasn't interested in how bad the acting was or how appalling the direction was and all i was concerned about was the blood and gore.Having watched the film again i can really see how dreadfull some aspects of the film are.Having said that this film is still creepy and atmospheric but has dated incredibly badly.  Bruce Campbell's performance as the leading man is so bad it borders on funny and must be one of the worst acting performances i have ever seen.

147,fernandoschiavi,"Although today the film looks much more comical than frightening, even after nearly 40 years it is undeniable that there is a macabre atmosphere emanating from Evil Dead",8,26 June 2021,"The horror story present in Evil Dead is quite common, without many flourishes or inventions. Sam Raimi's script is a secondary aspect, which gives vent to the visual inventiveness of its director, whose construction of tension, climate in the handling of the camera, would make a difference not only in relation to the horror genre but also to all contemporary cinema. Evil Dead is not Sam Raimi's first feature film, before it came 'It's Murder', also in collaboration with his star and friend Bruce Campbell, and where the filmmaker was able to experience some of the mannerisms employed in the 1981 classic.The story is simple: five young people get together to spend a weekend in an isolated cabin in an arboreal part of Tennessee. Arriving at the place, they find a mysterious abandoned book. Unaware that it is the Book of the Dead, a work bound in human skin and written in blood, the curious young people make the most of the book, material that has a tape recorder as a complement. By touching it, associated with handling the frightening book, they awaken the fury of demonic forces that inhabit the forest. What would be an idyllic and romantic walk turns into a terrible nightmare for everyone. Ash (Bruce Campbell) is the leader of the group, a character who will suffer ""the devils"" with the disturbance orchestrated by the demonic presence in the forest. There is a rape starring a tree, torn bodies, pus and blood served in a kind of visual cocktail for the spectator, as well as grotesque scenes perhaps never shown before in cinema.If there's anything interesting to highlight it's the structure of the film. If you immerse yourself in the work from a historical perspective, you can enjoy a good session. The camera that zigzags the forest, in a subjective perspective, is one of the best technical points of the film. The soundtrack is well executed, entering at the right times, thanks to the good editing work. By adhering to the explicit style, the film leaves out any suggestion to represent physical pain and supernatural presence in the most violently graphic way possible. Full of literary references, such as the Necronomicon, by H. P. Lovecraft, The Death of the Devil is a production made with meager resources and by students still groping language and the film industry.The feature film directed by Sam Raimi, even far from being perfect, takes one of the most popular proposals in cinema and shows how the style, when properly used, is capable of adding to a work, regardless of budget limitations. The atmosphere is built in such a way that you feel trapped with them in the cabin. Film editing is done to highlight this incarceration in each scene. From the opening scene, from the characters in the car, you feel this feeling of lack of space, to convey the idea early on to the audience that escape attempts would be useless. This claustrophobic tension building bet adds a sense of urgency to each counterattack attempt given by the characters in the confrontation scenes.Raimi used as much creativity as possible to make the film. Sound, lighting and shadows, visual elements like smoke, fire, mirrors and sinister objects like clocks, axes, shotguns, chainsaws, macabre recordings and occult books. Oh, and blood, a lot of blood! There are several standout sequences such as the disturbing scene in which Cheryl goes out alone in the woods at night and is violently raped by living trees, possessed by demons. Or when the same girl becomes the first victim of possession, screaming in a guttural voice to her friends: Why did you disturb our sleep? Waking us up from our lasting inactivity? You will die! Like the others before you! One by one we'll take them! This sequence is already classic and defines only the beginning of the bloody carnage that was to come.The parade of atrocities continues when Shelly is next possessed and in a moment of total insanity, she slowly rips her right hand off with her teeth in a grotesque scene. After a lot of blood, clotted ooze, exposed viscera, putrefying liquids, shattered flesh, broken bones, dismemberments and severed heads, the hellish night ends and early morning would reserve a dignified ending for the hero Ashley, allowing for various interpretations and certainly escaping the conventional happy ending cliché.The production took years to complete for lack of money, and while the actors were dedicated to other projects, Raimi himself, his brother Ted and several other team members acted as body doubles, in scenes where only the hands and feet appeared. Of actors, for example. Cleverly, Raimi used the classic strategy that many other cheap movies would also use, trying to tell the whole story in one place. By the way, the cabin in Tennessee where the movie was shot had no basement. They dug a hole in the ground, simulating a descent, until they were able to film the basement scenes in another house some months later. Anyone who watches the movie without knowing it doesn't notice. The Devil's Death is one of the best examples for filmmakers with little experience and money, but a lot of creativity. A real lesson in tricks that can be used to make the movie work. The magic of cinema.The other limitation the director knows how to use to his advantage is lighting. Rather than trying to create bright environments, the choice here is to use the light from the cabin's own lamps to illuminate the interior scenes. This results in a shaded environment, which highlights the corners of the room, imprisoning the protagonist a little more. In outdoor environments, most of the lights are from the cabin's floodlights and the headlights of the Delta 88, Ash Williams' car, which barely illuminate the environment, using darkness as a form of imprisonment in external scenes.Another point hit by the direction is never to show the true face of the monster that chases the characters, using Lovecraft's indescribable horror concept to create the great Evil. The monster is loose around the cabin and we, the public, only see through the eyes from him. The way the camera is moved to simulate the idea of a creature supernaturally hunting its prey around the environment, and the way these scenes are assembled, make a point of highlighting the demonic nature of the creature. The bizarre sound that accompanies the camera was a mixture of wind noise, the ambient sound of the cabin and Raimi's own voice, simulating the grunts of an evil creature. Despite being extremely simple, its effectiveness was such that other horror movies started to use the same effect later. The Death of the Demon had an impact on the audiences of the time, who suffered along with the poor characters who were haunted by the imminent death. The forest that surrounds them is alive and there is no escape. Lost in this maze, your only chance is to survive until dawn.Of course, the great intangible Evil isn't the only supernatural manifestation in the film. For the fight scenes, the film relies on the good old cliché of demonic possessions to create opponents to be faced by the protagonists. As the monster's way of interacting with the characters, the Deadites - the name given to humans possessed by Evil - end up being an interesting representation of the antagonist's demonic nature. Instead of just trying to kill the protagonists, they have fun playing with the main character's feelings and hopes, in a sadism that makes even the characters wonder why so much evil.It is difficult to evaluate a classic work without considering its cultural impact. The Evil Dead not only put the character Ash - played by the charismatic Bruce Campbell (Escape from Los Angeles) - on a prominent shelf, it also consolidated the ""hut horror"" genre, being stone fundamental in the career of director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man). The success of the 1981 feature film would influence an entire generation, opening the door to a franchise of movies, games and a TV series.The first The Evil Dead is more important in its context than a great movie in isolation. Proof of this is realizing how much Ash has evolved in subsequent productions. Here we see a protagonist plastered, out of tune and forcing grimaces in countless moments. The feeling is that many of the acting choices and, properly speaking, the script was being tried out on screen. And this is clear to whoever watches, also by the reaction of the actors on stage. As it approaches its ending, there is the impression that the film had found its way: the balance between the gore and the satirical. This combination would be consolidated in the success of its sequel, Evil Dead II (1987).The work may have been conducted by a director and actors who were still very young students and at the beginning of their careers; to have a clichéd script with a simple and obvious story (but elements like abandoned cabins in ghostly and demon-populated forests are always some of the best ingredients for a scary movie); and having crude special effects (a fact perfectly understandable by the very low budget of the production), the film is one of the most revered in the history of horror cinema. Although today the film looks much more comical than frightening, becoming one of the icons of the trashy horror cinema, even after nearly 40 years it is undeniable that there is a genuine macabre atmosphere emanating from Evil Dead. Proof of this is his brave resistance to the test of time and the cult status he achieved. A must-have classic for any fan of the genre.",The Evil Dead

The guy who taught the class was a genius, and THE EVIL DEAD was the climax of the semester (this would have been spring 1990). At the time the film was still notorious thanks to home video as ""The Most Horrifying Movie Ever Made"" (nah: CONQUEROR WORM) or ""The Most Gruesome Movie Ever Made"" (nah: Carpenter's THE THING), but the role that the film served within the framework of that class was as an all-out assault of *EVERYTHING* that came before it in one unstoppable, hypnotic barrage.We saw this film at like 7pm and people were FREAKING OUT, literally, in a college auditorium. Twenty-year old adults were reacting hysterically, both with enthusiasm (such as myself) for finally finding a horror film that got everything more or less right, or with hypnotic revulsion (probably 40% of the class, and not all female either) by people who were finally being confronted with a horror film that had the power to frighten them, and was unapologetic about doing so. People make a fuss about the foliage rape scene: fehh! The one that got us so frightened that some people actually got up & left was when the first girl starts naming cards, becomes possessed and starts talking like that garbled voice at the end of ""I Am The Walrus"" that says it buried Paul backwards or whatever. We were all screaming, and we were screaming together -- the film became a shared experience, and former classmates discussed it clear through graduation three semesters later. Being there for the screening had been a rite of passage & we wore the badge with honor. Watching it at home on a DVD is nice, but the way to experience this film is in a theater with a live audience. You'll scream too.I will let others sum up the plot. The film literally is a collective assault on the nerves using material culled from the entire history of horror before it: All the conventions are touched on, no T is left dotted and no eye uncrossed. We went out and rented EVIL DEAD 2 the next day and to me it was a let-down: I prefer the claustrophobic, cold, distant hopelessness of this film, the hands-on, rough hewn look of the special effects and the gambles that Sam Raimi took. I like how the film sets itself up, explains itself, removes any doubt from the mind of the viewer that the kids are doomed, and then unleashes a fury of Hell who's shock value has yet to really be equaled. Sam Raimi may be making Superboy cartoons now, but he will always be remembered for THE EVIL DEAD. This is one film where every good and bad thing you may have heard about it is probably accurate. The gore, the awful acting (my favorite is the jerk boyfriend who is easily the jerk boyfriend to end all jerk boyfriends), the overactive cinematography, the prevasive violence against (zombie) women, the gripping artiness, the complete trashing of everything that is sacred, how lurid and obliquely sleazy the film is, and yet how compulsively watchable. Like a train wreck.10/10; By the way, the *CORRECT* way to see this film is the way we did, in the 1:33 (or 4:3) open matte full frame ratio -- Anchor Bay's masked 1:85 LBX transfer is for newbies.

Debut director Sam Raimi throws everything into the mix, perhaps to atone for a flimsy plot and stock characters (well-played by an excellent cast, including cult-performer-in-the-making Bruce Campbell), and while much of it is tongue-in-cheek, some scenes leapfrog the taste barrier with unconscionable glee (Raimi has since admitted the 'tree rape' sequence was a mistake, for example). Sadly, the movie is rendered monotonous by its excessive pace and comic insouciance (the sequels - beginning with EVIL DEAD II - went even further in this direction), and the movie quickly succumbs to the laws of diminishing returns; once you've seen one drooling demon getting its head cut off, you've seen 'em all! Fantastic low budget production values, however, and the makeup effects are dandy.NB.

It progresses along gradually enough, ie the suspense builds realistically and naturally, instead of giving us zombies within the first five minutes, that we believe the zombies when they eventually come - it actually works as a straight horror movie, unlike its sequals.I don't know where Raimi found Bruce Campbell, but he's the real highlight of this movie. He's incredible - he's got this superhero's head. It was a great idea to have a certain guy's face being the figurehead of the series. Especially when he's got a face like this! Those crazy eyes, that jut jaw. Raimi is right - he does look great in a head shot.The first half hour is really exciting, because you can tell everyone is just learning how to make a film. It was shot over a period of seven years, i hear, so the general quality improves throughout, but there are no noticeable jumps in quality - the texture is not incredible uneven. It all hangs together okay.Its a fairly full-on zombie experience, once we get into the thick of it. Its fairly harrowing and foul, so be prepared - weak of stomach should stay away.Certain parts were better than others: I thought the zombie trapped under the trapdoor banging up against it was fantastic, all of Bruce Campbell was fantastic, especially his later scenes. But i didn't like the part near the beginning where a girl wanders into the woods and vines start chasing her and climbing up her crotch.Raimi's lightning-fast steadicam which predates Barry Sonnenfeld's famous ""crazy-cam"" from Raising Arizona by a good decade is pretty freaky, but gets a little gimmicky.7/10. Bruce Campbell's head in this movie is a thing to be seen.",The Evil Dead
154,AhmedSpielberg99,Decent.,6,20 June 2020,"I finally get why people consider Evil Dead II as one of the best and superior film sequels. For as much as I found this one truly innovative in terms of its stylish direction, some ideas, amazing camerawork and fantastic stop-motion animation, claymation and practical effects in general, it's in grave need of more self-awareness to compensate for its great lacking in substance and justify its unbelievably dumb characters. It's still good fun, though.(6/10)",The Evil Dead
155,DarthVoorhees,Possibly my favorite horror film,10,5 June 2005,"Evil Dead is a fun movie to watch.If you've read about how the film was made you appreciate it much much more(Check out Bruce Campbell's autobiography If Chins Could Kill) For it's low budget,Evil Dead is a very effective horror film.It has excellent make-up effects(People with weak stomaches will not enjoy Evil Dead) Yes the gore is very very extreme,but their is fear to go along with it. Raimi builds up a lot of suspense.The film has a dark and evil feel to it,its murky cabins,to the possessed forest.Even though Evil Dead doesn't have the best acting,its not as horrible as people make it out to be,remember the cast was made up of college kids who had little to no experience before.The movie isn't just some college kid monster movie,it's much better because it's darker and more gruesome.Some would say it's just corn syrup gushing around,but Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell and company made Evil Dead very unique to put it high up within the horror genre.Some of the gore in Evil Dead has yet to be outdone(Scotty's death) It's without a doubt the most gory horror movie next to Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.",The Evil Dead
156,tomimt,Good small budget horror film,8,20 February 2006,"""The Evil Dead"" is very atmospheric, small budget horror film. The tension is build by the unseen horror, that haunts the teens enjoying their time out in a small cabin away from everything.The obvious lack of huge budget has driven Sam Raimi in a very good decision not to show the thing, that turns people into a flesh hungry monsters. Weird camera angles and eerie music give the film a throbbing personality, with very eerie atmosphere.As said, the plot goes like this: A group of friends go into a cabin middle of nowhere. Then they discover a human flesh bound book, the Necronomicon, and they of course awaken the evil in the forest. Silly for them. The evil then starts to hunt the friends one after another, turning them into a flesh craving monsters. The death is always near.There are some rather campy jokes in the beginning of the film, but it does turn into a rather serious horror film in one point. It's the build up of the atmosphere that does it. There is also the fact of not showing the main baddie, which gives the viewer a good change to let his/hers mind to make out its appearance.Bruce Campbell is the one actor, who rose from the film as a lovable b-film star he is today, as for other careers the Raimi bunch came along this film.All in all a very good horror film for the fans of the genre.",The Evil Dead
157,acidburn-10,The ultimate experience in grueling horror,10,26 May 2007,"A Horror classic, if you don't have this horror movie in your collection then just get it because your horror collection just wouldn't be complete without this cult classic.There are just so many shocking scenes in this movie which never holds back like A woman getting raped by trees which was very unsettling and scary, people getting hacked to pieces and heads getting chopped off, when the some of the characters turns into zombies is just terrifying and all done with brilliant directing. This film is all style and that adds to the creepy factor. This movie wouldn't be as scary if Raimi wasn't behind the camera.One of the most terrifying scenes is when all the main characters are at the cabin and one of the girls is standing by the window and the other 2 girls are playing cards trying to guess each others cards and the girl standing by the window guesses all the cards and turns around and she's a zombie and starts attacking everyone.The acting is really good they actually got a cast worth caring about like Bruce Campbell (Ash) very convincing and sympathetic and shows that he's a true icon Ellen Sandwess (Sheryll) is plain looking but she works, especially when she's possessed Hal Delrich (Scotty), Betsy Baker/Linda and Sarah York (Shelly) all do well. They come across as normal people and played by real people instead of fashion models that we get in today's horror movies.All in all Evil Dead is just one of a kind with a simple story but filled with gore and still holds up to the standards of today.",The Evil Dead
158,Darkside-Reviewer,One of the scariest demonic possession movies ever made,8,12 May 2019,I first saw The Evil Dead at age 13 and thought it's just a scary movie how bad can it be I was very wrong This is the only movie I can't watch it with the sound way up and in the dark even to this day.The Idea behind the movie is 5 friends go for a weekend trip to a cabin out in the woods and well this sounds like the basis for most modern day horror movies The Evil Dead was one of the first to do this when night falls they accidentally awaken demons from there ancient slumber that take new life by possessing the souls of the living and killing anything made of flesh and bone one by one they are taken as the demons use the bodies of there victims to torture those left alive as they try to survive till dawn in the isolated cabin the forest that surrounds them alive and waiting for them to run so they can tear away the flesh from there bones.A lot of movies have done demons and possession before and after this movie but in my opinion this is the only movie that really makes it terrifying as the demons take full control of the living transforming there bodies to withering skin and decaying flesh with the eyes becoming pure evil and pulsating with blood no human soul remains inside the body is a pure meat vessel for the demons to have there fun even going so far as to bite off limbs with no care for there new flesh and skin.The sounds in this movie are very atmospheric and set the tone for the movie perfectly I have seen many horror movies try to create Demonic voices and make them scary but the actors and actress's make the screams and voices of the demons truly frighting and so loud you wouldn't think of having the volume up as the screams will scare you and make you cover your ears in fear.The movie was made on a very small budget by then unknown director Sam Raimi the crew mostly made up of friends and other eager filmmakers actors and stage crew who dedicated there time and effort to make this movie that took them so long to shoot running out of money more than once in the process.The actors and actress's do a very good job in this movie with memorable performances as humans and the demons Bruce Campbell takes the lead and it's easy to see why he became so well known over the years his acting is top notch.If you are a fan of horror movies filled with blood gore demons decapitations and alike I urge you to watch The Evil Dead it may be an old movie now but the screams and imagery will keep you awake at night.,The Evil Dead

160,gigan-92,"If You Haven't Seen It, Then you Haven't Really Experienced Horror",9,22 November 2010,"I find the overwhelming majority of modern horror just plain deplorable, cliché, and dull compared to this film. For such a small budget, it set a bar so high hundreds of films have failed to even come close to its greatness. Right off the bat I'll say that yes, the acting could have been more solid at times, but it doesn't distract at all. Bruce Campbell already stands out a bit from the others in my eyes, although he does vastly improve the quality of his performance in the sequel. The cast here is secondary, the atmosphere set up by the very creative and clever photography being its strongest point. Tom Philo came up with interesting visuals, under the guide of Sam Raimi. Our director creates a true sense of terror and helplessness just from the way it's shot, for example one of the opening sequences as the characters arrive at our cabin. It's just so ominous.This is greatly helped by one of the few good horror composers, Joseph LoDuca. The music was chilling and got to your nerves every time you hear it. The effects are good old 80s material, which I prefer when it comes to the horror genre. CGI can ruin an otherwise good horror film; alas ""I am Legend"". The makeup was gruesome and the photography effects just plain scared the hell out of me! The movie hits you hard with excellent carnage and some very disturbing shots, like that infamous tree scene. It's disturbing yet funny, to really sum it up properly. Raimi pokes fun at the genre while serving up stunning cinematography making just a fun movie to watch over and over. By now I doubt many haven't seen it, but if you haven't then you have not truly experienced horror.",The Evil Dead
161,sashank_kini-1,"Spooky, Funny and Unsettling - Evil Dead Remains Vastly Superior to its 'Sell-out' Sequel",8,1 November 2012,"Jump sequences have been quite successful in evoking fright; add to that a claustrophobic cabin and remove any sort of background music and what you get is tense gripping horror. This element was entirely missing in the sequel of Evil Dead, which I had the displeasure of watching about a year ago. Evil Dead however retains segments of horror while also providing enough laughs, and thus remains more exciting, more interesting and more original than its sequel. The plot of Evil Dead is not very new: Ash, his sister Cheryl, his girlfriend Linda, his best pal Scott and Scott's girlfriend Shelly decide to stay the night at a lonely deserted cabin in the woods. In the first scene itself, as they are traveling in a cramped car to their destination, they encounter this mysterious force (although they do not understand what actually happens) as their car steering wheel loses control momentarily. As they cross the rickety bridge to the cabin, a plank of wood gives away under the car's weight but they somehow cross the bridge and drive to the cabin. Over there, the mysterious thing's presence is felt again as a swing outside the main door keeps striking the house until Scott opens the door. At night, Cheryl is the first unfortunate to be directly targeted by the force as it takes control of her hand while she is drawing. Later, at dinner, the moment Scott says 'party down!' the basement door opens on its own. In a funny Scooby Doo like sequence, the camera pans at each one's faces as they speak their thoughts about the incident. Scott first enters the basement with Ash following and the pair come out with a book on the dead and a tape recorder. The tape, recorded in the past by a doctor, is played and the evil spirits are beckoned. After Cheryl is raped by the forest, she demands Ash to take her out of town but the pair realizes the group's fate is doomed when they see the bridge destroyed. One by one, Cheryl and the others are possessed and it is up to Ash to do something before it is too late. The low level canting shots in Evil Dead, which were shot without using dollies (the crew couldn't afford it) made me uneasy and I was reminded of similar shots in Blair Witch Project; its marvelous how these raw effects could evoke fear while many of the sophisticated effects in recent movies cannot. Another interesting element is Raimi's focus on the eyes: when the pendulum stops suddenly, a close up shot of Cheryl's frightened eyes are seen. A much better example is when Ash keeps a box on his lap and feigns to sleep while Linda tries to look at the contents. The camera focuses on their eyes as they play this little game of theirs. Later, when Ash is about to bury a possessed Linda, she pretends to sleep and the camera again focuses on their eyes, thus depicting the irony and difference in the situation. The gore in the film is plenteous, but it isn't very disturbing as most of the blood comes from the zombies. However, there is the tree rape scene that is much more uncomfortable since Cheryl isn't in a possessed state. This reminds me of another scene in the movie: just when Ash contemplates striking a possessed Linda, she turns normal for a few minutes and begs Ash to protect her from 'them'. This was when I realized how my perception regarding the gory content changed when the characters transformed; it would have been much more disturbing to see a normal Linda being hacked to death. Bruce Campbell, the supporting cast and the 'fake shemps' deliver great performances for a horror movie. Some of the dialogs are very funny and very cheesy, with Linda getting some of the worst and most vapid lines in the film. The thing I did not understand about Evil Dead is how the entire 'monster mechanism' worked – while it seemed at times that the evil force could not enter the 'cabin' (Ash closes the doors and locks the force outside), Linda gets possessed all of a sudden even though Cheryl only stabs her with an object and doesn't bite her. I saw Evil Dead twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both the times. While its sequel sells out for popcorn fun, Evil Dead remains spooky, funny, unsettling and the superior one.",The Evil Dead
162,Bogmeister,"Here we go, to that cabin in the woods",8,25 September 2005,"From such humble aspirations and low-rent resources, near-greatness is achieved. ""The Evil Dead"" takes its place alongside another seminal horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead""(68) as one of the most influential groundbreaking spikes of terror ever committed to film. With nearly no money, using 16mm film, Raimi and his crew devised a non-stop relentless barrage of horrific images and building dread. The film actually shows some influence by the afore-mentioned earlier film. It takes place in a very isolated location, a choice spot selected by the filmmakers. The setting manages to be very creepy from the outset, before anything even happens. I never really thought of the woods as creepy until I saw this pic. Well, maybe I did, but this is the picture that confirmed my fears.There is a limited amount of characters, reflecting the tiny budget, including a very young Bruce Campbell, who's still very active as a 'B' movie actor. If you've never seen this film, your first thought is that the group of 5 young people, stuck in a cabin in the woods, will be attacked by exterior forces from outside. In one sense, some of this is the case, but the story amps up the horror when the threat manifests itself from within. The story just gets more and more ugly and disgusting, to the point where most viewers will be shaking their heads in disbelief near the end point. But it's not disbelief in the story - you have that sensibility going in - it's a difficulty in grasping the extent to which the filmmakers went to. What were they thinking? you might think to yourself; what a bunch of crazed lunatics. Some of the FX at the end, resembling limited stop-motion animation, may not look too impressive but, by that point, most viewers are already impressed.",The Evil Dead

It has became a beloved cult classic and stands as one of the most influential horror films of all time!Five young adults go off to a mountain cabin, where they unknowingly unleash evil, possessive spirits that reek havoc upon everything!The Evil Dead is perhaps the last of the great drive-in horror classics. Director Sam Raimi, who has since gone on to films with much bigger budgets, made his debut with this wildly terrifying genre masterpiece. Raimi's crafty direction builds a thick atmosphere of dread and isolation through out the film, using the woodsy setting as a great back drop. He uses some nicely inventive camera shots. The movie does indeed play out like shocking roller-coaster ride, as the scenes of in-your-face horror and gore hit hard and fast, only to be followed by eerie lulls of tension. It's the most effectively gripping style that any horror film could use! Raimi also makes the most out of using dark humor in the film, making even the most scary sequences strangely funny. The makeup FX are truly gruesome, even with a low-budget there are plenty of freakishly-good FX to drive the thrills.Raimi also creates some nicely bizarre and memorable sequences, like the vine-rape scene with Cheryl, the demented singing of a possessed Linda, the 'bleeding' cellar pipes, and that grand finale with Ash having to make a stand to survive! Not to mention the knock-out final shot of the film, which is probably the greatest closing image to any horror picture ever! Also worthy of mention is the great music score by Joe LoDuca. LoDuca's music is a perfect match to the film, building plenty of tension and playing off the shocks very well.The cast is as good as one would expect from a B picture, but they do hold their own. Of course the real star of the show is square-jawed B movie hero Bruce Campbell. Bruce does an outstanding role, playing terror to a T, and enduring the physical hardships of a grueling low-budget film. He deserves his B movie king status!The Evil Dead has gone on to become one of the biggest cult films of all time and it's not hard to see why either! It's an outstandingly awesome horror ride that should be taken by all horror film fans!

This isn't as funny or as cool as the 1987 remake/sequel but it has one truly defining moment that isn't in the second one. The tree rape scene. It's amusing, sick, offensive, and just downright nutty. Bruce campbell starts off as a much picked-upon Ash who when ever hit always seems to go flying into furniture.

These are the kinds of people who put movies like this on to unwind after a long, hard day; taking in surreal immages of gore and terror to unwind after a tough day on the job. And, for them, this would be the perfect film.The biggest problem with The Evil Dead is the pacing a style with which Raimi chose to execute his story. All throughout the film there are multiple fast panning shots with the camera that are clearly attempting to set up an eerie atmosphere but ultimately do little more than extend the runtime of a film that already drags a fair amount.The acting, for the most part, was wooden. There wasn't enough time given to the actual human beings going into the situation and, as a viewer, I was stuck watching these things happen to a group of people that I barely even had time to learn the names of. Killing people does not a good slasher (or horror) movie make, and my apologies to the community who worships this film for my saying so.The special effects and gore were quite impressive, especially for their time.

177,DavidSim240183,Night of the Evil Dead,10,15 September 2011,"Its always interesting watching future greats in their feature debuts. When talents at the start of their careers are forced to work with minimal resources some of them turn out superb work as a result. Like Steven Spielberg with Duel. John Carpenter's Dark Star. James Cameron and The Terminator. And Sam Raimi with The Evil Dead.The Evil Dead was a film Raimi set out to make on a virtual shoestring. The cast are unknowns. Its confined to a single setting. And its scraped together by a next to nothing budget. But films like these, free of the ministrations of heartless Hollywood often turn out better than they're bigger budgeted cousins.The Evil Dead has nothing that one could really call a plot. But it works because of what Sam Raimi brings to the film. What it lacks in plotting it makes up for in entertainment. Its not a terribly original film, and Night of the Living Dead was almost certainly an influence on it, but The Evil Dead holds its own as a ferocious, bloodthirsty horror movie.Five teens holed up in a cabin are besieged by spirits from beyond the grave. After reading from a Book of the Dead that was in the cabin, the five of them wind up possessed, one by one becoming demonic zombies. The only one not affected is Ash (Bruce Campbell's feature debut), and as his friends and loved ones turn before his very eyes, it becomes a non-stop fight to survive the night.The Evil Dead is a textbook example of how monolithic budgets are not the beginning and the end of Hollywood cinema. All this film needed was a passionate director, a dedicated cast and a loyal production crew. Add to that plenty of blood, guts and pus galore. From what I've read, The Evil Dead was a difficult shoot on everyone. The hours were long and the weather was terrible, but Sam Raimi roused the crew into shape.Its the sheer confidence he brings that transforms the story. Raimi directs with a fierce energy that enervates the entire movie. The camera seldom stays in one position. It prowls around the cabin, darting into closeup. The restless setups Raimi keeps springing on us make for an intense, almost unbearable experience.Raimi is content to let the camera do much of the work in the first half. Its in the second half that The Evil Dead opens up and takes on the intensity of a nightmare roller-coaster ride. Some of the scares Raimi dreamt up are totally out there. The one memory people take away from the film more than any other, and what had the film classified as a Video Nasty here in the UK, is the scene where Ellen Sandweiss wanders into the woods and is raped by a tree. Its a wrenching, squeamish thing to watch that not even the climax manages to top. Even Raimi regretted putting it in the film.But Raimi doesn't stop there. In the latter half, he goes all out to shock at every opportunity. Considering the film was made on a $350,000 budget, the results are astonishing. The cast vanish into makeup jobs, eerie voices, and blood spurts, spits and showers us in a non-stop orgy of mayhem.The Evil Dead deservedly brought Sam Raimi to attention. But the only member of the cast who went on to any kind of success, and became a mainstay of Sam Raimi's is Bruce Campbell. A childhood friend of his, Campbell mapped out a career as a B-Movie actor. He came to specialise in playing parodies of the lantern-jawed, All-American hero. And later starred in one of this author's favourite TV shows, The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.But here, Campbell is a little flat. Campbell hadn't mastered the ability to remain deadpan in the face of absurdity. He would come to hone that on the Evil Dead sequels, and by the time of Brisco County Jr, he had it down to a fine art. Nevertheless, Campbell was a real trooper. One thing you can count on when a director is a good friend of the lead actor is that they inspire them to do things no inflated paycheck could ever do. Campbell went far, above and beyond the call of duty for The Evil Dead. Constant splatterings. Drenched in blood. A merciless work schedule. But it all paid off in the finished product.The one other person on the crew who was propelled to success (arguably more than Raimi) was Joel Coen. Before becoming a directing team with his brother Ethan, and carving out an original, consistently brilliant career, Joel Coen served as editor on The Evil Dead.Although principally a Raimi film, there are times when you can see some of the trademarks of a Coen film. There's none of the idiosyncratic pleasures of Barton Fink and Fargo, but the way the camera observes at a neutral distance the mayhem unfolding before it is classic Coen.Raimi plays The Evil Dead to a shrieking excess and that's really as it should be. The wild overacting from the amateur cast will no doubt provoke fits of the giggles from some and the gore will invoke revulsion from others. But Raimi maintains a perfect lunatic energy that never flags for an instant. The stuff cult classics are made of.",The Evil Dead
178,domino1003,Watch Out For That Tree!,10,13 June 2005,"Sam Raimi took off and running with his first feature film, ""The Evil Dead."" Shot on the cheap, Raimi still managed to scare his audience, and the film is a cult classic. 5 young people are on a little trip to an isolated cabin. While checking the cabin out, they find a tape recorder and a book. Not leaving well enough alone (This is a horror film, after all), they play the tape, which explains that the book is a ""book of the dead,"" which contains incantations that allow demons to possess the living. The spell which is translated on the tape releases the evil that's in the forest. Trapped in the cabin, each of them soon becomes possessed by the ""evil dead,"" which torments and brutalizes the remaining survivors, until only Ash (Bruce Campbell)remains. Ash has to try to survive the night and avoid his friends, who want him dead.The film is pretty graphic: people getting chopped up because that's the only way they can be stopped, one poor individual gets stabbed in the foot with a pencil, and there's lots and lots of graphic gore. But the most incredibly graphic scene is when one poor girl gets raped by the forest (you have to see it to believe it).Even after over 20 years, this film is still unsettling (And I have a VERY hard time watching this at night). If you're like me, then you might want to watch it in the light. Otherwise, go ahead and take a chance. But remember, I warned ya!",The Evil Dead
179,Rautus,A great gory movie,10,24 February 2007,"The Evil Dead is a great horror film made by Spider-Man director Sam Raimi with a very small budget by he made a film with some really great gore that would start the whole Video Nasty films like Zombie Flesh Eaters (Zombi 2) and The Driller Killer.The tree rape scene was kind of interesting, not many films show a woman being raped by tree branches. The acting is good for a low budget horror film, Bruce is a really good actor.The Deadite makeup is good and creepy and the gore is great to watch, when Scott cuts up the Deadite Shelly that was gory or when she bites her hand off.A classic horror film that is full on gore. 10/10",The Evil Dead

Now, however it is cheesier and sillier, even with the inclusion of the tree attack scene. The acting is awful, it's hard to believe the directors are being honest when they say that it was meant to be more horror than fun. It still manages to deliver scare, shock and horror well, and the gore factor is high, despite the low budget. There are some really interesting scenes that have been imaginatively thought out, and some bizarrely funny bits too. Well worth a look.",The Evil Dead
181,joelwatchesmovies,"Delicious low-budget, campy horror",7,28 October 2018,Fittingly rough around the edges; the bumpy tracking shots and ramshackle editing is the perfect wrapping paper for the campy acting and over-the-top gore and jump scares that emerge from the classic dumb-young-adults-on-a-pleasure-trip premise (the only thing that didn't fit was the unpleasantly dark tree rape scene). The wild third act and its ridiculous gore (bountiful buckets of blood and other unidentified fluids spilling and spewing and oozing out of everywhere) is truly amazing to behold.,The Evil Dead

I watched this movie without knowing what it was about or anything, and let me tell you, I was surprised. First I must give a little warning: This is a movie you should watch more than once. Why do I say that? Well I watched it the first time and thought ""ehhh...it was OK but confusing"" And if I had rated it right after seeing it only once, I would have given it a 5 or even a 4, but the 2nd time is even better. You learn the events in the movie better seeing them a second time, sure you cant get back that shock value of seeing it once, but thats no big deal, this movie gives plenty of them, You'll probably not even remember them when watching a second time and get surprised all over again, I know I did. Sure the effects and all that aren't great, but its a B-type movie made in 1981, its not gonna have great FX. Recommended for horror fans, 8/10",The Evil Dead

The Evil Dead is made cheap, free and easy at the same time introducing some interesting camera tricks to create great suspense. The camera zig zagging throughout the woods at just above ground level chasing its actors still holds up as a great technique. However, there is a bit of absurdity to the nature of this possession when trees rape and lamps talk, all the while taking itself really seriously. There is also an overuse of gore with bodily fluids and blood that didn't match well with the bright colored demon makeup. Many scenes dragged on for too long and some of the actresses really overacted the crazy all-out horror scenes. If it wasn't for the innovative camera work, creepy location and Bruce Campbell, I'm not sure we're talking about this cult classic that still gains popularity to this day.",The Evil Dead
184,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,22 November 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!one of the original video nasties and a classic piece of gory movie-making. This offers some genuine scares and shocks rather than full on slapstick gore that the sequels provide as we watch Ash and his friends fight off Armies of darkness after getting stranded in a cabin in the woods. After reading from the Book of the Dead, evil breaks loose, taking the souls of everyone, leaving Ash as the sole survivor. Grainy, cheap, with amateur actors, The Evil Dead succeeds where many big budget films do not, offering real scares and entertainment. Raimi may not have a 'message' to 'give' in the film, but that is irrelevant. What the audience wants is gore, and we get it. Campbell's acting skills are a welcome bonus. Very funny, and one film every horror fan should see and hopefully love. 8 out of 10",The Evil Dead
185,charchuk,Equal parts good and bad,8,6 June 2007,"I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, it's truly scary, very disturbing + unsettling, quite well-directed, and incredibly influential. But I just can't overlook the terrible acting (outside of Bruce Campbell), cheezy dialogue, stupid characters, and slavish adherence to silly genre conventions. I mean, could the girl do something other than run into the haunted woods? It did scare me quite a bit, though, the first horror film to do so since The Descent. The scene where Ash's girlfriend is laughing maniacally - brrr. Gives me shivers just thinking about it. I think if it had taken a little more time getting set up (it feels really rushed at the beginning), had some decent actors, and a better script, I would have really liked it, as the direction and visuals are top-notch for such a low-budget film. So it's just okay for me.",The Evil Dead

Sam Raimi worked with a very low budget and was helped by the Coen-brothers with whom he was living on a flat, the theory says that they even used motorbikes to film some shoots. Anyway, the guts are there and it is great to see a movie just like it's been made by some students but the horroreffect I read about here on these pages isn't here at all (just watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to see the difference) and it's not very funny (sometimes you can't help of thinking to see some creepy Muppetcreatures rather than scary zombies, especially when the zombies are completely destroyed...blood never looked as much as ketchup as here). Dreadful movie? No you can watch it, but as said just too dated to thrill us still...",The Evil Dead
188,bh_tafe3,Great horror film,8,24 February 2015,"It has corny effects...that are awesome! It has hammy performances... that are great! And some of the most atmospheric direction and creative use of limited resources you'll see in any film. On a budget of somewhere between 350 and $400,000, Raimi was able to churn out a film that received praise from Stephen King for being ""terrifying"" and went on to gross $2.4 million on its original release. So let's dust off our old VHS, get our box tellies out of the garden shed, dim the lights and take in this horror classic: Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.Our story begins with our hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) going with his girlfriend Linda, her sister Cheryl, and another couple Scott and Shelley to stay at a cabin in the woods. These early scenes are a little painful, with Ash failing to gain much interest..or anything.Some typical foreboding things happen on their way to the cabin (a near hit car incident and a semi-collapsing bridge) but they make it the cabin safely. Upon getting there Cheryl's hand is possessed by Satan (or something similar) and she draws a weird picture. Inexplicably finding this normal, she mentions it to no one. Later on at dinner time the attic door in the cabin flings open, Ash and Scott decide to check it out, again because there's nothing abnormal about an attic door flinging itself up for no reason. In the attic they find the Book of the Dead and an old tape player with some incantations on it. Needless to say these incantations release evil and demonic spirits.Cheryl was already demonically possessed earlier and so naturally she is the first to really have horrific things happen to her, like a pretty full on scene where she is violated by a tree. She gets back inside and no one believes her. This is pretty good gradual revelation as the audience and Cheryl know more than the other four characters. Cheryl is understandably hysterical and so Ash tries to drive her back into town, but they realize that the semi collapsed bridge has fully collapsed and they are trapped at the cabin.They arrive back at the cabin and Cheryl turns full zombie. From there they turn one by one until it's just Ash remaining trying to survive the night and survive the zombies.As classical as a horror film plot that is, and I hope from that synopsis of the setup that it comes across just how well this movie builds in the first act, the real star is the awesome shots of the camera zooming through the woods. Now, they couldn't afford dollies on their budget so apparently Raimi tried everything from improvised wooden sliders using trees to getting two guys to run around in the woods holding a camera attached to a wooden rail sleeper. However he did it, Raimi and his virtually novice crew are able to create the sensation of a spirit or force moving through the woods. These shots are unsettling in the first act and downright frightening as the film continues.Another star is the gore effects, even though there are some scenes where you can see blood capsules and melting plastic. In the end, these zombie looking things actually are pretty scary and do work, at least within the world this film happens in.Campbell does grow on you as the film continues and his panicked flailing near the end of the film is excellent. The rest of the cast are inexperienced and do what they're asked by a director who appears to be taking great pleasure in subjecting them to all manner of discomforts and indignities.This film was widely praised when it came out and still highly regarded now. I think I've revealed the most unexpectedly disgusting part, but there's a lot of stuff in here that may offend. With this type of story and budget, you know what to expect, but you can also expect to get a film far better than you typical horror outing. One of the very best the horror genre has to offer.",The Evil Dead
189,tankace,"Small budget ,huge pay off and copycats!",8,7 November 2016,"Evil Dead of 1981 is among the most historic horror movies and low budget flicks alike.The 22 year old back then Sam Raimi with only 350 to 400 thousands dollars at his disposal and his closest friends, among them the now legendary Bruce Campbell, he made the ground zero for the cabin in the hoods archetype we all know and frankly had ourselves full of it. So that is a bonus reason why to watch it or re-watch: to see how this sub-genre of horror is done well.The story is simple,nice and neat, five friends go for some days in a cabin in the hoods and during their stay there are attacked by demonic spirits and do their best to survive this onslaught of demons and gulls.And there is the stuff that imitators are made of ,for many future directors and studios just saw the low budget and high score (with only limited release it made 2.4 millions, which means about 6 times its budget) and went berserk to carbon copy the formula in order to get a piece of this new pie.As I have wrote before this one of the issues with the movie making business, when something new comes into view and critics, audiences and even the Oscars love it, studios don't look why the movie or series of movies made money, for the causes like ,good script, nice characters, captivating scenes which made sense in the story, the original or good- looking or interesting cinematography. No they focused to the gore, locations of the incident and genre, the external features of the flick and not the ones that matter. For the people don't love Star Wars, Deadpool or Saving Private Ryan ,because are science fiction, gory and R-rated or brutal respectively, they like them for their unique style, story and characters.Anyway to finish my rant about this issue ,when something is popular don't carbon copy it, made the style your own and give it something of you, this why City of God is praised like the movie from which took inspirations The Goodfellas and Legends was boring as hell.As for the legacy of Evil Dead, it is huge and has got a cult status equal to the Clockwork Orange, Fight Club and Labyrinth and today is put at the same category with classics of the horror genre like Dracula (1931), Psycho (1960), Halloween (1978), Jaws (1975) and Scream (1992). To add to that even nowadays we see it in its great sequels and TV series which as far as I heard of is pretty groovy.All in all I recommended for anyone that likes horror movies and new directors who want some idea how to make their first horror flick. Also to the latter group if it isn't as good as you wanted to, don't be too hard on yourselves, usually the first time is the hardest and the one with the most mistakes, the next one will be better, expect from Syamalan then it is the other way around lol!",The Evil Dead
190,akshatmahajan,Not great for today's time,4,24 October 2020,"Sam Raimi's debut ""The Evil Dead"" is a good horror movie. Maybe it is due to small budget of $375,000 that the quality was bad and effects looked fake by today's standards. It could have been much much better.The actors were also inexperienced. None of them did good acting. It all looked fake. Only the story was strong and different.

The situation where a group of friends are stuck in the forest. In this movie they find a house, and decide to spend the night. But there is something Evil following them. One of the memorable scenes in this movie is when the girls are playing Cards. They have to guess what card the opponent is holding.

She Turns back to look at them and they get spooked, because she has turned into a monster. The make up on the monster is terrific, Its amazing how they spent very less to make this movie and the movie is known as one of the Best Horror Films. There is a trilogy in Evil Dead series.

193,jayjaycee,The Holy Grail Of Splatter Horror!,9,21 October 2019,"""The Evil Dead"" is a 1981 horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss. There's probably no movie more controversial and simultaneously beloved than Sam Raimi's directorial debut. In Germany it was banned and highly cut for more than three decades and only hardcore fans had the chance to own it. It literally was unavailable as an uncut version until 2017 and now it's even rated 16. Last year I had the chance to finally experience what's claimed to be the holy grail of horror and I was tremendously impressed. This year, it did not change a bit. Unlike most people from my generation, I absolutely love this film for what it is. From start to finish it offers a gripping and sinister atmosphere that always sends shivers down my spine. Every single frame of this brims over with pure horror and it's incomparably iconic. While there's not much dialogue and the characters make some questionable decisions, it's scores with the pictures that speak for themselves. The best of it all are the absolutely gross and bloody special and make-up effects that haven't aged that well, but still manage to terrorise the audience with their excessive vehemence. Furthermore, every single character is worked out so well and sympathic, especially Campbell's Ashley Williams, the hesitant protagonist and hero against his own will. He really carries most of the film with his genuine coolness and well-paced character development. A hero the scared viewer can easily identify with. Next to this, the plot offers a lot of terrifying ideas and plays them out extremely well. Considering that this is a low budget production it made every single penny worth it. All in all, Sam Raimi created a timeless and horrifying splatter masterpiece that lives from its gorgeous effects and iconic scenes. Although it was a college student film it managed to become an infamous cult classic that will always scare the hell out of teenager generations to come. It might not have aged perfectly, but that's what makes it so special and remarkable. It breathes the essence of 80s horror. Also, it's absolutely inspiring for young filmmakers and shows them that you can achieve so much with so little. An all-time favourite that will never get boring. I love it!",The Evil Dead
194,jcbutthead86,One Of The Greatest Horror Films Of All Time. Sam Raimi And Bruce Campbell's Best Film.,10,13 February 2013,"The Evil Dead is one of the greatest Horror films of all time that is not only a Cult Classic,but a Horror Classic as well.Made on a low budget of 350,000$ and filled with Great direction,great special effects,originality and Dark Humor,The Evil Dead is in my opinion the best and my favorite of The Evil Dead trilogy,Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell's best film and is not only one of my favorite Horror films of all time,but one of my favorite films all time.The Evil Dead tells the story of five college students who are on vacation and rent a cabin in the woods. While there the five students unintentionally bring back evil demons from the dead that wants to possess the students one by one. Now,it's all up to Ash(Bruce Campbell)who has to fight off the demons and survive...The Evil Dead.I think one of the reasons The Evil Dead is a Horror classic was because when the film came out in the early 80s slasher films were all the rage at the time,but The Evil Dead was a different animal. Instead of making another slasher film,director Sam Raimi,decided to make a movie about demonic possession and give viewers a scary,horrifying and original experience. One of the reasons ED is such a scary and frightening film is because like some of the best Horror films you never know what to expect and don't know what's coming,with the scary situations in the film are insane,wild,creepy and frightening. The scares in the film are done with great timing,imagination and effect,using creepy sound effects for the demons and strange noises outside in the woods giving viewers an uneasy feeling because with ED there is great build up to the to the Horror and once the Horror starts it never ever stops and for 85 minutes you are put on a terrifying and scary thrill ride that doesn't quit until the very end. The atmosphere in the film is excellent,showing the woods not as a beautiful place you want to be at for a vacation,but a place that's ugly and evil filled with fog and smoke and pulsating with darkness and dread. What also makes the atmosphere in ED scary and excellent is the POV shots of the demons and the unique camera angles smartly not showing the faces of the demons when they're chasing and stalking the main characters but showing the faces of the main characters when they're being chased. The camera angles and shots from Raimi are unique and stylish with tilted angles and over the head shots adding to ED's brilliance and making the film rise above most low budget Horror films. Ash in this film is a character we can relate to because while Ash is the hero of the film Ash goes through a lot of pain and terror that most human beings can stand to bear. Although Ash isn't the tough guy(he's still scared in the other films)he became in the sequels Ash still finds a way to fight the evil demons but still realizes he's in way over his head and that's one of the things that makes Ash an iconic character The violence and gore in the film is not for the weak at heart,it's effective,bloody, gory and disgusting and when the blood and gore comes into the film the blood flows and never stops. ED is one of the most politically incorrect and craziest Horror films ever made and I don't know if it was intentional or not,but the film has a dark sense of Humor about itself because while the film is pure Horror there are some things in the film that are so over the top you can't help but laugh whether it's the demons taunting the main characters or the slapstick suffering the characters go through. The dark Comedy and Humor were pushed even further in the sequels Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn and Army Of Darkness and it's one of the things that makes this series great and unique. The ending of the film is insane,bloody,twisted and full of energy and will be something you'll never forget and is one of the great things that makes ED a Horror classic.The cast does a good job with their roles. Bruce Campbell does a wonderful job as Ash,the hero of the film,bringing sympathy and likability to the role. Ash isn't the tough-talking shotgun using hero he became in the sequels,but Ash still does heroic things in the film. Ellen Sandweiss does a good job as Cheryl,Ash's frightened sister. Hal Delrich does a fine job Scott,Ash's friend. Betsy Baker is good as Linda,Ash's girlfriend. Sarah York does a fine job as Shelly,Scott's girlfriend.The direction from Sam Raimi is just excellent and stylish,using great angles,POV shots,intense close-ups and also does well in the scary scenes. Great direction from Raimi.The score by Joe Doluca is scary,effective,frightening and fits in with the film's creepy tone. A great score.The special effects by Tom Sullivan is amazing,disgusting,frightening and unforgettable and are well done for a low budget.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Cult Films,Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell or cinema in general,you'll love The Evil Dead,a brilliant Horror classic from beginning to end that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Evil Dead
195,culwin,Better than expected,7,17 May 2003,"I didn't expect much going into this film, but being a fan of Bruce Campbell, I had to finally check it out.  It is certainly not the 'masterpiece' that the ""Cult of Bruce"" touts it to be, but still I was impressed.  This really is more than just a ""kids-in-the-woods-slash-em-up""; if you pay attention you can see some clever writing.  We see a budding Sam Raimi becoming a true artist at his craft.  We see a young Bruce Campbell in his first big acting ""gig"".  I was even impressed with the other never-heard-from-again actors.  I expected hammy performances all around, but it wasn't that bad at all.  Considering the pathetic budget and constraints they had to work with, this is a very watchable piece of work. A bit too much gore for my liking, but nevertheless I would recommend this to any fan of Raimi, Campbell, independent films, or the horror genre in general.  8/10 for fans, 6/10 for non-fans",The Evil Dead
196,GeorgeRoots,The Little Film That Could.,9,8 September 2014,"Well here we are with ""The Evil Dead"". Sam Raimi, probably has one of the most charming stories of how he got into the industry. He and childhood friend Bruce Campbell, created a 30 minute short entitled ""Within The Woods"", practically inspired by the works of H.P Lovecraft. This helped Raimi convince people to secure a larger budget for the next production thus ""The Evil Dead"" was made, and thus the rest is history.Five college students vacation in a furbished cabin in the remote woods. After they find an audiotape reciting incantations that release a plethora of demons and spirits, each of the group suffer various forms of demonic possession. Who and will survive? Regardless it's gonna lead to ridiculous amounts of blood use.It pretty much proves that regardless of budget, certain ideas and executions can become timeless and more iconic than a lot of these Hollywood franchise remakes we see today. Funny enough Sam Raimi had really became an influence to me when I began to take interest in darker movies. I remember watching ""Spider-man"" (2002) at the age of 10, and I was just blown away at the angles, camera tracking during the web swinging, and the abandoned building at the end was so eerie. How wonderful to know that all this was carried on from his earlier works. Shot for very long hours, and the cast were local friends and family who kept constantly dropping in and out of production. Bruce Campbell is one of the most underrated actors ever, yet I think he'll forever remain this kind of ""B-Movie"" icon for all the right reasons. But as said earlier, this movie is insane. It was made on a shoe string budget, has so many unique special effect moments and the finale is an incredible testament to the art of stop-motion before CGI now wiped it's arse over everything.Final Verdict: Another landmark of the Horror genre. If you haven't had the time to see it yet, make some. 9/10.",The Evil Dead
197,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Check this Masterpiece!,8,24 June 2008,"In the fall of 1979, Sam Raimi and his merry band headed into the woods of rural Tennessee to make a movie. They emerged with a roller coaster of a film packed with shocks, gore, and wild humor, a film that remains a benchmark for the genre. Ash (cult favorite Bruce Campbell) and four friends arrive at a backwoods cabin for a vacation, where they find a tape recorder containing incantations from an ancient book of the dead. When they play the tape, evil forces are unleashed, and one by one the friends are possessed. Wouldn't you know it, the only way to kill a ""deadite"" is by total bodily dismemberment, and soon the blood starts to fly. Raimi injects tremendous energy into this simple plot, using the claustrophobic set, disorienting camera angles, and even the graininess of the film stock itself to create an atmosphere of dread, punctuated by a relentless series of jump-out-of-your-seat shocks. The Evil Dead lacks the more highly developed sense of the absurd that distinguish later entries in the series--Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness--but it is still much more than a gore movie. It marks the appearance of one of the most original and visually exciting directors of his generation, and it stands as a monument to the triumph of imagination over budget.",The Evil Dead
198,random_avenger,The Evil Dead,9,4 August 2010,"Sam Raimi's classic horror-comedy still holds up after almost 30 years. Even though the plot may now sound very clichéd, and it probably did in 1981 too, it never hinders the fun of horror: A group of five friends, Ash, Cheryl, Scotty, Linda and Shelly (played by Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly respectively) drive to a remote forest cabin for a fun weekend but their plans are quickly put on hold by the presence of sinister forces from the unknown. After having inadvertently summoned the evil entities with the help of a strange book and audio tape found in the cellar, everything turns against them: the forest won't allow them to leave and starts assaulting them in gruesome ways, turning them into zombie-like freaks one after another. Ultimately only one of the friends remains human, intent on making it out alive...The movie starts as an atmospheric suspense-driven horror film: the camera crawls near the ground like a preying animal, there's focus on creepy little details like a swing banging against a wall, a clock pendulum stopping by itself, a bridge ominously falling apart even before anything out of the ordinary has happened. Once the gore starts after about 30 minutes, it keeps evenly escalating into ridiculous amounts, conveniently shifting the tone towards comedy without awkward mood changes. The infamous vine rape scene looks genuinely nasty, providing maybe the most horrific moment in the story, and while the wild dismemberments in the latter half of the film are intentionally over the top, the tone maintains a feel of tragedy throughout – the freaks were once human beings, more than fodder for axes, bullets and chainsaws. Despite the excessiveness of the gore, the suspense is never allowed to fade away even at the very end, thanks to Raimi's skillful direction and the frequently oblique camera-work.The effects still look excellent for the most part; only the stop-motion transformations of the climactic scenes at the end have dated notably, but I think their old-fashioned cartoon-like quality is really charming in a way. The screen-presence of the pus-oozing plastic monsters is on a wholly different plane of existence than the obviously non-existent CGI creations of many modern action movies.Even though the actions of the characters aren't exactly believable, it comes across as awareness of the conventions of the horror genre instead of lazy writing, and surely provides a strong basis for a both funny and creepy piece of entertainment. The direction, music, effects and acting make sure The Evil Dead is still just as enjoyable as it was in 1981, completely deserving of its classic reputation. Essential viewing for any horror fan.",The Evil Dead

At first looking at the cover I was not very interested but after hearing all of the positive things for this film I got my hopes up.The film follows a group of teenagers, Ash played by Bruce Campbell, Cheryl played by Ellen Sandweiss, Scotty played by Richard DeManicor, Linda played by Betsy Baker and Shelly played by Theresa Tilly who travel to a cabin located in the middle of the woods. They find a tape recording and when they play it they unknowingly bring the woods to life and one by one the Evil consumes their souls.This film is all around creepy. The cast does a good job in their respective roles. The makeup and Special effects are some of the best I have ever seen and you leave the movie feeling frightened and scared for your life.Rated NC-17 For Substantial Graphic Horror Violence And Gore.1hr 25min/85min.****/****",The Evil Dead

The special effects these days look laughable but if you think of the time and the budget they were incredible. Some of the scenes can make people cringe with things like the tree rape but it was sort of a necessary scene to show the true evil that Ash and his friends were combatting.

This was Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Rob Tapert. The reasons why this is a classic are: 1.Lame Special effects 2.Lots of blood and gore 3.There are weird comedy aspects about it.This was a really low budget film that showed. I mean, the ending when the zombies melted was entirely clay! Of course, special effects were not good back then.

I wondered if I was being too harsh on the film although I did like the sequel to ""Urban Legend"", Wes Craven's ""Scream"", and David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"".  The three films had one thing in common - they were very graphic.  The film takes place in the backwoods of Tennessee where a few Michigan State students drive up to a wooden cabin to spend a few days there.  Soon the students discover that they aren't alone when some demons called ""Shemps"" come after them.  The Shemps don't go down without a fight and take a severe beating (more severe than Stallone took in the ""Rocky"" films and Walken took in ""The Dogs of War"").  Although the violence is very graphic, I wasn't bothered by it and part of that comes from the excellent camera work.  The film made stars of director Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who plays the heroic Ash.  ""The Evil Dead"" is a first-rate shocker.",The Evil Dead

It is one of the greatest horrror films of all time my personal favorite it is in my top 10 favorite horror films. Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead to me is the best of best masterpiece terrifying terror on a widescreen ever. I saw this film on VHS when I was 9 years old and I was so terrified that I have not watch this movie for over 20 years.Sam Raimi and his roommate friend Bruce Campbell from college invasted their saving money in to making ""The Evil Dead"" movie. This movie was made on alow budget money Rami and Campbell could not effort better a big group of actors, or better effects, but with super low budget this movie works.""We're going to get you. We're going to get you. Not another peep. Time to go to sleep. ""I love this movie to death it was shot in Tennessee in the early winter 80's in the cabin, the cabin in which the movie was shot is burned down. I love, love this movie to death. It is a personal horror film of mine. There were three movies made: Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness and remake. My favorite will always be the first one, because it is more scary, has no humor. Really believable everyone making this movie did a good job.Bruce Campbell's acting performence is the best of the film,I like him more in this movie than in the sequels. In this movie Ash Williams is not a super hero with a chainsaw and a shotgun. He is a normal human being, he cares about his friends, he is not a selfish tough guy like in the sequels, he is a normal guy. He dosen't know what to do and he has to fight for survival against evil demons and spirits posessing his friends. Just like in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood when Tina accidently releases Jason from his cell and now she haa to fight to put him back there where he belongs in his cell. In here Ash, his sister and his friends accidently unleashes evil demons and spirits and now Ash has to fight for his survival to get them back there where they belong in the cell.The story is a basic cabin in the woods story about a group of college kids who get more than they bargained for when they accidentally release a few demons on their trip to the country. As you might assume, all hell breaks loose and Raimi really proves himself as a director combining horror and comedy elements that both work. The horror is genuinely creepy. Not to mention how well the film is shot with great framing and tremendous high speed demon POV shots that fly through the woods around the cabin with reckless abandon. It's a fascinating first effort, impressively well crafted and holds up very well despite its age.I love how the film was shot the filming locations I like the other cast beside Bruce Campbell. Ellen Sandweiss was excellent as Cheryl Williams love her performence I did not know Cherly was actually Ash's sister because she was never mentioned in the sequels later. Richard DeManincor as Scotty friend of Ash and Cheryl was really good. I like DeManincor's performence, I love Scotty he was a bad-ass in this movie. Betsy Baker as Linda was a babe she was really good as Ash's girlfriend I am wondering why she did not come back for the sequel. Theresa Tilly was a babe as Shelly I love her.I love the effects, the blood, the creepines in this movie, the gore, death scens all are excellent. Evil Dead II and The Evil Dead are the best in the series I will still go for The Evil Dead as my favorite in the series. I love this film to death I recommend this film to any horror fan.",The Evil Dead

But there is something fascinatingly good and brutal about this piece of cinema.  It's so over-the-top, it's brilliant.  A truly disgusting film -- but wonderful nonetheless.",The Evil Dead
206,Jacques98,Boyish childhood fantasy violence.,7,31 August 2008,"Let me be blunt: I ignored this movie with my life for years because I assumed it was just another cheesy zombie movie that would amount to nothing more than yet another night of boredom that I'd end up falling asleep to. I LOVE zombie video games, but I have never once seen a zombie movie that could fulfill that awesomeness and utter zombie carnage that games like Dead Rising and Resident Evil did. Until I saw The Evil Dead, I assumed it was simply impossible to put that much awesomeness that zombie games have on film. Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead both bored me, were pathetic, and couldn't come close to filling that hole that zombie games put in my heart. So, why would I want to watch something like The Evil Dead? I only watched it because one of my favorite critics, Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation, suggested it. To my shock, The Evil Dead is the first and only zombie movie I have ever enjoyed. Ever.Unlike boring George A. Romero films The amount of punk carnage was not toned down, much like the games I love. The characters actually have some personality and had something to say other than: ""Oh, God, zombies!"" over and over again. They didn't bother to ask what is going on, giving them a sense of self-aware realism. This movie was also purely for ENTERTAINMENT. Let me repeat myself: ENTERTAINMENT. Do half the directors/writers out there even know what that world means? There was no brainless social commentary we've heard since we were old enough to pee on our own, as seems to be included in every movie ever made by law or something. I think that is why I like Sam Raimbi so much, because he clearly states that his movies are for ENTERTAINMENT (I'm going to put that in all caps from now on in hopes some random director who stumbles on this will remember what it means) and not for retarded critical acclaim or some pointless social commentary.As for the violence, for an 80's movie, it was freaking childishly amazing! This is the kind of stuff I'd dream about as a little boy. Some of the gore effects were hard to look at because they were insanely outdated, but they were few and far between. At times, they even added to the cheese atmosphere. This is just as violent as modern horror movies like 30 Days of Night and The Hills Have Eyes remake, if you can look past the armature blood effects. (I'm mainly referring to the lack of decent blood on the severed limbs/heads.) Also, the cheesy disturbing factor added to it. But unlike modern horror movieslike Mirrorsthere was no cheap cliché scares. The clichés that were there this movie created, which I can ignore. The idea of being raped by trees was pretty original and laughably disturbing, in a good way, as well. Also, the idea of zombies that . . . umm, shape-shiftedis that what they did?was both original and just awesome. I'm not even sure I'd call them zombies as much as vampire-evil-doll-clown-zombie-demon . . . things.Overall, this gave me a new hope that zombie movies could be truly amazing and gory. This really is THE best zombie movie EVER. Why? Because it remembers ENTERTAINMENT.What more can I say?5/10",The Evil Dead
207,geminiredblue,Don't Shut It Off!!!,8,13 October 2011,"If one were to think of Sam Raimi the director, what springs to mind? Perhaps the SPIDERMAN movies? Maybe DARKMAN? Most assuredly ARMY OF DARKNESS (the third movie in the EVIL DEAD series!) Back in '80 and into the winter of '81, Raimi along with his pals Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell, set out to make a student film that would eventually cross over into their first feature. And what a doozy! Borrowing story elements from some notable Italian horror, SUSPIRIA for one, as well as popular American horror, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE EXORCIST spring to mind, the young filmmakers then proceed to tell their own twisted tale. Five college students spend the weekend at an old dilapidated cabin, only to discover an ancient book of spells called the Necromonicon and a tape recording of the incantations. Unfortunately, the tape recording awakens some very angry demons who then proceed to possess four of the students, soon leaving Bruce Campbell as the iconic Ash the only survivor. And if that wasn't bad enough everything in the forest, from the trees to the fog and wind, seems to have a mind of its own. Worse still, the only way for Ash to defeat the demons is to dismember each one of his friends. Tons of low budget gore, an unhinged plot and some very wicked special effects are what makes this movie shine. It's guaranteed to shock, appall, and terrify you. So gather together your brood of friends, unless you dare to watch it alone. Either way, the best way to watch it is with the lights turned down and the volume turned up! Enjoy some bloody good fun!!!",The Evil Dead
208,noahgibbobaker,Good for the budget.,7,7 October 2020,"I've heard great things about the evil dead and it's sequels. I don't think it is as good some people say. It is really good considering the budget, the effects are great and so is the music, set design and cinematography. The use of POV shots was brilliant. But the characters were a big let down for me.The characters were exchangeable with one another and didn't really have that much about them. Ashley was by far the best character, but I still think he wasn't great. Linda, Shelly and especially Scott really annoyed me, they weren't even very funny while they were human. I have a couple more issues, one due to having a tiny budget and one due to the dialogue. The ADR is bad sometimes and really bad when characters are laughing, and dialogue between characters wasn't ever interesting.I enjoyed the rest of the movie a lot. The makeup and effects were fantastic. I loved how whacky it got for the third act, I loved the last half hour. The cinematography got so weird and unique during the finale, the scares were great during this part as well helped by the shot composition. The music was awesome and appropriately used, the end credits music was funny and it sounded good too.I would highly recommend you watch evil dead, I heard the sequels are even better so I'm excited to watch them.",The Evil Dead

You can say what you want about cinema-art but I really liked this movie. It was so simple made, but it got so exciting and entertaining. The cheap (no offense Sam, this is a minimum-budget movie) special effects are a tribute, cause the better the effects in a horrormovie are, the worse the movie itself get. **Minor spoiler** In the end of the movie, when the dawn raises you feel calmed, since Bruce is safe now when the sun is up. That is why you get even more horrofied when something runs up at him from behind. **End of spoiler, keep reading** The movie is very caotic, but realistic enough to think that it is scary. I should have seen it late at night, and I'm still sorry for seeing it 16.00 pm. But I can imagine seeing it at the night!                              Classic! 8/10",The Evil Dead

212,TheCorniestLemur,Them some evil deads,9,24 October 2021,"Sooooo...this is my first time watching this, even though cheap horror films have always been a particular guilty pleasure of mine. I know that's a sin against the cinematic arts, but I'm here now, and happy to say that there's nothing guilty about these pleasures.This is actually one of very few examples to me of a really cheap and schlocky horror film where I don't only not care about how cheap it looks, but I think it actually makes it vastly better than it would have otherwise been.Roll with me for a bit here: could you ever imagine this film having a bigger budget than it did? Even if you could, in what way would that make it any better? None, as far as I can see anyway.And that's primarily why I loved this so much, because while the script, even at the time probably, was nothing all that amazing, it's just such an honest effort from a bunch of people who started out with nothing and no one who cared about what they were doing other than themselves.It's pretty obvious that about 85% of the budget likely went to the make up and special effects, and while it's a little cheap-looking, it's still so much more interesting to look at than any number of faceless CGI zombies having their guts stomped out or heads chopped off (yes, this is exactly what I'm expecting from Army Of The Dead). And I'm not lying when I say that towards the end, I was starting to feel genuinely sick from all the gore, and that is not a very common occurance for me, so it was definitely doing something right.Even though there can't have been all that much money going into everything else, there's so many visually creative and interesting shots that don't even involve any special effects.The dialogue is hilarious, the sound in general is awesome, and while it wouldn't ever win any awards for acting or writing, I think any idiot can tell you that's obviously not what it's focusing on. One point on the writing though: I really could have done without the tree rape scene. I know everyone's talked about it already, but it really does feel trashy and exploitative, and leaves a bit of a stain on an otherwise brilliant series of scares.And I suppose you do have to question why the demons can't just possess Ash as well instead of watch as he chops up all their hosts, but other than that, this is...well, rubbish, admittedly, but it's good rubbish. And it's especially good Halloween rubbish, so get on it in the next week.",The Evil Dead

It feels like one hell of a trope fest, but you can't help but think, how many of these tropes did this movie start? How can I judge that when I don't know, and it's for a review on a blog and I'm too lazy to do some research? And it's better to not actually address all that, because then I'd have to talk again about how stupid the characters are, because everyone's always a total idiot in horror movies. If I had to address that every time I watched horror movies, I'd probably never watch another horror movie again.While the story is great, and this is an excellent things there are few things that bother me. One of them is the cinematography. It's sometimes so weird and bad it ruins the mood. And sometimes it feels like the movie is a bad home video made by my dad. That is an eccentric look and it could be either good or bar. In this movie that look did work, but then most of the cinematography was just weird.Another thing was the effects, but hey, it's the 1980s, so it's not like I was expecting something hyper realistic. And I think it's better this way. All that crappy make up and stuff makes everything even more horrifying. You can't really get that same feeling with CGI.While I notice and can acknowledge why The Evil Dead has that reputation as cult classic, and I see why it was a big deal when it came out, it kinda leaves me cold. Could be the fact that it's kind of short, and I'm hoping to see more of Ash. There's something really charming about Bruce Campbell as Ash, and I don't know what it is yet.

215,nesfilmreviews,"Raimi's debut might be short on budget, but it's hardly bereft of ideas or spirit.",8,14 October 2013,"Nauseating and amusing in equal measure, ""Evil Dead"" is one horror movie that easily obtains its cult status, managing to surpass even your wildest imagination of gore and visceral violence. This is the first installment of the popular Evil Dead trilogy -- a low-budget, B-grade gore-fest horror film with the Stephen King quote-tagline: ""the ultimate experience in grueling terror."" A thinly scripted screenplay becomes a kaleidoscope of skewed camera angles and energetic panache under Raimi's remarkably assured guidance and direction. His debut might be short on budget, but it's hardly bereft of ideas or spirit.Five Michigan State University students spend the weekend in a remote Tennessee cabin, and inadvertently unleash dormant, demonic, evil spirits. In the cellar of the cabin, they find an archaeologist's tape-recording describing the contents of the Naturon Demonto (Book of the Dead). Unaware they are unleashing demonic forces -- one by one -- they must fight off evil spirits, and avoid becoming demoniacally possessed. It's obvious that Raimi takes great pleasure in all of his demented material, and he's eager to share it with an audience that's left equally shocked and thrilled. ""The Evil Dead"" is much more of a straight horror movie than its successors, but it's no less fun. Heads and arms are frequently severed, but it's all done in such a fun spirit, and in a over-the-top manner that it's difficult not to grin. ""The Evil Dead"" is at times genuinely creepy, due in part to the imaginative camera-work devised by Sam Raimi, and cinematographer Tim Philo. The ""shaky cam"" (in which the camera gave us the point-of-view of the demon rushing through the woods), became a staple of the Evil Dead series. Raimi and company empty the tank of all its gore, make-up, camera, and stop-motion tricks into an unforgettable, resounding success of entrepreneurial filmmaking.",The Evil Dead

217,FairlyAnonymous,A fun and violent movie that isn't as disturbing as many make it out to be,7,10 September 2014,"The Evil Dead is a fun movie. It's strange to say that, but it isn't scary and its violence only adds to its humour. The movie never has any real ""jokes"" in it; it simply has great timing. Everything in the movie is timed so well that it makes it hilarious. The difference between a horrifying death versus a hilarious death can just be a matter of seconds. This gives the movie a very unique flavor. Most black comedies usually get humour from violent/scary things happening and the main characters not reacting to it. However, this movie doesn't quite do that. The main character definitely react to death and violence; however, something always happens (due to timing) to detract from the horror of the scene.One such example is when the main character decapitates someone and the body falls on the character and bleeds into his mouth. Under normal circumstances this would be horrifying (and the main character is definitely scared) but because of the timing and the fact that ""A decapitated body coincidentally landed on the character and is spewing blood directly into his mouth for a long period of time"" makes it hilarious. The movie's gore is a major part of its humour. It's over the top.The movie's premise is actually entertaining enough. By today's standards it is incredibly cliché. Even for it's time, the whole ""Friends going on vacation in the woods"" scenario was a cliché, but not nearly to the degree that it is today. The movie's ""lore""--what little of it is revealed to the audience--is still more well developed than most horror/possession movies. While not a lot is revealed in the movie, you can definitely feel as if there is a bit more to the story that has to be revealed. The acting is good in the campy sense. It is supposed to feel kind of generic/campy. Overall, the cast is most entertaining when either being possessed or when reacting to something in horror...All in all, The Evil Dead is a very entertaining horror comedy. It isn't really scary and it isn't hilarious. It is simply a creative horror film that did very well with its budget restraints. The violence is done mainly to comedic effect.7.5/10",The Evil Dead
218,Chaves7777,Good try Mr. Raimi,7,15 November 2006,"""The evil dead"" is a movie of absurd horror. Is an imaginative but disgusting and bloody story of our hero in horror movies Ash. In a lonely cabin, in a calm forest there is a curse. A curse that won't stop until possess all that finds in the woods.The story, surpasses some limits, and that thing make the movie not comfortable. For example... i know in the story, the trees have power of anything... but, come on, a woman who is raped by a tree? I think is a little violent and (apologize for the repetition) not comfortable. It is a very creative, but not well presented story. Is a movie for those that want a good fright and to see blood until in the mat.In all ways, Sam Raimi makes an excellent work as director.

There have been two sequels made, Evil Dead 2 & Army of Darkness. While Evil Dead 4 has been rumored for years, the release of ""Drag Me to Hell"", Raimi's triumphant return to the horror genre, prospects are looking good for another ""Dead"" sequel.Sam Raimi met his leading man and constant collaborator Bruce Campbell in high school and both also went to Michigan State University. In the late 1970's Sam and Bruce put together a short film called ""Within the Woods"" which got them the funding they needed for a feature. Evil Dead was made in the early 80's on a budget of $350,000, and is still one of the most loved cult horror films ever made. It seems to get even better with repeated viewings. It is the story of five friends spending a weekend in cabin to relax and party. In the deep dark basement they find a tape recorder, a book, and a ceremonial dagger. Upon playing the tape (which is a translation of the book) they inadvertently unleash an evil force that will eventually crash their weekend. The cabin was once owned by a professor of archeology and the book is the Necronomicon or ""Book of the Dead"" it is bound in human flesh and written in blood. One by one the characters get inhabited by the evil force and turned in to hideous demons. As the tape says the only way to kill them is ""total body dismemberment."" Raimi is a huge Three Stooges fan and this can be seen in many of his movies. Known for his slap stick style of comedic horror and gore, his movies are truly original. The acting is quite over the top, but that's part of its charm. The make up effects are pretty creative and effective for the budget that had to work with. The camera work and shot selection is innovative and well done. This is a film that stands the test of time and will be enjoyed for generations to come.",The Evil Dead

Yes there were cheesy and flat-out stupid lines in the film that I laughed at, but these were mainly at the beginning. Also, according to my professor this was supposed to be gut-wrenching scary, but I was ultimately unimpressed with the horror aspects of the movie.Apparently this title has a rating of NC-17 because of the horror/gore aspects of the film, but I didn't find these elements to be even remotely scary - though I could see how they would be frightening in an early 80s movie. For me, though, when the teens were infected by the spirits, they looked exactly how I expected the un-dead in early 80s movies to look, if not even worse since they had strange tints to their skin. Also, in the second half of the film, there are moments when the spirits just kind of decide to make the infected appear normal for a minute just to fool the main character. So, the un-dead are only un-dead when they choose to be?I think if there were more funny moments (whether intentionally or unintentionally funny) it would have made the film more enjoyable since I expected to see something very campy, but this was just a plain bad horror film, though nowhere near as bad as Night of the Living Dead. In fact, when I watched Night of the Living Dead it broke so many continuity rules and had so many cheesy parts that I was laughing throughout the film. I guess something like that experience is what I expected, but to me this was just a standard horror film with a low budget.",The Evil Dead
224,kingofdanerds,Gore Galore,8,31 October 2020,"The Evil Dead is possibly one of the absolute goriest films that I have ever seen (with the exception of Rob Zombie's Halloween II). The Evil Dead is a 1981 horror film directed by Sam Raimi (famous for the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films and The Evil Dead sequels). It also starred a very young Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams (but not the Ash Williams that we all know and love). Campbell also was the the co-executive producer for this film. The film started production when both Raimi and Campbell managed to raise $350,000 to make this film in 1979. In 1981, the film was released and did amazing at the box office and critics and audiences loved the film. Even Stephen King loved the film!!! The film has since gone on to start a whole franchise that includes 2 sequels, a remake, and a television series and countless other types of media to tie in.A group of friends go to a cabin for the weekend and in the cabin is an audio recording along with the Necronomicon (the book of the dead) and the Kandarian Dagger. When the audio tape is played, the audio says an incantation that awakens demons that come to posses the group of friends. Will anyone make it out alive? Or will they all become possessed?This film is far from being perfect but still manages to be quite an enjoyable film to watch overall. Yes, the sequel is often considered superior but this film is alright by itself. The whole setup of this film is truly amazing. It starts out very unassuming and when the demons arrive, it is just pure entertainment. I truly have not a lot to complain about here in this film. First, the characters/acting. It is far from being perfect. The acting is chessy but in the best way possible. The characters are not very well developed. People who have watched the Evil Dead sequels and not this film might find themselves a little dissappointed with this film when it comes to Ash as he is not the Ash that most people know him as. In this film, he does not do much at all. Largely, the characters are the type of characters that you would expect to get possessed. But, I can mostly overlook all of that due to all the big positives that are in this film. A big positive is atmosphere. From the beginning, a very creepy atmosphere is developed and stays with the film all the way to the end. The whole concept of this film is fairly unique (for the time). Hell, everything about this film is very unique. The cinematography and camera work is a prime example of this film being unique. While most of the shots do work well with this film, there are a few that kind of get a little too much for my taste. The special effects in this film is truly my favorite part of this whole film. This film was so violent, that it was banned in several countries and is still to this day. There are parts in this film that make me cringe because everything looks so painful. It is very impressive with what was done with the budget that was available. The face makeup is not great but the gore effects somewhat hold up to this day. Seeing all of the gore really makes this film really entertaining. While this film might have been scary for its time, I did not find it really scary at all but I am saying that in a positive way. I think a film like this should be viewed more for its effects rather than the scares. There are a few moments when the film can and does get pretty suspenseful (mainly in the last half of the film). For me, it is not a soil my pants type of film. But it most definitely can be scary for other people. Strangely enough, this film does have some funny moments but unlike it's sequels, those moments are unintentonally funny. But funny nonetheless.The Evil Dead is a very impressive film overall. Sure, it has its flaws, but they can mostly be overlooked due to all of what was done to make this film have it's identity.",The Evil Dead
225,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,A few excellent things but overall still very disappointing,4,24 October 2015,"Things I liked (the good) - well the best parts are in the first half hour or so, decent build-up with the tape recorder, the old book with spells, the bridge that could fall apart every moment. - one of the girls being trapped by branches of tree and/or plants, that was a strong scene - the special effects surely are impressive - and while not the best horror make-up I have seen they surely did a good job thereThings I disliked (the bad) - Yes the story is as generic as the premise - The characters well they don't have background or personality whether they live or die in the end I wouldn't care, yeah maybe the character of Bruce Campbell was the most interesting but that is mainly because he got most screen time - Once hell started to break loose and the gore and splatter started, it will with some short breaks go on until the end. This overkill surely lost its effect on me before the 1 hour mark. At least Braindead kept most of the action and splatter until the end. - No rules how people get possessed/infected. One person becomes a demon while being cut an other doesn't while getting cuts and gallons of blood over him. This was way too random for me, at least give everyone a fair chance and not randomly make someone immune to it. - Not good when you like everyone to die asap and still think 80 minutes feels like 3 hoursNote that the only reason I did give it a chance was that it was a double bill on a DVD with The Brood, a movie I think is great.",The Evil Dead

228,WubsTheFadger,The Evil Dead,7,29 January 2018,"Short and Simple ReviewThe plot is full of clichés but since this is an older movie it may seem original. The story is kind of intriguing but it is still a little weak. The pacing in the movie is very slow in the beginning but picks up towards the end.The acting is overdone. Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Hal Delrich, Betsy Baker, and Sarah York perform on the standard of old horror films. All in all, the acting feels old in a bad way.The gore is the best part. The amount of creative uses of gore is great. From melting scenes to grotesque monsters, this film does a great job at making gore seem fresh and unique.Pros: Great use of gore, suspenseful third act, and a semi intruding storyCons: Outdated acting, slow pacing in the beginning, and a cliché storyOverall Rating: 7.1",The Evil Dead
229,CrassActionHero,Sinister,7,12 October 2006,"The Evil Dead. Ah yes. The first installment.The movie starts off with a group of people going to a rundown cabin in Tennesse. After looking around the place, they find a tape recorder, That's when it begins...The acting is wooden. They are not the most experienced actors out there, but it's not really bad. The ladies are fine eye candy. Horror movies always deliver them well and this is no exception. The Violence is gruesome. The amounts of blood here are quite excessive. The makeup is good. The people indeed look quite disgusting. So far so good.There is however a scene involving a tree and our first victim. What happened there was.....original and will definitely get your attention. Trust me. The movie is unrated for a reason.We meet Ash for the first time here. Don't expect the calm and cool one here. He starts off as kind of a wuss. This is the first time he is witness to the awful events that unfold and how would anyone react to horrible things like this? Sam Raimi is a talented director. He already shows major promise here in his first big movie. The many things he does with the camera are unique. Don't forget the fake shemps. Even Ted Raimi makes his film debut here.(You have to listen to the commentary to find out where) The Last Word: A good start. The cult following begins. Although not perfect, this is a fine campy flick. Good for a Saturday night party flick. Remember, this is not a comedy. A few funny scenes otherwise, it's pretty graphic.",The Evil Dead

232,schroeder-gustavo,The Evil Dead Review,10,12 March 2016,"I'm just gonna go ahead and say this, I truly believe The Evil Dead is one of the greatest movies ever made. I admire this movie on so many levels it's insane. Quick back story on The Evil Dead: Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi grew up together and made several low budget Super-8 mm films. Sam Raimi then had the idea of directing a horror movie and had a budget of about $1500 and he made a short film called Within the Woods. The idea of that film was to attract producers and use the money gained from that to create a full-length film. He then even asked friends and family for money to create his project. With around $350 000, Raimi set out to make a remake of his short film. What we got was The Evil Dead. The thing that interests me about the film so much (other than the film itself) is the production. With limited budget, Raimi had to cast friends of his (including Campbell) for the film. The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The team had absolutely no assistance from location scouts and they had to find a fitting location for the film. They found an actual abandoned cabin in the woods in Tennessee to shoot. During pre-production, the entire team had to stay in the isolated cabin that had no plumbing, no heating and was far away from any medical assistance. Due to the crew's inexperience, many of them got lost in the woods and several got injured. One of the actresses even had her eyelashes completely torn off while taking off her mask. Because of the low budget, contact lenses to create the ""demon-eyes look"" were very thick and had to be taken off every 15 minutes because they eyes could not breathe. They could not afford a camera dolly so they had to build several things to create the desired camera movement, including attaching the camera to lumber. On the last few days of shooting, the conditions were so terrible, they began to burn furniture in order to stay warm. The actors went weeks without showering and many caught a cold because of the poor conditions. Shooting took 3 months and shortly after that, looking at the footage Raimi realized there were holes that needed to be filled (no pun intended) but the actors had already left the set and were already busy with other projects. So family members of Raimi filled in for the actors for the re- shooting of some scenes. Several sounds were not recorded properly, so dead chickens were stabbed to replicate the sound of mutilated flesh and Campbell had to scream into a mic for several hours. After months of torture, the project was finished. So, is the film any good? Absolutely. It's a staple of modern horror. It's a clichéd script by now but it's executed perfectly. The movie knows what it is and it never tries to be anything else than what it needs to be. It's gory, silly and unapologetic. It has just the right amount of gore, horror, and black humor to be great. Campbell's great in the film, although he doesn't really shine as much in this as in Evil Dead II. But the film isn't about the acting. As a matter of fact, the script is minimal and so is the acting, but the movie's purpose is to be campy horror schlock and it succeeds in every way possible. Every jump scare is earned through tension. The gore is so ludicrous, it's great. I love the creative angles they used with the camera, as well as the use of fog. This is a perfect example of an extremely low budget movie executed to perfection. The Evil Dead isn't really that scary (at least to me) but it's so much fun and so much effort went into making it, I love it for that. The Evil Dead is one of my favorite films of all time and to end this review I want to quote critic James Berardinelli from his review of the film: ""The extreme nature of the gore isn't beside the point - it is the point. Raimi goes so far over the top in presenting these displays that they take on a campy, almost humorous appearance. It's impossible to take all this blood seriously. So, instead of being sickened, we're strangely amused - and this is all intentional.""10/10",The Evil Dead

234,Condemned-Soul,"A well-done, admirable, low-budget splatterfest",8,12 March 2021,"What Sam Raimi accomplishes on his directorial debut with a small budget is quite brilliant. He creates a good atmosphere from the outset, but it's what he does with the camera that's impressive: the close-ups, the Dutch angles, and, most memorably, those POV shots - the embodiment of unspeakable evil - that glide malevolently through the smoky woodland, lurking behind trees, and jump-scaring the characters, all while accompanied by eerie sound design; and that final shot is one of my favourites.This is the ultimate cabin in the woods horror film that starts out slowly before bursting into a nightmare of flesh-possessing, gory dismemberment mayhem, blood gushing everywhere, bodies cackling in demonic glee, and Ash, the hero, soaked in his friends' entrails. Great fun.8/10",The Evil Dead
235,TheFilmGuy1,A Brutal And Scary Cult Classic,7,10 January 2014,"The Evil Dead has become a cult classic since its release, and I totally understand why. It's a film that is chock full of blood, guts, and screams. Did I mention blood and guts? Its a low budget film, but this only adds to the film, in my opinion. The usage of practical effects is truly amazing and is something that I kind of wish would still be used today in some areas. There are also a lot of interesting shots such as the fast moving shots through the forest, which are fun to watch. Acting wise, it's not strong, but Bruce Campbell gives a fun performance. It's a must watch for horror fans, and for anyone who wants to have a good time and some fun scares.",The Evil Dead
236,JeffG.,Low-budget horror classic!,9,30 August 1999,"Despite the incredibly low budget of this movie (which shows in everything from the superimposed moon to the obviously fake blood and gore), this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Unlike most horror movies made back then, and now, this film is sprinkled with touches of dark humor. One of the things that sets the ""Evil Dead"" movies apart from most horror films is their unique combination of traditional horror fare with dark comedy. This is a film you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. One of my favorites! The other two films, ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army of Darkness"" are also well worth watching.",The Evil Dead
237,ScottAmundsen,"Whether You Find it Scary or Funny (or Both), You Won't Forget it Easily.",10,21 April 2012,"THE EVIL DEAD sits right up there with other horror films such as the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. But though all three of these films are horror films, they couldn't be more different in plan of attack or in effect. NOTLD, a real gross-out when it first came out, seems somewhat tame in the shadow of movies like the SAW series. And BLAIR is sort of in a class by itself; it does things that no one ever attempted, and is nearly always not only successful, but brilliant.Which brings us to THE EVIL DEAD, the feature film debuts of both director Sam Raimi and his favorite star Bruce Campbell.The first time I saw this film was at a New Year's Eve party (of all things); we had had a bit to drink and consequently the six or seven of us that watched the movie found it hilarious. And this is oddly enough a valid response, but uniquely, the opposite is true. Because some time later, being home alone for the evening and with nothing in particular to do, I took a second look, and this time the story drew me in and I had to watch the last forty minutes or so with the lights on.Made for less than $400,000.00, nearly eighty per cent of which appears to have gone into the visual effects, this is a film that has a strange and inexplicable power to it despite amateurish acting, an often terrible script, and variable special effects (mostly the result of poor editing, as in the obvious cut between the live actor in makeup and the model after the Book of the Dead has been thrown into the fire.They didn't spend money on originality either: the plot is so familiar it was trite when the film came out: five friends (college buddies?) head for a remote cabin in the woods; the exact location is never given but one suspects the Smokey Mountains as a passing reference is made in the car to having ""just crossed the Tennessee border."" Little time is wasted on setting the scene. There is a moment in the car when ""something"" wrenches the wheel from the driver's hands and they just miss a collision. Upon turning onto the dirt road leading to the cabin, the background music suddenly falls silent and all we hear is a rhythmic thumping. It turns out to be the porch swing banging against the side of the cabin although there is no breeze; the movement stops as soon as Ash (Campbell) locates the door key.Pretty soon they are seated around the dinner table, eating and getting pleasantly loaded, when all at once the trapdoor to the basement opens. Predictably enough, Scotty (Richard DeManincor billed as Hal Delrich) and Ash decide to explore. And they find something: An ancient Sumerian book of the dead and a tape recorder which, when they listen to it, speaks of evil spirits in the woods. The fact that the Sumerian civilization was located in the Middle East and therefore such spirits would hardly be likely to be found in the mountains of Tennessee is not even mentioned.Anyway. They play the tape, which has on it an incantation to wake the spirits. And they keep listening despite the pleas of Ashley's sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) to ""SHUT IT OFF!!!"" Then a tree limb crashes through a front window and the contents of Pandora's Box literally take over the rest of the movie.I don't need to go into detail except to say that the spirits pick the kids off one by one, possessing them and turning them into hideous monsters that look like a cross between Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST and Gary Conway in I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN.The rest of the movie is an utter bloodbath, complete with bodily dismemberment and other equally disgusting stuff. But there is a certain tongue-in-cheek humor about the proceedings as well, with an abundance of in-jokes and horror movie clichés like Cheryl going out (ALONE!!!!) to explore the woods (and you won't believe what happens to her out there!).I won't reveal any more. But whether you think the movie ridiculous or one of the scariest things you ever saw (or both depending on your mood), it remains an audacious debut both for Raimi and for Campbell; his acting here is still that of an amateur, but of the entire cast he was the one who broke into the mainstream, though the three women have remained active in films.I love this movie, and probably for reasons I would rather not know.",The Evil Dead
238,counterrevolutionary,I know that many intelligent people have praised this film. They are wrong.,2,28 January 2003,"Personally, I found the tension so unbearable that I could hardly stay awake.The more risible something is, the harder it is to parody. Imagine, for example, trying to parody PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.What Raimi is apparently trying to do here is to parody moronic and clichéd low-budget splatter flicks. Unfortunately, he has no idea how to accomplish that difficult task, so he just ends up making a *particularly* moronic and clichéd low-budget splatter flick.(At least, I *think* he's trying to send up the genre. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he simply lacks the imagination to do anything interesting.)On the other hand, Raimi is also trying to make a truly frightening movie. But the *sine qua non* of horror is that we must *believe*. Blood and guts are beside the point. For the duration of the movie, we must be made to believe that we are watching real people, and that what's happening to them could happen to us. That is the essence of any horror film.However, since Raimi intentionally (again, I *think*) used the sort of typical cardboard characters and ludicrous plot contrivances which show up in these exploitation gorefests, he lost any chance to make a genuinely frightening film either.Maybe I'm getting jaded in me old age, sonny, but I no longer find that films like this work (if you can call it that) even on a sheer grossout level. What's grotesque about red-colored corn syrup and cranberry juice? (Contrast THE EXORCIST, during which many viewers get physically ill at the sight of pea soup--because William Friedkin makes them *believe* that it is something else.)Even the widely-praised camera work is merely a sad cry for attention. It adds nothing to the film, while failing to mask the utter lack of anything worthwhile actually happening on the screen.",The Evil Dead

It's far simpler and less elaborate, not resorting to as many campy cheap thrills that those latter films resorted to.  Sorry, but I'm not into black humor, especially when it appears forced and contrived and silly.  If I want silly, I'll watch BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY.  This film has some of that, put it's played down and kept to a minimum.I'm sure everyone knows what this one's about by now.  Two dudes and three chicks go up to a cabin in Tennessee and find a book made out of human skin left behind by an anthropology professor, along with a tape recording of his last and final words.  The evil spirits then take over these guys and they start to kill each other off.  All except Bruce Campbell, that is...It all is pretty standard stuff until the last scene where Campbell throws the book into the fire and the corpses of his dead friends start to melt and decompose.  It reminds me a lot of the claymation Ray Harryhausen used to do with stop motion photography.  Looks like they spend a lot of time setting that one up.That scene looks pretty cool and imaginative, however I think there were far scarier 80s horror films out there, done by the likes of David Croneneberg, John Carpenter and Wes Craven, so I think this one's a bit overrated.  And nothing was more scarier at the time than the first TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. That one scared the living fu#k outta me.The Anchor Bay DVD uses a pristine print and has all kinds of extra goodies on it, including unused footage, stills and posters, pictures of theater marquees at some various premieres around the country, Raimi and crew on location, etc.Even though I think there are greater shockers out there, this one is still entertaining as hell.  7 out of 10.",The Evil Dead

But man, this film is by far the scariest I've ever seen. It's not just creepy or eerie, it's damn right horrifying. So two thumbs up for Sam Raimis horror master piece.Bruce Campbell as Ash is just awesome, and he's kinda the main source behind the appeal to these three films. After having seen some scenes from the third film, Amy of Darkness, I thought Ash would be some kind of handy action hero who isn't particularly scared by anything. Nope, he was pretty scared during the whole movie, and almost survived by pure luck, and some quick thinking. I guess he get's used to the demons in the sequels. Nevertheless I'm looking forward to the sequel.Now this movie was shot on an shockingly low budget, it's shows a little, but it still amazes you what these guys managed to do with almost nothing. The camera work is great, the make up is pretty good, and the effects are pretty decent. I don't know why, but sometimes low budget films are the scariest.Now if you're easily scared, I wouldn't recommend this film for you. if your squeamish, watch it with friends on a bright summer day, turn the volume slightly down, and turn on the subtitles (just in case). Then it shouldn't be so scary. I saw it alone, and it still freaks me out as I am writing this review. PS. it is not directly scary because of gore and such, there are some for sure, but it's the atmosphere that's scary.

247,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,The Right Colour of Blood,8,7 September 2013,"It's difficult to explain why this film is so entertaining more than 30 years after it's original release. I've seen the film before, know what happens next and it's got pretty average acting, but it's still a good film because of the intertwined level of horror and humour. When I first watched this film it was a full blown, shocking horror, but now, thirty years on, it's a complete comedic blast. Almost genius in a way.After watching hoards of horror movies recently I was half expecting TED to fall flat on its face in comparison, but if you've seen films like 'High Tension' and the way it veers off with idiotic plot holes and ridiculous twists at the end, you'll really appreciate the straightforward A-Z terror mapping of this film. It's essentially scares and survival of young adults getting more and more freaked out while looking for ways to get to grips with the situation and then survive, but all done in a ridiculously bombastic way.After victim no.1, Cheryl, is zombiefied and then superbly bundled down the cellar, the naive group have problems grasping what's going on. They're just kooky kids freaked out in the woods at night, witnessing very strange things.""I think there's something out there"" one of the girls says. You're not wrong there darling, and something very much down the cellar as well.As we all know, rule number one of any horror situation is lock all doors, board up all windows and do not go outside until morning. Well forget that...After Shelly gets singed in the open log fire, she utters ""Thank you. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't pulled me off those hot coals, burning my pretty flesh"", one of the films' laugh out loud moments. The first infected bitch, Cheryl, chained off down the cellar, lifts up the hatch on a regular basis so she can taunt the others for being so weak and scared - a true classic 10/10 horror/humour event, filled with malice and no shortage of cackles.And of course there's hero Ashley, getting smashed around the room for the umpteenth time, reeling around on the floor under yet more broken shelves and wardrobes, rallying to the rescue of his buddy, but instead just standing there watching Shelly gnaw off her own hand.The transformation of the girls, one by one, into unrecognisable zombies is a bit too quick. A few minutes, maybe ten, and they're fully transformed, but does it matter? After a nice bit of dismemberment the two guys are the last men standing, true to nature, the strongest surviving until last. When Ash finds himself alone, especially now that his own girlfriend is fully zombified, he FINALLY starts to react instead of just freaking out.And there you have it... Ash defends himself for a while, mysteriously not turning into a zombie like the others either, even though he's wounded, but slowly grasping the required 'dismemberment' logic. He doesn't quite fulfil the role of hero, but after bashing his girlfriend around with a giant telegraph pole and ultimately beheading her in a swishing spade-like manoeuvre, you've got to hand it to him for getting this far into the nightmare.The spurting colours and gunk and the rather nasty plasticine stop-motion effects at the end don't really enhance the film, and the effects are all a bit slap-dash and splattered around, but I still enjoyed them.I really wanted to give the film a '9', but I had more enjoyment writing these comments and re-living the past, laughing perhaps where I shouldn't, than actually getting scared by this film, so a point deducted for that.It sounds like an awful film in many respects and granted, it was a better film on its original release, but it's a worthwhile piece of cinema with extra amounts of gore and lots of entertainment check boxes properly ticked.",The Evil Dead

250,MattBirk,The Epitome of Cabin in the Woods Terror,9,2 August 2015,"Sam Raimi has created a cult classic that has stood the test of time, The Evil Dead is a horror classic. The first of the three in Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy, The Evil Dead is campy, silly, and all around a gruesome thrill ride worthy of its cult status. It's hard to not admire the film, you can clearly tell what Raimi was going for, the limited budget and inexperience definitely shows, but that only adds to the overall charm of the film. A group of unsuspecting 20 something-year-olds unleash an ancient evil and have to fend off the foe for the sake of their souls. As the movie moves along, the tone goes from being creepy to downright chaotic as the demons taunt and torment the remaining survivors. It's hard not to laugh at the silly antics of the possessed, as well as the campy dialogue coming from most characters. But like I said, all of those silly aspects of the film only adds to the overall effect of the film, which couldn't be any more entertaining. The movie may be too campy for most people's taste, this is a movie that must be seen by any true horror fan or anyone who has a taste for extremely low budget films.It isn't until the sequel Evil Dead 2, which was made 6 years later that our hero Ash truly takes form, but this sets the stage for that. The Evil Dead may be over the top, unrelenting, and silly, but the movie is never dull nor entertaining! This is one of the best horror movies of all time, bar none!",The Evil Dead
251,leoxatzian,"Phenomenal practical effects and make up, but no story to back it up.",4,7 March 2019,"While ""The evil dead"" pacts a ton of realistically mind blowing make up effects and has more than enough bloodshed to please zombie and demon enthusiasts, it has nothing to offer in terms of plot, character development or any kind of story structure in order to make the gore worth the attention it is getting, resulting in a mindless movie that is the definition of style over substance.",The Evil Dead
252,manchester_england2004,A masterpiece that lives up to its tag-line!,10,31 July 2009,"The tag-line for THE EVIL DEAD - the ultimate experience in grueling terror - is genuinely lived up to.Having seen the sequel, EVIL DEAD 2, before this one and laughing hard at its light-hearted intentionally comical nature, I was completely unprepared for what awaited me when I popped the video tape of THE EVIL DEAD into my VCR player all those years ago.There is an ongoing polarising debate about what makes a good horror movie - supernatural horror or gore. Sam Raimi sweeps away the false choice by taking both elements and elevating them to extreme proportions to bring an ultimate terrifying nightmare you will absolutely never forget.Sam Raimi took a budget that would seem tiny even by the standards of Hammer horror movies and produced a true horror masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of cinema like never before. Wearing its NC-17 rating like a badge of honour, it truly gives no quarter and takes no prisoners. It makes its sequels, EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS, look like Disney movies in comparison.THE EVIL DEAD is one of 74 entries on the DPP (now CPS) video nasties list and it's the best by far.The simple plot of five travellers taking a trip to the woods and unknowingly unleashing demons seems very formulaic these days. But I'm telling you the rip-offs and stealth remakes are merely swimming in the wake of this classic original.The small cast works wonders in this movie. These young people are easy to relate to. They are likable. They enjoy having fun. They like to tell jokes. They show love and affection for each other. As such, we feel for them when they are picked off one-by-one.The demons in this movie are also proper antagonists. They are not Hollywood villains who you can negotiate with or shoot with a machine gun if they annoy you too much. They are genuinely ugly, horrific, inexplicable abominations prepared resort to emotionally cruel subterfuge to achieve their evil objectives. You can bash them over the head a dozen times. You can shoot them in the face with a shotgun. You can even poke their eyes out. But they keep coming for you until you've literally chopped off their every limb.The special effects here are funded on microscopic budgets compared to Hollywood blockbusters. Yet there is no Hollywood movie I could name where you literally see demons decay bit-by-bit inside and outside for several minutes, bits of flesh shriveling up like screwed up paper, skulls exploding, blood emitting steam as it oozes out, demons biting their own hands off and faces pierced with shotgun shells like a dart piercing a dartboard.The camera work and sound effects allow Raimi to exploit to the fear of the unknown to the absolute maximum. You know there's a demon there, yet you can't see it. A simple effect of a camera mounted on top of a motorbike combined with excellent sound effects and jarring music chords literally, and I mean literally, scares the living daylights out of you the first time you see and hear it.The acting is superb as well.Bruce Campbell plays the role he was born to play as Ash Williams. He is not the stereotypical muscle-bound Hollywood or the James Bond-type hero with nerves of steel. He's an ordinary guy just as freaked out as the audience. He literally is overwhelmed at what is happening. He's watched his friends die. He's even had to kill his girlfriend to defend himself. He tries to avoid believing what he's seeing is true. He shakes like hell as he tries to barricade himself into the cabin. He can't hide forever. Sooner or later he has to face up the demons. When he does he accidentally becomes a hero - one who returns in two sequels.Ellen Sandweiss also delivers a highly underrated performance as Cheryl. The events that bestow her character are unlike anything seen in movies before this. You feel her fear, her anger, her disgust and shock from the ultimate violation. This is what proper horror is about.This is a dangerous movie to watch from a personal perspective because once you've seen it, you might never see other horror movies in the same light again. I mean that literally.Overall, THE EVIL DEAD is a true masterpiece of low-budget movie production. It's easily the best of the video nasties and a must-see for all fans of the genre.",The Evil Dead
253,KHayes666,Original,6,28 January 2008,"While this movie was never in the running for an academy award, it has touched two generations of fans now in the last 26 years. It was made by college kids as nothing more than a b-movie but it turned out to be one of the most original and gruesome movies in the last quarter century.Evil Dead is a tale about 5 college kids taking a vacation in a secluded cabin among the woods somewhere in Michigan. During their stay they stumble upon the centuries old Necronomicon, the book of the dead. (Not to be confused with the book of the dead from The Mummy) After stupidly reading from the book, the ancient evil the book possessed comes to life and begins attacking the 5 kids (including one scene where a woman is raped by a tree, yes you read that right) until they are either killed or posssessed. One by one they are dispatched by the one remaining survivor named Ash (Bruce Campbell) and by daylight the evil is gone....or so we thought.This movie took the possession concept from The Exorcist to a brand new level. This was supposed to be a b-movie orchestrated by college kids yet the special effects are AWESOME for 1981 and non-Hollywood standards. If you see this movie and not the next 2 in the series, its quite amusing to see Ash play the role of the wussy as upposed to the hero he'd become. If you look at the movie from the perspective of it was a low budget flick run by unknown actors, actresses, directors, etc you can truly appreciate its lasting effects on the world and the sequels spawned from it.The highlight of the movie is the end when Ash throws the Necronomicon into the fire and the remaining deadites (names for the possessed) melt, that's tremendous special effect work if I may say so. Definitely watchable 6 out of 10",The Evil Dead
254,IamROCKAS,Product of low budget but it has marking of directorial acumen,7,14 July 2020,"I'm not sure where to start with this movie. On one hand, it's unique and a wonder to behold but on the other hand, the acting is amateur. It horrified me, I'm not gonna lie, and the screeching laughter sticks in my head.The first person shots were eerie, the whole demon perspective was a really good touch for the movie. The moment where the first person shots of the evil forest are knocking down trees, coming for Cheryl, kept me in suspense since I didn't know what was coming at that moment and when Cheryl got tangled by the tree branches, it both terrified and disturbed me. In retrospect, that whole sequence was awesome and it's one of the better scenes of the movie.The first look at the possession was haunting. I didn't know what the hell has just happened and the change of the voice was disturbing, to say the least. The dead eyes are damn terrifying. Then Shelly got the same treatment. That whole segment was bizarre since Scottie barely reacts to the possessed Shelly and Ash stands just a few feet away with a poker face, just enjoying the view but the dismemberment of Shelly was satisfying and gory as hell. Then came Linda with the creepy laughter. It wasn't scary but the crazed laughter made me feel uneasy, so good job on that, movie.When Ash is left all alone, the movie got a bit of a psychedelic treatment - a pipe burst, spraying Ash with a ton of blood, blood begins to drip from outlets, from the walls, into the lightbulbs, which particularly looked awesome, even the projector starts playing on its own and we get a bloody projection. The camera angles even get wacky - either their upside down, the perspective is from the ceiling or they are closing in into Ash's face. The last thing I want to mention is the mirror scene - it was both unexpected and it looked awesome. The cinematography, for a low budget film, is of high quality and I appreciate what the crew managed to accomplish on a small budget.So far I said mostly positive things about the movie but overall, as much as it fascinated me, it was messy and the acting is the biggest culprit. The lack of expressions on the actors' faces just doesn't fit the situations they are in at times and when they do show their emotions, they look exaggerated to hell. Like how does everyone stay calm when Cheryl starts freaking out and a branch breaks a window or how do Ash and Scotty barely react to possessed Shelly?",The Evil Dead
255,Keyser Soze-12,I'm going to be REAL brief (more than I usually am),5,8 October 2000,"Normally, I would put some time into writting a review, but I'm too tired right now and I don't have much to say.I thought Evil Dead wasn't the cult classic that everyone makes it out to be.  I didn't think it was that bad, but not that good.  I thought it was a very clieched 70's horror movie.  Some of the special effects are very original (the blood filling the light bulb is genius)My only major problem is the scene were the girl is raped in the woods. Well, thet me put that a different way. Raped BY the woods.  It seems stupid, digusting, and unnessacery.  Really, I don't care how much you like horror movie, you MUST have found that a little didturbing.I've heard Evil Dead 2 and 3 are much better (Ive heard Evil Dead 3, Army of Darkness, is hilarious) so I'll have to see those as well.",The Evil Dead

Sure, the acting comes and goes in quality and yeah, that stop-motion animation is dated, but that's not what makes a horror movie. This has something you almost never find in our modern watered-down Hollywood horror trite these days. Pure, dark, terrifying atmosphere. It's dark, moody, and the action comes and goes with relentless pace. The quiet moments are so well done that you can FEEL the stress. The scene out in the woods... if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about... reminds us all of how the filmmakers came to the idea that submitting this movie to be rated (or raped) by the MPAA would've resulted, most likely, in an X rating. Not to mention, this movie is about the only competitor in horror film existence that might even be able to match, let alone compete, with the amount of gore dumped throughout, Peter Jackson's (Unrated, Uncut) Dead-Alive.

But On Screen Its One Crazy Nightmare. The Creepy Atmosphere, Sound design and incredible camera work set the tone early for this film and you are hooked. With a very charismatic lead in Bruce Campbell, you stay engaged till the end for his fate. The gore is just incredibly gross here and it was a big reason for this film's infamy. And surprisingly among all the carnage, there is some stupid humor too. Obviously there are flaws, the acting isnt that great, the makeup is kinda hilarious but considering they were literally scraping their way through,I'm gonna excuse that. Enjoyable Still today.",The Evil Dead
258,Det_McNulty,A Franticly Satirical and Endlessly Innovative Gorefest Which Launched A Thousand Ships,8,26 May 2007,"Infamous for a variety of reasons, The Evil Dead remains a landmark for cinema as a whole. In 1981 the film was banned, cut or had a delayed release in many countries as it was deemed both sadistic and gratuitously explicit. In the UK the film was originally released cut like in many other countries, yet when the film was due to hit video it was banned by the BBFC. It became notorious for being one of the first ""video nasties"" and it was not until 1990 that the film became ""unbanned"" by the BBFC. Fortunately, when released on DVD in 2001 all the cuts were waved, and since then the film has been widely available in its uncut and intended form. When viewed in the new era most of the film's material is fairly tame in comparison to the content of today's horror films.The premise of The Evil Dead is one which is so basic that it enabled Sam Raimi to create something so blissfully unique and absurd. The film kicks off with introducing five friends who are journeying to an isolated cabin. On arriving, they find a mysterious book (The Book of the Dead/Necronomicon) and a tape recording from a professor. Out of curiosity they decide to listen to the unsettling recording, which reads out an ancient curse. This results in ""the evil dead"" being released and wreaking possessive havoc on the innocent group of friends.Though The Evil Dead follows a simplistic story, and one which might even seem clichéd to viewers today, it was still a glaringly unique film for its time and has spawned influence across cinema. Arguably, the lack of a complex or even recognisable narrative structure acts as a way of making the film focus and succeed in all its other areas. Due to the lack of narrative, Sam Raimi is able to emphasise the ""exploitation"" side of the film and let his astonishing array of imagination flow through the picture. Some might dispute that The Evil Dead should not follow a story anyway, as it is a film whereby the aim is to depict survival through ""gruelling terror"".When you break-down The Evil Dead (analysing each area of the film); I find it hard to comprehend how anyone could refuse to respect the painstaking effort which went into achieving the best out of a tiny budget. The attention to detail in factors such as make-up, camera-work, animatronics, editing, lighting and atmosphere remains an astonishing achievement. Sam Raimi litters the film with B-movie flourish and classic horror references. This is a mark of respect for the films which helped to inspire many areas of The Evil Dead.The use of quick-cut editing focusing on tiny details is something which became extremely stylish in the sequel, yet not quite as raw. This is an example of how The Evil Dead is supposed to be scary at times. One of the film's most famous factors is the first-person camera shots of ""the evil"" rushing through the woods and around the key set-piece (the cabin). This has become a trademark style for the series; The Evil Dead is both amusing (yet this became much more apparent in the sequels, which ultimately became self-parodies) and fairly creepy. Yes, some moments may seem horribly corny and dated now, but it is something you should expect from such a film. My favourite aspect of the film is Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash, which although extremely cringe-worthy at times is indisputably bursting with panache and charm. Bruce Campbell established himself as a cult favourite due to the series, and rightly so. He honestly is one of the finest character-actors of all-time, a genius of physical comedy and an expert in the art of exaggeration. His acting talent is something which improved as his career progressed, but he is still widely recognised for being the lovable imbecile and protagonist of The Evil Dead.The Evil Dead kicked off a cult following and introduced what was to become one of the greatest trilogies of all-time. There is no denying the sheer fury and excitement The Evil Dead carries with each viewing. Ultimately, it is the low budget that enables the film to still pack an unnerving jolt of exhilaration.",The Evil Dead
259,RomanJamesHoffman,Gore-fest horror spectacular and archetypal Video Nasty.,8,30 March 2014,"The horror genre has always benefited from low-budget movies: in 1968 George A. Romero independently produced the seminal zombie flick ""Night of the Living Dead"" and in doing so invented the zombie apocalypse genre as well as marrying incisive sociological commentary to evisceration; and in 1978 John Carpenter reworked some of the tropes found in ""Black Christmas"" (1974) and effectively suburbanized horror in the consummate slasher movie ""Halloween"" (1978). Both were low-budget efforts done out of love and both immediately and irrevocably changed the way we think about horror. In a similar way, Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"", although not quite in the same league as the aforementioned films, nevertheless was born in similar low-budget circumstances and was able to transcend these financial limits with sheer creativity and craft. And in doing so, created such a furore upon its release and spawning such a robust legacy that it can rightly said to be considered a classic.However, having given such high praise, it remains to be said that the movie cuts an unusual figure among other ""classic"" horror movies (low-budget or otherwise) in being possessed of a definite self-awareness in its employment of horror clichés that have led some to consider the film a parody and not to be taken seriously - a kind of horror version of ""This is Spinal Tap"". Chief among these is, well, the whole plot: a group of young people head out to a remote cabin where they find an ancient book which they shouldn't read from but do and allow demons to come into this reality and wreck havoc. This kind of plot barely cut it back in the day, let alone these days (even though it was remade, quite well in my opinion, in 2013). And yet, despite an undeniable campy quality (with patchy-at-best acting augmenting the thinnest of plots), when it unleashes itself it can create a lurking sense of claustrophobic dread more penetrating than ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974), demons which pose a genuine threat in their sheer malevolence, gore that would make Lucio Fulci blush, and a very real sense of hopelessness.So, even though the film has its camp flourishes (like the ridiculous and equally horrifying ""Tree Rape"" scene) and knowing nods and what-not, it seems that the distanced self-awareness that ""The Evil dead"" demonstrates is the very thing that allows the film to venture into the realms of excess with its gore and nihilism that allow it to ultimately stand above the tropes and genre conventions it employs. As such, being so bleak and such a gore high watermark, it's no surprise that the movie wound up on the list of official Video Nasties drawn up in the 80s; a list designed to remove from circulation movies which were considered morally corrupting. To be honest, a lot of the movies on the list haven't aged well and one wonders what all the fuss is about, but with ""The Evil Dead"", while morally corrupting may be pushing it (especially given the depths of recent movies ""The Human Centipede"" (2009) and ""A Serbian Film"" (2011), it still retains its ability to creep you out, make you squirm, and damn well entertain you.",The Evil Dead

The creepy atmosphere with the eerie synthesizer music sets the tone and my friends were always at the edges of their seats during the movie. I would recommend this movie to anybody who is a horror fan, if not, it might not be the best choice but watch it anyway! The wonderful story of a group of friends who decide to get together at a cabin for the weekend who soon find out that they are not the only ones inhabiting the forests they are visiting. Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash is brilliant, this is just one of those movies that I can honestly say I'll never get sick of watching....ever.

Definitely something any true horror fan wished they were a part of, despite the horrible living conditions for the filmmakers at the time.It's a lot of quick pans, zooms, low budget look-what-I-can-do-type-special-effects, and yet, it is incredibly groundbreaking and crucial to the horror genre. You can't help but love to hate it, and hate to love it. The dubbing, editing, etc is so amateur, but it works so well because these people not only had talent, but Sam Raimi, who had VISION.NC-17 at the time, rated R for our time. Yes, the 2013 remake is WAY more intense, violent, and gory than this. But this, is STILL violent and worthy of its rating for its age. It's STILL gory, gruesome, and a milestone for horror gore effects. You gotta appreciate its value. And that says a lot for horror films, when so many tried to set the standards. THIS one, not only set the standards, but raised the bar for mainstream AND indie horror alike.If you consider yourself a horror buff, and have not yet seen this, you're a fraud.

Especially Saw, I just love that movie so much (and I'll have a review up soon for that.) Because both of these movies were made with a shoestring budget, yet they ended up changing horror as we know it.The Evil Dead is very disturbing, there are some scenes that make you feel so scared, this isn't just any normal horror movie, this shaped the genre for haunted house movies in the middle of nowhere made with a small budget. It proves you don't need to make a big horror blockbuster like Jaws in order to make an amazing horror flick!

269,Manthorpe,Marvelously putrid.,10,16 August 2004,"What more can be said of Raimi's legendary cult-classic that hasn't already been beaten to death like a puss-oozing zombie that crosses paths with Ash? Possibly nothing, but I'll try. Before Spiderman and before the countless spin-offs of this movie were made or even conceived, Raimi and friends decided to make a low budget zombie flick mainly for fun, and surprisingly it has become a masterpiece of shock and horror. Possibly a perfect example of how to make an entertaining film on a shoe-string budget, The Evil Dead delivers what it promises, the ultimate in grueling horror. Even with it's mild budget and sometimes shaky acting, TED shocks and spooks the audience through chilling atmosphere and some of the most violent effects ever put on film. Those who are squeamish need not apply. As a matter of fact, just run for your girly life.There are several reasons this film succeeds. First, Raimi's camera work is truly masterful. By using fast camera work and aggressive shots, Raimi has created an eerie world that is sometimes hard to look at but too entertaining to turn away from. His style from behind the camera is absolutely unmistakable. This is perfectly exemplified in the beginning of the film, where the camera alone creates enough atmosphere to leave you biting your nails in suspense of what's to come. You feel at any moment someone is going to get their neck chomped on by some zombie hiding just out of view. One of the most impressive openings I can think of, perfection in pacing and atmosphere. It gets even better once the action starts. Some shots hold for a seeming eternity, and part of you wishes for it to stop for it's unrestrained gore and violence...but the other part of you is getting a sick kick out of it. One of the most impressive shots is where the darkness from the trees begins to chase people, knocking any tree or obstacle down that happens to be in it's way. Truly magnificent technique, however they did it. TED also succeeds because it's self-aware of the fact that it's a simple zombie movie and never takes itself too seriously, and doesn't expect the audience to do so either. It's meant to be campy, cheesy, revolting and chilling at the same time. There are moments in the film where it seems to be making fun of itself and the genre in general. For this fact alone, one cannot hold certain things against it such as sometimes questionable acting from the supporting cast and sometimes the downright implausibility of certain situations. If you can accept this and you're not put off by mannequin ultra-violence, then you should find yourself on the supporter's side of the fence. I think some don't like it because it can be ridiculous and cheesy in parts, although it was meant to be. Even with the fact that it's sometimes cheesy, there are some downright chilling moments in this film that most horror films nowadays cannot begin to muster. Case in point, the zombie screaming from the cellar door. The zombie growls and howls themselves are enough to send shivers up one's spine. And let's not forget the unforgettable tree love scene, ridiculous and hilarious simultaneously.Last but certainly not least: Bruce Campbell as Ash, the badass of all zombie films. Campbell is Ash, period, and always will be.In my opinion, this is by far the best of the trilogy, and although there could have been more of the chainsaw, this is the definitive zombie film and probably always will be. I feel it succeeds over it's sequels due to it's increased violence and lack of humor in comparison. It's blood, gore, camera work, and shock factor are still formidable even today and are what make this such a cult classic. If you've ever liked any horror film, this is an absolute must-see.Love or hate it, there it is.",The Evil Dead

Me and my friend went to see it because we had nothing better to do, and we were pleasantly entertained. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid, so it was like watching it for the first time.  This movie was excellent on the big screen.  The gore is delightful. Everyone in the theater had a blast laughing at some of the cheesy dialogue. It was one of those rare movies that manage to be both THE BEST and THE WORST movies of all time.

It definitely had lots of creepy moments and funny moments.But from an old gits perspective I was actually a little bored watching this. I suppose when it was first released this movie would have been cutting edge and the ultimate horror flick. But I got that bored feeling in my stomach that I get when I'm reading a really boring book that I can't wait to finish so I can start the next one. It was all so repetitive. One demon possessed person attacks and then another and then another and then another. there was nothing new here and it's all been done before.The acting was okay but a bit hammy and the special effects ( although probably brilliant in 1981) showed their age.I'm giving it a 6/10 but my teenage self would have given it much more.",The Evil Dead

273,crickwill,Join us,8,12 June 2020,"What a pleasure it is to revisit Raimi's classic time and time again and never tire of it. Hard to believe 39 years has passed since The Evil Dead splattered it's way onto our screens and into our existence but this fact only reinforces it's tenure now as a modern 'classic' of horror cinema, even though it was ahead of its time back in 1981. It cost supposedly $50K to make and yet what they achieved with that paltry sum is indeed astonishing.They, for the most part didn't put a foot wrong. From the swirling fog and mist, to Cheryl's leafy assault and pursuit amongst the undergrowth, Linda's hilarious demise, the surreal excursion into the basement and of course the landmark final tracking shot - a movie of this flaming originality and departure only comes along perhaps once a decade. The Evil Dead stood in for the 80's, Blair Witch for the 90's and after that, I can't really think of the next entry ( there has been admittedly kind of a drought for awhile). Like your worst dream as a ten year old, The Evil Dead resurrects itself in real time as the everloving fun-house nightmare you cannot escape.",The Evil Dead

275,lale-ba,Directing foundations,5,4 April 2017,"Sam Raimi's franchise about the dead coming back to life went almost side by side with Romero's Living dead"" story and the parallels are unavoidable. The Evil dead"" will tackle the same situation horror layout, with young people being trapped inside the lonesome cabin in the woods, but with some weaker plots and action sequences. However, Raimi will compensate the hollow script with his directing talent and trademark fast moving camera to create the tension and horror. As for the Romero, effects are really outdated, but also more gorish. Also, a whole new B-production star will be born with Bruce Campbell taking the male lead. The Evil dead"" is one the flicks that made zombie trash horror genre.",The Evil Dead

However I hate this movie, it is dull, cheesy and boring as i have wrote in the summary, I had very little to smile about during this film and i know people are going to disagree with me but it's true that I hate this film. I am a fan of EVIL DEAD 2 & ARMY OF DARKNESS and the remake EVIL DEAD but i hate this film.This film starred: Bruce Campbell and was directed by Sam Raimi.The story is 5 friends go to a cabin in the woods where they find a book in the ellar (the book of the dead) when listening to a passage from the book through a cassette it summons the demons to create havoc for the people inside the cabin and wants them to join the demons.*/***** Very poor",The Evil Dead

278,neon47,Eeeeviiil.....!,10,6 June 2005,"Please realize that I'm not trying to look down on this movie. It's a good movie, but it lacks a plot. That was my only real dilemma with this movie. The only thing that happens is the group listens to a tape that awakens the dead, then the forest (yes the forest) captures a girl and everything goes from bad to worse from there. But when it comes to horror movies Evil Dead shines as an original because it uses the ""Deadites"" a type of evil dead zombie that's actually kinda smart. The Deadites are obsessed with eating souls. I have to say that I was surprised at the amount of gore used in this, but that's probably because I saw AoD first. Out of the three movies (Evil Dead, ED2:Dead by Dawn, AoD) this one has the most ""no non-sense"" feel to it, it has a much deeper fixation on horror than the other two which mixed comedy elements into them. Horror fans are sure to get a kick out of this as it is a really great horror movie (it's a really great horror series).

280,nathanjamesemerson,THE EVIL DEAD - The best horror movie ever made,10,23 September 2018,"THE EVIL DEAD to me, is the best horror movie ever made. I still remember shivering and getting out of my mind when I snuck the VCR of this into the player while my parents slept back in the 80's.As of today, this is still the best horror movie I have ever seen. EVen though the film was low budget, it still managed to bring the scares and a bucketload (and more) of gore to the film.The first of a trilogy, it is this film which is strictly horror in every sense of the word. The comedy you may see in it now, was not intentional. Bruce Campbell is an absolute legend and this was one of his earliest films. WITHIN THE WOODS was the precusor to THE EVIL DEAD, and that is a brilliant nasty little film in its own right.If you are only familiar with EVIL DEAD 2, ARMY OF DARKNESS or ASH VS EVIL DEAD, then you need to do yourself a favor and watch the original film which started it all. It may start off slow, but when it gets to the horror, it does not stop. And it is not relenting. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. It is a solid 10/10 from me",The Evil Dead
281,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,Horror at it's finest,7,23 April 2013,"I first heard of the Evil Dad franchise when I was a kid (9, 10 years old). I dared not to come any closer to it because, let's face it, this is not a movie for children. Time passed, I grew older, and at one point, after Hollywood hadn't made a decent horror movie in a decade I saw something that scared the Hell out of me - The Evil Dead remake trailer. I said to myself, now is the time (I'm 21 now) to see what this franchise is made of. I rented the movie today with really high expectations due to the knowledge how it is a cult classic, a masterpiece in horror and a revolutionary vision in horror movies. Are all of these elements true?1) The atmosphere. At first viewing I was disturbed by the gory images, the utmost violence and bloodshed this movie threw at me. Only after a few hours of contemplating had I realized that The Evil Dead made me more scarred and shocked than any other horror movie in a decade. The basic scare is not the CGI or insane killers, or sic traps, but the fact that there is no knowledge of what is happening, how to fight it, or how to escape it. Fear is elemental. The claustrophobic, colorless, dark atmosphere with no tension relief and panic that simply doesn't stop, awakes a feeling of terror like I have never felt while watching a movie. Even though the movie is relatively short, the final 20 minutes pass without a word spoken, with marvelous camera-work that held me on the edge of my seat. I just knew something was going to happen, and the expectation tore my nerves apart.2) The acting. As basically every cult classic only one person stands out. Bruce Campbell is good. He is actually the only one that actually tried to do something with his character more than be a screaming freaked-out teen. He is the prototype of a horror movie hero.3) The story. Actually, nothing to say here. There is nothing specific or memorable about it. One could define the story in a sentence but that's not the point. The point is that the lack of a story is what makes the movie so terrifying. As I said before, there is no knowledge of what is going on - ignorance it the basis of fear here. Questions are raised but not answered, questions that really need answers in order to give one a peace of mind, but this is Evil Dead. There is no peace of mind. But, a lack of a story could be seen as a big flaw. There are some segments of the film that could have been explored a bit further in order to gain a multi layered structure of the characters and the storyline.4) The music. Perfect timing, perfect atonal horrific sounds, and a great main theme.All in all, The Evil Dead redefined how horror movies were made. It redefined how people saw horror movies and it will definitely change views on horror movies for generations to come. This is not the Godfather of horror movies, and do not expect something like that, but it comes really close.",The Evil Dead

286,LagerLagerLagerShouting,So Much Better Than Spiderman.,8,29 April 2008,"The Evil Dead one of the best horror films ever made and another great example of how to make maximum impact on minimum budget. Plot and plausibility go out the window in favour of an atmospheric, disturbingly-amusing gore flick that doesn't shy away from anything and it made a cult icon of Bruce Campbell, who is great as Ash. What perhaps sets it apart is the brilliant way it was made, showcasing Raimi's talent for crazy visuals and frenetic camera-work and he also knows how to make effects. He definitely should have stuck to making virtuoso, inventive flicks like this rather than doing the flat, unconvincing Spiderman trilogy.I can't believe the liberals labelled this film as 'The Number One Nasty' in the U.K. Video Nasties uproar in the 1980's. Not only does this seem amusing by today's standards but couldn't those goddamn backbenchers with PC values and a stiff-upper-lip appreciate a work of art rather than just judge a book by its cover. They didn't even see the thing for Christ's sake! The Evil Dead will always be at the top of the horror canon.

287,DorianWynHowells,I didn't connect with this film.,6,23 January 2002,"For some strange reason, this film didnt really do anything for me. That's kinda sad, 'cause I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I had read some great reviews, and word of mouth among mates was good, and I know it's become a hell of a cult classic, so why didn't I like it?The simple fact is - I just didn't care about the main characters. I didn't CONNECT with any of them. I know it was an independant film, and on that basis it deserves a 10 for special effects and make up and so on, but if I am to judge the film as whole, then it hits just over average. I firmly belive that the main factor that NEEDS to work in a film if it is to succeed, is to have the audience relate to or care about the characters in the film. This, to me, fails to do so, and I was left wanting a few of them to die!!The story was good, with some intelligence, and the acting was deliberately OTT - Bruce Campbell is the king of Ham acting!! So I didn't mind these small trivial facts, I took it for what it was. I enjoyed it, but maybe it was hyped up too much?There were some genuine frights as well, I have to admit. The 'tree rape sequence' was, for me, slightly disturbing, but I had been warned that I could either view it that way, or just laugh, I'm glad I didn't react the latter way.All in all, this is an average horror film. It's not amazing and it's not trite.You need to watch this film so you can say that you HAVE seen it, but don't expect much, go in with an open mind and just take it for what it is - a B movie spoof. Which, if you put it that way, is kinda interesting...6/10Enjoy!",The Evil Dead
288,NicolasCostoglou,"You will laugh, you will scream...",10,28 March 2017,"The Evil Dead is one of the most interesting and unique Horror movies ever. It spawned the career of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and a whole franchise that followed it's huge success.It was made on almost no budget and simply self made inside a real abandonment cabin in the woods. The gore and make up is self made, they had no stunt people for the action scenes and no money for better equipment, but hell it works incredibly well!It's astonishing how good this movie is, for some reason, even though you see that it's a low-budget student film, you never once feel like ""Oh man, these are just some kids playing zombie in their cellar"", instead you are invested the whole way through.One of the reasons for this are the actors, who had little to no experience and aren't written as stereotypes, instead they just feel like real people who are in a bad situation. The best part of this is by far Bruce Campbell who has the most real reactions to the weird things which are happening.The best example of this is a scene which surprised and positively floored me: The scene when Ash knocks out his girlfriend Linda and ties her in one of Sam Raimis trademark montages to a table and starts a chainsaw to cut her in pieces. Me knowing just a few of the one- liners and the image of Ash from the sequels thinks ""Okay now it 's gonna get bloody as hell."" But instead, Ash just stops the chainsaw and breaks down because he can't kill his girlfriend, who he loves so much.It's one of my favourite scenes ever, and it's done very well. And this is what i like the most about this movie, the realness and the heart of it, together with the insane amount of creativity and work that's clearly put into it.I also have to praise the camera-work of this movie, it's so insanely creative and effective, together with the fitting editing, and most of the best scenes in the film are because of these two aspects.And also, something almost no one talks about while discussing this gem, the soundtrack is fantastic. It fits perfectly at the right places and has some memorable themes. As i watched the movie with a Friend a few weeks ago, he always had a emotional reaction to the love theme of Ash and Linda, and ""awwww""-ed every time he heard it and remembered what's at stake for the protagonist.All in all, i didn't expected such a weird but fairly adult, scary and ALSO funny at times, horror film, and hell yeah i love it to death...",The Evil Dead

There was a certain scene that really dragged on and I'm not sure wether to sit there in silence or laugh at how awkward it was. The scene that has the stop motion is very cool.

290,ColeSear,Best Gore Film Ever? (Spoilers),10,14 August 2002,"If there was ever a horror film in the gore sub-genre that went for the throat and just wouldn't quit it is unquestionably Evil Dead. This is a film with such pulverizing scenes of blood-letting and death that there's no time to be concerned with much else it just draws you in and you become absolutely enthralled. 	At the beginning we see just enough of these characters to differentiate amongst them. They are sketched out just enough such that we don't hat them for their out and out stupidity, which they never really display, and so that their deaths aren't a relief but sometimes it does come as a pleasant shock. The use of the subjective camera to represent the spirits made this film and absolutely did wonders to add to the atmosphere. The relentless speed and the bowling over of trees on the part of these spirits who never really manifested themselves in their true form made the film what it is. Of course one cannot talk about the cinematography without discussing the score of this film for without it these would have just been cute camera moves. Instead the spirits had their own theme song a tenebrous, loud yet low-pitched thump that struck fear into my heart every time I heard it. 	Another way the film Evil Dead is interesting is that it takes some precepts of film and the horror genre in general and uses them masterfully. First, is the Book of the Dead which may also be known as the Necronomicon which may or may not be a factual text but the point being they implemented it to unleash unknown powers on these characters and it was done tremendously well. The book of the dead is undoubtedly a piece of work that has been sparingly used but here it is a perfect fit and shows these people have at least working knowledge of the works of Lovecraft. In Lovecraft's fiction man's desire to know what they had absolutely no hope of understanding always lead to his downfall a similar parallel can be drawn to this film. Secondly, this film mastered the use of the subjective camera as the villain which was initiated with It's Alive! And made famous by Jaws, after Evil Dead it would be foolishness for someone to try and rely so heavily on it because it just wouldn't work as well. Third, there is the great use of possession in this film which is no doubt inspired by The Exorcist and comes close to reproducing an equally effective result along that line. 	Some audiences may look back on this film which is now 20 years old and think it looks dated but they can't argue with the fact that it works. I happen to think that the special effects are great especially for when they are made. Claymation or Stop-Motion Animation is a great technique and truly a lost art. Granted it is very difficult to film but the results are great especially with Evil Dead because the clay and whatever other materials they chose to throw in their alongside the oatmeal just added the extra grotesque touch the film need. I think it was just wonderful! 	There is a great debate between people who are proponents of Night of the Living Dead and Evil Dead. I think all the arguing is futile. Both of these films are their own unique kind of beast and they're both beautiful in their own way. Enjoy both these films for what they are and the debate should end and everyone busting a vein trying to win the argument should just shut up.",The Evil Dead

Let alone, theses poor teenagers are constantly suffering inside a cabin with no help or anything. The demons play around with them like puppets. Thank god Sam Raimi created the character Ash to bring down some hell!! It's really surprising how they got away showing this in theaters especially, the infamous scene in the woods that everybody remembers. As for the make up, how incredible the demons looked for a budget that was about $350,000. Blood coming out of their mouths, big white pearl eyes, with insane body decay, screaming and laughing... ahh I LOVE IT!!!Now theses are the demons that belong in Evil Dead!, the remake of Evil Dead seem to fail at that.

294,andrewnmiller,A landmark for horror movies.,10,16 July 2017,"Now, I'm not the biggest fan of horror movies, so when I sat down to view the first Evil Dead movie, I didn't know if I would even like a film about scary things in the woods, demon possession and a B-list actor, but much like a lot of movies I've watched, Evil Dead totally surprised me with it's use of atmosphere, horror, music and of course Bruce Campbell. After viewing this, it's become one of my favorite horror films period.The film starts with five collage students heading to a remote cabin in rural Tennessee for a vacation. While there, one of the kids hears a feeble satanic voice calling her to join them then her hand becomes controlled and she draws a book with an evil face on it but isn't sure what to do about it, so she doesn't mention it to any of the others. Later on, the door to the cellar strangely opens, compelling two of the kids to venture down and examine it, while down there, they find a Sumerian chronicle of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. While listening to a tape recorder that was found with the book, the voice of the archaeologist a cycle of chants that awaken a strange devilish creature that possesses one of the students. Now it's up to a remaining students to battle the entity while trying to not get possessed themselves and keeping their sanity.Sam Raimi was able to take a budget of 350,000 dollars that would seem small compared to the Hammer horror movies and has given us a truly great horror film that wears it's rating like a token of integrity and shows no mercy or takes no hostages. Evil Dead is still a film that is able to hold it's own despite the film being branded a ""video nasty"" over in the UK due to the overabundance of gore and blood, and yet one can't disagree how much influence Evil Dead had on the horror film genre, and while it's not difficult to view things in the movie like trailing shots, the extreme amounts of carnage and the house in the forest location and call it noticeable and quintessential, it's easy to overlook that all of these clichés that have become so associated with horror films over the last few decades arose because of this movie and while that's not to say that the movie isn't silly or over-the-top because it certainly shows that, it's equally amazing when you are aware of the confines the movie was filmed under.Sam's camera work here is nothing short of perfect. By means of rapid camera work and forceful shots, he made a creepy world which is difficult to stare at but too thrilling to not glace at and his way of filming is distinctive which is apparent in the opening scene where the camera produces so much ambiance to make the viewer start nibbling their nails in anxiety of what will happen next. It's one of the best opening shots in film history and dripping with atmosphere. Another incredible shot is when the shadows from the trees begin to pursue the characters and are hitting everything in their path, truly one of the best sequences in any horror movie.Even with it's small price tag, the movie is astonishingly polished on a technological stage, and while the visual effects do come across as outdated and ridiculous, they were made on the cheap when set side by side with modern blockbusters and yet I haven't seen any major Hollywood movie where demons fall apart both externally and internally, bits of body tissue drying up, skulls blowing up, blood spewing everywhere, demons gnawing their hands off and faces rattled with shotgun ammo like darts on a dartboard. The film also works because of it's own self-awareness of that fact that it's a low-budget zombie picture, and yet doesn't take itself very seriously and doesn't think the viewer should either. The film is supposed to be a little on the campy and cheesy side and yet scary and haunting at the same time and there are times in the movie is poking fun at itself and the horror genre too.Of course, a great horror movies are nothing without great characters and the actors who bring them to life and Evil Dead has the best of both. Ellen Sandwess might be dull-looking but she still does well in the part particularly when she gets taken over by a demon. Hal Delrich, Betsy Baker, and Sarah York all play their parts well, but the reason to watch this movie is for Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams. Bruce was born to play this role and he isn't played up as the clichéd Hollywood strong man or the James Bond type hero, but rather playing a regular man who is just as scared as the viewer at what's going on around him. His performance in this movie is what has made him such a hero amongst the cult movie crowd. Bruce portrays the character of Ash with such a comedic brilliance and yet is incredibly benevolent, rather than the toughed bad-ass that we see him become in the second and third movies, while oozing swagger and charisma with unquestionable bravado. His growth as a character is also well done here where Ash starts out as a timid coward and as the film moves along, he becomes a shotgun-holding demon killer by the end. Simply put, Bruce Campbell will always be Ash, no questions asked.Honestly, there really isn't much else I can add to what has already been said about The Evil Dead. It's a timeless horror classic that broke a lot of new ground for the genre which continues to be felt to this day, so if you haven't already seen this, then go out and watch it, you won't regret it!",The Evil Dead
295,Asentiff2004,Necronomicon Ex Mortus,7,26 January 2014,"Five friends head to an isolated cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly discover a book that releases evil demons that possess the living. Who, if anyone can survive the night or the evil dead?A cult classic within the horror genre, this brutal, grotesque and raw film is a must see for any fans of the genre. A classic film that has inspired many other horror directors of the genre and gone on to inspire two sequels and a remake. The acting is not the best and in fact is a bit mediocre, though this film did make Bruce Campbell a star and one of Sam Raimi's favorite cast able actors. The pacing is wonderful, the camera work as well, the acting and dialog though can be considered cheesy in some aspects but it is still decent film. One must understand that this film though many consider a B-film was and in fact an extremely terrifying film for first time viewers. Some may consider it cheesy now compared to the effects ridden horror films of the present, but to this viewer, I personally find this to be an enjoyable horrifying film. The effects all practical add to the grotesque realism. Though while the film starts slow it eventually build up steam to an almost unbearable breaking point of horror. The original Evil Dead is a must see for anyone who considers themselves a true horror film aficionado. Though not for the faint of heart whatsoever.",The Evil Dead

297,FilmFreak94,A Brilliantly Made Gore-Fest,9,27 November 2013,"The Evil Dead follows five college students driving out to a secluded cabin in an even more secluded forest. At first the five young adults have a fun time with one another until they explore the cellar in the cabin and find the Necronomicon Ex- Mortis, The Book of the Dead. They play a tape recording of the previous tenant of the cabin, Professor Knowby, who recites the incantation described in the book to unleash ancient Candarian demons from their slumber. Afterwards strange things begin to happen around them until a dark force begins to possess them one by one. Will any of them survive the night?When I first saw The Evil Dead I liked it but didn't really give it much thought afterwards. However upon reevaluation and thinking of just how much work went into making it I've come to really appreciate it for its natural horror and have recognized it as one of my favorite horror films. The brilliant use of natural effects like fake blood, stop motion, realistic props really blend together masterfully and make this a truly disturbing experience. The cast deserves major recognition for their work. Of course the one everyone remembers is Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams who in this movie isn't the snarky, one-liner spouting walking bag of awesome he becomes in the later movies but is still a great character here as he has to gain courage through the night and take charge against the Deadites that are trying their hardest to kill him. Another stand out cast member is Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl, Ash's sister, who at first is the common scared girl we see in most horror films. But when she becomes possessed she turns into an entirely different character. She threatens them all in a dark booming voice and spouts a few lines that are almost comedic in a dark way. It's a chilling performance and without it the movie wouldn't be half as effective.The rest of the cast do a great job too. Betsy Baker plays Linda, Ash's girlfriend, who really shines as a Deadite. Her creepy smile combined with the brilliant makeup make her one of the scariest looking characters in any horror film. And then we have Richard DeManicor as Scotty and Theresa Tilly as his girlfriend Shelly, who were both credited with different names as the Screen Actors Guild wouldn't allow them to star in such a film as this. What's interesting is that Scotty is set up to be the hero for the first half of the film but by the halfway point we switch perspectives to Ash who is forced to watch all his friends suffer and die one by one. Where this movie shines is in its effects. This movie was made on a very little budget by people with little to no experience filming professionally and yet they managed to pull it off exceedingly well. From the cuts and bruises the characters endure to the demonically possessed students almost nothing in this film looks fake. Although there are some noticeable instances where an obvious dummy was used and the stop motion might be considered dated by this time but still in a time where CGI was barely used if at all it's amazing to see this kind of practicality in a movie made by a bunch of college kids. The Evil Dead series gets progressively campier as each film goes on but make no mistake, this film is straight up horror. There are a few unintentional humorous moments to be found in the dialog or a few visual gags here and there but if you're expecting the same kind of humor as its sequels you certainly won't find it here. And what's great about the horror in this movie is it's constantly building you up. You know something is going to happen. You know the movie is just biding its time leading up to the next scare and just when you think you know something is going to happen it doesn't, only to happen about a second later when you've let your guard down. There's a real atmosphere to the cabin and surrounding woods and you feel just as trapped and paranoid as Ash does.The film lives on a diet of blood and gore so if you've got a weak constitution for that kind of stuff you may want to think twice before seeing this film. The standout scene that really scared me though comes in the first half hour where Cheryl goes to investigate mysterious voices coming from the woods and starts getting attacked by tree branches that proceed to rip her clothes to shreds, spread her legs apart and for the coup de grace a tree branch launches in between her legs. This happens for a good 2 to 3 minutes and you're forced to watch the entire thing play out. She manages to escape sure but it's still a terrifying scene and probably the only one that really disturbed me afterwards. However as I said there is a lot to appreciate in terms of how this movie was crafted. This is the first theatrically released film of Sam Raimi, who would later go on to direct the Spider-Man Trilogy and the recently released Oz: The Great and Powerful. And after seeing this movie and looking back on those I can see just how much Evil Dead still influences his style. All in all The Evil Dead is a classic horror film that will leave you guessing what's going to happen every minute. It may start out slow but once it gets going with the horror it doesn't stop until the credits roll. It's a great movie for horror enthusiasts, aspiring filmmakers, and anyone else looking for a good old fashioned gore flick. I definitely recommend it.",The Evil Dead
298,inxsfett,"""An horror masterpiece""",9,2 January 2014,"I remember when in the ending of the 70's the horror-terror movies was at its highest point movies like Halloween,Friday the 13th,Blue Sunshine,The Dawn of the Dead,The Omen II,Jaws 2,Phantasm, Alien,The Brood and many many more shine in the screen.Evil Dead,like a lot of this movies,showed that you not need a lot of millions to make people scream in the theaters (The movie cost $375.000)that's why the movie works great because the director and the crew used all their imagination to make a Really scare movie with a some gore.The Plot is like this:5 friends come to a abandoned cabin to spend some days there when one of them find a book and a recorder and play the recorder the evil entity try to possess every one of the 5.The big accomplished of the movie are that even that was make it why little budget you never feel it that the movie was cheap or bad make it and other big thing is you really scare because the movie focus in the cabin not the characters and that work very well.It's a shame that don't make movies like this anymore but if you really really want's to scare see it and enjoy (I recommended to see it later of 10 of night).",The Evil Dead
299,hikerhetav,"A terrible, terrible, terrible slasher!",4,12 August 2016,"Sam Raimi, for what he became a famous director but I don't get any clue of why he got so much fame for actually directing a stupid horror movie. Yes, The Evil Dead is a plain slasher and in the name of horror it is being praised a wrong word. You might get some hint of horror-pass plot line but isn't actually. In fact, from the very first half an hour, stupid points of haunting elements are depicted which nowhere takes a spectator to feel a real charm of horror. It's just straightforward, rubbish extraction of big horror names. Gibberish! Story has nothing much to offer. Direction is wasted. Characters are way gibberish. Their acting is nowhere near to make a smooth flow of movie. Only Bruce Campbell was up to the mark for which the movie can be taken to the last scene and get a bite of satisfaction. Cinematography is alright for what thrilling scenes have to offer. And it was an icing on no ice-cream for keeping it short to less than 90 minutes. Though Sam Raimi improved a lot and made few other smarter movies, I guess but this is definitely not his gem. This was a pure insult to horror genre.",The Evil Dead

Being a horror movie buff i would hve to recommend tis film. I enjoy it very much. Most people i have seen this movie with jump at he height of a horrifying moment. To most people i saw this with hey told me that evil dead and texas chainsaw massacre were he two scariest movie ive shown them. Ill have to agree. Not only am i into horror movies but i love to hike in the mountains and woods and stay he night in  cabin. I think that is what freaks me out evn more about this film. Sam Raimi has made spider man which is critically acclaimed an so forth but i like his horror movie work a whole lot better. Evil Dead and The Gift were two of my favorites from him. Above all i recommend this film but dont be goin to any cabins anytime soon.,The Evil Dead

304,mrrockey,Amateur Filmmaking at its Finest,8,15 August 2013,"The Evil Dead is amateur filmmaking at its finest. It was directed by an amateur filmmaker at the time, Sam Raimi and had a budget of only $375,000. So we have a director who has basically no training whatsoever and only made amateur short films prior to this, a budget of only $375,000, and a cast of actors who were just friends of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and had no acting experience prior hand. This should have been a recipe for disaster but instead we got a fun, original, atmospheric, well-shot, and spooky horror film that proves once again that small budgets can still make great films. But why is that? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. This film tells a very simple story about a group of college friends who decide to stay in a cabin together for a few days but end up encountering all sorts of demons when they open up the Book of the Dead. It all sounds very basic and simple but it works because unlike most movies, the story isn't really the meat of this movie. Most movies would have the story continually develop the characters but here, the story is just used as a setup for all the scenarios this movie throws at us. So in a nutshell, the story isn't especially deep and complex but it's not a problem because this movie really isn't about the characters, it's about the horror and that's what this movie delivers.This movie's horror is very effective because of the way it's shot. Sam Raimi uses a lot of POV shots for the demons in this movie and it makes the forest seem really creepy because you can tell there's something out there but you don't see it, your imagination fills in the blanks for you and it makes it way scarier than if they just had some sort of optical printer effect or an animatronic because you picture whatever scares you to be in the forest. So the fact that this movie had a baby-size budget actually made it better because it allowed Raimi to think of more creative ways to create chills rather than just throwing in some cheap special effect. Kinda like Spielberg did with Jaws.While the film is a horror film, it still has a campy feel to it which makes it more fun than if they played it completely straight. The demons are very over-the-top here with all their manic laughs and depraved faces but it makes you feel like a kid again watching this movie and that's always a good thing.The sound design is also quite good in this movie. It creates an eerie mood with the strong wind blowing outside and the quietness in the cabin, it's really spooky! This makes for a good movie to watch late at night, all alone in your room in the dark, with no sound other than the movie. That's probably the best way to watch it.The special effects here are actually pretty well done for such a small budget. They look cheesy but that's what makes it fun. It's okay to be a little cheesy sometimes and this is one of those times.So this film is actually quite good in terms of its direction, camera- work and other technicals but it is flawed in some areas. The makeup on Betsy Baker looks a little cheap compared to the other makeup effects in this movie. Bruce Campbell's acting is a little hokey at times but it's expected for a first-time actor like him and it doesn't ruin the film. And the girls here aren't well defined enough for me to differentiate them. Towards the end of the movie, I had no idea which demon was which girl but it really doesn't matter because once again, this film isn't really about the characters, it's about the scares.This film is also not for everyone. Not everybody will enjoy its campy tone, over-the-top style, and excessive gore but if you are in the mood for a good spook show then this movie is for you. I'm gonna give it a 8/10.",The Evil Dead
305,Amityville15,The first and worst...,5,12 July 2014,"5 friends travel up to a cabin in the middle in a deserted wood as they explore the basement, they find some things like a shotgun, a tape recorder and the book of the dead, when they play the tape recorder the accidentally listen to a spell that releases demons that eat the flesh and possess innocent people and tell them to join them and get them to kill their own.This film starred: Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss & Betsy Baker.The Evil Dead is the first from a trilogy and also has a remake that was released last year and out of the 4 films this is by far the worst one, it has some of the worst graphics ever known to man, people say this was made in 1982 and had a low-budget and I respect that but Jesus surely they can't be that bad, they must of had a budget of £5 just to buy the play dough that was used to make the demons when they start to corrode. Although I don't like this film I do recommend it as it has some god sequels and you don't just dive into the sequels without watching the original.**/***** Poor.",The Evil Dead
306,Zod-2,lower expectations make for greater enjoyment,7,28 September 2003,"With 365 other reviews at the time of this writing I find it hard to believe that I have anything new to add but here goes.No movie is ever going to be liked by everybody but I think the fact that The Evil Dead gets so much positive hype from its fans that fewer people in the future will enjoy it.  Hype brings with it a twisted like/hate ratio.  A movie with lots of positive hype will receive fewer positive critiques from future viewers and vice versa, negative will bring more positive critiques.With that said I admire what The Evil Dead brings to horror.  When I first watched this movie as a teen it and it's sequel scared the hell out of me. It didn't help that I watched it in my basement alone but that's part of the fun of horror movies.  I watched The Evil Dead again last night and it still packed a punch for me.  Of course not nearly as much as it did 15 years ago but I still found it enjoyable.The Evil Dead is an uneven movie but that is to be expected being made on such a meager budget.  But it does have enough suspense, shocks and creepiness to it that The Evil Dead can actually claim to be a horror movie. A lot of nay-sayers of The Evil Dead say it's a ""stupid"" movie, which in and of itself is a brilliant critique don't you think?  I for one think it's anything but.  Unlike many horror films it has a story which is easy to follow and for the most part fair to the viewer.  Given that The Evil Dead was made for somewhere around $350,000 many of the aspects of the movie are remarkable.  The special effects are nicely done even if at times obvious.  Sam Raimi's camera work makes otherwise dull moments interesting to watch for the viewer.  Raimi knows his way around a dollar and in The Evil Dead he gets everything he can out of every cent he spends.So if you are looking for a good horror film, The Evil Dead is a perfect choice, if viewed in the right frame of mind.  Just remember, it was made on a very small budget, it was made by a first time writer/director and amateur actors.  With this in mind you should have yourself a good time watching The Evil Dead.  The Evil Dead rates a 7 out of 10.",The Evil Dead
307,bhicks56,Cabin Fever,8,3 December 1999,"This is what a cult classic is all about. This movie may be shocking for its relentless gore and wicked use of a chainsaw, but you can see a great director at work.Sam Raimi, who gave us DARKMAN, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, and A SMIPLE PLAN broke out into the scene with the real cheapie and helped bring the great Bruce Campbell in schlock genre territory (where he belongs, no matter where he dwells).Ultimately, Raimi and Campbell do their best work in the faux sequel (actually it's more of a remake of this) EVIL DEAD II, but that doesn't mean this movie isn't bad. It's much more serious than the second one, with some very trendy horror elements and wicked camrea effects.
The part I hate about this movie is the end, which is a long, gory sequence that is very patience-trying and seems to go on forever. The best part is the last shot. But there are some great moments that don't appear in the second one. Like the infamous scene where the trees start attacking, almost raping, Ellen Sanweiss in the woods. Like TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (which inspired some moments in this film), this is a groundbreaking horror cheapie from a young director onto better things.If you look closely in a scene from the first NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, you will see Nancy watching EVIL DEAD on television!!",The Evil Dead

It's stereotypically set in the dark in the middle of the woods, and anybody knows what happens in the dark in the middle of the woods, if you ever set around the fire at scout camp. Weird tapes wake up demons in the woods. Some idiot girl decides to go out into the woods to confront the demons and gets raped by a tree (yes, you read that right...there is no particular reason for this scene, by the way, except to give the obligatory T&A shot these movies are notorious for). The demons are not only out to rip out your innards, they are also determined to annoy the sh*t out of you before doing so. Otherwise, it's basically a whole lot of fake blood and strewn about body parts-not a bad thing in and of itself, but certainly does not elevate this to ""good movie"" status.

310,JamesMitchell451,One of the best horror films ever,10,22 September 2013,"Very few films can mix humor and horror like The Evil Dead. The film is about a group of teenagers who are going to a cabin out in the middle of nowhere. While there, they find a book called the book of the dead, one of them recites the words and in doing so, releases unleashes a bunch of demons. The acting is top notch from everyone, along with the creepy as hell demon voices that are guaranteed to give you the creeps and the sound of the winds increasing outside, it wins in the auditory department. This film is gory. Yes I've seen hundreds of not thousands of films and this is the only film that the gore looked so real and disgusting, I actually threw up. There is no horror film out there right now that can match this film in terms of violence, between demons getting their heads cut off and buckets of blood (literally), I recommend that you bring a barf bag. Another thing is that this is the scariest film I have ever seen, even more so than The Exorcist. The way this film builds up suspense and tension is unrivaled in any film in any category, not just horror, and the best part: most of the scares aren't jump scares! It is also unrivaled in the humor department, heads are getting cut off and yet it is intentionally funny, the sort of humor that you'll find in Zombieland and Shaun Of The Dead (Though this film came before both). Add all this, plus the most creative camerwork in the industry and you've got the formula for one badass film. If you like movies of any sort, go check this out. And even if you don't like movies (I've never met anyone like that though) you should still go out and buy this movie.

That's probably why 2 and 3 added loads of comedy which turned those two into marvelous movies. But having it serious, though, it doesn't really work. I give it credit for the directing and sort of disturbing scenes, but I highly recommend that you see Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness first.

315,born_naughty,I wish I knew what the point was,1,20 October 2016,"I wish I knew what the makers were going for. I saw Evil dead because of all the positive reviews and I hated everything about it. I'm not even gonna analyze it, I'm not gonna pan it as I don't see the point. The simple fact is that I hated every single aspect of this movie and I haven't the slightest clue what the they were going for. So afterwards I was reading reviews and I noticed something funny. With the positive reviews there are two kinds: the ones that love it because it's terrifying and the ones that love it because it's hilarious. So which one is it? Was it supposed to be funny or scary? Or both? I'll say right now, both doesn't work. Being scared and laughing are opposites IMHO. I can't be scared and laugh and I can't laugh and be scared. So horror comedy doesn't work, a parody on horror movies does. Except for the famous tree scene (which I didn't find remotely funny nor scary) I don't see anything here that could be meant to be funny. The sequels and Ash vs Evil Dead are definitely more like comedies. So here's what I think. I think this original was either never meant to be a comedy (it was in no way billed or promoted like one and IMDb doesn't list it as one). I think the audience thought it was funny and that's why they decided to make the sequels into comedies. That also explains why Evil Dead 2 feels more like a remake then anything else. I know it's just speculation, I have absolutely not basis of proof but it's an interesting thought nonetheless. You don't have to think so, I think it's an interesting thought.",The Evil Dead
316,ivony,"Not the ""scare"" so many claim it to be...",6,17 June 2003,"While I can see the entertainment value in Evil Dead, I find it laughable that anyone would refer to this movie as ""scary""...especially in comparison to the Exorcist.  I remember feeling more fear during the flying monkey scene of The Wizard of Oz than any moment of Evil Dead.Now, don't get me wrong.  There were some good points to this movie.  For example, the camera shots with the ""demons"" chasing and following through the woods had its potential.  Unfortunately, it was linked with a bad script and even worse acting.  Sam Raimi did well with never actually showing the demon, but spoiled this with his cheesy not-so-special effects of the friends-turned-demons inside the cabin.  It just didn't go over well. 
I've heard the ""it pokes fun at the genre, all the while taking itself seriously"" argument.  That doesn't fly well with me...at least not when so many try to claim this film is ""scary"".  It simply isn't so.  Had Sam Raimi consistently used the scare-by-imagination route, this film probably would have been a more successful scare.  Unfortunately, this was not the case. It's as if Raimi couldn't decide what he wanted to do; and in the end, made an awful attempt at horror...even campy horror.  Sure there was blood and guts.  But to be successful, one has to actually *believe* that it is blood and guts we're seeing...not ketchup, corn syrup, or colored water.  Oh, and let's not forget the squirting milk that seems to be the chemical make-up of the demons. I understand this was made on a shoestring budget, but that doesn't mean it had to be horrible.  It *is* possible to create a good scare with little money and, like I said, had Raimi continued the assault on our imaginations, the Evil Dead would have been more successful in the fear department.Now, the negative aside, I can see why this movie has become a ""cult classic"".  It *is* indicative of the horror genre of the time period and does have its moments of sheer fun.  By no means would I recommend watching this if you're actually looking for a good scare.  However, for entertainment, a hearty laugh, and some good fun the Evil Dead does deliver. You simply cannot watch this movie without a sense of humor.",The Evil Dead

Eyeballs being squashed? To describe 'The Evil Dead' as ""gory"" would be a severe understatement, as director Sam Raimi seems to have no qualms about thrusting the audience right into the bloody, cringe-inducing mayhem that makes up the second half of this, his first feature film. And yet, believe it or not, the term ""gory"" is something of a misnomer when applied to 'The Evil Dead', as it usually has the habit of implying that the film it is describing has little going for it besides blood-splattered carnage and over-the-top set pieces. The controversy surrounding the content of the film is understandable, as some scenes are sure to induce physical nausea for those who watch them.

319,Ore-Sama,The Tag Line Was Actually Right,8,23 November 2007,"""The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror"" This tag line is actually correct this time instead of a lame exaggeration. The terror produced by this film is indeed grueling and physically exhausting. I thought I saw the scariest films ever made in ""Halloween"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and while those film did indeed produce their own kind of terror, ""Evil Dead"" has surpassed them.The story is simple. Five friends go to a cabin for some good old partying. A few weired instances take place but only when the Necromonicon is found and a tape player recites the text that the fun begins.What makes this film so scary? The first would have to be the inventive camera angles. Fast, rapid and above all else stylish, especially when from the demon's POV, it's like being grabbed by the shirt and pulled along for the ride. The cabin is a perfect setting to take advantage of which Raimi does. Add to that is the use of sound. A creepy soundtrack with sinister sounds and a good use of silence, this movie has scene after scene after scene of unbearable tension, knowing something is going to pop out but never knowing when.The makeup on the zombies are well done and while the fore effects are not realistic, they sure are cool to look at. The acting ranges from mediocre to below, the best performance going to Bruce Campell who pulls off his part fairly well.On the downside, the film does drag a bit at the end, probably could've been cut about 5-10 minutes short. With that aside, this is a classic, classic horror film and one of the best ever made undoubtedly.",The Evil Dead
320,ESOTERIC_,BAD,3,3 January 2021,"I was really disappointed with Evil Dead, the beginning is interesting, but the continuation quickly becomes without any interest.The film is hardly scary. it must be said the film is still pleasant to watch but it has aged really badly because of its very low budget.The film has aged due to its special effects which are outdated today.",The Evil Dead

322,Indifferent_Observer,Hands down one of the Top 5 Horror movies of all time!,10,14 January 2011,"I remember as a kid watching this movie late one evening after midnight. It had just come out to VHS and I had rented it from the local Movie rental store. I could've never known how much this film would affect me and turn me into even more of a horror buff. I actually never even returned this movie. I happily paid for it saying it was lost somewhere and I still have the copy which is worn out in parts because I seriously mustve watched it 100 times in my life(literally). I see kids today trying to watch this and saying its no good, has bad acting, etc and by todays standards this movie wouldn't make it very far, but back in 1981 this was the most horrifying thing in the world. I don't epect kids to understand with all the effects they have today. If you put yourself in Ash's shoes stick up in thew woods,all alone, having to kill all his friends, and having absolutely no one. Some people don't understand too that this movie wasn't meant to be real campy and there is little or no humor in the movie unlike Part 2 and 3. This movie was dead serious in 1981. Believe me I watched it over and over again and it didn't start being funny till years later..and even then its still scary. This movie reserves a place in my heart as one of the Best Horror movies EVER! From the reviews here I can see I am far from the only one! 10 out of 10 stars. I wish I could give it a higher rating because this truly was a time piece and will remain a revered classic forever!",The Evil Dead

The build up to scenes could scarcely be done better, dialog, well, it left a lttle bit to be desired but the 2 sequels made up for it, this was basically a fledgling attempt, that much like the Blair Which Project, just took off with the original ideas.  Highly recomended is the Evil Dead.",The Evil Dead
324,rneil95,The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror? YOU BET!!,8,19 June 2008,"In the year 1979, a group of friends set out to make the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror. With a shoestring budget of less than $375,000, Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell deliver one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.The Evil Dead tells the story of 5 college kids (Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Rich DeManicor, Betsy Baker, and Teresa Tilly) who travel up to an isolated cabin in the woods for the weekend. However, while they're there, they find a strange book entitled Naturon Demonto, (renamed Necronomicon Ex-Mortis in the sequels) which roughly translates to Book of the Dead. They accidentally play a tape recording that recites demonic incantations from the book that eventually makes the demons reawaken and possess them one by one until the lone survivor, Ash (Campbell), has to step up and fight back.This is a great film. Sure the acting isn't great, but this movie features some great practical effects from Tom Sullivan. Yes, it's fake. Yes, it looks fake. However, it's impossible not to appreciate them.It's a VERY gory movie. For pretty much the last half-hour or so, blood is soaking everything. There's even a scene where a character get's it's hand hacked half-way off, so it tears the hand the rest of the way off with it's mouth.This film introduces Ashley J. Williams, better known as Ash. The character of Ash is well-known for being a badass, but don't expect that from him in this one. In this one, Ash is actually kind of wimpy for the most of the movie. It's not really until Evil Dead II that Ash becomes a full-blown badass.So, anyway, this movie is amazing. It's scary, it's entertaining, and it's a hell of a lot of fun to watch with a large group of people. So, in the end, does Raimi succeed in bringing us the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror? My answer is definitely yes.",The Evil Dead

But with so little money to spend you have to be creative. And that's what Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were.The camera movements are original and I can't remember seeing a movie do this before this movie or even after this movie. It is amazing how an, at first glance, amateuristic film can produce such original and creative camera-work.Just don't pay to much attention to the bad acting. In Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn Bruce Campbell does a better job acting then in this movie. But this movie sets a standard for horror movies who don't take themselves too serious. But it's is scary too. And no: it is not a brilliant film. But for the people who have interest in the genre and for the people who recognize the creativity and the camp in this movie it is well worth watching. I think it is a classic. The audio commentary on the DVD is great too. Campbell tells us while seeing the movie on his own cynical way (even about his own terrible acting) how this movie was made and how they came up with the ideas. I usually don't watch these extra's, but this one's very funny.",The Evil Dead
327,mazec666,"A $350,000 masterpiece of American horror.",10,25 March 2013,"Around the time John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" was spawning an avalanche of blood-soaked imitators, a motley crew of Detroit filmmakers ventured into the isolated woods of Tennessee. With a $350,000 budget and eye-popping make-up effects from Tom Sullivan, director Sam Raimi unleashed a film that would change modern American horror forever. And that film I'm talking about is ""The Evil Dead"".Five college-age friends spend the weekend at a deserted mountain cabin. In the dark basement they find and play recordings of mystical incantations, which elevate an angry group of hell demons intent on devouring their souls. One by one the luckless students are controlled by the demons except the mild-mannered and deviant Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell). Thus, Ash has no other choice but to mutilate the living corpses of his sister (Ellen Sandweiss), girlfriend (Betsy Baker) and two of his friends (Sarah York & Hal Delrich).While overcoming the problematic shoot for the cast and crew, Raimi unwittingly made horror film history in making the final survivor a male instead of the typical female victim in most '80s slashers. And Bruce Campbell is seemingly perfect for the role of Ash Williams. With his blue work shirt and all-American looks, Campbell played Ash as the average Joe who is not a jock or a ladies man but as someone whom we can root for. Stylistically, Raimi balances slow-moving suspense with his signature brand of humor more understated than the over-the-top aesthetic of the later sequels. Unfortunately, the filmmakers would soon find themselves in hot water.When ""The Evil Dead"" hit movie screens in the United Kingdom, the film received an X rating and being named as a video nasty mainly because of the notorious ""tree-rape"" scene. I found the whole video nasty controversy to be ridiculous because Sam Raimi was out to create a horror film he wanted to make without executive interference and egotistical actors. And it doesn't deserve to be categorized along with the exploitative likes of ""Faces of Death"".""The Evil Dead"" is a $350,000 masterpiece of American horror that must be seen to believe.",The Evil Dead
328,TedEBear,When does it get interesting?,3,3 May 2004,"About the only thing that separates it from the rest of thefriends-get-stranded-and-killed movies is the Book of the Dead plot. Otherwise, I got the idea of it, even though I fast forwarded through the majority. I'm not sure if I'm going to move on to the sequels; nothing about this movie compels me to do so.  The ending, trying not to give away any spoilers, just leaves it hanging open with no resolution and makes it too obvious that it wants a sequel. I'm not even sure if I can qualify it for its perceived ""camp"" value; dull, flat acting from four of the five cast members, weak special effects (yeah, yeah, yeah. I know:  it was made in 1981!  What did you expect?  ""The Matrix""), a storyline that was new at the time, but I've seen at least 100 times before and 1000 timesbetter.  * of ****",The Evil Dead

332,crystallogic,"The whole thing is a tad overrated, but this is still an atmospheric creeper",7,8 December 2018,"I'm sure by this point nobody cares what somebody like me has to say about this movie, or indeed, this *franchise*, but I'll do it anyway. I saw the next two instalments (the remake given the name Dead by Dawn and the loose sequel), and I was glad to finally come to this one. I thought all three movies were somewhat entertaining, but also given an undue amount of cultural weight. This is my favourite of the bunch because it really does contain a weird, morbid atmosphere, and is not played for laughs.Those only familiar with the other films (and I think there are a surprising lot of you) might be surprised at how hard Sam Reimy works to create an atmosphere of genuine dread and hopelessness. It works well, up to a point. The problem is that the characters are non-entities except for Ash, and the story feels like it was written by a nine-year-old. Of course, we are all only really in this for the mayhem, and it does start pretty quickly. I like how this movie really pushes the case for the environment itself being malefic; that it's not just the playing of a tape waking the dead (or demons as the case may be), but the entire woodland they are in being riddled with evil and malignant spiritualities. It added an unexpected almost folk-horror element to proceedings, even though it was rather understated. Not much dialogue of interest in the film at all, so really not a lot to think about.The demons seem to be able to possess whomever they want, whenever they want, so the rules of the world are nebulous and don't seem to make sense. Why'd they go back to sleep after the professor made the tape and spoke the incantations? Look, I'm fine with ambiguity in horror; in fact it's largely preferred to having everything explained, but here it just seemed like none of that stuff really mattered, and that's a bit iinsulting.But hey, this is a really well-made movie with some nice quirks that was created by people who clearly really enjoyed what they were doing. Everyone plays it up to the hilt and I appreciate that. It's a lot creepier than the other instalments and does contain one or two genuinely disturbing scenes involving trees. it's also just over 80 minutes long, so the time will fly by.

336,woinaroschy_1979,They don't make movies like that anymore...,10,6 September 2010,"This movie is a true masterpiece and one that will always be cited as a reference in the domain of horror movies. With very few means (the location is a shabby cabin in the middle of the forest, there are only 5 people acting in the movie, there is no CGI because it was made in 1981) the director manages to transform a very simple story into a nightmare, that will give you goosebumps and make you cover your eyes every 5 minutes. The movie reminds me a lot of the ""Night of the living dead"", another masterpiece of horror. The make-up is perfect, real, very visual (only 2-3 times where I am able to see that it's not blood or that it's make-up or a mask). But it's really the camera angles that fascinate me the most, the rapid movements in the woods, around the cabin or even from the basement, giving you the impression that you truly look through those dead eyes, or that shot where the image turns upside down because the view climbs up on the ceiling and then back down to the face of the victim. Amazing! Comparing horror films today with this one is like comparing water with wine. They just don't do films like that anymore! The only horror flick that could come close to it is The Grudge, but it's a totally other type of horror film.

How did they do that?(!IF YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW ABOUT THE STORY SKIP THIS REVIEW!),10,23 March 2000,"Evil Dead is by far the most frightening horror film I have ever seen and I can't imagine how any film could possibly top it. The budget (50'000 $) is laughable because the film contains so many effects that it is almost unbelievable it was done on such a small budget. The actors and actresses did a decent job (at a salary of 100$ a week) although they weren't experienced at all. Sam Raimi's direction is absolutely outstanding, maybe the best ever seen in an American film.The story is about five students who go to a cabin in the woods. They find a tape with the voice of a professor trying to translate the ""Necronomicon"", the Book of the Dead. By playing the tape the students unleash the evil power that lives within the woods. Gradually they are turned into blood-thirsty zombies until there's only one of them left. Ash (Bruce Campbell) now has to fight not only his former friends but also the evil that is trying to get him too.The film is ultra-horrifying and ultra-violent. It is a masterpiece of horror and will probably scare you out of your wits if you see it for the first time. But it is also very inventive and adds some entirely new elements to the horror genre.

Exceptions not counted, my guess is: if you're not a true horror fan, you'll absolutely despise this brilliant piece of film. It's understandable because if you're not to it, the constant terror, haunting sound effects, scary photography (from the forest creature's point of view), and bathtubs full of blood and other gore that occupy the screen for 75% of the duration will put you off if not sicken you beyond belief. But if you would manage to see beyond that, you'd see the incredible talent of Sam Raimi, the director. The vision, the way of shooting the movie, the choice of sound effects, are examples of a great new master at work. The special effects are low budget, yes, but once again to all the people who complained, THIS WAS A LOW BUDGET FILM! You can't buy a Mercedes with minimum wage. And however ""bad"" the effects may have been, they were still effective and at times pretty scary. Just watch this movie alone in the dark late at night and you'll see.When i first saw this movie i was shocked at the gore displayed in this film, and although less so, still am today. With the exception of certain zombie films, especially the brilliant ""Brain dead"", there has yet to be a horror movie making this attempt to gross you out.

Obviously most of it is fake 😂 but ever since the release of The Exorcist in 1973 which gave everyone a big scare, which was based on a true story, the horror genre began to expand and evolve .. so in the coming decade this movie came, which stretched many things and took it to the next level .. but I'm not so much of a fan of blood, gore or violence and neither would I recommend it in movies. They could've still given a huge scare to the people without the bodily dismemberment scenes or without the ferocious violence . Thats the whole technique how to do it .. Yes horror I do like but especially those types of movies which give a realistic message of understanding to ponder over so that people don't stay in darkness and come towards the truth .

It was the ""in"" thing - the movie to watch and the most talked about movie amongst us teenagers who were scared to death watching it.When I watched this the first time, I made the huge mistake of watching it alone. Right from the beginning, with the eerie, spine-chilling music and the sense of dark evil in the woods I knew that this movie was going to be unique in the amount of atmospheric terror it would strike into my very soul.Nearly every single scene scared me to death - the most frightening moments for me were when the camera was zooming around the steamy swamps, through the woods and approaching the cabin at break-neck speed, only to retreat quickly back when the poor soul running from the darkness made it to safety and slammed the door behind them.The zombies were excellent - the best I have ever seen (or ever likely to see) in any horror movie and their voices were deeply disturbing.After viewing it I told my friends at school how I felt about it and they all agreed that they were deeply disturbed by the whole experience and to me, this will always be the ultimate in scary horror - no other film before or since has come anywhere near the mark for heart-striking terror for me.Even to this day I have to pluck up the courage to spin this disc in the DVD player - the effect it had on me back on the 80's lies firmly planted within me and even when I hear anyone mention the title of this film today it strikes me full of terror.It just goes to show that you don't need a huge pile of cash to make a fantastic, chilling movie.Evil Dead is the best horror film of all time, and with the rubbish they produce today I think I can confidently say that no other movie could ever scare me again as much as this one does.Excellent!",The Evil Dead

354,Deadsoonx,"Garbage, no budget.",1,29 January 2021,I watched this in 4K and it was in 4:3 aspect ratio and it looked worse than VHS.

355,mcrpghk,A classic of Splatter!,10,30 March 2021,"I believe that The Evil Dead is the best example that with a camera, good friends and committed people a small idea can create a great movie, in an era where renowned directors spend millions on their stars, gigantic scenarios and state-of-the-art effects still create mediocre films if the classic 1981 had been released today would be a laughing stock , but this film is brilliant.When I watched it was something stunning, I've never seen demonic possession and haunted houses being approached that way, it's unbelievable that four decades later this film still remains clight, in a good way of course.The atmosphere that is created with camera movements around the hill and cas next to the background sounds is terrifying, as an unsuspecting person is apprehensive about the mysterious threat that is to come, and when they come it is a shock, although the mythology is still small in this first film it is certainly very much alive.Using the lack of budget to treat evil entities as a force of nature and the invisible supernatural was a master move, since the last thing we imagine as an enemy are trees, wind and earth.And what about the main enemies? A spectacle of makeup and practical effects, all those possessed humans are terrifying in a way that no other zombie movie or mutation has achieved, both by physical and mental torture to their victims, highlighted by actress Betsy Baker who was responsible for one of the most macabre scenes I've ever seen in a horror movie.People imagined in the past, indeed some to this day, that hell is summed up in violence, blood and suffering and this film lived up to this vision, the torment that the characters go through with the whole situation that are exposed is to give agony, both the physical and mental injuries that deteriorate each little by little are tormenting to see , especially Bruce Campbell who shows Ashley's insanity increasingly high because of everything that has to be done to make her survive.Despite some continuity errors there is nothing in this film that erases its brightness and originality, it is certainly mandatory for any fan of the genre!",The Evil Dead

Here's the plot in a sentence: demons attend camp college student idiots.Of course, everything I've said points to something: this is for horror movie nerds only. Joe Schmo isn't going to be scared, he isn't going to appreciate how hard this was, and since he's probably seen WRONG TURN or CABIN FEVER, he's not going to appreciate originality.But I'm a nerd: I f---ing love this!",The Evil Dead

Basically, this movie must appeal to those that don't believe a good horror movie should have any of the things that make any other movie good: actors that can maybe act a little. A plot. Something faintly resembling adequate cinematography, or at the very least, shots that Camera-work that looks like the cameraman had the visual sense of a at least a seventh grader. This piece of forgettable trash has none of that. I have no problem with low-budget horror. But this doesn't just look like a student film. It looks like a film made by talentless students who didn't know how to write, direct, set lights, or act. I first saw it in the theaters as a 13-year-old horror buff, with a friend with similar tastes. As a 13 year old, I found it laughably stupid, poorly made, and not at all scary. Now, 27 years later I gave it another chance. And you know what? It's laughably stupid, poorly made, and not at all scary.This is an execrable mess. It's that lousy. These people who are giving it 10 stars... I don't know what movie they were watching, because the one I saw certainly wasn't worth the hour and a half of my time. If I could have watched the whole thing in 15 minutes, it wouldn't have been worth the 15 minutes. I dunno, I guess if you like wooden, ham-fisted lack of acting ability, or are scared by completely fake-looking special effects that are clearly made of poorly animated stop- motion clay, or enjoy weak plots full of logic holes you could drive an 18 wheeler through, there'll be a lot to please you here.

Sure, one can admit that the acting and the gore can be a bit over-the-top.  Heck, even the special effects really pale in comparison to other films in the genre. But one can't deny the creativity that Raimi has put into his film.  This creative sense of the film more than makes up for its miniscule budget.

I love a good horror film, but these days the're just so hard to find... so when you catch something like ""The Evil Dead,"" you just can't help but feel jazzed.I was 13 when I saw this movie (but don't let that marr your opinion of the proceeding words) and I was truly scared.  I love that adrenaline rush, and this one delivers it.  It wasn't the gore - this is one of the few films that puts the viewer on unstable ground and makes them nervous, and THEN uses gore to heighten the terror.  Blood and guts doesn't do the trick alone.  Sam Raimi, the genious that he is, uses masterful techniques that thousands of striving directors lunge for but miss so terribly.Wait for a stormy night, put off dinner for a while if you're squeemish, pop in the videocasette, and enjoy!  You'll truly love it.  I know I'm always disappointed when I rent a tape with high hopes and it turns out to be a dud.

364,AhmedDaReviewer,First time watching The Evil Dead in 2021 and..,8,27 September 2021,"Kinda late to the party I know, but yeah, I finally watched The Evil Dead for the first time ever in 2021 aaaaaaand I enjoyed it, This movie ain't this loved and well praised for nothing, and while yes, I had a fun time watching it, I really expected a lot more outta it.. Like I can see why so many people love it and say it is the best horror movie ever made and how it changed horror movies forever and yade yade yada, and yeah It has a lot of great moments here and there, Amazing make up work, Great practical and gore effects, Very cool and creative camera angles that make the cabin seem larger than it is really, but other than that, Is this movie really THAT good..I really respect and appreciate Sam Raimi for making such an ambitious movie (especially for the time) with such a small budget, Like.. this man and his team are a living definition of doing so much with so little, But you don't need money to write a good story and characters and that's basically my biggest problem with movie, The characters, I felt like the characters were basic, Way too basic infact I couldn't for the life of me care for them, Even for a horror movie, Like the only reason we should care about these characters is just because they're the main characters and that's it, I wish they had a little bit of depth to them, so we could actually care when something bad happened to them.The acting is.. kinda questionable (let's just say that) Let's keep in mind that this was Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell's feature debut, so I guess I can forgive them about that, but the thing that I can't actually forgive and not gonna lie kinda annoyed me is the tree rape scene, yes THAT tree scene.. Was that scene even necessary, Like I kinda understand why it is in the movie, It is to show how evil and messed up this forest really is but I felt like there was like a hundreds thousands other ways you could've implied that and I'm not saying this because the scene disgusted or disturbed me or anything (I'm kinda numb to these type of things because of how much horror movies I've watched) but yeah this was just kind of outta nowhere and really clashed with the tone of the rest of the movie, I'm really happy that Sam Raimi admitted that regrets filming and even thinking about writing a scene like this saying in a recent interview: ""I think it was unnecessary gratuitous and a little too brutal... my goal is not to offend people. It is to entertain, thrill, scare... make them laugh, but not to offend them... I think my judgment was a little wrong at the time."" I think the movie would've been a lot better without it but oh well..So yeah, this was overall a pretty fun and interesting experience, I think with time and more rewatches (especially with friends) I would love this movie even more and maybe give it a higher rating but as if now, I'm pretty satisfied with my rating, and I'm pretty excited about watching Evil Dead 2 and especially excited about the fact that they embraced the goofiness and wackiness of the first film, so I already know I'm gonna enjoy it even more, So yeah, The Evil Dead gets a 7/10.Edit: Not gonna lie, I feel kinda bad for giving this movie a 7 now, After watching other classic horror movies, I've changed my mind, this movie easily gets an 8/10, I don't know why I get so critical sometimes lol.",The Evil Dead

This film, I would assume, basically wrote the book in terms of genre tropes (specifically character archetypes), but I've always thought that that was too bad.

Especially for people who generally never want to watch the same movie twice or are easily bored. The timing in the preparation of horrifying the audience is delightful even though the acting is amateurish. The violence was, for the most part, cinematically tasteful (i.e. The tree-rape) and the grossest parts are visceral (get monster gunk in your mouth). This is about 100 times better than the Blair Witch Project, and it is no wonder Raimi and Campbell have become so famous with all their big budget projects since then. This is a wonderful movie to watch on a teenaged date together, or else when you're old and alone and have nothing much better to thrill you when you can't eat sugar, salt or drink alcohol anymore!",The Evil Dead
367,Ash-89,The Birth of two legends of horror movies!!,10,13 April 1999,The Evil Dead is a stunningly effective horror film about five students who go in an abandoned cabin. This movie is Sam Raimi's and Bruce Campbell's first( first real movie I mean!)and it proves that these two guys are one of the greatest combinations of directing and acting. Ash(Bruce Campbell) is a chicken at the beginning but he soon discovers that this attitude is not good against ''The Evil Dead'' and his many possessed victims!! The last twenty minutes of the movie really show Raimi's brilliant visual style and the end is just amazing!! This movie deserves serious attention from any horror films fans. 10/10,The Evil Dead
368,Tyypo,A movie with more notoriety than it deserves,1,21 December 2012,"First off, I liked ""Army of Darkness"", essentially the film that put the Evil Dead movies on the map. I knew of the two prequels, but they were really hard to find for a while. I'm not really a fan of gore per se, so the reviews that described it as such deterred me for a while. However, I couldn't resist streaming Netflix + some spare time.I know people in these sort of movies are compelled to do stupid things, but this one goes over the top. The most cowardly woman of the group going out alone to look for someone/something was completely out of character. The subsequent violation by demonic foliage was out of place, uncalled for, and unnecessarily gratuitous. Then there's the whole notion that evil supernatural forces are trying to kill them, so... let's split the injured girl away from the rest so she can take a nap. That's a sound strategy.There are people who are scared by this film, even think it is the scariest they've seen? You probably shouldn't have gone to my high school; you'd just be cowering in a corner somewhere. The gore effects were about as ridiculous as one could imagine. The stop-motion at the end had me laughing like I was watching an episode of MST3K. For comparison, it made a Doctor Who episode of the same era look like ""Avatar"". I can imagine this being a cult movie with its camp appeal, but scary? Really? This is one overrated movie. When ED2 comes available on streaming Netflix or On Demand, I'll probably watch it for completion, certainly with low expectations.",The Evil Dead

I was so spooked I didn't have the nerve to go outside that night as I lived in a wooded area. Sure, it is not for everyone, but the critics should have risen above the subject matter and seen the genius of Raimi.

Its also has one of the funnest scenes in a movie involving a tree and...well You'll have to rent it to find out. Bruce campbell is god.

373,Equinox23,"""Why Are You Torturing Me Like This?""",10,30 April 2013,"Let me start by telling that I'm not actually a fan of gory horror movies and that the movies that scare me the most are those in which the horror is not graphic but rather happening in your head. Like the most scary movies to me are ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925) and especially the scene when the phantom is described and one can see the horror on the face of the person who is describing him, or The Haunting where the horror is also only conveyed by the reactions of those exposed to it.The other preliminary is that the first thing I learned about this movie is that it was banned in Germany for being too brutal and yet I watched it and am glad I did for I was pleasantly surprised - if one can talk of pleasant in the context of a horror movie. For what I found was a movie that takes its brutality and gore and the effect on its protagonists seriously. For me the conflict became evident in Ash's exclamation: ""Why are you torturing me like this?"". First of all I took it as being directed against the demons who are of course threatening him, but then I discovered some other deeper meaning here. For he is the only one who actually knows the remedy against them, which is dismemberment, but he is also shown as being very reluctant to actually apply it. So what is tormenting Ash is also this knowledge and the effects it does or would have on his soul. Which according to Peter Brook also happens to be the central one in Hamlet. Hamlet is ordered to revenge his father's death, but at the same time the ghost also demands him not to taint his soul. In both cases the choices are horrible and both are quite classic.",The Evil Dead

376,imad_jafar,A masterpiece of 80's horror!,8,4 February 2010,"In this cult classic - the original cabin-in-the-woods flick - a furious demonic force possesses a group of thrill-seeking teens (led by Bruce Campbell) who venture deep into the Tennessee backwoods for a weekend of sex and drugs. The five friends awaken the ferocious intruders by playing a tape-recording of weird incantations, which consists of recitations taken from the Sumerian ""Book of the dead"". As each character gets possessed, the gore-factor effectively rises. The build up of the outrageously organic violence leads to a humorously horrific climax in which the remaining zombies deteriorate (via clever stop-motion techniques devised by Tom Sullivan) and their organs emphatically explode. With this film, Sam Raimi established his signature touches as a director: breakneck speed, kinetic action sequences and inventive camera angles. ""The Evil Dead"" is shot with a powerful flair, and it's mainly Raimi's directorial verve that elevates the film above it's mundane zombie contemporaries. Overall, a superb example of what can be done on a low budget and a masterpiece of 80's horror.",The Evil Dead

It's got amateur, yet completely awesome acting. It's got amazing gore, and a supremely low budget. It's got the necronomicon, and Bruce Campbell.Evil Dead is a simple story about a few kids who go to a little cabin for the weekend, when they discover a book. This not any normal book, it's the Necronomicon; the Book of the Dead. It slowly turns everyone into demons, all except little ol' Bruce, who is left to fend off against the evil dead menace. Finally, after a long night of fighting and being tormented, Ash (Bruce Campbell) throws the book into the fire place, leading to one of the coolest scenes in any movie... Ever.The acting is awesome. It's four kids, no experience, putting their heart and soul into this movie. Most importantly, Bruce Campbell, who not only acted, he funded the majority of the movie, did a lot of the FX, even got injured making this movie. And the gore in this movie is incredible, the pencil in foot scene is so wrong... And we can't forget the tree rape, thanks Sam Raimi for giving me nightmares about that!

378,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of The Evil Dead,10,11 February 2013,"In honor of the new Evil Dead remake I will be reviewing the original Evil Dead trilogy. Evil Dead is the 1981 horror classic directed by Sam Raimi. Many people think that The Evil Dead is more comedic like it's brother,Evli Dead 2, but the original Evil Dead is quite scary. Evil Dead is about a group of friends who go to a isolated cabin deep in the woods and are attacked by an evil force. Evil Dead has a very distinct feel to it sort of a realistic tone to it. Evil Dead not only gave us the ""Cabin In the Woods"" genre but it also gave us one of the grooviest horror movie heroes ever Ashley or ""Ash"" if you prefer. This is one of the best,scariest films ever created. The only problem I can imagine one having with this film is that it is dated and very campy. Other than that it is a near perfect film. 9.5/10",The Evil Dead
379,El_Rey_De_Movies,Never turn on an abandoned tape recorder!,8,3 November 2005,"Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" movies are so different in the way sequels are structured that they really have to be reviewed together. Raimi made the original ""Evil Dead"" as an extremely low budget college project back in 1982 with the help of buddies Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell. But what he lacked in money he more than made up for with a dizzying array of camera tricks, homemade special effects, and sheer nerve and bravado. It's a very simple story: four friends rent an isolated cabin in the woods where they find the abandoned notes and tape recorder of an archaeologist who's discovered a book named the Necronomicon ex Mortis or Book of the Dead. When they play back the recorded notes that contain translated passages from the book, they unleash a horde of demons which they then spend the rest of the night fighting. Although there's an INCREDIBLE amount of karo syrup/blood thrown all over the place, what impresses you most about this is how much humor Raimi manages to inject into the proceedings. There's some scary stuff, but it's hard to take it seriously or get offended when the demons torture Bruce Campbell with an array of gags straight out of the Three Stooges. Even the monsters are credited as ""fake shemps"" in the credits! There are a couple of scenes that are creepy, both visually and aurally, which is a credit to how inventive Raimi was in setting up shots and designing the sound on a budget that wouldn't pay for the caterer in an Ah-nuld movie. The first ""Evil Dead"" is very obviously made by a young director who loved making movies and couldn't wait to strut his stuff in front of the entire world. It became a video hit here, so a sequel was announced. But Raimi, Tapert and Campbell pulled a fast one on their audience  instead of doing a straight continuation of the story like a normal sequel, they went back and basically remade the first ""Evil Dead"". The difference was that this time they had access to a much bigger budget that would allow Raimi to really push things completely over the top and watch them go splat when they hit the other side! There's more blood, more gore, and more monsters but this one is even sillier and funnier than the original. As I said earlier, it's basically the same story, reworked slightly. Two of the original characters were jettisoned so that Raimi could concentrate more on Campbell's performance  and that's the glue that really holds both movies together. Campbell transforms his character from a terrified and rather mousy little nerd to a chainsaw-wieldin', shotgun-totin', quip-spewin' Ramboesque action hero who proceeds to chop, shoot, kick and punch the crap out of each and every demon that confronts him  even after having to chop his own hand off because ""it went bad"". If you can't handle lots of fake blood and gore, this isn't the movie for you  but if you like your horror mixed with smart-assy humor and lots of visual flair then this one's for you, buddy.",The Evil Dead

Sam Raimi knows that you don't need boobies and language to make a movie good. I looked at the title thinking yep another freakin' zombie movie, then I saw it I realized it was way more than that. It wasn't typical zombie people getting eaten kind of not original movie. The movie was completely original. It wasn't even about zombies its about demons and possession. But still not a rip off of the Excorsist either. I loved it and you will to. But be cautious its rated NC-17 for substantial excessive graphic violence and gore.",The Evil Dead
383,skullballmovies,Extremely impressive - one of the best cult classics,8,18 November 2010,"It's awesome how much this film moved people. It became a phenomenon extremely quick and spawned 2 sequels. Running off of the extremely low- budget that it did, it was extremely impressive. The effects were great, the gore was satisfying, and the actors were great for the money's worth. This is a brutally putrid and oozing, gooey film. The gore and brutality of everything is so over-the-top that it's just satisfying as all hell. No moments were realistic in any way possible, and that is what makes this movie so much fun. Sure it had some flaws, and though I'm not completely bypassing those and giving it a 10, it's a great film.",The Evil Dead
384,roy-nicholas33,Groovy,9,7 November 2004,"I bought the uncut version of The Evil Dead on DVD two years ago, The Anchor bay version, What an ace movie this is! Sam Raimi who directed this fine crafted movie made a big name for himself in the horror world when he followed The Evil Dead up with a bigger budget Dead by dawn sequel and the later Med-evil dead, Which i still laugh at today.I own all three movies on special edition DVDs. The Med-evil dead is my favorite (if you watch when Bruce Campbell is being chased through the woods before the windmill, You will see three trees split open. The last tree to split open has the face of a demon on the inside side of the tree!)But at its time The Evil Dead was ground breaking stuff on a shoe string budget.The movie was originally completed in 1980 but was not released until 1983 as the movie ran over budget and could not be completed. But determination prevailed and Mr. Raimi became a cult horror name!My verdict 8/10 Highly Recommended if you have never seen a splatter movie before.",The Evil Dead

Guess what's going to happen to them? Well, I'll tell you. They find a tape that conjures up some demons whose main purpose is to turn all the girls into squealing, cackling freaks that puke and spit all over the place a-la The Exorcist. The two male characters eventually realize that women only act this way when possessed by Evil Incarnate, so they are left with no choice but to beat the living crap out them.The first girl gets raped by a tree. Naturally, she is totally freaked out by this, but when she reveals the event to her friends, they find it ignorable (""but trees don't attack people!"") and rather than show any concern, they proceed to play a game. Yet in mid-game, they are confronted by the same girl turned demon, skin turned green and talking in demon-speak, which barely gets a rise out of them (""do you think she's OK?"").What follows is a non-stop violence fest as more of the girls turn into demons and get beaten with sticks, axes, etc. by the two male kids, in fierce competition for the award for worst actor.This movie will scare the hell out of you if you are under the age of 12.",The Evil Dead

Sam Raimi's first feature has none of the humor and storytelling skills that would come to be a hallmark of his later work (most notably the romantically swoony homage to the Universal horror films of the thirties, ""Darkman""). It plods along with far too many cliches until the second half when, during the vividly gruesome action sequences, Raimi's inventive imagination comes alive through Tom Philo's camera and Edna Ruth Paul's deft editing.

These questions are important because depending on the answer given to them, the film changes radically. For my part, not knowing what to think, I adopted a very docile posture : I confirmed my vision to what each scene evoked me. A forced laugh here, I saw a desire to create discomfort. From the monsters that appeared there, I jumped and let myself be overcome by fear.In my mind, Evil Dead always landed on its feet, and even, it was sublimated by an incredible intelligence to film and an exploitation of space like I have rarely seen. Some criticize the film for its actors who sometimes lack credibility. But what if, basically, we have to adapt our gaze as I advocated before. What if, after all, these acting faults were intentional?Let's agree on the problem : I'm talking about the fear reactions that anyone would experience instead of the protagonists, who are often too calm. But deep down, maybe that's the intelligence of the film. The audience is required to experience each situation for themselves and not just through actors who do all the work for them. Sam Raimi pulls on the cord of the placidity of his characters, and we die of fear for the lack of finding an emotion ready to take away. Some will say that I see what I want to see and it's quite possible. But after all, not all of the qualities of a film are necessarily intentional. Sam Raimi leaves his audience with a multitude of possible experiences, and for me, that has been a significant wealth. 8/10.",The Evil Dead

Sam Raimi was 19 when he directed this, he made short films before including Within The Woods which was the short film which got him where he is now.

This movie was a labor of love and it truly shows. Dead is a very important movie in the horror genre since it remains to be inspiration for so many subsequent ones. I remember several people suggesting I see this movie because I am a big horror fan. When I finally saw it, I was very impressed and enjoyed it a great deal. It's very in-your-face and is loaded with dark humor. The gore is also pretty disgusting, which goes well with a campy movie like this. I think I really appreciated the movie years after first seeing it and finding out how much went into making it. They took years to film and piece it together, actors left due to scheduling issues, they filmed in poor conditions. It really was a labor of love made by a handful of horror nerds that any filmmaker should appreciate, considering most first-time feature films turn out so horrible.

Hell, throughout the opening of the movie, people are calling him ""Ashley"", not the much cooler ""Ash"" he gets in later movies.A lot of what fans have come to expect from Bruce Campbell and Ash weren't in this movie. Bruce Campbell himself said on Reddit that the problem was that he couldn't act in this movie. But that's not the whole story. This movie didn't have campy humor or a strong hero. This movie was scary. You were thrown into the movie with no sense of humor, just dread.The movie had a $50k budget, which was spent over a few years that the film was thrown together by two friends. Every expense was spared. But it has still had a lasting impact on the modern horror genre.And, while I find most modern horror movies to be forgettable, I find myself coming back to Evil Dead every year around Halloween.

This movie was recommended for me based on some of the other movies that I have either selected for viewing, or just inquired and read the synopsis about. I was led to believe that there was something special or outstanding about this movie. As it turned out, The Evil Dead is simply a terrible cliché of all gory movies. The only thing special about it seems to be that it was one of the first of it's type and the director, Sam Raimi, was very young (21 ?) when he made it. It has all of the elements of a ""B"" movie (which it is): lousy story with characters that make unbelievably stupid choices, terrible acting, terrible make up and effects, overall terrible production. I couldn't believe The Evil Dead had a 7.5 rating on IMDb, but apparently if you like blood-fest type movies, this one comes highly recommended by your cohorts in ketchup. I don't watch many movies of this type; I will be more careful about selecting movies that are recommended to me by database preference analysis.

The latter was one of my favourite action/comedy/adventure films when I was a boy. I still remember to this day when my father first told me about the original Evil Dead. He told me, however, unlike Army of Darkness, the original film was a ""real"" serious horror film. He also told me that it was the first movie that he and my mother had watched during their first date....I was never allowed to watch the film until I was a teenager, and when I finally did.....I was truly terrified. I had never seen a horror movie like it before, and to this day, I have never really seen another horror movie like it since. For me, I really think that The Evil Dead is still a pretty scary movie today.The plot is rather simple and somewhat cliché. Five college friends journey deep into the Tennessee woods to vacation at a small creepy cabin. They later find an old tape recorder that when played allows demons living in the woods. One by one, they become possessed until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) remains.There is just something incredibly frightening about this movie that I don't believe any other film has ever been able to recreate. Many viewers find parts of the film funny, but for me, I never did. The part where you see Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) engulfed in the darkness of the cellar, looking up and laughing demonically with the blue goo dribbling down her chin is, for me, something truly creepy and disturbing even to this day.The make-up of the ""deadites"" may look cheap, but I think that that just makes them all the more creepy. Even the deadites in Evil Dead II (which had a bigger budget) did not seem almost as menacing and truly ""evil"" as their original counterparts. That being said, I don't even think the deadites in the 2013 remake lived up to the terror of the original.10/10",The Evil Dead

1. The character Ash (Bruce Campbell) is so loveable, honest, charming, and funny.
This was the foundation of his character that has given me decades of enjoyment watching him evolve into the indestructable, and totally amusing deadite killer that he became.
2. Sam Raimi with his killer camera work is second to none.
3. It is still a cult classic, after 36 years. And I believe that every evil dead follower is just as rabid and loyal as myself. They know what I mean if ""they get it""
4. Brilliant writing, stories.
5. I LOVE THE SERIES!!!
About the movie? Simply put, four teens go to an old creepy cabin in the woods, wake up demons by reading from the book of the dead, which in turn possess the teens. Ash then, has to deal with crazy demons who are trying to get him to ""JOIN THEM"".
The BEST ""B"" movie ever made in my opinion. Lots of gore...lots of dumb choices made by the dumb teens, with honest blue collar special effects.

To round out the cast are Hal Delrich playing Scott, Theresa Tilly playing Shelly, and Betsy Baker as Linda, Ash's girlfriend.These five teens go to a cabin for a weekend getaway that Scott bought cheap (Gee, I wonder why?) But while exploring the cabin's basement with Ash, they find three objects, a shotgun, a tape recorder, and an ancient book bound in flesh and written in blood. Yeah, that's a good sign. Well, in true dumb teen fashion, they play the tape, which makes something evil come from the woods. Later that day Cheryl decides to check something outside, she thought she saw.

Next, behavior of characters in certain situations is, well, funny. Either they are too brave, or too scared to do anything. Special effects are very bad but that is not really problem since this is low-budget movie. Most of movie doesn't make any sense - for example - stupid dead women is laughing whole time on same way, no matter Ash (main character) is hitting her with steal.

Filmed for dirt cheap, The Evil Dead had to come up with ways in which to take shortcuts that would make it look good and be scary without looking silly. Thus was the first person perspective Sam Raimi is known for invented. Claymation, cheesy blood hoses, and milk vomit add to the enjoyable inventiveness of this movie.There's not much to say. The actors are all subpar, even Bruce Campbell is still gonna need a few years to iron himself out into a B-movie god. The story is weak and the script isn't particularly memorable, it'd only be with the next iterations we'd see the memorable parts. I feel that if this weren't attached to two other much better movies it'd have been lost, but despite that it's still an enjoyable cinematic treat and one of the most respectable horror films of the eighties.",The Evil Dead

One of the bests ever brought to the Horror genre!,9,1 November 2020,"The Evil Dead (1981) ReviewDirector - Sam RaimiPlot - The Evil Dead revolves around this group of college students who head to an isolated cabin and find a mysterious book, and accidentally release horrific events to occur by these terrifying demons known as ""Deadites.""My experience - When I was 14 years-old, it was around the Halloween season and I wanted to catch up on some horror movies I've never seen before and it just so happens that I found The Evil Dead free On Demand and the 2 biggest things that caught my eye was that Sam Raimi directed it (The same man behind the Spider-Man Trilogy) and the unexpected NC-17 rating. I was still a teenager, so I pulled off one of those ""I'm going to watch this anyway"" tropes, and my Auntie was the only person inside the house with me anyway, and she pretty much trusted me watching hardcore movies, mainly because she knew I really loved horror movies and cinema in general.From start to finish, The Evil Dead is an exploding experience! This is truly one of my all time favorite Horror movies with great acting, especially by Bruce Campbell, a simplistic, yet grisly story and a STUPID amount of gore. To me, The Evil Dead is one of the goriest movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing in the horror genre and only a few movies are able to match this kind of gore, with Dead Alive/Braindead being one of them and Cannibal Holocaust being another, The Evil Dead has to be one of the most graphically and disturbing horror movies I've ever seen! Aside from the gore and violence, the practical effects are astounding and are easily some of the greatest highlights of the entire film!This film also gives us a great introduction to the character of ""Ashley,"" who is later known as ""Ash"" in future movies and a 2015 TV Series. The dark humor and campiness of this movie also stands out perfectly, and a lot of people love this film for that, including myself, and not long after its release, it was clear to audiences that The Evil Dead would later become a cult phenomenon! Sam Raimi delivers some really clever shots in this film, while others may be out of focus at times, I have to give him credit for the shots he was able to make surprisingly well done! Sam Raimi really shows a lot of love with this film, especially with how he directs his actors and the way the Deadites themselves move around and attack people, it's very well done!The stunts in this movie are another thing I have to give praise to, because I'm pretty sure the 2 hardest things were to get the practical effects right and accomplish good stunts, while trying not to injure any of the actors. The Evil Dead is a movie that I adore, it's for sure one of my all time favorite horror movies and movies in general and it's a film that has stayed influential and revolutionary ever since its initial release. My only minor problem with the film are a few of the out of focus shots, but it doesn't truly hurt the film in any way, like I said, it's just minor.Grade - 9.5/10",The Evil Dead

413,the rock-17,a low budget horror milestone (possible spoiler),9,30 August 1999,"This movie, The Evil Dead, is the first out of the Evil Dead Trilogy, all directed by Sam Raimi (who also directed A Simple Plan, another great movie).  With an extremely low budget somewhere around only $50,000, Raimi had few options to try and scare the viewer.  He did an excellent job of doing so by using the camera as a tactic.  Examples of this in the film was when he would have the camera skim over the forest, making it seem like evil was around the cast and the cabin, was excellent.  also at the end, when Ash (the sole surviver of the Evil Dead, I told you this would be a spoiler) is walking out of the cabin in the day, thankful to be alive, and then the camera comes screaming through the forest, in through the cabin, through the doors, and out right on to the unsuspecting Ash was a great way to leave the movie open for a sequel.  Although the blood and gore was incredibly fake, you couldn't expect much more from a movie with a budget as low as it was. Out of the three movies in the Evil Dead trilogy, this one was geared toward horror the most.  The other two, especially Army of Darkness (which was basically all comedy), is geared toward the horror/comedy aspect, which is always entertaining.  If you're really in the mood for a nice treat, get the special edition DVD of this movie, with audio commentary by Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, among others.  It is excellent.

This movie introduced Bruce Campbell and his ""Ash"" character to the world and pop culture would never be the same again. Bruce is probably the best actor out of the bunch, but that really doesn't say much since the acting is pretty much atrocious. The wild and inventive camera-work and editing make up for it though. The special effects hold up surprisingly well and the filmmakers get extra points from me for creativity. No CGI here folks, this is down and dirty film-making at its best.

Watching this now a lot of people may dismiss this as low budget crap or a tad tacky, but when it was release in the early 80's, this was a horrorheads delight, and inspired so many great spin off so in true spinal tap tradition i'm giving it a 11/10",The Evil Dead
417,imlong54,More absurd than scary,5,19 October 2018,"I didn't shutter once when I finally saw this film for the first time last night. These 5 friends as portrayed here did not react like any human would in their situation. They're always leaving each other alone in dangerous situations, they're reluctant to help each other against the dead. The film is nonsensical and I found myself laughing and shaking my head instead of sitting on the edge of my seat. Good for a laugh, not for a scare.",The Evil Dead
418,DigitalShark1,Campy Fun,8,6 October 2021,"The Evil Dead has a unique charm to it that few movies do. It came out at a time where indie films were beginning to take off and film festivals were gaining more and more traction. The Evil Dead is a movie that proves you don't need millions of dollars or connections with incredibly famous people to make a good movie.Easily the best part of Evil Dead is it's cinematography. Every film student in the world has tried to figure out how to make a single cheap location look impressive and interesting and Sam Raimi somehow figured it out. Most shots are incredibly close up and generally have an little angle or movement to them. It may not sound super impressive but it really makes you feel like you're in the cabin with these college kids and keeps an incredible tension throughout the entire film.It's also the only film I can think of that's visuals are both funny and scary with the emphasis still being on scary. I would've said it was impossible to make scenes scary and funny otherwise and the only other film I can think that accomplished something similar was Little Shop of Horrors. But Little shop of horrors is still at it's heart meant to be a comedy, whereas The Evil Dead is meant to be a horror. Some scenes are so incredibly ridiculous (one famous scene in particular) that you want to laugh but still so disturbing that you can't. It's visuals are so campy and yet gave me chills looking at them. There's really no other movie that can do both.The Evil Dead is not a masterpiece by any means, but it's not trying to be. That's a huge part of the charm of it, there's not a scene in this movie that's even remotely pretentious. It feels like a movie that they had fun making and it equally fun to watch.",The Evil Dead
419,Nedla24,Truly Disturbing,10,22 August 2000,"Of all the words in the english language, disturbing is the best to describe Sam Raimi's cult horror classic.  The setup is simple enough; five friends rent a cabin in the woods and are attacked by evil spirits that inhabit bodies and go on a killing rampage, but it is on this seemingly cliche premise that Raimi builds a horror masterwork.  Evil Dead delivers in every aspect that you would expect of a horror movie and a few that are surprising.  While Evil Dead has mounds upon mounds of gore, billions of ""jump moments"", and other standard horror movie fare, it also builds genuine suspense.  Also the standard horror fare is top-shelf.  The Gore is frightening and not just sickening, the jump moments are perfectly timed and really make you jump.  Furthermore there is a sense of humanity faced with the unspeakable.  As a detatched viewer, you yell at the screen for Ash (Bruce Campbell) to take action, but you realize that faced with that situation you too would be frozen in horror.  Raimi does an excellent job of drawing his audience into the action with heavy doses of point of view shots and close ups that seem to bounce toward and away from the character.  These techniques are used with great success (and ripped off in the recent Blair Witch Project).  While the end may not be as satisfying as one would hope, any ending to this wonderfully horrible ordeal is a happy one.  I would like to end by saying that I am not a fan of the horror movie genre.  I find films like the Elm Street, Friday 13th, and Scream series to be highly stupid, but this movie is genuinely terrifying.  Recommended for those who really want to be scared and have a strong stomach",The Evil Dead
420,Nivera,Iconic,10,17 March 2021,"This low budget b movie spawned two well received sequels that I personally don't think are as good as the original. In my opinion, the over the top slightly comedic, but still scary nature of the movie worked much better then the dark absurd comedy in the sequels. It's cheesy but still interesting, unique, thrilling, and the effects were great for the time",The Evil Dead
421,monkeybone,One of the finest horror debuts ever.,10,27 July 2002,"Sam Raimi's directorial debut is a gore filled beauty of a film. It may not have award winning acting, but hey, who cares, it's still a load of fun to watch. Filmed on a micro-budget, 'The Evil Dead' is about five teenagers who are on vacation in a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. While there, they discover a book with ancient texts and a tape recorder which contains translations of said texts. Unwittingly, they play back the tape and unleash a horde of evil spirits that are lying dormant within the woods. What follows is a rollercoaster ride of mayhem and scares with a touch of humour. Director Raimi has created a cult classic and this is one movie that will be remembered throughout the annals of horror movie history. There are clear elements of inspiration in the film. Tobe Hooper's 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and George A. Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' are to name but two, which then only adds to the ferocity of the film. This is for hardened horror fans and will no doubt attract future fans to the genre. 'The Evil Dead' is a one hell of a ride.",The Evil Dead
422,cobra_011,What can i say.... CLASSIC,10,23 February 2003,This has to be one of the best low budget horror films of all time. Raimi knows how to work the camera and Bruce Campbell takes care of the acting. This is nothing like Army of Darkness. I can't think of any one-liners in this film. Also Bruce isn't a badass. If anything he's a wimp until the very end. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror films. 9/10,The Evil Dead
423,ThatSlackerOnSci-Fi,"The Evil Dead is what I love in a Horror film; gory, fun and actually scary...",8,21 February 2019,"The passion and skill that went into the film-making here is great, it takes many of the usual tropes and enhances them in its own way (especially with Sam Raimi's fantastic style of direction). The effects are also great but in the way they stay charming and aren't trying to be realistic (using a more Claymation style of effects which I love to see).As a person in a love/hate relationship with Horror it's a film that takes a Hammer Horror type of style and makes something new with it. It's a unique Horror film and one of the stand-outs of the genre.There's a reason why Evil Dead is touted as one of the Classics. It takes a small budget, hard work and makes a passion project that still holds up to this day. It's also interesting to see with how the Deadites mess with Ash and slowly drive him insane.Glad to finally get round to it, great Horror and mid-night movie, I give it a read the review/10.",The Evil Dead
424,Charlotte_Kaye,Great low budget American horror film!,9,29 March 2007,"Forget today's ""modern,"" ""hip,"" ""polished"" ""PG-13"" horror movies full of pretty people, recycled plots and cheesy computer effects. I'll take a cheaper, grittier and more audacious, inventive and humorous 80s horror movie any day of the week! Five people, led by future cult horror hero Bruce Campbell, rent a cabin way out in the middle of the woods. In the basement they find an ancient book, read a few passage out of it and all hell (literally) breaks loose! Several characters quickly become possessed by demons whose only mission is to kill the living. And that's all the plot this terrific little fright flick really needs. It's not a ""plot"" movie anyway, it's an exercise in horror in the purest sense; with atmosphere, mood, pacing, camera-work and splatter all at the forefront. Sam Raimi's now-classic film set new standards for levels of blood and gore way back in 1981, and the film stands the test of time miraculously well considering all the advancements in special effects since it was made. In fact, I actually prefer this old style mix of make-up effects and stop motion animation to pretty much all of today's films. Also of note is the invigorating point-of-view camera-work, which has been copied endlessly sense. ""Evil Dead"" is a fantastic, scary, funny, imaginative and gory good time not to be missed! I know a lot of people seem to prefer the 1987 sequel or even 1991's third installment ""Army of Darkness,"" but I'm still a much bigger fan of the look, feel and tone of the original.",The Evil Dead
425,biz`,Not bad as horror movies go.,6,8 November 1998,"This is the first and the worst of the Evil Dead movies. Actually, worst isn't a good term. This movie is pretty good and very similar to Evil Dead 2, but it lacks the humour that made the two sequels so good. This movie is basically a kinda gory suspenseful horror. You don't even need to see this one to enjoy the other two because Evil Dead 2 summarizes this one pretty effectively. By all means, go and see it, but don't expect the humour and camp of the other two, which are much better. What you will see is all the same great camera angles and techniques, which work really well in all three movies. Worth seeing.",The Evil Dead
426,Takeshi666,A masterpiece.,9,30 January 2003,"While not as good as The Shining, or horrible as all the sequels of Nightmare on Elm Street, the values of Evil Dead come from somewhere else. Just like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead was made on extremely low budget, but Evil Dead is a good proof that a movie with tiny budget can be great - Evil Dead was shot on a budget of only about $100'000, and yet they managed to make one of the biggest cult hits since TCM. It never got a cinematic success, but when it hit on video, the cult slowly formed up. Evil Dead was extremely succesful on video, and thanks to several releases it has survived to this day. Isn't it ironic how they have spent more money on releasing it on video than in making the  thing? Evil Dead will always be popular, there is no question about it. 9 out of 10.",The Evil Dead

It was made on a budget of $90,000 resulting in fake-looking gore. Most of the violence is also too comical and over the top to be taken seriously. However, as an example of how to make low-budget horror movies, this is one of the best. Featuring innovative camerwork, a creepy atmoshpere and a sinister soundtrack, the Evil Dead can either be watched to frighten you or just for the fun of watching Demons being hacked to pieces. It is not, however, as violent as George A. Romero's living dead trilogy.",The Evil Dead

I will start out by saying nothing new can touch this film, not even close! This movie is truly amazing knowing how low of a budget they had and could make a movie that can stand the test of time! I was never really a big Bruce campbell fan growing up, but now that I am older He is one of one of my favorite actors and Evil dead is one my favorites. I wouldn't recommend this flick to someone who scares easily, but if you are a bonafied gorehound and haven't seen it you don't know what you are missing! I got this on DVD with some cool extra's I have watched the film with Bruce""s documentary on it and he is really smart and funny, so sit back and turn out all the lights and enjoy the Evil Dead!!!!!",The Evil Dead

431,Fractalizer,Genre Defining Classic,7,17 March 2002,"Evil Dead got banned in Germany in 1985. This probably contributed a lot to its infamous reputation it enjoyed here during the second half of the 80s. Among teenagers it was _the_ movie to bring to a party and devide the guests into those who were ""brave"" enough to watch it and those who weren't.I remember one such party, I think it was 1990 already, were the movie was playing. I caught only about half of it (not including the gorier scenes at the end) because I was too busy experimenting with other stuff you tend to be very much interested in at the age of 16 (won't tell whether it was sex or drugs)... or maybe I just wasn't brave enough?Anyway, time moved on, the ban on the film was lifted in 1991, and you can now rent and buy it on DVD in various incarnations. So, I rented the ""full uncut"" UK release (PAL, Code 2, 86 min).OK, the violence in this picture is excessive but presented in a slapstick/comic book manner that makes it easily watchable. Acting is as bad as everyone is saying, but still it's hard to not like Bruce Campbells performance.I also liked the much acclaimed camera work. From the first minute on camera angles and movements are used to create suspense and the sense of some immaterial threat lurking in the woods.There are other very nicely done low-budget effects such as a mirror liquefying when one of the characters tries to touch it, which curiously reminded me of similar scene in The Matrix (done in CGI) that alone probably cost about as much as the complete Evil Dead.I'm not sure though whether, after 20 years, this movie is still scary. The Sixth Sense, for example, scared me much more (don't laugh).Still I guess it is a must-see for any fan of the genre. It is wonderfully campy and bits of it actually can pass as rather smart filmmaking, especially considering the highly limited budget.7/10 (this includes a bonus point for being the influential cult classic it is)",The Evil Dead

OK... here it goes: i think it's one of the most ridiculous and at the same time cool movies i'v seen!!! i laughed so much that i have trouble on just describing as a terror movie, more as a dark-gore comedy!!! u can c it's 80's without any doubts... plenty of goofs all over the movie, bad script (at least for the demons development and appearance) and weird weird blood ""ejaculations""!!! it's not scary at all and u can undoubtedely watch it with ur girlf if she has a dark sense of humour!!! just don't offer such a bad taste necklace!!! haha, that's pure evil!!! :P anyway, the movie follows a nice line and the effects are quite original and good for the year it was shot... a great scene that i'll always remember is the originality in the last scenes when the main actor goes to the basement... oh man... blood filling light bulbs and coming out of the pipes!!! hell yeah, pure evil!!! and the guy being illuminated by the projector and all the blood running down the wall behind him... beautiful beautiful beautiful!!! i'm really pleased with this low budget film, it's pure entertainment!!! and check well the last demons death, it's pure gore on its best form!!! and as always, zombies have more than 1colour of blood!!! ahah, actually these are 3-blood-coloured-like-zombies!!! and i like specially the blood part in the end when the book burns!!! oh man, run and watch it, it's so damn funny!!! gets a 7 for a good Sunday's night entertainment!!!",The Evil Dead
433,raimi3,The epitome of an underground classic,9,21 January 2002,"I know it goes against the popular mass, but Evil Dead is my favorite of the Dead trilogy. Yes, it is true that the Sam Raimi quirkiness seemed to become more and more apparent as the trilogy rolled along. Each film possesses its own personality, and I found the desperate solitude created in the smoky hills of Evil Dead the most cinematically effective. Evil Dead, to me, had the most in common with later Raimi films like The Gift and A Simple Plan. All three films relied on silence and surprise as its main technique. As opposed to the zany, eye grabbing  circus of his Army of Darkness, Evil Dead II & Darkman.To me, Evil Dead set the stage for a classic. We had young filmmakers, not yet tattered by the spoils of Hollywood, sacrificing everything to make a movie and a career for themselves. There was nothing for an audience to go on except what they're eyes were experiencing right at that very moment. I myself didn't expect to see a film with blood running down the screen. The violence and gore is legendary, only being eclipsed by Peter Jackon's ""Dead Alive."" Evil Dead, unlike most horror films, doesn't seem to exist only to bleed and spill though, but more to act as a window for young Sam's need to make movies. This is my favorite part about a filmmaker. I think that such an attitude produces the best results creatively. Hence, my stance on the dubbing of classic. Some might disagree to the fullest but that's just the way it is in the critical circle. I, however, will never stop recommending this movie.",The Evil Dead
434,fire-lizard,A Gorefest with Imagination,10,13 June 2008,"This film is about evil spirits taking over peoples' bodies and turning them into bloodthirsty zombie-like killers. I decided to see this film because I enjoyed director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films. I thought that this would just be some gore fest but judging from most of the positive reviews it got, I became sure that it was going to have some good in it. I was entertained from start to finish.The first thing I would say is Sam Raimi definitely has some talent. He takes his films very seriously and works very hard for them. this film shows that he can do gory horror films as well as spectacular superhero films.Its not just gore you get out of this horror film. It is also very chilling. The demons look extremely scary. Also the moving spirit is also quite creepy. Its mostly the way they move, look and talk. Their make-up was done extremely well.The acting was also very good. Bruce Campbell does the ""ash"" character very well. The other actors were good in this film as well. Unlike the sequels, there is no comic performances in this film. That in a way is a good thing but the sequels were still great entertaining movies.Overall The Evil Dead is a fun movie to watch. If you are in the mood for a horror film and you don't have a weak stomach, see this.",The Evil Dead
435,harfordamanda,cheap and wonderful *spoilers*,10,11 February 2010,"As a horror movie fan you have to give props to ""evil dead"" and it's creators for beginning ""the ultimate gross out horror movie genre"" which scary movies today emulate. For example look at Cabin Fever, it's the same premise: group of friends take a nice vacation out in the woods at a cabin that turns into a disgusting blood bath of guts and gore with it's cause seeming to never end but back to Evil Dead; the film its self is incredibly cheap, the acting by the supporting cast is for crap but the horror element of it remained. I thought Bruce Campbell was extremely convincing and his reactions through the whole movie at times made it absolutely frightening. I still to this day have to fast forward through the part where Linda is possessed by the demon and she's singing ""we're gonna get you"" oh it gives me the chills!! The other 2 sequels weren't as creepy as this one but for those who aren't fans of Evil Dead 2 and Army Of Darkness b/c of that lack of creepiness it allows you to watch Evil Dead all on it's own without wanting the story to continue and be perfectly fine with it. This series reminds me of the Return Of the Living Dead series where although different movies entirely they still have an element of same plot, same characters, same outcome.it's a great combination of horror and dark comedy making it truly classic.",The Evil Dead

When I first saw it, it ran for Eighty minutes and had the good stuff cut. Bugger! So, bought the DVD, good stuff back in equals RESULT! I can't really understand why the BBFC cut most of it. The effects, good back then, are lame.The actings a bit suspect but strangly....it works! And did you know there was a game of The Evil Dead released for thr Sinclair Spectrum waaaay back in 1983 that also got banned. Just for going round and carving up already dead people.

437,lolbleachfan,Cartoonishly Violent and I Love It!,8,2 January 2013,"'Evil Dead' is a movie that you really should go and see without having and prior knowledge of it whatsoever.The story is a group of buddies all going to a cabin somewhere in the rural Tenessee woods for a weekend getaway. When they get there, they discover a weird book and some tapes. The tapes belonged to an archaeologist who was studying the book and came to the cabin to not get distracted by anything at home, he explains how he believes this to be the book of the dead, or Necronomicon, itself. He managed to translate some of the writings and speaks them out loud of the tapes. The words summon demons to the cabin that slowly possess each of the friends one by one until the lone survivor, Ash, has to fight off the rest of the demons and somehow escape from woods alive.Now, as soon as you see the phrase 'group of buddies' in the context of a horror movie, you want to roll your eyes. Yeah, it's a horror movie cliché to have a bunch of boring and unlikable teens just there for the sake of getting killed. But wait! We actually care for their characters. Okay, they're not exactly three-dimensional Shakespeare characters but at least they are decent characters. Especially the relationship between Ash and his girlfriend, Linda. They're an adorable couple that you want to see live but it all ends in tragedy as the demons use Linda to torment Ash.The rest of the film? Really unique. There are very few films out there that can take place in one small space and hold my attention the entire running time. The cinematography is fantastic, with some shots really making you wonder how the hell they managed to do them. The atmosphere is fantastic, with very little music and more emphasis on sound effects. The wind blowing outside, the floorboards creaking, the squelchy noises the blood makes as the characters walk through them. Great stuff. The cabin itself is very creepy. If I saw anything like it in real life, I would just stay far away. It's widely known that the movie was on a really tight budget and the crew found the cabin abandoned in the forest. Knowing that makes it a whole more creepier.The effects are jaw-dropping and a true testament that practical effects will always beat CGI. The way the demons look, the white stuff they spray out of their mouth when they are stabbed or shot, the ridiculous amount of blood almost literally coming out the woodwork and the stop-motion finale.It's also pretty inspiring when you watch or read a lot of stuff that went on behind-the-scenes. How some of the effects where done, the hell the crew persevered through, the ridiculous controversy it caused especially in the UK but is now considered a horror classic. I highly recommend watching documentaries on the film if you have an interest in film making.Is there anything bad about the movie? Of course there is. While I did mention the characters were decent, the acting is a bit bland. Even Bruce Campbell as Ash who has become one of the biggest cult movie stars is nothing to write home about in this movie but when the characters become possessed, then they turn up the ham dial all the way up to 100 and it becomes far more entertaining. I also don't think I need to say anything about the infamous tree rape scene. It's just out of place even in a movie as crazy as 'Evil Dead.' Well, that's my take on it. If you haven't seen it, do me a favour and do it soon. It's one of the most creative, original, entertaining and greatest movies of all time.",The Evil Dead

The movie starts out slow-paced and gives you the feel of a campy low-budget horror flick, and it is. So, you watch and wait for the action to start and when it does, you are rewarded with plenty of gore but unfortunately, it's not very realistic gore. Most of the effects were done with clay and time-lapse cinema (yes, like those used in ""Santa Claus Is Comin To Town""). I felt the ""Violated by the Woods"" scene was rather dull. Gee, how difficult is it to think up a young woman having sex with trees? Not very. In other scenes, I felt they were plain annoying and stupid. The scene where Ash's girlfriend becomes a Cindy Brady demon is a perfect example. ""We're gonna get you, we're gonna get you.."").

Not many people could have pulled it off under the same set of circumstances. But MASTERPIECE?!!Please guys, be realistic.

The Evil Dead immediately sets you up in a creepy mood just by the first few minutes; I absolutely love it. Now right away you are introduced to the charterers, 5 high school students (or college I don't know for sure) all of them are clichéd no doubt about it except for one, he's different but I'll touch up on that later. The story now seems very basic people go into and abandoned cabin to die in weird ways, simple but at the time that was new. The rest of the movie keeps its scary and suspenseful mood that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the payoff. Now the movie gets interesting; all hell breaks loose... LITERALLY! Demons start to posses bodies and tress? Thats right trees and this is shown in one of the most disturbing/ darkly comedic movie scenes depending on your sense of humor. The demon makeup is very good and the gore, there is so much gore DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE SQUEAMISH!! But the gore is a lot of fun to watch. Now to the one different character, Ash. All the characters get an equal screen time but one by one they're picked off until Ash is the survivor now in the first movie he's not as interesting as the sequels. Now lets talk about the final 5-7 minutes, it's fantastic a true display of stop motion effects, wonderful! The Evil Dead: its a horror movie with non stop scares, an incredibly fast paced movie that never lets up, its scary, its fun, and it gets a 9.5 out of 10.

It also contained one of THE great performances from, at the time, an unknown Bruce Campbell who went on to show how good he is in Evil Dead 2.

446,freakyteenager666,The horror movie that started it all,10,29 November 2006,"The horror movie that begin the series, the video games, and the stage musical, Evil Dead is a well done cult classic made in such a small budget that you could even made yourself.The story is about Ash and his sister and friends are off to a cabin in the woods looking for fun and sex but soon to find a book holding a demonic force that they unleash, started off with Ash's sister getting attacked and raped by the trees in the forest and soon to have a demon inside of her body and one by one everyone of his friends are being turned into demons now it's up to Ash to stop the evil force that is surrounded the woods.After the success of Evil Dead it follow by two big budget hit films: Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, and the Army of Darkness and it made a series of video games and now there's a hit Off-Broadway musical based on the first two movies.Evil Dead is truly the horror movie of all horror movies.""All the men in my life are keep getting killed by Candairan Demons""",The Evil Dead
447,TGlimm,Angst and Estrangement,9,19 April 1999,"Forget about the scenes of grueling violence, the dismemberment of heavily bleeding zombies, the ultra-rapid decay of undead bodies at dawn - these are just the usual horror-flick gimmicks. What makes this movie a stunningly accomplished oeuvre is the powerful representation of existential angst - the estrangement of the individual from its environment, the epiphany of becoming aware of the fundamental gap between nature and the individual man, shown in incredibly powerful images in the last half an hour of the movie, when Ash feels that the house (being a symbol of his ""soul"") is surrounded by an unseen, totally incomprehensible, yet omnipotent ""evil"" (the ""absurd"") : Everything has changed, nothing is as it was before, there is nothing familiar anymore, nothing to hold on to - this is the exposition of the feeling of the absurd in Camus' sense. Being restricted to a very small setting and cast of actors which gives the movie nearly the feeling of a play, the whole conception of the archaically simple plot is directed towards this last moment of total estrangement. I am very well aware that probably, Raimi just wanted to shoot an entertaining horror flick, but what he (probably unintentionally) accomplished is one of the most powerful displays of angst and estrangement in film history.",The Evil Dead

Every time you think The Evil Dead might start to let up or change pace, it gets more disgusting, challenging and surreal. Essentially, the film melds the relentless evil of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" with the demonic spirituality of ""The Exorcist"" to produce an unforgiving, DIY, low-budget masterpiece. The various creative, resourceful effects and complicated, cheap rigs only add to the respect I have for The Evil Dead. It is my favorite illustration of how death comes ripping anytime, and in any way it chooses.",The Evil Dead

453,88keyz,I was never the same again...,10,29 September 1998,"I first seen this movie in 1983 very soon after if was first released on VHS.  At the time I was about 6 years old and I lived a 4 room shack out in the boonies.  This shack had no running water and the washroom was an outhouse, the shack itself consisted of a kitchen, family room and 2 bedrooms.  While I watched this movie I was horrified, but it was the long lasting effect that it had on me that was the worst.  I had nightmares for almost ten years, never being able to get the image of the deadite girl sitting on the floor, chanting ""We're going to get you"", out of my head.  I am 21 now and I still get scared watching Evil Dead to this day, and my fiancee refuses to watch it because she can't get to sleep that night if she does.  This is the effect that The Evil Dead has on people, and that is the reason that it is the greatest horror movie ever made.  Any movie that can leave this sort of long lasting effect on a life is truly a great movie, in any genre.  Thank you Sam Raimi, thanks for showing the world what fear is all about.",The Evil Dead
454,acole0228,Good old fashioned spooky cabin movie,8,5 April 2020,"There must be really something inherently creepy about cabins in the middle of the woods. Whether it's the isolation, vulnerability, the proximity to nature or the fact that it's pretty cheap to shoot a movie there (like this one), creepy cabins keep showing up in horror movies. It's basically a trope at this point.While this film series is well-known for incorporating humor and action elements, those are lacking in this film.. In a way, it kind of feels like a band's first album where they are piecing the elements together but still haven't found their sound. Ash Williams (played by Bruce Campbell) in the later films would become more action hero like, but in this movie him and the rest of the characters that venture to the cabin are just regular people.The story premise, which involves evil spirits being summoned through a book of the dead, is a bit silly (which is why Evil Dead 2 works so well as a kind of parody of the first movie), but The Evil Dead is so well made that this can be gladly ignored. Director Sam Raimi uses a lot of inventive camera work to make the horror feel real. Through POV shots, the invisible evil spirits in this film have a real physical presence, and there are plenty of great long takes that build up suspense perfectly. The effects are low-budget but work really well, and nothing is held back because there was no major studio they needed to deal with when making this movie.This movie is kind of the black sheep in the franchise, but it is still a very effective horror movie.",The Evil Dead
455,miketh,woefully overrated,3,21 March 2001,"Definition of a cult classic: a movie that never quite appealed to mainstream taste, but for some reason really appeals to a certain kind of person. With that in mind: Evil Dead is only going to be a cult classic for you if you're the certain kind of person that enjoys constant, gratuitous, vomit-inducing gore.Basic plotline: some teenagers go to stay in a creepy cabin in the woods. They discover an ancient Sumerian book -- the Necronomicon -- and unwittingly raise some evil spirits. And then everybody gets possessed and dies, with the sole exception of the hero. Wait, did I say ""dies""? I should have said ""gets torn limb from limb, gushes every conceivable kind of bodily fluid (and some inconceivable kinds), and just generally manages to perish in the most protracted and horrible way anyone could imagine"".Now, I have no basic objection to gore. In a good horror movie, the gore just highlights the terror, and adds a visually shocking element to it. But in this movie, there's really no suspense to go along with it; apart from a few false scares at the start, and some startling zombie attacks, it's really just constant, on-camera violence. I finished this movie feeling more ill than terrified.And humour? Well, unless you find something intrinsically hilarious about zombies chewing their own arms off, inflicting gaping wounds with pencils, and vomiting blood from neck-stumps, don't count on it. Even Bruce Campbell isn't any fun in this movie; he's basically here only to be terrorized, look put-upon, and get drenched with blood. This isn't the hilarious, manic Ash that makes the later movies worthwhile.",The Evil Dead
456,Thosle,"Play it again, Sam!",10,19 January 2003,"Sam Raimi is a genius! Evil Dead IS a classic horror film in a class by itself. Scarier than The Exorcist, and funnier than The Dead Hate the Living (both excellent movies}, Evil Dead is a must see for any true horror fan. I last watched it on the porch of a mountain cabin, very similar to the one in the film. What a rush! Very few horror movies deserve the praise that this one does. The cult that has arisen around this series is deserved. Too much gore? Impossible, although Braindead, aka Dead Alive, tries. It's great that both Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson gained opportunities to make some money with big budget hits, recently. Still, Evil Dead proves that ultimately it's not the budget that makes a great movie--it's the film makers. Ash should appear in the Freddy v Jason movie and kick both of their tails!",The Evil Dead

458,fidelio7,A wonderful combination of horror and humour,6,19 March 2011,"'The Evil Dead' is a wonderful combination of horror and humour. Made on a shoestring budget, it is extremely entertaining and very fast-moving. Bruce Campbell is excellent as the put-upon hero who must do battle with some very nasty and resourceful zombies.When five friends drive to a secluded cabin in the woods of Tennessee, they are looking forward to a fun weekend. But upon arriving at the aforementioned cabin, they discover a tape machine. When they play the tape, they hear a man reciting from the Book of the Dead. It is these recitations which awakens an unspeakable evil in the surrounding woods which possesses several of the group and transforms them into hideous, homicidal zombies. Pretty soon, Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams (Bruce Campbell) is the only one left who has not been transformed, and he must fight for his life.This is a thrilling and imaginative horror classic whose camera-work - like that in Peter Jackson's first film, 'Bad Taste' - is really splendid and cleverly conceived. The special effects makeup is very impressive considering the limited budget, and the film's most notorious scene - in which a major female character is raped by a tree - is completely unexpected and very twisted.That first-time director Sam Raimi should go on to such massive box office success with the 'Spider-Man' franchise is no surprise; you can feel a lot of fledgling talent at work when you watch 'The Evil Dead'. If you are a fan of horror, then this film, subtitled 'The Ultimate Experience in Gruelling Horror' is required viewing.",The Evil Dead

Some are entertained by the nonstop horror/violence, and some are scared witless by the demon like spirits that possess the kids. I myself fell in between the two groups. The movie has great horror movie elements and is also a great fantasy/action like movie. Its entertaining and fun, but not a comedy film, whereas the two sequels are.By the end of the film a heroine has sprung up in the form of Ash {Campbell}.

A friend of mine got a copy of the film on bootleg and we watched it in his house when his parents were out. Back in its day it was considered a video nasty and pretty tough going. At the time, I found it terrifying - especially the bit where the demon is locked in the cellar. I got to watch the film again recently and I thought that it had dated badly. The special effects look very wooden nowadays. However, it is a landmark film and one of the first of the zombie genre. It will always hold a place in cinema history. Sam Raimi is to be applauded for making such a successful film for such a small amount of money. The sequels were rubbish and turned the franchise into a comedy show.

Having had the luxury of having seen ""The Evil Dead"" in the theater with ED enthusiests and on the small screen, I can say that this film works well in both formats. Made on a shoe-string budget of around $350,000 dollars made by Sam, Bruce and Rob from showing thier short film ""Within the Woods"", the effects are cheesy but are still very well done. The camera angles, lighting, matte composite shots and sound work harmoniously together to create a truly special film which boils down to one man fighting off his recently turned zombie-esque friends in a cabin, all alone in the woods. True, the acting is a little stiff, but keep in mind that Bruce Campbell was only 21 when they shot it in 1979-1980. All of the great props of movie history are in the film such as the 1972 Oldsmobile 88 Supreme, the axe, the out of sequence costuming of artificial blood on the face and clothing, bookcases, mysterious dissappearing floodlights on the cabin roof, and a shovel to name a few.If you'd like a good scare and a little bit of laughter, get this film, turn off the lights, light a fire in the fireplace and settle in.",The Evil Dead

This, together with Megan's 360 head-roll in Exorcist, was one of the most dramatic possessed soul moment in films. I'd lost my bet with my pal (as I turned on the light immediately) and had to endure being called 'Duh' dude for a while. Nevertheless,the movie was darn frightening.

I don't remember seeing any male demons or any of the men getting thrown around and having their heads bashed open... no... not at all... for some reason only the women turn into these crazed lunatic demons and in turn are disgustingly and violently beaten to death by the non-possessed male characters. I am not a femme-Nazi, nor am I sensitive to violence and gore... but when it is so obvious that this movie was just an excuse to lash out in such an extremely negative way towards women and try to disguise it as a horror movie... I just had to say something. I've always thought that this movie was over-rated.

I think that I'm more attracted to the psychological thriller, having been weaned on Hitchcock. I stayed with ""The Evil Dead"" to the end, mainly because of all the hype I'd read about it here on IMDb. Overhype, I should say. Most of it seemed just really silly and never came close to getting me frightened...never got the pulse going more than a calm 80, not even close to what the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" did for me.

I'll admit, I jumped quite a few times with some of the jump scares, and I laughed my butt off. This movie is soooo funny! The camera angles are absolutely beautiful. I don't know what they did but it worked so well. While there were a few moments that I felt were kind of cheesy, i still enjoyed it. Especially since they were purposefully cheesy and ended up being really funny. In all honesty I think that this movie isn't for everyone. However if you are a fan of Sam's films then you will like this. I would say it's okay for teens 15 and up.

474,jones-ben42,Plot Holes Galore!,4,15 February 2011,"Sam Raimi's very first film seemed to get a pretty strong fan-base, so I decided to check it out. While the movie is scary at times, it is also insanely predictable and the characters are so stupid that it's astounding.The premise of this movie, while it seems somewhat like the Exorcist in the sense of the demons infecting living bodies, is pretty creative for the time. Basically, cursed words are spoken while a group of teenagers (or young adults, I can't really tell) are at a isolated mountain cabin and this wakes up demons which inhabit the bodies of the living. While the premise is pretty interesting, it is very formulaic. First off, there are FIVE friends as the main characters, the main character is a quiet, reserved guy, there's the arrogant, ""I can do anything"" type friend, and for Christ's sake, they're young adults ALL alone in the mountains in a small, creepy cabin. This movie just screams the HORROR genre. To the movie's credit though, the characters were picked off in an order I didn't expect, so it's not completely formula Horror style.Let's get right into this, plot holes and characters' decisions are the big downfall of this movie. I don't know if I ever rolled my eyes so much when watching a movie. There are a ton of them, so I list the ones I can remember. First off, why does the guy from the past on the tape actually say the cursed words that summon demons? Was he trying to bring horror to a bunch of random people in the mountains? I'd think that they be on a level beyond swear words, like since swear words are said on occasion when you're really mad, these words would never be said because they bring about the freaking apocalypse. Next, after they realize that the only way to get rid of these demons is body dismemberment, why don't they just take a shotgun to evil Cheryl's face then chainsaw her in pieces? This also brings up the question, why didn't evil Cheryl break out earlier? She showed at the end of the movie that she could just break the lock on the cellar, so why didn't she break out and sneak up on them when they weren't looking and just kill them all? It's obvious that that was the demon's goal was anyway, so why put it off? Then, once stupid Shelly becomes demon person number 2, the arrogant character seems to know what the hell he's doing and starts trying to kill her in many different ways, but the main character is just standing on the sidelines holding a dang ax doing nothing while his friend is beating up, and getting beat up by his girlfriend. Where the heck are this guy's balls? He knows that this isn't the same chick that he knew, so why doesn't he just help him out? You know this would be a great time for Cheryl to ""surprise"" her brother. Then the friend has to take the ax from him to kill Shelly for good. During this whole time, Linda has been snoozing up a storm not batting an eye. Why? Wouldn't she hear a demon screaming in the other room? Then Linda wakes up as demon number 3 after being stabbed by a pencil by Cheryl. This begs the question, how come Ash can have their blood all over him but not turn into a demon and Linda can just get stabbed by a pencil, not even like physical contact with the demon, and become infected? Then, once Ash finally seems like he's getting some balls and is about to dismember his girlfriend with a chainsaw, he stops because he looks at a necklace which holds no significant value, except that he gave it to her. Doesn't he know that she'll just come back as a demon and try to kill him? And on that note, for a large portion when Linda is a demon she just sits and stares at him and does nothing at all to try and kill him. Why? He's already dealing with another demon so why not just double team him to take him down? That was their goal, so why not set out to accomplish it? Skip ahead to the end, and all it takes to bring these guys down is to destroy a book that they found in the basement. If that's all it took, then why didn't he do it earlier? Nothing told him at that very moment to burn the book, so that tells me that he knew about this beforehand, so he could have just ended the crisis from the start by just burning it when Cheryl became a demon. Then in the last shot we see that everything seems fine and resolved, but then something comes up from behind and scares Ash white. What was it? It couldn't have been a demon, or at least it shouldn't have, because he burned the evil book, which seemed to do wonders to the other two in the room at the time. Maybe it was a scarecrow. I assume that we're suppose to believe it is another demon, but that doesn't make sense given that their book was destroyed. Maybe it was explained in the sequel, but the ending just doesn't make sense to me at all.There are tons of holes in this movie, and I don't get how people can just sit through all the BS that these characters do. I've heard the sequel is better, but I'm not going to hold out much hope given how disappointed I was with this one.",The Evil Dead

At first it is just little stuff like Cheryl being forced to draw creepy books or trapdoors randomly slamming open. When they explore the basement of the cabin they find The Book of the Dead and a skull bone dagger thing that according to Scotty looks like something Ash might have got it on with. They listen to a tape recording where the previous owner of the cabin reads some text from The Book of the Dead. One of these incantations releases the demons and they possesses Cheryl in one of the most awkward way possible. From then on the story is about the group surviving the onslaught of demons that are called Deadites. So the story is simple but the Deadites have this cool mythology setup and once these things are established, the second half of the story is non-stop horror. If you can really bring the scares in a horror film, you can get away with a slim story. The story just does its job at getting Ash to the point where his friends and family torturing him.The main character Ash is usually known as a bad ass one-liners Deadite killing machine. That is not the case in the original movie as he is kind of a goof ball. Ash is still a great protagonist and is the most likable in the movie; just don't get disappointed if you want to see Ash crudely attach a chainsaw to his hand. The real attraction in the first movie is not Ash, it is the Deadites.The Deadite makeup looks amazing and is better the most zombie affects nowadays. The thing that really makes the Deadites is the actors that play them. The one Deadite that really stands out is Cheryl just for her Deadite voice. Ellen Sandweise seems to be having the time of her life just being as evil and creepy as possible. All the Deadites have their own bits of personality to them. Deadite Linda also has this really creepy song in the movie while she is lurking outside the window that is just plain disturbing.Another area that this movie really excels in is the blood and the gore. The Deadites are not afraid to get their hands dirty, like in a part of the movie when a Deadite gets its hand cut and the Deadite just bites it clean off. To kill a Deadite is upsetting for the characters because you have to kill a friend and because there deaths are really gruesome. Deadites really know how to milk a death because they won't just die; they will spurt out blood or leak out some really nasty yellow stuff. This film may not have the same kind of blood and violence modern horror film has, but it knows how to use it all creatively.The music score in the film is kind of a disappointment as it really just sounds like standard horror movie music. The sound that the evil force makes is the only really interesting sound in the movie. The force sound is one of the more iconic things in the movie.At the end of the movie, while under attack from Deadite Cheryl and Scotty, Ash manages to throw The Book of the Dead into the fireplace and then out of the blue they like explode. With some of the best stop-motion I have seen, satanic hands burst out of the Deadites and they like dissolve into plies of bugs and pus and it is truly memorable.Sometimes the Deadite makeup effects look a little silly and there are some inconsistencies with the way things look, but who cares! This film is a great bit of cinema and Sam Rami shows that you don't have to get everything right to make a great horror film.A must see for horror fans 8.5/10",The Evil Dead
476,MovieLad26,A classic in the eyes of horror enthusiasts and horror movie fans!,8,4 April 2013,"When I was a kid, horror movies scared the living crap out of me. It didn't matter what the subject matter was, or what kind of horror drove the film. If it was scary, I wasn't watching it. But then I came across ""The Evil Dead"". A film that's not only scary, but fun as well. I can't say within any degree of accuracy what possessed me (No pun intended) to watch this film, but I'm glad I did. The plot centres on a group of friends who visit an old abandoned cabin together. Upon getting there, they unintentionally awaken an evil entity that (surprise, surprise) possesses them, one by one, until the hero of the film, Ash (Bruce Campbell's trademark role) is left alone to survive. The film is not only original in terms of cinematography, but it's gory, too! If you have a sense of wits about you, and you enjoy horror movies like me, then check this film out!",The Evil Dead
477,nickgodfrey,If you go down to the woods today.....,10,13 July 2021,"Evil Dead is still the horror classic I remember and this film is a must-have in any horror film fan's collection.Ultra low budget combined with talent produced one of the best horror's ever seen.5 kids go to a deserted cabin in the woods and stumble across an old book and a tape. The tape gets played and summons dormant demons, who then proceed to possess them in a variety of gruesome ways.There is gore aplenty as blood and bodily fluids spray the cabin and the actors and Raimi really puts his cast through the meat grinder, particularly Bruce Campbell.Originally filmed around Nov 1979 when Sam Raimi had just turned 20, the funds for the film had been cobbled together from an 8mm short called ""Within the Woods"".The cast and crew (around 13 of them) all lived in the aforementioned cabin for the 12 week shoot and by all accounts the filming was as gruelling as the finished film.Of course the low budget shows in places, but Raimi's style shines through. Marvellously innovative camerawork stand out along with Joe LaDuca's spooky music and Tom Sullivan's gooey effects work. The demons are frightening when they appear and this is the stuff of nightmares.I haven't seen the remake as I'm not a fan of remakes (laziness is no excuse for a lack of talent) so I'll leave this classic right here.",The Evil Dead

480,killer_tray,Evil dead: one great low-budget ride,9,21 July 2006,"The evil dead, one of the great low-budget horror films, proves that everyone can do something in a film, that little too no money shouldn't stop you from achieving your goals, and people who don't have sex in horror films can die.Ash(Bruce Campbell) is camping out with his friends in an old creepy cabin when they find a tape recorder and a ugly-looking book(book of the dead). the voice on the recorder reads out a spell that brings out the demons of another world. Ash is now made almost the antihero when he becomes the last person alive from the horrible ordeal.This film wasn't always smooth sailing(as if any low-budget film is), the movie in whole took 5 years to make because of lack of funding. You can see Bruce age from age 21 to age 26, you also see him sustain real injuries and many of the cuts on his face during the film are real. Also many of the actors left the film during filming, so many locals were called to finished the characters role, including Sam Raimi(director) and his brother Ted(who is in almost everyone of his brothers films).Unlike other horror films, there is no sex,(""there's no hanky-panky in this film, kids!""-Bruce Campbell). Which makes the film more professional, But Sam still flashed a girl topless just for laughs. Sam tried to capture what real teenagers would do in a cabin miles from the nearest town, But when Bruce inhaled real marijuana smoke in front of the camera for a scene, he was totally senseless(he'd never done drugs before). But still the totally untrained actors tried there best to do every stunt, every emotion, everything that Sam threw at them for as little pay as $100 a week. One of the hardest scene to shoot was the last. How are we to end this film with a good kick? how about...The ""Force"" running through the house and into Ash. True non-acting locals were called in to do the sequence of doors, noises and Sam himself was behind the camera. He started at a shot of a leaf on the ground, then started running through the woods, through the back door, through the closed doors of the house, out the front door and straight into Bruce. Although there was a rumor that Sam did the whole scene on a motorbike because of the speed the camera seems to be going. The Evil Dead, a real start for Bruce Campbell and for Sam Raimi(who directed Spiderman+Spiderman 2), a true masterpiece for low-budget film history.",The Evil Dead

In fact half way through  we ended up fast forwarding the rest of the movie till the end, & that was only because I insisted (I hate not finishing a movie). I really don't think we missed anything. They had to have shown the same background outside the cabin 10 times or more, the special effects were so fake & very over done. On the scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 0.

At that time in the UK a list of Video Nasties gained notoriety and a ""must see"" attitude was manufactured as a result. Proudly at the top of this list was The Evil Dead. I hunted down a copy from a local video shop, he kept it under the counter, it cost me £5 just for one evening to rent and me and my group of mates sat in a dark room and watched. We had a ball! Terrified, thrilled, excited, entertained. By todays standards of course the effects are cheesy and cheap, the make up is not very well done, the whole production looks aged and not shiny and polished like the modern horror that we all expect nowadays. But what this movie did have was an eerie sense of ""what you are about to see"" and it didn't disappoint. Jumps galore, just enough gore to make you wince, great performances from the then unknown cast and rock solid direction from Sam Raimi. Kids nowadays will claim ""overrated"" or ""cheap and nasty"" but they are missing the point, and unfortunately for them, missing out. I bet those same modern kids would say Psycho was rubbish ""black and white"", ""corny acting"" ""slow"" or ""tame"" - but watch these movies at the time of release and see them as the works of genius they are.",The Evil Dead

This movie took years to actually complete, because the actors (hehe) were college kids with other things to do, but damn was it worth it. As a person whos into films some may call ""artsy"", i.e. Begotten or Lynch films, I have to say this is just as good as any. For such a low budget film, the effects really are quite impressive, and if not impressive, at least innovative. The sequels are genius as well, but the first is easily the best.

""Evil Dead"" is a legendary cult classic that will both scare you and make you laugh. Some people argue that ""Evil Dead 2"" is better, but I disagree. The original ""Evil Dead"" is quite gruesome, thus it is very entertaining. Demonic zombies? People possessed by evil spirits? Evil trees? Now that's a movie for you. This is a great movie to watch late at night in the dark, and it is classifiable as a ""midnight movie"". Evil Dead is not like any other zombie movie that you may have seen; this one is quite original, and it lacks elements of the generic and clichéd zombie movie elements.

489,The_StickMen,A B-Movie Horror Gem,9,10 May 2004,"A first from a common favorite of mine, director Sam Raimi, and it shows. This movie is amateurish in many ways, the acting is subpar (but eventually leads to the rise of horror icon Bruce Campbell), and the story (now at least) is recycled.  What stands out about this gem is the directing, this film is double-dipped in style and I would see it just to experience that aspect of it.  This film also reeks of blood, the gore, even by todays standards, is astounding and the violence is quite startling (it is unrated mind you).  Other than that, the little score that is used in the movie is also quite chilling at times.  Check out this B-Movie classic and get a good thrill (also see the sequels).",The Evil Dead

While looking in the cabin's basement, they find a weird book, which happens to be the Book Of The Dead, a book bound in human flesh and inked in blood; and also a tape.

Sam Raimi has done an incredible job as a director, with a perfect camera work, lots of blood and gore, great story...

At the beginning it's easy to get lost in the character's stories, understandable for what's really in store. Just minutes it already tries to creep you, but the 'good' stuff really comes in later on. Basically the movie will try to haunt and creep you all the way to the end. It does a good job at that. The setting feels somewhat clamped in, which adds to the overall ambient horror. Acting may be cheezy and visuals korny. I enjoyed the film although they could have done things better but what more could they have done back then?Because of modern horror films of late, many may not appreciate the movie. I have to admit I can't deny being jaded. If you see beyond that then you can appreciate the smart visuals, gore and terror material, which is what highlights this movie I believe.",The Evil Dead

The effects were actually surprisingly well done for low budget.  The acting is very well done and believeable but the Scotty character spouts out some bad dialogue from time to time.  Some of the scenes can be quite laughable like when Cheryl first gets possessed and spouts off death threats and they just stand there like ""What's wrong with her,"" not even acknowleging the fact that she was levitating and is getting uglier by the minute.  This movie also had some campy humor mixed in a few scenes as well and a great gory filled ending that you'll love.  As for plot wise, it's simple but I won't tell, you'll have to watch for yourself. Also, you have to watch for the tree rape scene, poor Cheryl.  If you want to see this movie how it should be, buy one of the re-released versions by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

While it is not the best, that distinction would definitely have to fall to the second in the series, it has it's place in history as the film that launched the careers of Sam Raimi (writer/director) and Bruce Campbell (star).A simplistic plot, which is just really an excuse to showcase the excellent (for the most part) special effects and the virtuoso camera movements of director Raimi.The film also deserves notice as one of the slate of horror films that got fledgling studio New Line off the ground.But perhaps the finest achievement of the film is it's continued influence on films to this day.  Not just the low budget horror genre, but all films across the board.  I don't know if Sam Raimi realized he was creating some revolutionary techniques at the time, but his film has stood the test of time and Raimi is finally getting his due in hits like Darkman and the critically acclaimed A Simple Plan (which is actually far more frightening than this film).Raimi is currently directing Spiderman and I for one cannot wait to see what this master of the camera has in store with a budget that ridiculous.",The Evil Dead

The tongue-in-cheek humor, gore and often hilarious shock tactics work together to create a rather awesome experience.

Another thing is, this movie is full of goofs and that irritated me, I mean when Scotty was hitting Cheryl with the ax to put her in the cellar and you can see it is not Cheryl but a doll that is doesn't look like her, I know it is a low budget film but they could either use a foam ax or don't show Cheryl. The part were Linda spits blood and her face is covered with blood when Ash takes her outside the blood disappears from her face, and you don't need a mega budget to just leave the blood in her face, I mean it's a low budget film but doesn't mean that the blood will be removed, that means they forgot the next day they came back to shoot the film",The Evil Dead

Wtf?,2,23 September 2012,"Can you explain to me why this movie is so great?This is a stupid nonsense slasher movie.From the get go everybody seams like they are retarded or something.A girl is rape by a ""bush"", no, no the president, but a real tree bush, with no reason later in the film or explication or meaning for the development of the nonexistent plot.The demon/women seams like joker fans on drugs.The lines, when they say something, are worthless.And don't get me wrong, i am not talking of FXs.

But I think some people actually believe this is a good movie by itself.  One guy even expressed awe at the tree gangbang fiasco.  This is disconcerting.  As a horror movie, The Evil Dead is laughable.  But even if Raimi had tongue-in-cheek shlock in mind, I think it is hopelessly flawed.  Sure, we all feel smart when we're sharing an inside joke with a director.  But how long can that last?  How long can we smirk at a movie?  The fact that both the audience and Raimi know it's achingly dull doesn't make it right.",The Evil Dead
513,Aurdreyen,This is how Horror movies should be.,10,31 December 2011,"The Evil Dead is probably the most violent,graphic and disturbing movie in existence. But this is how horror movies should be. Five college friends traveling to the woods, where they release flesh eating demons that starts to take them, one by one. I rate my movies in 4 categories; cinematography, Film-making,Acting and the Overall experience.Cintemography: The cinematography is this movie is cheap. Cheap budget gives cheap lighting and cheap visual effects. Ha ha I bet your thinking ""Why would you like it then?"" But that's the catch, the cheap effects in this movie MAKE it so good. The way everyone is cheap brings out true horror effects,it gives a disturbing undertone. so who needs a large budget? 25/25Film-making: Despite the cheap cinematography, the camera angles are amazing. They're very dramatic, especially the flying camera intro scene, that give the movie an eerie tone. 25/25Acting: For people who aren't even real actors, this is amazing. Not just when they're casually talking to each other, but when they're possessed demons. They're truly brilliant. 21/25Overall Experience: This movie is very entertaining, very. It keeps you on your toes trying to intercept what will happen next, who is possessed or really immune and who will survive. Marvelous horror movie, especially because the budget is so small, this Horror movie could teach modern horrors a thing or two. 25/25Overall score: 96/100",The Evil Dead

The story is secondary to this movie...ha ha ha! It gets very splattery...but in the end its basically a very black comedy disguised a zombie splatter film.In the sequels Raimi unveils all the comedy in a more slapstick manner.I always prefer the first, but then again I *LOVE* black comedy!

The Evil Dead is fascinating, the cabin is really old, the script is awesome; but beyond all this, you have one of the most disturbing film ever. Indeed, you don't show this to children. Some scenes are violent, some others are completely mad, but, you're still able to enjoy it, watch it many times, again and again, with passion. Not the funniest movie ever, right, but, as i said before, some mad scenes, by the extreme of the thing itself, can make you kind of laugh.

516,thekesslerboy,just watched this again after 31 years,8,10 January 2014,"When I was 14 / 15 myself and two school friends used to go to our local cinema in Glasgow for the Wednesday night skuddie / horror double-bill. Allow me to clarify. The opening / supporting film would usually be a soft porn flick, and the main feature would be the latest horror. The man on the door would enquire re our age, to which we would reply ""18, mate"" - and that was us in.We had an arrangement that we would each bring something to the party. And so it was that cans of lager, cigars and so on, were transported from our homes to the picture-house in large coats.If I shouldn't move from here, I can remember - with one of my old Granda's cigars in one hand and a can of lager in the other - saying to my pals, as we settled down for The Evil Dead, how I was sick and tired of being disappointed by these would-be scary films about young Americans getting murdered on rural holidays. Not this one, one of my mates assured me. He'd seen the clips, and they were enough to convince him that this film would be different. And he was right.All the knock knock knockin on horror's door stuff was familiar enough, but once it all kicked off, it was a relentless, concentrated gorefest. There is no doubt that I had never been so captivated by a horror film in my life. For once, I had got what I paid for, and was thoroughly entertained.So, how did it look tonight, all these years on? Might sound daft, but I think that one of the things that 'dates' early 80's horrors (and Sci-Fi's) is the electro-drone music. But, I enjoyed the sfx - very European, with touches of The Thing near the end. Has there been a better horror film than this made since? I think that The Omen is a better horror than this - but it's older, and very different. And I would say the same of a number of other films. However, I cannot think of a younger horror film that is a better horror film than this. Then again, as you'll have worked out for yourself, it's all changed since my day - all of this was just fields, you know.",The Evil Dead

First of all, the demonic forces don't throw things around or cant make the dead alive. this is stupid. If you wanna see real horror watch exorcism of Emily rose and try to compare the two. In E.O.E.Rose the horror is created just with the superb acting and dialogs. there is no one vomiting colorful liquid, blood all around or trees raping people.Has anyone ever felt scared in real life? In real life the horror comes from our feelings inside that cause us to perceive the ordinary things around us in a different way than normal. Demonic forces just use these inside feelings and scare the possessed ones make them act insane. sometimes give them knowledge which may be good or bad. but NEVER can they make person do things which are physically impossible.People who are possessed (and there are very few most of them are psychotics) cant so things like flying around or other wonderful feats.

Let's just say Evil Dead does not disappoint.I bought A Nightmare On Elm Street and The Evil Dead to see some horror classics. I watched Nightmare first and wasn't creeped out much. I then watched The Evil Dead (this was quite late at night) Big mistake.It is known as one of the goriest and scariest films ever made and it lives up to its expectations. The suspense is fantastic and the film builds up to a brilliant ending. It looks like an old classic which may not be scary compared to films today, but this has scared me way more than any horror film from the 2010s.Overall, brilliant film because it scares the heeby jeebies out of you!",The Evil Dead

522,rickets,The Ultimate Horror Film,10,25 August 2002,Evil Dead is quite possibly the greatest horror film ever.  It was a great debut for Sam Raimi and I am still amazed Bruce Campbell didn't become a big mainstream actor.

Everything about it, the gore, the special effects, the setting, the theme, the plot and the camera work the lot! I first heard about this film when i was about 7 or 8 and we got the game on ps1. After that, the fascination began. Took me a while to watch it as this film used to scare me a heck of a lot. But once i was able to watch it, its been my favourite horror film since. This film has inspired me to pursue a career in media. It might sound odd but honestly this film is that good. If your a fan of the B movie horror films then this should be a favourite. This is the king of B movie horrors. It doesn't have great special effects (at all) but thats why this film is amazing. The over-the-top violence is endulging. Sam Raimi's best film. The camera technique when the camera goes over the rafters is just brilliant. If your a lover of horror films, this is a must. Every horror fan must/would've seen this film! Class!",The Evil Dead

Definitely a must-see if you really like classic horror movies, or if you're just into really campy amounts of gore and violence. And let me assure you, this movie is extremely campy. The acting is for the most part awful, despite a star-making performance from Bruce Campbell. However, your not seeing this movie for how well its acted, your seeing this because its a horror film thats meant to scare you, and on that front it certainly delivers. This movie will definitely make you jump as well as squirm. From the creepy, prolonged sequences of wandering in silence to the actual bodily dismemberment scenes, this is a pretty terrifying ride. Sam Raimi's directorial debut with this movie is one of the best debuts ever. From the way its shot, right down to the music, this movie was executed and designed perfectly. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It is a must-see movie for horror fans everywhere. The direction is great, the scares/kill scenes are original and truly frightening, and at times it's really funny and campy. The only reason it isn't a perfect 10 is because the acting was really cheesy and I didn't feel emotionally attached to any of the characters and didn't care when they died. Otherwise, great low-budget horror film, easily one of the best.",The Evil Dead
526,darkness_is_your_ally,"scary, violent, creepy soundtrack and bad acting!",6,14 August 2012,"Having recently just watched this film for the first time and seeing a 7.6 rating on IMDb before hand, i have to say that this film did not live up to those expectations and mildly disappointed me. I did not hate this film, nor did I love it, what I can say is that I understand its cult following and I can appreciate it for what it is, and that is a decent horror flick, written and directed by Sam Rami. Now to begin, I was never expecting solid, performances or an Oscar winning role, but for what it was i just couldn't feel much more than, these people will eventually die (basic horror logic) and to be honest i'm not that bothered about it either,and that to me is down to a poorly written script or down down to bad casting, but none the less, i felt No sympathy for any of them, apart from the only believable character, to which i could believe is the point, and this would be ash; who was a bit more three dimensional and stood out more than the others, rather than using clichéd horror thinking and doing stupid s**t (ignoring the basement scene). Now putting acting aside and looking at it for what it was it was otherwise pretty good; one thing things I especially loved was the score that was pieced to each and every scene, it really gives the film that horror edge and makes you quiver with fear, even if there is nothing particularly haunting happening in that given time; pretty much that I know somethings going to happen but when; and the score builds this up perfectly for say when two arms smash through a door. another thing that I though was absolutely great in this film was the special effects, oh how I miss the simpler films, where things can look better than CGI and at the same time not be spending wad loads of cash on it; going back to the special effects, the make up for the zombified humans was disturbingly frightening, especially Cheryl and creepy ass laugh. the ending scene with the melting corpses clearly made out of plaster scene (or clay for the Americans) was so cool, and because it looked like it had that skin like texture, it made it seem more like it was melting than if it was being done nowadays in CGI, thing is to me, is that realism can ruin things like that and thats why this film is very entertaining for the genre that it is. however another small gripe I have is the way the film is shot, the camera annoys the hell out of me, reminds me of home videos that have been shot by a budding film maker in his teens. The whole floaty cam and as if it is the evil spirit, it just bugs me, and I don't really know why. Overall I really enjoyed the story, because if you don't read any synopsis' it really does help to make it a better story, the special effects are awesome, the music is incredibly creepy and frightening, yet the acting lets the film down. well worth a watch though, and for some classic 80's cheese horror, i would certainly recommend this film, as long as you remember it is not meant to be a masterpiece. I'm off to watch Evil Dead 2 to see what happens in the continued story. 6.5/10",The Evil Dead
527,dain84-743-188250,Creating originality,7,10 May 2019,"There's something about this film that really resonates; moreso than the perfected comedy and cinematography of the more acclaimed Evil Dead 2. There's a special place in horror (and in my heart) for the entire film series all the way through Ash vs Evil Dead (which I advise anyone reading this to watch all seasons). But, seeing the initial product of Raimi's vision still satisfies in ways none of the others do. A specific view that's been copied over and over and yet this film still buries all that try to emulate this look; a much darker forlorn aspect that even the remake (the Mia one) can't match. Much love for all but this original stands the test of horror time",The Evil Dead

529,marcusfernandez-28887,Grates on Your Skin Like Sandpaper in the Best Way Possible,8,27 November 2020,"Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is a beloved horror classic. Despite playing with familiar tropes, what The Evil Dead manages is completely unique. It's a wild ride that ignited one of the most exciting horror franchises. However, it was no easy task to bring The Evil Dead to life.The story is really as simple as it gets. A group of friends travel to a cabin and accidently awaken demonic spirits from the book of the dead. It's a straightforward premise that wastes no time.The audience is swiftly introduced to the characters led by Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell). Barring a few scenes, the film rarely strays much further than the cabin. The majority of the movie takes place at night with the characters stranded and surrounded by the woods.It's a brilliant set up and before you know it, the adventure begins.The Evil Dead is completely aware of what it is. It doesn't try to reach beyond its budget, nor does it shy away from taking risks. What makes The Evil Dead special is its bizarre realism. As unusual as that sounds, it's precisely what puts The Evil Dead in its own sub-genre of horror.The film masterfully hints at something evil at the cabin long before the demons show up. From the bench that repeatedly knocks the side of the cabin to the long and silent shots of the woods. The first act of the film uses its setting, the sounds and cinematography to create a sense of foreboding.It's an unsettling atmosphere that perfectly sets the mood for what's to come.However, the real trademark of The Evil Dead and of the franchise is the campiness. It's horror that borders on being silly. The film brings together genres that are normally regarded logical opposites. Horror and comedy.Audiences were caught unawares, despite being undoubtedly a horror movie, The Evil Dead finds a way to simultaneously be amusing. A lot of that rides on Bruce Campbell's excellent performance.Ash Williams is your typical reckless teenager, wild and bold. Campbell gives Ash that fiery spirit. Yes, his performance is over-the-top and exaggerated but it's clearly intentional. Campbell, rather ironically, gives The Evil Dead life.Ash is instantly likeable despite his character making questionable choices throughout the film. That being said, character development is not the film's strength. We don't learn much about any of the characters and most of the performances are just about decent enough. However, these rough edges only add to the experience. Raimi is not looking for an Oscar here, he instead crafts something crude and raw that grates on your skin like sandpaper.The film pulls no punches, despite its tiny budget, The Evil Dead is a gorefest like no other. It's a beautiful display of practical effects from demon trees to melting corpses. The film was banned in several countries and even Sam Raimi acknowledges that he may have gone too far at times. Yet despite the storm it kicked up, it only proved the film's commitment. Without the intervention of studios or executives, The Evil Dead was Raimi's vision actualized.The Evil Dead was a journey and not an easy one. Made with a budget under half a million dollars, Sam Raimi had to squeeze dry the few resources he had to complete the film. Frequent collaborators and friends since kids, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell managed to gather the funds for the movie.Soon production began and filming started at the cabin. Bruce Campbell would later describe it in an interview as ""twelve weeks of mirthless exercise in agony"" yet despite the setbacks and consistent hurdles as a result of the small budget, The Evil Dead was a film created with passion and a true love for filmmaking.Several actors left during production, the crew had to cease production often to gather funds, a multitude of injuries occurred on set and yet Raimi pushed on with his vision. The result was a film that grossed $2.4 million domestically and received the praise of Stephen King who called it one of his favorite films.There's no denying The Evil Dead is flawed, and it certainly is not a film for everyone. But the flaws are part of the flavor. In fact, polishing the rough edges in the film might in fact result in an inferior experience. It's unusual but it's another of several reasons that makes The Evil Dead special.Despite being a horror movie, it also finds a way to poke fun at the genre, an approach that would take center stage in the subsequent films. It's silly, it's exaggerated but also relentlessly distressing. It's an interesting emotional concoction that no other franchise has quite created.Yes, it's a horror movie but it's also something else. A genre that cannot be labelled or perhaps shouldn't be and that belongs solely to the remarkable work of Raimi and Campbell.Yet the strongest message of The Evil Dead is the fact that with passion behind and in front of the camera, with a true love for filmmaking, a movie is unstoppable.",The Evil Dead
530,MovieInYourFace,Greatest horror movie of its genre,9,4 November 1998,"I watched Evil Dead for the first time this halloween(1998) and I immediately became an ""evil dead head"".  It is about 5 friends that go out to an old cabin in the middle of the woods and stumble upon an old tape recorder which recites ancient words bringing an evil spirit into this world.  Although, it is one of the scariest and gruesome movies I have ever seen, It also has its comedic moments as well.   This has got to be the greatest horror movie I have ever seen in my life.  Bruce Cambell (Ash the hero) gradually transforms from an everyday-joe into a rough-and-tough killing machine (not to mention his dwindling sanity).  I totally dig the special effects and the mix of horror and comedy.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an original scare.  Overall: Great movie (10 stars)",The Evil Dead

They open a book of the dead and listen to a former visitors diary and accidently re awake the evil dead. Although this story lacks deeply the directing and camera work is very unique and inventive.  Some points in the film are extremely well done e.g. the upside down camara on ash, a girls turn to a monster, and the hilarious rape scene( a tree actually rapes a girl!)  Evil Dead lacks in plot but the great camara work and imagery makes up for it.",The Evil Dead

This movie is filmed in 1982 which is quite old for our current generation, so the visual effects seem to be quite obsolete but the movie is never boring and never tedious. It's quite intriguing in performance and plot. I felt quite fresh about the early 80s style of classic gore and violence which aren't really too offensive and chaotic.Overall value is much better and more realistic than our current stupid and exaggerated horror flicks aided by graphics. Unlike other two Evil Dead sequels, this first one has almost no humor. Instead, it has a lot of frightening and violent scenes.One warning: Never show this movie to any kids.",The Evil Dead
533,klastaitas,The Start of Something Big,8,25 August 2021,"At 21, Sam Raimi (and a group of his friends) set off into the woods to make a film. A low budget, independent, gory horror film. Now, when someone hears low budget horror movie, they may be haunted by images of ""The Drive in Massacre"" and Roger Corman's rip-off Poe films, but this is different drastically different.It starts with a group of friends (as most horror movies do) driving to a cabin in the woods (as many horror movies also do), but what's interesting is that the main character (played by the amazing Bruce Campbell) can't really be identified as the main character until at least half way through the film. This is not only because he is in the background and has few lines but also because he is a complete dunce. He's not smart or charismatic at all. The only thing that gets him through the night is brute force - no thinking involved.It is in this brute force approach that Evil Dead succeeds spectacularly. It allows for creativity in the way Bruce Campbell slaughters the deadites. It never becomes repetitive. I could watch 2 hours of Bruce Campbell mowing through deadites if Sam Raimi could come up with enough imaginitive ways to kill the deadites. It's no avant-garde, arthouse film which r/Truefilm can drool over but it's still a great film.And after writing so much that's good about the film, I realise I should probably write what's bad about the film. I think it relies to much on horror rather than action/comedy. Although it is scary (and gory) the best parts are the action and one-liners. Luckily, Sam Raimi realised this and in the sequel (Evil Dead 2) mastered his own style of horror/comedy/action.To some people the visual effects and stop-motion may be outdated but I think it fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film. The stop-motion disintegration of the deadites is amazing.I would urge anyone who likes horror to watch not only this but the two sequels (Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness), then watch the TV show (Ash vs. Evil Dead). The bloody slaughter of deadites never gets old.",The Evil Dead
534,stvnqch,I understand why people loved this film but...,5,2 August 2020,"The Evil Dead is a cult classic horror film and I was excited to see this because I've always been so interested in it. So, I watched it and it was rather disappointing - and maybe because there was so much hype and I had high expectations.I can't lie and say this movie is a masterpiece. It's not - but I can say it's a cornerstone of the horror genre and it is definitely ambitious. It's not ashamed of being that ambitious despite not having the highest budget or levels of technology. I applaud Sam Raimi for this project - you can tell he knew what he wanted to do and wasn't afraid to show the world what he had in store despite these shortcomings. That, I can respect and admire.Yes, at the time, it was probably incredibly inventive and terrifying. The audience in the 80's probably saw this film the same way I saw the remake (Evil Dead, 2013) which I thought was on par (in terms of ratings) with this movie but that's only because the remake nailed the gore aspect... take away that gore, and the remake is powerless, generic and just a recycled horror film.I must say the first leg of the movie had me at the edge - they executed that very well and it was promising. But, moving along with the story, I found it comical and I just COULDN'T help but laugh at how comical some of the scenes were (it maybe goes to show how desensitized I am to horror flicks and how far technology has advanced) and how tediously annoying the ""evil"" laughing was.Overall, this movie isn't all that bad - it was inventive at its time and has eventually inspired many horror films but... I'm more indifferent towards it than liking or hating it.",The Evil Dead

The great thing about this movie is that it is ORIGINAL. All the horror movies now a days are always going along the story lines of an old one. Sure, Sam Raimi's shaky camera movements may get irritating, but through all the action, gore and suspense, who really cares?? This movie is a fantastic B-graded horror. I was surprised at how far this movie went with only having 3.5 thou to make it! The gore was mind-boggling! The guts, the blood, the decapitations and the ankle part (You'll Know what i'm talking about when you see it!) The actors were a fantastic choice as well! Bruce Campbell... who could ever forget him for staring in this classic. He was the perfect person for it and always will be.

536,ecw06,best horror ever... period,10,20 September 2006,"words cannot express how much i love this film. being an avid horror fan i gotta say this is the best one there ever is period. The scene where they drive through the woods in the middle of nowhere ( was actually in the middle of nowhere) to the cabin and the eerie music starts in the background still sends shivers down my spine cos it signifies we are in for a hell of a ride. Bruce Campbell (Ash) is the quisessential demon ass kicker how the hell he did not get a bigger push after this film is beyond me the guy is a legend, he goes from being a sissy, cowardly shop assistant to a bad ass in the space of about 30 mins. one word for Ash LEGEND. Cannot forget the support either absolutely magnificent and some of the scenes in that film will go down in horror folklore most notably the infamous tree rape scene or the pencil in the ankle and of course who can forget the scene where Scotty (Hal Delrich) chops up his former girlfriend into a million pieces, and oh yes how can we forget the underrated star of the show the howling wind that actually came about when Sam Raimi (Director) LEGEND, was asleep and he actually taped the wind that was creaking through his window and used it for the film. a stroke of genius. A lot of indie horror fans might think Sam Raimi sold out for doing the two brilliant spiderman films but not me. No for me it just proved what an absolutely fantastic director he is and he can only get better in face HE WILL get better the guy is a god. This film was made on an extremely tight budget and it became on of the scariest if not THE scariest horror ever made whereas these days Hollywood plough millions and millions of money into horrors purely for special effects, lots of blood but no suspense, but thats what Raimi did and thats how EVIL DEAD didn't just became another run of the mill horror.

The creepy cabin, the atmospheric woods, the young adults who were just bad acting cannon fodder for the horrors to come.And then the horror begins.Demon possession, dismemberment, madness, a spell book-it's a driven amalgam of horror movie elements that totally gels, directed with assured panache by a young Sam Raimi (with a few pages from Robert Wise's play-book).

539,dio-3,It's all about the gloom and doom.,10,21 March 2003,"The plot itself for Evil Dead is not very good. It's kind of bad actually. I believe that if anyone today tried to do a remake, it would even surpass the awful 'Psycho'-remake from 1998 on the list of pathetic movies.What makes Evil Dead one of the best horrorfilms ever, is the way it's presented. It has the same kind of feeling you get when you listen to the early 70's Black Sabbath. Very, very doomy and gloomy.I'm not a big fan of the ""Zombie"" genre. Evil Dead is a great movie, but 90% of similar movies really sucks. It's a thin line between success and failure.",The Evil Dead
540,mysteriousbhat,Fine Original,6,13 November 2003,"THE EVIL DEAD is a scary horror film. It succeeds as one of the best in the genre because of extreme low budget made to great use in gore, action, and directing. Sam Raimi, director, has even said this is one of his best films. There is not a lot of flaws one would expect for a B movie like ""Evil Dead"". Instead, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. Bruce Campbell is not as heroic as the sequels would show, but he still is great as a defensive fighter against the dead. It shows he is more vulnerable and at the time period, (79-81), nobody knew what to expect from Bruce.Evil Dead is good to watch as the stepping stone to future horror movies. I'm sure Jason, Freddy Kruegger, Halloween, and other horror movie chain directors have used a page from Evil Dead with its mix of comedy and horror. I recommend you seeing Evil Dead II however, out of the Evil Dead trilogy, because it is a pictureque remake of this movie and a lot high-paced. Most importantly, it looks better on screen as the DVD for Evil Dead is still not as clean as one would expect.",The Evil Dead

This put me on the patch to horror films.There is a lot of negativity about this film, but I imagine that the negative reviews are from the millennium generation. This is a low budget film but shows how it can be done. Compared to the dross that calls itself horror now this film blows them all away.",The Evil Dead
542,Soul_Stealer_2001,Fantastically Gory...,6,7 March 2005,"Well what can i say, i mean what it lacks in script it makes up for in gore in pure 80's horror fashion.With a small budget, up and coming director Sam Rami did not have a lot to go with, but he certainly did well with some of the camera shots. Rami, who has since directed hits such as Spiderman and Spiderman 2 used simple techniques to get the right effect. For example the effect of the camera creeping through the bushes was not used as much when this film was made, and the production team managed this by attaching the camera to a plank and they had someone running around with it.The script isn't great, and to tell the truth there aren't a lot of lines anyway apart in the first half an hour or so while the story is set, but as time goes on there's more bloodshed and less chat, which is good in a way.There are very few special affects, and the while the appearance of the zombies is good it is basic, but as i said before, where it lacks in story and script it makes up with gore and pure violence. Shortly after it's release it was banned for many years, and even after it was re-released there were many scenes that were missing, luckily not for ever. For example a scene where this woman is led out into the woods, wherefore the trees and plants come alive and rape here, called "" the tree rape scene"", or another scene where a woman gets a pencil stuck in her ankle.Luckily though the full version is being shown on television, as it was last night where i watched it.Towards the end as the number of characters diminish due to being killed or turned into zombies, the amount of talk lessens which leads the way to a climax of gore and violence.This is a good film which is enjoyable despite a few faults, and i am looking forward to seeing the two sequels.",The Evil Dead

Bad acting mixed in with horrible story. I get how its a cult classic, most cult films are terrible and that this was. How this has such a high rating for a supposed horror film I don't know, again must be because of cult status. Almost unwatchable, reminds me of Critters or some other cheap B horror. This is a film that basically mocks horror. With the exception of the decent special effects for a low budget film in 80s this is pure garbage and should be remembered as such.

545,karlonsh,My Tip !,10,26 April 2007,"""A classic of the genre you must have watched !"" One of the ""real horror/pictures"" in this world is Evil Dead. I mean, nearly all elements a good horror film has to proof, this one does. Something evil that you do not really see, except the ""Zombies"", a well thought concept, in which a bunch of ""adoliscenses"" want to stay a weekend in the nature and getting heated up by ""demons"". Stereotyped idea you might think, but if you do you're wrong on this one. Sam Rami's first work has reachedcult status from scratch and the legendary ""Book Of The Dead"", ""Necronomicon"", was ""animated"" pretty well to that time's conditions and budget (it was made of plasticine, goes without saying that !). Originally the Necronomicon is to thank to H.P. Lovecraft, because if he hadn't come with his horror novels in the 1920's - 1930's, I wouldn't know wheather Evil Dead could summon up such a story. By the way Evil Dead was Bruce Campbell's debut in a film and the figure this unobuious ""hero"" Ash, was impersonated very well by Mr. Campbell ! The remaining cast is good eighter such as the atmosphere in the film. And one more praise to the effects - and - mask makers of it, you've done incredible, guys ! I advice everybody to watch it and those who'll do should know, that the two sequelsare unless as good as the first, if not even better on the effects. Absolute recommendable, but only the uncut version. Greetings to everyone not - knowing me !",The Evil Dead
546,Chris-375,Not the movie I expected to see...,6,20 January 1999,"The Evil Dead was a movie that I had wanted to see for a long time before I actually saw it.  I read many plot outlines and reviews of the movie and I still couldn't really piece together what I thought the film would be or how good it would be.  There are cult followings to the film so I thought it must be pretty good.  When I finally did see the film I was surprised to find that it did not grasp me the way I thought it would.  There is nothing really scary or funny in this film.  The deadites are kind of weird looking but it's nothing I would scream or laugh at.  Now I know that the first in the Evil Dead Trilogy is not supposed to be a comedy but a horror film but the monsters are very fake looking and there is no creepy music or anything. I actually found myself easily distracted from this movie because of the lack of interest I had in the characters and lack of suspense.  I found the film inconsistent with how one could become possessed by a deadite.  I started wondering if you had to be bitten, touched or just in the same room as one of the deadites.  And if so why did Ash (Bruce Campbell) not suffer the same fate as his friends.  There is a lot of blood and gore in this movie so kids would most definitely be frightened by it.  For people who love blood and gore you might like this movie but it just doesn't have enough good qualities for it to be a top notch horror movie.  So if you were like me and listened to all the buzz about this movie I say don't watch this with really high expectations.  It's not bad but I don't think it's deserving of all of the praise it has received.  =",The Evil Dead

548,dissolvedpaul,A horror classic,10,12 July 2000,"So much has been written about this film over the years that it's hard to be subjective about it anymore. It's a film I know so well now that it's too easy for me to get into a massive dissection of it.So instead I thought I'd focus on how it first affected me and what it still means to me now.My first knowledge and exposure of this film was surprisingly not a first viewing of it but rather a shocking (for me,I was only 7!) cinema trailer that was showing on British television at the time.A fast cutting trailer(that I've never seen since)comprising mostly of the rushing shots through the forest accompanied by the now famous Evil Dead chase sound and the ""were going to get you"" chant. The trailer absolutely terrified me and I had nightmares for weeks, mainly because I had no idea what it all meant and also had never really seen anything but Hammer horror on the TV.When I was old enough to start seeing more risqué' horror(about 12) The Evil Dead was one of the first I saw on video (along with ""The Exorcist"", ""Mothers day"" and ""Halloween 3"" bizarrely enough.)What can I say, the film had a profound effect on me and I can safely say it was the one that whetted my appetite and eventual love of horror in the years to follow. Never had I seen such an atmospheric, creepy and sense assaulting, freaked out horror film. Repeated viewings years later only confirmed what an effective low budget this film still is.I recently watched the Bruce Campbell audio commentary on the Elite DVD and all I will say is that his views put paid to all the detractors of the movie. For every one that complains about the supposed shoddy effects, the bad acting and how it's not really scary, these are the same people who queued for ""Armageddon"" and ""Godzilla"" and sat there numb at 'Blair Witch' waiting for an explosion or sex scene. A film like ""The Evil Dead"" reeks of passion, made by people who love films and not fuelled by mass market and greed. The original camera work, the scant disregard for the faint hearted in the audience, the repeated viewing factor, the mastering of equipment because it was all they had to use, the atmosphere (Intentional and un-intentional) and the jet black comedy in this film all put it up there in my all time top five. A must see for any self respecting horror fan.To partly quote Alan Bryce ""If you don't like this film you have no imagination"" (talking about Blair Witch) I'd say if you don't find at least something redeeming in this film then you don't like Horror.",The Evil Dead

Even though the special effects are more like special defects, the budget of the film must be considered, and the semi-cheesy effects don't take away from the terror of the film.  The acting is not so great either, but the directing and the idea are what steal the show.  And, you have to see the ending.

552,CultZoneTheReal,MAKE AMERICA GROOVY AGAIN => BRUCE CAMPBELL IS FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED GRAVES,9,19 March 2021,"With actor Bruce Campbell, a movement began four years ago for something to come back from the past, besides the undead, that was the joy of seeing American cinema more roots. As has already been mentioned by other authors, the big brands, franchises and stars have made the seventh art so boring, tedious and dull that the public has also fled in fear of the not-so-live pseudo-celebrities... And another part of the campaign is to end this worn-out political system of the Western democracies, which are still polarized between communist or satanist, Christianity or Buddhism, veganism or cannibalism... This is the kind of guy who is really good to govern... in the cemetery... with him there is no mi-mi-mi, no undead moneybag, it's kicking the crap out of these slackers! He even released the great movie with the trailers.The two-party system is flawed. Even the most oblique of people should be able to see that neither Clinton or Trump are purer than water, which is why America really needs to reconsider its whole political stance. They should start by letting a fictional character from a beloved horror franchise run. Currently gearing up for its second season, Ash vs. Evil Dead is going all for broke with its marketing to find some new viewers. Although it isn't exactly unpopular, it isn't really hitting the heights that the continuation of one of the most revered horror franchises deserves. Enter Bruce Campbell being only a slightly exaggerated version of himself as Ash Williams, the series' protagonist. Promising to make America groovy again, he argues that the country needs someone that ""looks like Mitt Romney from the waist up, but is Barack Obama from the waist down"". He's got my vote. Sure, Ash may sometimes be a bit of a sexual predator, but it's better than voting for a lizard or a robot to run the country.",The Evil Dead

But what Raimi needed more than money was time: time to write the script, think about the characters, and rehearse. The acting is wooden, as if the actors are still blocking out where they will be standing in each scene. Their actions and reactions are implausible, with the impressive exception of Ash's vacillation over what to do about his girlfriend. You share his moral dilemma as he weighs whether he would be slaying a demon or murdering an innocent girl. With so many horror movies that are executed so much better, this movie is only useful as part of Raimi's biography...and perhaps the history of the genre. Good for film students; not a priority for anyone else.",The Evil Dead
555,john-shelton-2,Evil Dead (30 Years on...) - A Cult Classic!!,8,13 February 2011,"Evil Dead (aka The Evil Dead) is now 30 years old this year (2011) and has been one of the most influential splatter-horror comedy of the 80s and is considered one of the best zombie films ever produced on a shoe-string budget for Indy cinema. The film was made for $375,000 and stars Cult-actor Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker, Hal Delrich and Sarah York. It is set in a vacation cabin in the Tennessee woods where a mysterious, ancient book is found which resurrects the dead, turning our heroes into blood-thirsty demons in which each of the souls are taken and turned on the living until one survivor is left to deal with the unstoppable force of the film titular title.Directed by then-student, Sam Raimi and produced by himself, Campbell (Actor) and Robert Tapert, The Evil Dead is a non-stop splatter fest which will please gore hounds and comic-book lovers of over-the-top horror fans. I watched this as a an early teen and repeatedly viewed the video in my aunties video cupboard in summers and had known the infamy attached to this cult classic. Admitidly, I had to fast-forward through the first half hour through wanting to see the gore and even the, had to fast-forward through the horror I was subjecting to my 11/12 year old mind! However, it was the later years I picked this film up from the original days of the films release on video where I watched it in full and witness a less cut-up print (BBFC has had a field day with this title for 20 years until being uncut on DVD in 2001) and appreciate why film makers and Indy horror fans hold this film so close after all this time.The film is made so tight on a budget that was small. Joseph LoDuca's music score was one thing that set a rich atmosphere and Sam Raimi's twisted and interesting camera angles tells a story of madness and suspense with each scare and jump, which brings me to the sound effects: they are so up front and scary for any youngster watching this film for the first time!! It will creep you out, or make you go on to make your own movie and that IS the influence of The Evil Dead in this day and age. A gem of a splatter-fest with comic book violence which, when cut-up by censors makes it even more shocking compared to what might be a gore fans dream with all the blood-letting left intact on DVD these days. I only watched this again last night on British TV and was still shocked in some ways that a horror film like this could be left intact, even for 10pm on the Sf-Fy channel - which proves this film is still full of IMPACT... 30 years later!! The sequels made, tell a different story and another review...

559,wiggie-5,The Evil Delight!,9,13 May 2012,"I'm just going to come right out and say it this is a scary movie!Even though it's Sam Raimi's directorial début, and filmed on a low budget, The Evil Dead (1981) is filled with enough atmosphere and gore to turn the stomachs of even the most hardcore horror fans. It's grittiness and over the top violence is a delight that can't be found nowadays.Following the exploits of five college students, the audience is lead into an isolated cabin in the woods, where something evil lies in wait. What is this great evil, you ask? Well, it's a book. But not just any book, 'the Book of the Dead', inked in blood and bound in human flesh! Using a book as the source of evil was an ingenious decision. It takes a familiar image, one usually associated with wisdom and knowledge, and completely turns it around, creating an item of evil and torture. We find it hard to believe that such a simple, inanimate object could be the source of such terror, leaving the audience wide open for when the real baddies show.The film gives birth to one of Bruce Campbell's most famous movie roles, 'Ashley J. Williams', a fan favourite and icon of the horror movie genre. Campbell brought this character to life, walking the line between fearless hero and sheer incompetence. Our protagonist is a man scared out of his wits, whose only talent seems to be dismembering the bodies of his possessed friends. Raimi and Campbell would later take the character in a completely different direction for the sequels, making him goofier and even less reliant.Raimi's creative use of the camera has become a staple in his movies, to the great joy of the audience. One such technique is the constant use of 'point of view' shots, showing the audience what it's like to be the monster. These shots are clever, because we never see what is chasing the protagonists. This is a great horror technique because the audience has to use their imaginations to fill in the gaps. The monster can be anything that the audience can think of, which is especially frightening because people have a tendency to imagine the worst.The cabin in the woods, the central location for the film, completely isolates the characters from any kind of salvation. This does for The Evil Dead what the boat on the ocean did for Jaws (1975), a small oasis in the middle of nowhere, the monster lurking just outside. The audience is never shown any scene that takes place outside the woods, making them feel just as trapped as the characters.Without a doubt, the highlight of the film is the stop motion scene towards the end. In the early 80's, stop motion was the closest that a low budget film could get to CGI, due to the lack of technology. The scene was unexpected, disgusting and incredibly fun to watch! The Evil Dead seems to be aware that it's a very simple movie, almost parodying itself and the genre. This would be built upon in the later sequels, taking the humour to all new levels. But the first film in the trilogy is a far more traditional horror film, relying on atmosphere, suspense and tension building to get a reaction from the audience.It's cheesy at times, filled with the usual horror clichés, but this is what we love about it. It never takes itself seriously, and doesn't expect the audience to. There are many big budget horror films today that try to come close to The Evil Dead but fail miserably.This movie will forever be a horror classic.So, switch off the lights, grab a bowl of popcorn, and maybe even a change of underwear, because this is one horror movie that won't disappoint its audience!",The Evil Dead

563,StellarDread3,The worst film I have ever seen,2,24 September 2017,"To start off with I love weird stupid films and shows, I personally love the Scary Movie franchise (Yes the later ones were not as good as the first two), I love the idea of just sitting down, switching my brain off and enjoying idiotic things for an hour and a half. But I like many people have limits and this film destroyed them, before watching this film I thought the worst kind of film was a boring film that you don't even react to, but no this film changed that.So this film is about a group of people going to a cabin in the woods for a holiday and when they get there weird and satanic stuff happens, nothing other than that really happens. The characters are very forgettable and bland and this includes the main character who is the worst of the bunch, but where this film is at its worst is with what it shows and makes you listen to.One of these things occurs about 25 minutes into the film, when I first watched this I stopped it and made sure I saw what I actually saw and then carried on, the thing that happens is one of the dumbest things I think I have ever seen (Remember I love the first two Scary Movie films) and it just makes you rack your brains at its existence. Then near the end everything gets so much worse as the sounds used are very grating and just painful to listen to.A pro of this film is the special effects which for the low budget of this film (Wikipedia puts it between 400,000 and 500,000) is just incredible as they are so creative and puts other horror directors with bigger budgets to shame. Other than that the plot is like the characters and is very boring and forgettable and the film is regarded as a Horror and it is not scary at all compared to other films from that era like 'The Thing' and 'Friday the 13th' this could just be because of budget but 'Friday the 13th' did not have a much higher budget (Wikipedia puts it at 550,000), this film also has been regarded by fans as a comedy and it is not funny in the slightest. It may have been different if I saw it when it came out but I do not know, it could just be my taste in films (Although I would say I like quite a broad range of films). Oh well I have no idea and if you like this film then that is great that it can appeal to others and bring you/them happiness and remember that this has been my opinion and you really do not need to get upset or angry with it but hey, do what you like.

The Evil Dead, directed by Sam Raimi, starring Bruce Campbell, produced by Rob Tapert, with assistance from Josh Becker, and special effects by Bart Pierce, and even co-edited by Joel Coen, as far as horror movies go, The Evil Dead is the best of the best. It was here that Ash, the greatest horror hero in cinema was born. He has had two more adventures (Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness) and I hope he will have at least one more. At the end of the remake Bruce Campbell had a cameo which gives me hope that this might still happen. The remake was decent, but the original is just the best. It's scary, it's funny, and the camera work is out of this world. Sam Raimi was a genius even when he was a teenager and a better director than most directors when they're 40. If you haven't seen the original Evil Dead you really should. Even Stephen King agrees it's the best, and he's the King of horror!",The Evil Dead
567,PinkFloyd7900,Odd but good,8,21 June 2005,"When I saw the director's cut of the Evil Dead, I had mixed feelings. Some parts I thought were boring, but others, quite intriguing. One part I thought they should of left aside was the tree raping scene. That was rather gross and unneeded. Although, I don't care what people say, but this is the perfect horror film. It's not dull and blunt with the plot of just some dude killing people, but not too complex and in depth as the Exorcist. This also doesn't scar the sh*t out of you, but doesn't leave you not scared or nervous like the Grudge (which sucks, I have no idea why people like it). It's also a good cult movie (get some people together to watch it, especially the directors cut, discuss about it while the movie's playing). Overall, I think it's pretty good.",The Evil Dead
568,johnnysixguns,Whoa! What an old school delight,10,27 December 2015,"Do you remember back in the day, when once or twice a year the expensive pay movie channels had a free weekend? Everyone I knew used to put the blank VHS in and just start taping anything and everything right?! Then you'd end up with crap movies, great movies, and some movies you've never heard of. I was about 14. My brothers friend gave him 2 of these VHS tapes. With 3-4 movies on each one. It was a long weekend or something, so I had some late nights watching them. On one was Monkey Shines, Amityville Horror, and The Evil Dead. I had heard of the first 2 before and the last one had a name that sounded ridiculous.When I got to the Evil Dead it was very late at night and it turned into a horror movie experience I will never forget and made me a life long genre fan! I quickly got over the ""crappy"" quality and low budget. I was mesmerized by the terror. Excited, scared, and blown away. It was the perfect time and setting to make me a Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell fan FOR EVER! I realized that there was a sequel and that Army of Darkness (which was a ""new release"" VHS at the time) was the 3rd one. So i devoured it all HAHA.I wish others could have the experience I had with my first viewing of Evil Dead. But instead I will continue to be an ambassador for it! Don't expect crystal clear quality or amazing cinematography its just not like that. Its older. And one of their first movies. Just let go and let yourself get sucked into the horror, the genius...And the CELLAR!!!!!! ooooooooooohh. Ha.",The Evil Dead
569,SteveyMac70,"Clichéd, wooden, but still worth watching",6,22 April 2018,"What better place to start with my first review than this classic 80's cult horror. I remember in my very early teens, all the hype surrounding this movie and scrambling around a friend's house to watch a grainy VHS copy totally against my parents' wishes, especially after the uproar that it had cause with the notoriously pompous British Censors which only added to the movies' allure. I recently decided to go through my old DVD collection so that I could give a rating to movies I had not seen in a long time and therefore had not rated. My attention was drawn to this movie very early in my task - I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It is a pretty poor movie by today's standards and a complete cliché, but in a way, that's what makes it good! It's like a journey through a carnival house of horrors as an adult. The effects are shocking, you know what's coming yet it still makes you jump! The acting is outdated and almost wooden at times. The effects of the puss squirting from the arm and eyes is almost laughable but still you can't stop watching it. It still manages to create an atmosphere that draws you in and engrosses you so that you do not want to switch it off no matter how bad you tell yourself it is. But it isn't bad at all, it really is quite good. Take yourself back to the 80's and this movie truly was a masterpiece filmed on a budget but drawing the attention some of the so-called blockbusters of the time could only envy. I have seen this movie several times now and each time I come back with the same opinion - that it is definitely worth watching. If you are viewing for the first time, do so with an open mind and put yourself back in the early eighties to give yourself a fair go... you won't be disappointed. I can only give this movie a 7/10 which in my rating system is a movie worth watching and that is exactly what it is what it is nothing more, nothing less, but still a masterpiece of its time which if judged back then would have surely scored a straight 10",The Evil Dead
570,Born_Free,Creepy as hell,9,15 May 2006,"when I first saw the movie i was expecting it to be a splatter movie with no scares just gore, I was very glad when the i was about half-way through the movie because it was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. The sounds the possessed make and their empty eyes,the cheap yet good make up effects,the thick fog and darkness.This movie also features some great camera work, and some of the shots were pure genius. It might be a little nasty with the trees raping women and the gallons of blood and gore but in this case the gore is not just filler to make the movie more repulsive so it wont need to be scary, no this movie really is scary.Every horror movie fan should own this.But I'm not giving it 10 points because of the silly FX in the final scene with the book and the demons.The plot is not a masterpiece but it's alright and nothing really bothers you, and as for the acting lets just say that although the actors would never win the academy awards they are much better then Saw's actors could ever be.",The Evil Dead

But a ""classic"" is not always ""good"".The basic rule is: A ""horror movie"" has to be either frightening or funny.""Evil Dead"" is neither.A zombie flick doesn't have to be horrifying. It can also be comedy, with the usual clichés turned in-and-out. Look how well Peter Jackson did with ""Braindead"". Not scary, but a jolly good fun.But this movie lacks both horror and laughs.

If you're in to demons, then you should probably skip this one and rent Night of the Demons! The only good part about this movie is Army of Darnkness. It was way too long for the little bit of trash it had in it. And the tree having ""sex"" with the one chick, who went outside looking for the owner of a strange voice was just LAME with a capital SUCK! Who in the hell goes looking for strange voices in the woods in the middle of the night? Not I. The part with Ash's girlfriend all crazy and possessed, giggling like a psycho was kinda creepy, in a weird ""WTF?"" kind of way, but that was about it.

Raimi's use of the camera to add a sense of menace and to give life to the demonic force are fantastic. Stephen King was right on when describing this movie as ""grueling"".

All escape routes are blocked. Kids resound to fight evil zombies who have possessed some of their party. Ok, so maybe not the typical  plots, but Evil Dead certainly does have all the makings of a bad horror movie. Why then, is it so appealing?First of all, Bruce Campbell (Ash) has a few really great one liners. Although not revealing his potential until the latter movies in the series (Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness), he is still a darn cool guy. Next, there is tons of fake gore and cool special effects. The effects Raimi uses are not the typical big budget effect. Big budget should not be used anywhere near this film. Instead the effect are more of a stage show, magical, slight of hand effect. Bruce Campbell remarked that Raimi was a master of such things.I would certainly see this movie if you are planning on watching the rest of the series, or if you're just looking to see a funny, cheesy horror film from the early 80's.",The Evil Dead

582,bmk149,This is the film that got me into horror movies,10,13 April 2003,"I first stumbled apon the Evil Dead when i saw it had got the NC-17 rating from the MPAA. I've never really heard of a film getting an NC-17 because of the violent content only so i decided to check it out. Thank God i did. The Evil Dead is by far the best horror movie i've ever seen. It's this film that got me into the Horror/Gore gerne into the first place and since then i've become quite the Gorehound.SPOILERS Below:The gist of the movie is about a bunch of young college kids who rent a cabin in the woods for a weekend of sex, drugs and drinking. Things go way out of hand after the guys find a Ancient Sumarian Book called ""Necronomicon del Monto"" and a tape recorder with a message from the professor who studied it there with his wife. After playing the recording on the tape recorder the demonic forces awake from their slumber in the dark forests of man domian and all hell breaks lose. The Demons have the power to possess the living and one by one each of the kids in the cabin become possessed and try to kill their friends. Among the horrors you will see in this movie are a violent tree rape scene, a pencil stabbed in the heel of a woman's foot and twisted, a possessed woman biting her hand off after having it cut half way off with a hunting knife, a man chopping up her possessed girlfriend with an axe including shot of arms and feet being severed with lots of blood, a man severing his girlfriends head with a shovel and her body falling on top of him spurting blood all over his face, a possessed chick having a hole blown out of her check with a shotgun blast, a possessed man's eyes being gouged out via thumbs, and a glorious meltdown and disintegration sequence were the possessed persons body's start falling apart right befour our eyes. This film definetly lives up to it NC-17 rating and if you don't believe me check it out for yourself. This is by far the goriest film i've ever seen with the exception of Dead Alive (unrated version). Other then the awesome gore effects the film has some of the best camera shots and movements i've ever scene in a movie. The acting is good for a low budget horror flick, well at least Bruce Campbell's is. The scene where it's just him all alone in the cabin with the demonic forces screwing with him gives you the feeling that this character might think it's all just some weird hallucinations he's having possibly from the drugs he's done. Maybe this was a just a bad head trip and he chopped up his friends for nothing (chuckles).SPOILERS End:I can't possibly give this film enough praise, it's the best your gonna get when it comes to low-budger horror flicks, Hell it's even better then all the high-budget Hollywood horror pictures that have come out, well at least in my opinion. I could watch it again and again without ever getting sick of it. Rating: 10/10.",The Evil Dead
583,stekebabman,First 'video nasty' ever watched......and I LOVED every second of it !,10,27 October 2020,"Guess I shouldn't have even been watching this kind of stuff (I was only 14 at the time of release here in UK) but luckily I had a good mate who worked at the local video rental shop,who to be fair he did advise against me watching it,but NO,I WAS gonna see this movie somehow ! (video tapes,another thing of the bygone years) replaced now by streaming and numerous download options available via internet.
At this time my parents often worked until mid evening,getting home around 9 pm,so I figured it all out and relaxed as I saw opening credits flicker to life on screen...I really don't want to give too much away as to script but saying that the movie is now almost 40 years old majority of gore fans will have watched it over & over again (I definitely have).
One thing that still puzzles me re this amazing once banned movie here in UK is,when 'Cheryl' (one of a group of 5 students who rent out the cabin in middle of nowhere) hears something in the woods she merely just takes it upon herself to investigate matters..only going to say things don't go down to well out there after all ! From then on it seems Cheryl was attacked by 'something ' in forest and is demonically possessed from now on....eventually this leads to Ash locking her in the 'cellar/basement' for everyone's safety..
For next 80+ minutes it tears along at a blood splattering pace leaving hardened gore hounds thirsts quenched somewhat..
For me personally the special effects what makes it so memorable (don't forget there was no such thing as all technology what is now readily available) but yet the scenes were blood/broken severed limbs/other bodily fluids on display (in very close up detail at some points) was the realistic looks of it all ! Nowadays a guy gets shot and it's like a volcano erupts,flames arise from nowhere,staggers around short time etc. ..well you get the idea what I'm trying to say I hope..what you get here is the guts in ALL its glory thrown at you 'shocker style' right on your lap almost..so if you are one of small minority who have not yet watched this classic yet I urge you to go find yourself a copy (might be good idea asking 'Grandpa' could you lend his LOL.
I think.well I know you'll be glad you did.
Please enjoy as much as what I did and still do when I get chance to watch it again.
All my older children have left home now with families of their own,but I did say if you ever wanted a bloodfest of a movie anytime just don't need look no further than this what will go down in history long after I'm pushing up daisies one day myself.

Nevertheless, Sam Raimi's production is the strong point, the director is already very inventive, in his framing, tracking shots and subjective views. He already shows a style he will improve later.The special effects have aged (especially the stop-motion end), but if you accept the contract right away, that is to say watching a low budget 40 years old movie, there's no problem, on the contrary, you can watch this film with curiosity. So just dive head first into a good little gory and uninhibited film which remains funny and entertaining 40 years later, and encourages us to watch the following films.",The Evil Dead
587,Tone303,A classic for a specific audience,9,3 December 2004,"The Evil Dead is one of those horror movies that require a specific taste or appreciation. Many people will not like it but many will love it. It is one of those movies where you're either on one side of the fence or the other. Personally, I think of it as ""the little horror movie that could"". I think it is part of the original horror movie family, and begins the fantastic career of director Sam Raimi (director of the Spiderman movies). The movie is difficult to like for many people because, yes it's effect are, we'll say low budget, but it's not in-your-face low budget, you can really see that they put the time into this movie. The premise for the movie is great, the horror in the movie is great, the demented nature of the movie is great, and Bruce Campbell is great.While watching this movie you will either see what is in front of you and judge it accordingly, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this, I do it my self sometimes, where you may see cheesy effects, unoriginality, bad acting and something too silly to be scary. Others will watch this movie and see the TLC the filmmakers put in to it and the effects will be awesome, the story will be original, the acting will still be bad, and the silliness will be very enjoyable.I know people who have been frightened by this movie, and I know people who hated this movie, I simply cannot tell you which kind of people like and dislike it, you'll just have to find out for yourself to which category you belong. I positively love it and I consider myself to be apt in the horror movie genre. And if for nothing else, see it so you can watch the second one, which is one of the most demented horror movies of all time in my opinion. It is funny, but not in the cheesy annoying way like Scream 3.I strongly recommend this movie if you are a horror fan on the rise, or if you are a horror fan period, or if you are curious for something new.

Well, take into consideration that this was the first major film of most of these actors and actresses careers, and the first major film for Sam Raimi (true legend) and Bruce Campbell (Horror movie God!).This movie is about a group of teens who buy a cabin in the woods and have a party. After snooping around the cellar, they uncover an old reeled-tape player, reeled-tape, a shotgun, some shells, and a torn Hills Have Eyes poster. Ash (Bruce) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) bring the player and tape upstairs so they can listen to it. Upon doing so, they unleash the deadites from the Necronomicon, which was originally ""created"" by H.P. Lovecraft in several of his short stories. The Necronomicon was basically a book bound in human flesh, inked in human blood, that contained nothing but evil spells, art, and the occasional cheese ball line.After a woman gets raped by a gang of violent tree branches, she becomes a zombie possessed by one of these evil creatures. Some of the hardcore Evil Dead fans know the ""deadites"" are Indian spirits bent of revenge. After everyone except Ash falls victim to the spirits, he wages war against these ""monsters"".

591,grahm_cassius,"Mysteriously evil, good but hurried and predictable.",8,19 February 2003,"The filmmakers succeeded in every aspect of this film.  It gives off that nice evil tingle and leaves the mysterious, eerily evil woods a deadly substance.  It does, however, seem rushed as a whole and fairly predictable in general.  What is not too ""general"" or common is exactly what and how the things happen that do happen.  The Evil Dead clearly has an undeniable imagination behind it.A small group of feeble-minded college kids go to a cabin they ""got for cheap"" in the deep forests of the hills out in the middle of nowhere. Upon exploration, a couple of them eventually find a book, ""The Book of the Dead"", in the cellar.  It is made of dried human flesh to bind it and its pages, which contain codes and dark yet skillful sketches, all strictly written in the blood of its flesh.  The man who last repeated the codes found in the book made a tape recording of his discoveries.  This tape is also found in the cellar.  The young men show everyone else in the group and make the mistake of playing back the tape, just out of curiosity. Unfortunately, the man recorded his readings of the codes found in ""The Book of the Dead"", so when these kids play them back out loud it is like a call to the evil within the forest, unleashing it.  This evil then turns brilliantly acted, by Bruce Campbell, Ash's friends, 1 by 1, into demons. The way these incidents occur are shockingly heartless, gross, nasty, and simultaneously convincing.  Ash is the focus as he is challenged by his ""proper"", heartfully caring sense of personality.  He struggles with his loyalty to his friends and inner strength is forced upon him as things become do or die.Why a 7/10? The ignorance of potential.  The filmmakers had the ability to make it even more, and to make that ""even more"" shocking, as they have proven.  The sequels put this film in a comic book, which is not where this film should be.  The Evil Dead was a 9 for where the filmmakers were at when it was created.  Then the same creativeness applied to a slight ""don't make things be overwith so quickly"", for the sake of affective substance, would easily knock it to a 10.  Easily place it at the top of all horror films, period.  That is amazing, considering the fact that the entire movie practically happened in the area of a cabin and its wooded yard, combined with its group of 2 actors, 3 actresses as well.  How do you make a classic with that?  Upon answering you will realize the brilliance it took for The Evil Dead to accomplish what it did, has, and still is.",The Evil Dead
592,MostafaJamal,"watch it , that's if you dare",10,22 September 2010,"Five Michigan State students venture into the hills and mountains of Tennessee to spend a weekend in an isolated cabin. There they find The Book of the Dead (a fictional Aztec/Canaanite text, unrelated to the Egyptian Book of the Dead), otherwise known as the Nyturan Demonta. While searching the basement of the cabin, the students find and play a tape recording of demonic incantations from the book, unwittingly resurrecting ""Kandarian"" Demons. The characters are then possessed one by one, beginning with Cheryl Williams (Ellen Sandweiss), after she is hypnotized by the song of a Demon and lured into the forest at night. Alone and far from the safety of the cabin, the Demon proceeds to possess the trees of the forest, which come to life in a snake-like fashion and brutally rape her. Cheryl escapes the trees and is chased by the Demon all the way back to the cabin, where no one believes her story and assumes that she was attacked by a wild animal. Her brother, Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell), decides to drive her into town where she can stay the night. They discover that the only bridge is completely destroyed and the supports are bent into the shape of a claw-like hand.Soon thereafter, Cheryl, having been infested by a Demon during the rape, dies and becomes a deaden (a corpse that is used as a vessel for the Demon that has possessed it) and stabs Linda (Betsy Baker) in the ankle with a pencil. Scotty beats her with the blunt end of his axe and kicks her in the cellar; he then locks her in the fruit cellar, but afterward Shelly (Theresa Tilly) enters her room and is killed and possessed by a Demon lurking there; now a deaden, she becomes psychotically vicious and attacks Scotty (Hal Delrich), who dismembers her with an axe. Scotty then leaves to find a trail out of the woods.Ash goes to check on Linda, but finds that she too has become possessed by a Spirit. Scotty returns, but has suffered massive injuries inflicted upon him by the possessed trees. Before losing consciousness he tells Ash there is a trail in the woods. Linda revives momentarily from the possession & Ash drags her outside and locks her out of the cabin. He goes back to check on Scotty, but finds that he died from his injuries. Linda later returns as a deaden and tries to stab Ash, but Ash stabs her through the chest with a dagger. Ash drags her outside to dismember her with a chainsaw, but finds that he cannot bring himself to do it, and simply buries her instead. She rises from the grave and, after a violent struggle, Ash beheads her with a shovel. He returns to find the cellar door open. He enters the cellar, to find shotgun ammunition and returns to the upstairs. He hears a noise from Shelly and Scott's bedroom. With the shotgun, he goes in to investigate and suspects Cheryl may be in the closet. Cheryl jumps at the window a demon had earlier broken through and tries to take the shotgun from Ash, grabbing at it wildly. Ash shoots her in the chest, but it does not seem to have any effect. Ash then proceeds to barricade both the front and back doors. He runs back into the cellar to find a box of shotgun shells and experiences a strange series of events including the cellar filling with blood and hearing voices. Cheryl tries to attack Ash through the door, but he shoots her and then barricades the door.Meanwhile, Scotty's dead body suddenly revives to reveal that he has been possessed by a Spirit, only to have his eyes gouged out by Ash after a brief struggle. Ash notices that Nyturan Demonta has fallen near the fireplace and is starting to burn. Ash sees that Scotty's body is starting to burn as well, giving an allusion that disposal of the book into the fire will also destroy the Demons. Before he can reach it, however, Cheryl successfully breaks in through the front door and easily knocks him down. Scotty then pins Ash to the floor while Cheryl grabs a fireplace poker and repeatedly hits Ash in the back with it. Ash manages to grab the book after several attempts, using the necklace he had given to Linda earlier in the film, and throws it directly into the blazing flames just as Cheryl raises the fireplace poker to impale him. The Demons leave the bodies of Cheryl and Scotty, and their corpses become inanimate and fall apart over the course of several minutes just as dawn breaks, leaving Ash as the only survivor. He heads outside and stands in front of the cabin for a moment, thinking he has survived the ordeal. An Unseen Evil speeds through the forest, breaks its way through the cabin doors, and descends upon Ash, who screams in terror as the film ends",The Evil Dead
593,tmanbelief,Very Scary,7,15 May 2003,"This has to be the second most scary movie, next to the Excorcist, of all time.  It freaked me out and I did not recover from it until the Army of Darkness (which I found very entertaining, 7-8) came out and kind of mellowed it out with a bit of humor mixed with horror. I can now watch The Evil Dead as long as I have Army of Darkness to watch afterwards.",The Evil Dead
594,isetthisupjustforfaceboo,Very Brutal Horror.,7,1 December 2010,"This movie is a very brutal horror movie. Some viewers may find the scenes of extreme violence an ordeal to watch though. And I recoiled in absolute terror at some scenes in this movie (And it takes allot for me to do that).This movie is certainly not for everyone. If bone crunching violence & suspenseful horror is not your cup of tea stay clear of this movie. But if you want a good suspenseful thrill ride give this movie a go.Also the make-up on the possessed people is very scary and I think is almost as good as the make-up in ""The Exorcist"". Whilst this movie is not as good as its sequel Evil Dead II, it is still an alright horror movie. So if you can handle the very graphic violence you may find this movie very entertaining. I certainly enjoyed this one.",The Evil Dead
595,Hannah-Balsom,Quite good but not as great as i'd hoped,7,4 March 2005,"Being a big horror fan i was really excited at the thought of this film. Up until last year i had never seen it, just seen clips and heard people discuss it in enthused tones. It seemed to be at the top of most horror fans lists. So when i bought a copy on DVD i couldn't wait to get home and watch it. And i did. And to be honest, i wasn't quite as impressed as i thought i'd be. OK, so first off, the film isn't really very scary. I suppose when it was released it would have been as people weren't so much used to that extreme amount of violence and gore. But now it's just really funny.i wrongly thought it was meant to be one of, if not the scariest film ever. Which it's not. Nor does it pretend to be. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed watching the film but i just wasn't scared which i want to be when watching a horror film, otherwise i don't see the point. Anyway, i can see that the film has acquired over the years a sort of spoof status which is indeed what it looks like at times. The acting is terrible, the script laughable and the plot patchy at best, but i think (or at least i hope) that is how it was intended to be. I admit that i was creeped out a few times and did jump on occasion. So overall, i can appreciate the film for what it was. A funny film with a few scares and a lot of gore. Just not as good as it's meant to be.",The Evil Dead
596,meisill,So relentless it works...,10,30 July 2003,"Sam Raimi, the same director who was given 139 million dollars to make ""Spiderman"" started off with 150,000 dollars to make ""The Evil Dead,"" which I personally like better. ""The Evil Dead"" is the first in the trilogy that features the misadventures of Ash, a gun- lugging, chainsaw-wielding, blood-secreting ""sole"" survivor of a night of mayhem and horror. Ash, being the main character, basically is faced with the decision throughout the entire movie to either kill his friends, or lock them up in the cellar. I personally enjoyed the film because of its relentless amount of gore. When's the last time you've seen a Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) lick its own face while a demon is hitting someone on the back with a fireplace poker.The basic plot revolves around a group of five friends who decide to travel to a supposedly remote cabin for a vacation or something.  But things go awry after... well it doesn't matter. A real basic summary of this movie would be: teens get killed off and/or transformed one by one into zombies by the evil spirits inhabiting the surrounding woods.  Basic zombie/survival horror flick.  But this one stands out from the rest for some unidentifiable (to me) reason.  Maybe it's because it knows no bounds.So anyways, if you like NC-17-worthy gore, tree rape, and any way, shape, or form of dismemberment, then this is the movie for you.*Gore: 10/10*Suspense: 3/10*Overall: 6/10",The Evil Dead
597,lel_xd,I am getting everything straight between Evil Dead and Dead Alive(Braindead),10,18 December 2003,"Ok. The Evil Dead movie hit theaters in 81 and it was frightening. They started making it in 1977 it was released in 1981. Once this fild came out, people hardly wanted to go see it... After seeing the trailer or commercial, people thought this move was two intense. Ill tell you a true story... This was on the news along time ago. 3 friends went to see The Evil Dead. After the movie was over, 3 of them went home and they had not slept in days... After 2 of them had heart attacks after when they were walking together... Someone never knew they watched it and asked them do you want to go see it? They both immediately had heart attacks... Protesters were protesting against the film... Then rating for the fil was NC-17. It was way to gory and frightening. That is why it is restricted from tv. Also the exorcist is restricted from tv too. But when they play it on TV they must cut out scenes for both movies. The Evil Dead topped The Exorcist in being most frighning. Dead Alive(Braindead) was released in 93 and people said that it was a evil dead wannabe. I agree. Put it this way.. .Watch Evil Dead 2 which was released in 87 and look at Dead Alive(braindead). Comedy? Well so is Evil Dead... Evil Dead is comedy and horror. Most people find it scary and not funny. Dead Alive had a big notch hero and so did Evil Dead.. What a coinsedense. Dead Alive has alot of gore. And so does evil dead. Evil Dead may have less blood but it is gorier. They have white blood and it is disgusting. Zombies getting cut up and everything... It is just scary. Evil dead now is by far the best damn zombie movie in the world and 2nd in scariest movie in the world... first is the exorcist. 2nd best zombie movie ever is Dawn Of The Dead...Well Thank you.. I just cleared everything up..",The Evil Dead
598,RolandOfGilead82,"Fast, Furious, Grungy, Blood-Splattered, Cult Masterpiece of the Genre",9,13 July 2004,"I first saw 'Evil Dead' way back at a guys' sleepover in the 7th grade. Up until that time, I had only been exposed to intelligent, PG-13 psychological horror films. I remember my friend showed me the 'Evil Dead' VHS slipcase and it read NC-17 on the back...wow, how exciting at this age...practically a porno! Anyway, I prepared myself for the scare of a lifetime, only to come home the next morning with nothing but unsatisfied thoughts. I thought it was cheap, and went for all the blood and guts instead of plot. Years later, I came across the limited edition 'book of the dead' DVD edition of the film at Suncoast. I thought, ""Wow, I remember that movie. Too bad I'm not into it, because that looks like such a creative and fun release.""Well, one thing that had happened since I had seen it back in the 7th grade, was my increasing taste and interest in old low-budget splatter films. So I went back home, called up my friend, and asked if I could borrow his beat up VHS copy to give it another viewing. Bam! Suddenly, something just came over me and I starting loving the movie. It was like I had never seen it before. So I went out later that week and ordered the very expensive 'book of the dead' DVD. Since then, I have seen it countless times.I tried explaining Sam Raimi's grungy horror film in one sentence above, and I think I pretty much summed it up. It will seem like complete trash to some people, while it will be a treasure to others. The plot is simple, giving Raimi the energy to showcase his gore and distinct visual style. It's obvious he loves the camera, whipping it every which way and coming up with new techniques to shoot a scene.Being a huge fan of the Three Stooges, Raimi injects the film with slapstick humor and laughs galore. This film represents the birth of one of the most popular cult icons ever: Ash. You know, the character played down to the bone by Bruce Campbell who eventually acquired a chainsaw for a hand and a shotgun in the other. The guy whose adventures with the dead continue in both Raimi-directed sequels; 'Evil Dead II' and 'Army of Darkness.''The Evil Dead' has lived on the back shelves of video stores for years, being cherished and kept alive by all those rabid fans out there. Even though Raimi is up to bigger things these days (the Spider-Man movies), I truly believe that this remains his best film. The one key to all of his movies. It will forever be his roots.Yes, while the beginning may seem slow and extremely low-budget, stick with it. If you are an avid fan of the splatter genre, this may become your new favorite film.",The Evil Dead

It was quite terrifying since i was so young but i loved it. Since then i have seen it many times and i still love it, now being able to analyze it and so on. The fact it has such great scenery and simple yet wonderful plot makes it fantastic. And me being a fan of Bruce's (Ash) acting especially in this trilogy only makes it even better. I have many times tried to understand just exactly it is that makes this movie so great but it is hard to put a finger on! it's a classic horror movie with a hint of humor as well as all the blood and old time effects that you need! i could go on forever telling you how much i love it but i'm tired..WATCH THIS MOVIE AND ENJOY!!!!

600,klsf91,Gross but Good!,8,8 November 2013,"I heard about the infamy of the Evil Dead which is what drew me to it initially, however I was hesitant to watch it as although I am a fan of the horror genre I'm not a fan of overly gory films.I think the Evil Dead balances out being somewhat silly yet scary at the same time and although very gory it wasn't unbearable to watch most likely due to the fact of the era of which it was filmed.The camera shots add to the suspense and there are quite a few creepy moments throughout the film which I didn't expect to be scared by.Although Evil Dead 2 is regarded as more of a cult classic I definitely rate this one more and recommend it to fans of horror.",The Evil Dead
601,chitragoldy,Not worth the time,1,20 September 2020,"I am writing this review on the 20th of September, 2020. I watched it today for the first time because I believed on the rating of this movie in this trusted platform. Frankly, this movie does not qualify as a good movie in any of the aspects: screenplay, acting, horror, thrilling, suspense. All 1/10.
If you wanna watch any thing similar to this but better than this, go for the ""Wrong turn"" series.
This movie is not up to the mark. It makes your mind heavy with the absurd sounds and bad dialogue delivery of the artists. Also there is no emotional sense to it. The artists are not showing extreme emotions/expressions even when they have just killed their mates. I have seen better movies contemporary to that time from the same cinema so there is no doubt on the availability of skills which are absent in this film.This was certainly over-rated.",The Evil Dead
602,sonickid,"""Why are you torturing me like this?""",3,11 June 2012,"I might get a lot of heat for this review, but, in my opinion as both a horror movie fan & a fan of cinema in general, ""The Evil Dead"" is simply a poorly executed film.The plot is simple; a group of ""teenagers"" (calling them teenagers seems inaccurate, I'm in my early twenties & they look older than me) venture into the woods for a retreat at a cabin. In this macabre cabin they discover an ominous ancient book & an audio recording. After they play the audio recording, which recites a spell to reanimate the dead, that's when the ""horror"" begins.The story is simple & easy to follow, & that is not a complaint. It is a unique way to create a movie about a common horror movie subject—the undead. The setting is well created; the woods (within Kentucky, I believe) are creepy & the cabin definitely has a very dark & ominous vibe.Sadly the setting & the story are the only well-done elements in the movie. The dialogue was mediocre & the acting of the characters ranges from cardboard to obnoxious overacting. There were moments where I just wanted some of the characters to be killed off just to save me from their acting. Once the second character had ""turned,"" I just wanted the movie to end.The special effects are really good; I give the creators credit in that regard; they did particularly well for an obviously low budget film. ""The Evil Dead"" definitely pours on the blood, guts, & gore; however, that didn't help my opinion of the movie; special effects simply aren't as important to me as good acting & coherent dialogue.As far as the music score, at some points in the film it blended well with the events occurring while at other times it clashed.Something as rudimentary as cinematography also struck me as amateur, not simply low budget but amateur.If you would like to see a movie that properly combines elements of horror & black comedy, I would strongly recommend ""Frostbitten"" (Swedish title: ""Frostbiten"") or Hitchcock's black comedy films (specifically, ""The Trouble with Harry""); if you would like to see a very low-budget horror film, check out ""Just Before Dawn;"" if you want to see a simple-minded slasher-type gory horror movie, then see one of the Halloween sequels, its remake, or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. All those disparate films have something in common that is lacking from ""The Evil Dead;"" they all have good acting.I have read that this film was considered by some fans to ""take itself too seriously"" compared to the rest of its series, perhaps I'd feel different about it after watching its sequels; however, I cannot recommend this movie; if you're looking for any of the elements that I mentioned above, check out the other suggestions I mentioned.",The Evil Dead
603,moviebuffv1,Pretty scary movie for an early 80's movie,8,18 July 2005,"I thought that this movie was going to not be too good when I first got it. I mean at the beginning it has a girl getting raped by a tree/ However, a little later on when everyone turns into a zombie or get possessed, it gets really scary. I must say that it did scare me a bit and I normally don't get scared when watching horror movies because I like them so much but this movie really did scare me. I think that there was some good acting as well. From the actor that plays ""Ash"" and i really began to get into his character. I also love the possessed girlfriend, very creepy and scary. The other girl that was locked under the ground was extremely creepy as well because that image stays with you after a while.

604,davisyoung,A great horror classic,10,15 January 2019,This movie to me is honestly one of the greatest movies ever made. The story is simple: 5 friends go to an abandoned cabin in the woods to have fun when a mysterious force starts to take them one by one. The character development from Ash is incredible... we see him going from a calm person to a survivor who will do whatever it takes to stay alive. The atmosphere goes from light to dark as if the film changes us. The cinematic history is really important because although this is a B movie the movie seems to be important because of the structure and the way it was set up. I would recommend this movie to all film fans and horror fans alike.,The Evil Dead

This movie is a masterpiece of horror macabre, surpassing the simplicity of your basic gore fest with intelligent cinematography, creativity, and sound.

617,herecomethejudge,A woman gets raped by a tree...,2,26 June 2006,"First, there are boobs. There is nudity, despite what the IMDb and CARA say. Second, this movie was recommended to me by a friend who considers herself smart, artsy, goes to art theaters... you know the type. All I can say is, don't believe the hype. I challenge anyone who likes this movie to ask themselves why? I think I was abducted by aliens while watching this movie because I swear the whole thing was over but I don't remember any of it and I'm not even on drugs. Maybe that's the problem. People really need to start being objective in their reviews. What I mean is, forget the cliques you belong to, the image you try and live by, forget what you envy or know about the directors/actors and just look at the movie for what it is. In this case, not too good. This is what I got out of it. The people responsible for creating this trash hated women. There are three women in this movie and they all ended up being possessed, raped and beaten/horrifically dismembered. There are 2 men. One is the ""hero"" (Bruce Cambell, who I guess is some sort of cult movie super hero) and one dies rather quietly without much attention. First woman goes into the woods and is raped by the forest... or a tree... or something not sure but there are roots involved. They show her in agony, screaming, etc. They show a root going up her leg and under her night gown... you know where... They show her cupping her breast as a root tries to remove her hand, then low and behold, they show her naked breast. *gasps* After she is all scratched up and bleeding from the incident she runs back into the cabin... from this point everyone else but the one male hero gets possessed by demons and it's just one giant gore fest from here.If you hate people, you will like this movie. If you are a nerd, and were dumped by a girl, and are developing a serious psychosis towards woman, you will like this movie. You will probably like Anime too. You know, the type with the aliens, and tentacles, and little helpless girls. (Smart people know the truth about people like you and what's under the hood, know what I mean?

618,austinwjohnson,The Best of Low Budget Horror.,10,30 April 2020,"I love the Evil Dead franchise, and this was my first movie i saw from it.Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" is creative, gory, spooky at times, and ground breaking.Yes, the actings not the best, and yes of course its got a low budget but The Evil Dead really proves what can be done with a low budget. The special effects and makeup are fantastic, especially for 1981, and Raimi's cinematography is stellar, especially in the final act of the movie when (minor spoiler) Ash begins going crazy.The iconic character of Ash Williams wasn't in full fledged badass mode here but the more cowardly, ""just a man by himself in a cabin with friends possessed by demons trying to kill him and trying to survive"" side of him shows and i love it.The cabin setting is iconic and the cabin has a genuine eerie look to it, especially on the inside, and the Deadites (possesed people) look pretty spooky.Now my problems (i dont have much) start with a certain...interestingly strange and unnecessary scene. (if you know it you know it) Now, i'm not offended by it but it doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the movie and feels sort of awkward and kind of forced for the sake of shock value.

Through the first 20 or so minutes I was somewhat intrigued by the plot but after that, it became a chore that I just had to sit through. The plot is practically non-existant.I can't believe this was considered even remotely scary back in the day. I don't even mind the dated practical effects, but the entire movie is filled with random immersion-breaking moments. For example, at one point, a zombie grabs a man's foot and proceeds to stab him multiple times. What should the man do? That's right; he should stand there screaming for at least half a minute before even trying to get free.The best part of the film: The beginning when no zombies are around yet.

The movie takes you on your grip and don't let go until it ends. Now this is a gruel movie and many people don't like cause of that, but you have to remember that if you take this movie too seriously the experience will be shattered no doubt about it.Also the simplicity of the plot is plus for me in this kind of movie. 5 young people a forest + Book Of The Dead + Evil Spritis + Remote cabin.

623,ryang_film,Enough Gore to Make Charles Manson Gag,10,5 February 2007,"As I sat down to watch The Evil Dead for the first time I was expecting to see an older version of Army of Darkness (since I had originally seen Army first).As I watched I became more and more transfixed on how this movie (unlike Army's adventure, Sinbad, cheesy goodness) was truly disturbing and shocking. The movie held my ADD attention span for the entire length, with me begging for more by the end.I was pleasantly surprised as I watched a possessed character stab a pencil into another's ankle and TWIST (which makes me quiver every time I see it), another character dragged mercilessly through the woods by possessed vines to ultimately be raped by a TREE (you heard right), and another possessed character pounding and screaming while trapped underneath a cellar door, antagonizing the poor Joe Schmo character of Ash.This film, needless to say, is not a happy tale and not for the family (other than the Manson family, of course). It's so shocking that I find it refreshing to watch every time I do so that I can get a break from the high budget ridiculous world of A movies.Sam Raimi makes an outstanding directorial (feature length) debut with this very original movie. Shots and angles are set up beautifully, most of which are skewed on purpose for the reason of showing the characters in a world that is unreal, which, I thought, was proper training for his future Spider-Man movies.The average movie goer though may not appreciate this film. Do you see films once every 6 months or so? Films like ""The Notebook"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"" or ""Lady in the Water?"" Movies that you take your mom or girlfriend to? Yes? Then this movie isn't for you. The only people who can really appreciate this movie for what it is are the kind of people who have seen, and love movies such as ""Bubba Hotep"" and ""Man With The Screaming Brain"". The B movie fans.This film is loved for all reasons. Most of all because of Bruce Campbell who portrays (beautifully) the Wimp to Leader of Men roll in this movie and it's sequels, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.What I like about this film is that it stands alone from it's sequels in that it was low budget and straight horror - no slapstick here, folks. Just pure gore, gore, gore. Story? Ha! Not here, sir. Too much grueling horror to take in all at once for there to be an Oscar worthy story here (Oscars are for snobby A list Hollywood types anyway). Again - that's what I love about this movie - it's simplicity, which, I think, was caused by the more than modest budget.This film, along as entertaining, is also educational in the sense of film-making. This film is easily one of the most influential for filmmakers who just want to make a good movie. Someone could easily be influenced to make a movie if they were to watch three movies - Robert Rodriguez' ""El Mariachi"", Kevin Smith's ""Clerks."" and this movie, ""Evil Dead"".In a world that's over saturated with $50-$250 Million epics, it's good to see a GREAT movie made for *only* $350,000. The lower the budget, the greater the movie, in my opinion as there's no option for money to save the day should a problem on set arise. As a filmmaker I know that no money means more creativity - you have to THINK your way out of problems, rather than buy those problems away (as most movie production crews seem to do) and, believe me - this movie is creative - you'll never look at milk, creamed corn and applesauce the same way again.With talks of an Evil Dead 4 (possibly a remake) I cannot wait to see what Raimi, Tapert and Campbell have in store for us.",The Evil Dead
624,aarondebeers,But was it scary?,6,26 December 2006,"If you're expecting a truly scary movie, you will be disappointed. I just bought this movie because I remember it as being a classic from the 80's when I grew up......There are certain movies that stick in your head as being scary, for me these to name a few would be: The Shining, The Changeling, The Omen, The Blair Witch Project ( I got caught up in it )..... to name a few.I suppose for me it's what you don't see, or when you let your mind get the best of you and you start to see shapes in the living room...... that is truly scary, and then you know the movie has worked.....Bruce Campbell is good, there is no doubt there... You have to take this movie for what it is......gore! The opening scenes in the forest are scary....the reminded me of the Blair Witch Project, and everyone can imagine that type of scenario...when the gore starts, it loses all reality and then becomes a comedy.....it simply doesn't scare you.Maybe that is the intent......more a comedy than a horror.....its just not scary. Let your mind go to work.....watch a psycho thriller......let it do it's magic.....",The Evil Dead
625,amitontheweb,The cover blurb calls it the best horror film of the year. The film is really a comedy with some effects of horror thrown in.,6,14 April 2007,"The cover blurb calls it the best horror film of the year. The film is really a comedy with some effects of horror thrown in. With children of course it never fails to leave its right impact of morbid horror with its close-your-eyes scenes. But the movie is adults rated, so perhaps Sam Raimi got mixed up with the intended audience. A more appropriate name would be  The Comic Dead. So why was it banned ( :-) Ref - the IMDb site in UK and Ireland between 1983 to 1990?) Shot in 35 mm and only 1-1/2 hours long, the storyline contains elements that have been beaten to death in any number of horror movies. A bunch of college youngsters, males and females who are in relationships, proceed toward or get stuck in a lonely cottage somewhere around Tennessee, where one by one each one of them falls prey to demons / ghosts / evil spirits or other inhabitants of the nocturnal, hidden world of spirits. The entire action takes place on a single night, so that daybreak heralds the end of horror and beginning of normalcy.The background to the action evokes interest. An archaeologist has spent his life away from the ""myriad distractions of modern civilization"" to research an ancient Sumerian burial and discovered a book - the book of the dead. He leaves behind an account of his experiences in a tape recorder subsequently discovered by the college vacationers. The Sumerian demon lying dormant gets a new lease of life when the tape recorder with evil chants is played back. The film remains silent on the nature of the spirit and all one gets to see are camera shots zooming onto victims. The spirit appears to lurk in trees and vegetation who then tend to come alive and attack the victims.The comic aspects of the film lie in how the dead victims, with white, morbid faces and distorted voices, go around trying to attack the rest of the group, though never really making an attempt to do serious harm. Their main intention appears to be only to scare - and that works well on children, but fails on adults after a while. Some of the background music actually tries to create comic effects. The makeups though do evoke and generate feeling of horror and revulsion. The main protagonist, well played by Bruce Campbell, supports the action throughout the film.While watching the film, the reviewer compared the dead creatures come alive in the film to office workers and thought they were quite similar, the latter being more scary than the former. The reviewer first saw the film at a young age and considered it to be the epitome the horror. Recently, a waiter at the local restaurant requested him to get the film, saying his entire family wished to see this film. Such is the popular hold of this film, which on closer scrutiny is really more of a comedy than horror.From the film: Ashley (Bruce Campbell) - Is there something in the woods that did this to you? Cherly - No, it's the woods themselves.First published on my blog at: www.myvoice.in",The Evil Dead
626,Flickout,90 Minutes I'll never get back,1,29 May 2016,"This monstrosity has to be among the five worst films I've ever sacrificed time to watch. A migraine would have been more fun. It's obvious within the first three minutes that the script...well, to be polite...stinks to high heaven. I've heard better dialogue come from the pens of fifth graders. Of course, the premise really doesn't deserve a decent script. Take 5 college-age kids (although I doubt that any of them could have gotten into college), 3 girls and 2 guys? (why not 3 couples? - or would one more talentless unknown have been beyond the budget?) and put them in the usual deserted cabin in the woods.Next, let them act like 5 college kids alone in the woods - not! Do they drink? Smoke some pot? Make out? Get naked? This is an NC-17 film, so there's no reason not to do all of those. But no - we must rush into finding the poor man's version of Lovecraft's ""Necromicon"" and turn the evil spirits loose before we have time to find out if we care about our characters and their futures.The only scene in the film worth watching - and fairly (but only fairly) well-done is the attack of the vines and tree roots. This was the obvious time to introduce the touch of nudity sorely needed in an NC17 film. But no...'twas not to be, here or elsewhere.From there, the film quickly and fully degenerates into a gore fest, with blood, guts, body parts, and unknown fluids flying in all directions. Unfortunately, that's where it stays, right to the (painfully far ahead) finish. I won't call it a denouement, since that would imply that there was a plot or story to be resolved. No such luck. It's a tough call on which is worse - script or acting. It often seems that the film is progressing (a generous term) without either script or acting, just blurting along on its own. Ultimately, I think worst accolades have to go to the script, since not even Sir Lawrence Olivier could have made any of those roles believable.Right down there in Putrid Land with script and acting are the special effects. No excuse accepted such as ""OK for the time period"". No, they're not OK. Look at a couple of good short films from the 70s such as ""Closed Mondays"", or ""Bags"" to see what the times could do. When it comes to effects, though, I have to say that nothing says ""the good guy won"" like oatmeal squeezed from a vanquished villain's cuff.Gawd, this thing was a disaster. It could have been played for comedy, but they were too full of themselves to admit it was a turkey. I'm going to take two aspirin and watch a ""Gilligan's Island"" marathon so I can see some *quality* filmmaking.",The Evil Dead
627,en_van_med_en_bil,The scariest piece of horror ever!,9,29 October 2002,"Until about 3 years ago, my favorite movie was Halloween 2. There was no doubt, whatsoever that THAT was the greatest horror flick ever.Then, in the fall of 1999, I found The Evil Dead on a sale at a shopping center in Stockholm for a great price. The previous missing 12 minutes of blood and gore (that the Swedish censorship had cut) were back, in the full uncut Swedish version.I bought it with another film, 'cause there was an offer to buy 2 movies and only pay 100 crowns (about $11/£7 today).I saw it, and I was scared beyond recognition! The music, the low budget camera, the camera work! Everything. It had everything!It was scary, it was dark, the music was scary, it was made during the golden age of horror (early 80's) with a low budget and no huge stars in it - everything I look for in a horror movie.It still is my favourite - no doubt about it. I can't imagine any movie being better than Raimi's masterpiece, I definitely can't.The greatest piece of horror ever!",The Evil Dead
628,tahvo_ensio,We're going to get you.,10,7 October 2008,"This movie proves that you do no not need a big budget to scare the living hell out of people. The special effects, while not being sophisticated on modern standards, are in my opinion perhaps the best I've ever seen in a horror movie, the stop motion animation and sick makeup effects add a hint of authenticity. As modern cgi would look, and in most movies looks dull. The set of the movie was also realistic as it was a cabin in a forest instead of a studio set. The acting while not maybe academy award winning, is great, Bruce Campbell does a remarkable job as Ash, the bad ass hero. The girl chanting ""we're going to get you"" really gave me the chills.What about the atmosphere. It reminds me of the George A. Romero zombie trilogy (which is the best ever BTW), the feeling of isolation and helplessness against a horror nowhere to be seen, but still lurking everywhere around. The use of clever camera-work as seen when the deadite crashes through the window of the cabin to possess one of the girls and in the end when one of them flies through the cabin to get Ash gives a feeling of uncertainty of whose point of view is it if anyones as the deadites are never shown without a possessed physical body and is left a mystery if they even have a form without it.Humour is also a part of the greatness of this film, the graphic violence is executed in a humorous, but still convincing way, there are also some cool one liners and the performance by Campbell itself is somehow unexplainably funny. There's also a weird rape scene featuring a tree raping a girl, while being pretty messed up it was also hilarious.That's about it. I give it a solid 10/10 and if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? Go see it.",The Evil Dead

It's classic campy horror fun. I'd take this flick over any art film anyday. Bruce Campbell's performance is note worthy, he sticks out as being great in his first real movie. Sam's directing is top notch, and more involving and fun than his directing in Spider-Man. The script is a bit cheesy but if someone can kick back and have fun with the movie, they'll enjoy it much more.

Evil Dead 1,2&3 are all fantastic here are my feelings on them all.Evil Dead I Ash and friends take a trip to the famous cabin up in some woods to relax and have a sort of honey moon trip with other couples. Chizel chinned and sharp eyed, we Ash (Bruce Cambell)soon realizes that all ain't what it seems when a tape left by the previous occupants of the cabin is played at night. The necronomicon Exmortis is slowly translated through speakers awakening the Forest and possesing many within the cabin. Gory, Jumpy and over all fantastic, of the three films this is the Scariest, with its gritty special effects and old school sound effects. Evil Dead II My Personal Favourite, here we see another of Ashes adventures in the Cabin, but a more Re-vamped Story, Ash is only in the cabin this time with his Girl Friend. Window smashes, girlfriend gone, fun begins! Here we see a more Black comedy yet mixed in to the bowl with a still very scary and jumpy film. The effects in this film are far more advanced from the first and are a joy to watch. (Spoiler): When ashes hand gets posses, and lopt off by the man himself in a crazy gory blood spattering frenzy the real fun begins and our well known hero Ash is born, Chainsaw to the right hand, BOOM stick to the left. GROOVY. Evil Dead III Army of Darkness Still carrying on form Ashes last adventure we see him in a med-evil realm, caught by a army of men and thought to be one of the enemy Ashes is stripped of his weapons and taken to a castle, doesn't take long tho for him to get his Boom stick out and go on the trail to find the Necronimicon Exmortis. In a trail for love and wanting to go home, Ash goes on a journey to get the book for a befriended wizard in order to fight the Army of Darkness, Fronted by Evil Ash, (If your confused watch the movie).

636,shuttle919,A classic goof horror,7,27 March 2010,"""Evil Dead"" (1981) was made for almost no budget. But it compensated by being campy and mocking the genre. The camera work was very good. The fast motion stuff showing the ""demon"" coming was what I think everyone remembers. The acting was really bad and funny. I was never sure if that was done on purpose or not, but either way it works well that way for the camp factor. Overall the movie is highly gory so much that you want to laugh non stop. At the same time it is creepy and even scary, especially the infamous tree rape scene.

643,bjlehmann,Gore At It's Best,9,23 September 2004,"I remember first watching this film as a ten year old kid, who had snuck a peek at his father's horror collection, and I ended up being absolutely terrified after seeing it, with it's utter scariness and blatant use of gore and decapitated limbs staying in my mind from years to come.Recently I bought the Necrominocon Edition of the Evil Dead Trilogy, and this film is still as scary and brilliant as the day I first saw it (the same can not be said about it's commercialised sequels Dead by Dawn & Army of Darkness though). One of the great things about ED is it's simple timeless tale of a group of friends going away for the weekend at a secluded and seemingly run-down cabin. The horror begins even before they get there, with a near fatal car crash, and a porch chair that seems to have a life of it's own. That's probably one of the great things about the ED, we are led to believe that all the trouble starts with Professor Knoby's reciting of text from the Necromonicon, but it's quite clear there is something evil in the woods, with Professor Knoby's recording only giving it the kickstart it needs to start Mayhem.One stand-out performance in this film is Betsy Baker, who plays ""Linda"" - the ill-fated girlfriend of Ash, who when possessed by the ED is turned into a giggling demon who chants hilariously ""We're gonna get you, not another peep.."". It is an absolutely brilliant and comedic portrayal, especially when you see Baker as Linda before she becomes possessed, in which she is a quiet and reserved. The horror and gore in this film isn't as gruesome as some of the stuff we see these days, but to put it in retrospect at it's time ED was rather controversial and was put in the same category as snuff-films by a lot of right-wing anti-movie violence and horror protesters. Though some might find the scenes with demons biting off their own arms, genitals being mutilated(the scene with Ash & the Scott-Demon) and a tree raping one of the females a bit too much to stomach.All in all, this is a classic horror film. Although it doesn't have state-of-the-art SFX, or high production quality of mainstream horror films made these days, it's all about the atmosphere of the film, the comedic scenes of a possessed Linda and Ash and his buckleys hope of making it out alive.",The Evil Dead

I found that after this film was released, an abundance of followers tried to match the rawness and ferocity of Raimi's picture but failed to achieve a level of belief. For a film with a small under used budget, unknown cast and a fresh director, this film achieved quite a lot in the ""critically acclaimed"" department.

Conceived as a ""This is cheap, but let's see how many people are going to throw up their lunch"" film it features extrodinary camera work and a brilliant actor (Bruce Campbell) and Raimi did well in concentrating on them. Because of the bad script and the lousy co-actors, this appears indeed as a first try and in his second try (Evil Dead II) he adds what is missing in this film: humour. But with a few beers and friends it still is a sweet little movie, but nothing more (I give 6 out of 10).",The Evil Dead

I love the rubber-suits to the computer generated (yawn) junk that you find in the Army of Darkness. Great sound effects, and good old cinematography that new methods have been lacking in classic horror.

I strongly suggest just about any other horror movie over it. The acting was terrible, and it was one of the most predictible movies i have ever seen. Nothing is really scary when you know whats going to happen before it does. And the problems havent even begun to start. I am well aware that a movie does not need great special effects to be a quality film, but when the special effects actually take away from the movie its another story. If you do decide to get it, make sure you look at the scenes when it shows the cabin and the moon in the background....i have never in my life seen such a poor editing job. Well i guess the movie is good for a laugh, cause thats all i did while watching it. If you could think of the typical unoriginal stereotype 70's B horror movie, this would be it.

656,vincent410,Nowhere near as good as it is made out to be,4,29 March 2000,"The Evil Dead is regarded as one of the great cult horror films made in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Made for approximately $300,000 as an expansion (of sorts) to a student film made by Raimi entitled ""Within the Woods,"" this film relies (after the initial twenty minutes) entirely too much upon shock tactics and stage blood to propel events onward, although since this is sort of what Raimi and company intended to do, it's not really a fault of the film itself. In any event, the first twenty minutes or so are brilliantly shot, well-made, and hint at all sorts of subtle terrors awaiting the audience amidst the imminent buckets of blood. However, after the visceral evil begins, there is a sharp decline. A few scenes come across as remarkably tasteless, and I won't go into them here. However, one does not review solely based upon the negatives, and there are a few great moments within. As I have stated earlier, the beginning is brilliant. The camera work is spectacular (as it is throughout the film), and between that and the performances we are drawn into the events of the film. We are the college students, and we are there in this quietly sinister cabin in the woods. After the beginning, things turn a little too splatter with too little substance to sustain or warrant the blood-drenched ""horrors."" One shot from this film will stick with me for a long time, though: the camera looks down from the cabin's roof to see two characters talking between the shining headlights of an Oldsmobile. This is a powerful scene, at once shuddering with latent horror and revealing just how talented Raimi is at the surrealistic, subtle side of horror. Too bad he didn't reveal more of that here.",The Evil Dead

(Spoiler),10,4 January 2001,"(WARNING!: The following may spoil the movie.)I have just finished watching ""The Evil Dead."" this morning. Personally I think it is the best horror movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of horror movies. (The Shining, The Exorcist, etc.) This movie is a classic horror story with tons of blood and death. There are two scenes from the movie that will stay in my mind. The first one is when one of the girls runs into the woods. She gets ""lost"" and is attacked by trees. I've seen several websites call this scene ""The Tree Rape,"" but I have a correction on that. Do any trees really attack her, NO, vines do. The second part that will stay in my mind is when one of the girls is locked up, and the other is sleeping. A third girl is possessed and goes after the two boys. In the end of this attack she is dismembered and buried. The reason the is so gross is because it's realistic. During this she even gnaws off her own hand. Ultimately the quote from Stephen King is correct.""This is the most ferociously original horror movie I have ever seen. And if you don't agree with that, watch every horror movie ever made, then watch this. I am positive this will be better.",The Evil Dead

The Evil Dead seemed almost like a pornographic parody of some other film. Minus the sex of course.I found the camera angles erratic and distracting. The soundtrack could be described in the same way. The narrative was all over the place and the acting was on a par with Debbie Does Dallas. This film certainly doesn't stand the test of time in my books. This is to Sam Raimi what Bad Taste was to Peter Jackson. But if you love to see horror that's ""so bad its good"", this might be one for you. It certainly paves the way for its genre and has obviously inspired many films that followed but don't expect to be scared if true horror is what you're after.",The Evil Dead

Alternatives include as pizza instead of a steak and a mini keg(your roommates, if possible) for the six pack.JOIN US!Oh god, I need ten LINES!?!? alright then, here goes.........You should also buy the Evil Dead DVD that comes in the rubber book.

Other than that, I watched this wanting to love it and ended up fighting with myself just to keep the damn thing on, and ended up being completely flabbergasted as to why it has such a strong reputation.The tree scene is ludicrous and unnecessary. This film relies too much on gore for both its scares and its humor but widely missed the mark on both. I love cheesy horror flicks, but there wasn't one second of this movie that I was either amused or scared, and I say that as someone who's a big fan of Romero's work. The acting is terrible and few movies have annoyed me as much as this one with its characterization of screeching and lolling ""demonic forces.""

Holy poop, was I blown away!! Bruce Campbell, Betsy Baker, 'Sarah York,' 'Hal Delrich' & Ellen Sandwess pull off an extraordinary film, and for many of their acting debuts.  Under the writing and direction of Sam Raimi, this film is a masterpiece with experimental angles and shots, stop-animation, fast shots, sudden close ups, great mood and even some crude, but very effective, clay-animation.  All these features send this group of friends into a whirlwind as they drive along that infamous road, leading to that eerie cabin in the woods.  Only one will leave (or will he/she) alive, the question is who and how?  Not only does this film 'do it' for its fans visually, but the originality is extremely odd and bizarre, but very scary and totally applicable to the plot.  From possessions, dismemberments,***SPOILER*** an unforgettable tree-rape scene, (yes you read that correctly) to a slight love story and some heartfelt emotions, this film has it all and should be on the shelves of all die hard horror fans - or any movie fan in general. Oh, by the way, DEFINITELY NOT for the slight of stomach.  This film begins pleasantly with friends on the road to a 'nice vacation spot' and then leads to the insane happenings at the cabin in the woods that will change all of their lives.  At the cabin, the archaeologist who lives there off and on, is not at home and all that the group finds of him is a tape recording and a book.  The book of the dead.  The Necronomicon.  With this book and the tape recording, this group of friends will unleash the evil that lurks in the woods around them and ultimately pay the price for their naivete.

That is how everyone should experience this movie. While it doesn't follow the rest of the series it is very likable. It does spook you at some times, but you need to watch the series in order, otherwise you wont get what you want out of it: comedy and a chainsaw.

Rent it.",The Evil Dead
673,marrhettmurphy,One of the worst movies I've seen!,3,18 November 2020,"Directed and written by Sam Raimi, The Evil Dead is the movie to see if you want to be unimpressed. With the leading man, Ashley, played by Bruce Campbell, bringing his friends Linda, Cheryl, Shelly, and Scott, played by Betsy Baker, Ellen Sandweiss, Teresa Tilly, and Richard DeManincor, to an abandoned cabin in the woods. These young adults are caught in the middle of a demonic takeover and it would have not been more cliche.
First, the acting in this film is anything but good. Starting in the very beginning, one of the characters is being squished against a car window, however the lack of real expression and resolve from that is so funny. One minute these people would be in such a great fear and then next they would just be sitting there as if nothing had happened. I understand that this movie is a horror flick and is not actually realistic, especially with the action from the woods, but that does not mean the actors should be unrealistic as well. Having what is going on in real life would obviously scare anyone to death, yet the characters just don't react as quickly or as strongly as they should. The only okay part of the acting came from Bruce Campbell and that came finally to the end.
The steps that each character took in this film were highly predictable from the beginning. As well as seeming to speed up the plot. With every turn there was something happening, they did not give the characters time to reflect on the moment. It felt like falling down a hill and not being able to stop. By forcing the characters to have to do the unfortunate thing makes the movie boring with the constant knowing of their decisions and consequences.
The setting is okay, very basic but okay. It just seemed like a cheesy low budget haunted house put on by teenagers. Being that this is quite a low budget movie, I understand the lack of specialties. However, there are several unnecessary things they could have cut and went a different route to save money and improve the movie. For example, the use of clay-mation was at a total loss and denied the possibility for a fear factor in this film. Yes, mixing elements can help improve a movie, but the director should have taken a better look before putting a random spot of clay-mation in the final cut.
That money could have possibly been used for better makeup because that was hideous to look at, in a bad way. Looking like a 10 year old painting their face for Halloween, this makeup ruined another possible moment for this movie to shine. The cheap prosthetics and overuse of blood to try to cover up the bad reality of this awful movie really looked like they were struggling.
This movie may be ""iconic"", but in my eyes the only thing iconic about it is how horribly they missed the mark for a good movie. Instead of being scary this movie was more of a drab comedy at best. Just because this movie is low budget does not give the director an excuse to not meet the requirements of a good movie. Look at The Blair Witch Project, an incredibly done movie on such a low budget. I am glad that in 2017 they redid the movie and attempted to save the movie that Raimi messed up so much. My rating on this movie is a D-, barely passing because it is well-known, but I believe it is well-known for the wrong reasons.",The Evil Dead

The horror genre is one of the ""sexual"" genres, I think, but now they abuse too much...) can try...The plot of The Evil Dead isn't special, but it has something that makes it special. Could be the camera movements, the remember of a movie that really scared me (today no one can... not because I'm not the young boy that I was, it's because it was and remains scary), the gore, the low budget but effective fx, the genial Bruce Campbell, the pencil in the foot, those white eyes, or simply that cabin in the dark woods, so cosy, so scary, so dark, the kind of place where everyone want to go with his/her boy/girlfriend and friends to be one night and subconsciously want to get scared.

Then I hear about the Evil Dead,- a film for which I haven't seen a bad review so I thought I would pay out some of my hard earned money for a copy on VHS. Were my expectations too high? Maybe. In the opening scenes, the acting is wafer thin, the script not too good either. Then the scene with the cellar was genuinely creepy,- if the rest of the film was left to the imagination like this scene then I think maybe we would have a timeless classic on our hands. Very tense. Some of the special effects are still impressive (even 20 years on), but the make up is just hillarious. It isn't scary, it just seems like a joke. The reactions from the cast when they encounter the ""undead"" is so annoyingly bad,- imagine one of your best friends/your girlfriend has been possessed by an ancient evil spirit, i'm sure you'd look just a little bit concerned/frightened/confused. Not just ""lets kill it"" without an element of ""what the hell is going on?!""Maybe I'm being harsh, as apparently the film was made with a reasonably small budget,(which would perhaps forgive the amazingly non-frightening make up), but how hard is it to look frightened or to look surprised?

That aside, if you've had a few beers and you are with your mates this film would definitely be a good laugh. The disappointing this about that is it isn't intended to be a comedy.

The other people were possessed much more quickly and without the disturbing hentai scene.  Completely unnecessary. ***END SPOILER*** If you're going to make a bad movie, at least make it funny.  Skip this one and watch ED II, or better yet, Army of Darkness.",The Evil Dead
690,StianAleksander,Really ?,1,8 November 2011,"7,6 ?? Really ? I'm still amazed I actually made it to the end of the movie without throwing my TV out the window! This was beyond crap. Unbelievable. I mean, I have seen my share of bad horror movies, but this one is right up there with the worst of them. Val Kilmer in the Traveler is Oscar material in comparison, that's how bad this is. What do you do when your best friend that suddenly turned into a zombie attacks you and drives a pencil through your ankle? You do the only reasonable thing anyone would do, take a nap of course.Suddenly they just turn into zombies? And what's the deal with the man in the background when they drive over the bridge? Oh well, another 80 minutes of my life I'll never get back.To summarize: I give this movie 1/10.",The Evil Dead

692,tina-klein,Oldie but creepy!,8,4 April 2012,"The Evil Dead is just a REALLY scary movie. Low-budget, the plot is simple and direct, the characters are few, but the pacing is wonderful.I had been a fan of horror for several years before seeing this movie. I read about it and wanted to see it, but at the time it was harder to find than uranium. I finally got to see it on the Sci-Fi Channel in the early-to-mid 90s, and I was spellbound. This movie scared the hell out of me and left me creeped out for a good while after it was over. After seeing this movie, my lifelong love of horror was cemented. If you are a horror fan and haven't seen this film, WATCH IT!!! And shame on you for not seeing it earlier.",The Evil Dead
693,Project_quumf,Evil Dead is a classic,10,9 December 2004,"'The Evil Dead' was one of those films that no-one ever got to see as there was little call for it in Video, but now with DVD it is readily available for anyone. And thank god for that! People can have opinions of this film which weren't derived from some friend who probably hadn't seen any of the trilogy, never mind the first. The film may have been banned when it was first released, but it is not the scariest film ever made and apart from Big Boy Bruce the acting is not the greatest. But the tension is excellent and the directing from Sam Raimi is effective as well as impressive, especially when you consider that this was his debut feature film. The possessed characters are brilliant, better than the make up in Romero's Trilogy, and the back drop is used to perfection.It may be another in a long line of horrors in the wood, but it easily stands out as one of the best due to its scares brought out through the high quality cinematography and Sam Raimi himself. And the underlying humour that is apparent throughout just improves it further (see the present Ash gives to his girlfriend).",The Evil Dead
694,cthistle22,A must see,9,13 May 2012,This is an excellent film in every way possible! It has the low-budget feel to it with a top-budget atmosphere. It starts with a group of teenagers staying at a cabin when they start to turn into zombie/ demon things. The graphic violence is really in your face and makes sure you see exactly what is happening. The gore in this film is very well done and convinced me that I prefer This kind of FX over CGI. The use of stop motion/fake body parts just adds to the overall creepiness of it. The camera shots are very nice and are noticeable for being so creative. Everything about this film was phenomenal except a couple of points (nitpicking):I HATE jump scares(this film has some) The reason as to why they turn into demons/zombies is never explained and the book/tape recording is never fully explained (Doesn't really need to be anyway since it's a horror film) The sound is mostly either dead silent or knock-you-out-of-your-seat- loud. It took me a while of thinking to actually come up with a couple of points of things I didn't like about it; now that's when you know this is a good movie. This movie helps define what horror movies are all about.,The Evil Dead
695,cziggy124,"Evil Sick Joke, The",1,29 June 2004,"**Spoilers**DON'T READ THE FOLLOWING REVIEW WITHOUT SEEING THE MOVIE FIRSTThe Evil Dead, on rottentomatoes.com, was raved as a wonderful movie. After renting this crap, all I can say is, if it was supposed to be a horror...it sucked, if it was supposed to be a comedy...it sucked. The movie is incredibly lame, comedy or horror, I may have laughed but even if the attempts were to make it more of a comedy, I thought...well that it was dumb to try to also make it a horror...just pick a genre!! Also, even if it was intended for laughs, the movie is incredibly disgusting...a tree rapes a girl??? That's GROSS! The special effects and visuals and makeup aren't ""imaginable"" like some may claim...they are just cheap and gross. This movie was a waste of time!!Grade: F",The Evil Dead
696,thumbscrews,One of the most influential horror films of all time.,10,3 July 2004,This movie is one of the most influential pieces of cinematic horror ever. Sure it's a cheeseball of a film (To those of you that complain about it... What do you expect? That it would be some great academy award winner? A handful of college kids with virtually no budget made this movie. And I believe they did a fantastic job... I wouldn't even know where to begin.)The Evil Dead perhaps has the most HUGE cult following ever... behind Rocky Horror Picture Show.Plus... The way the whole movie is filmed is excellent... The camera angles and the sound alone are really mind blowing. That's good ole Sam Raimi. Let's hope he'll kick out an Evil Dead IV for us to put the series to bed properly.,The Evil Dead
697,anorigionalemailaddress,Quite scary,8,23 December 2012,"If you are looking for a horror movie that scares you, leaves you with images 'till next morning, and even then causes you to wake at nights even years after watching, this is the movie for you. It is definitely disturbing, dark, hopeless, creepy, and everything a good horror movie is. That being said, it is a B-horror movie with a budget of less than 400,000 dollars. So the special effects are just good enough and the actors just convincing enough to sell it. The movie dances on today's line of ridiculously thrilling or hilarious with it's claymation. However, the story is original, thrilling, and sticks with you. Don't watch with the kids or grandparents.",The Evil Dead
698,howe_yadouin,"Grueling, Mr. King? Oh, how clean the thrust.",10,16 December 2004,"No matter the cheap effects, much less the college acting, I had to have a deep tissue massage once the final credit of this film had completed its upscreenward journey. If there is one thing I'll give this film, it is that it keeps you in suspense. Sam Raimi's use of sound and angle are merely the infancy of his genius. I dare say the second was even more grueling. Hats off to you Mr. Raimi, we know now what got you that Spiderman bid.In Evil Dead, we also had a glimpse of Bruce Campbell's early acting. He plays the naive oaf with uncanny perfection as Ash, the unsuspecting hero of this film. Of course, in subsequent sequels, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, the character of Ash develops from this same unsuspecting hero and naive oaf to a crazed lunatic in the second film and finds himself a war hardened veteran of deadite war in the third.The ladies of Evil Dead are captivating in spite of the dingy cinematography and 80's acting style, and they look none the worse for the wear what with the cold Tennessee atmosphere and tea saucer contact lenses. They certainly do make that old cabin and Hal Delrich's garage look mighty frightening. Oh, and hey, Ted Raimi's in this one.",The Evil Dead
699,fraser_clark2000,Fantastic!,10,18 February 2005,"The original, and maybe the best. Just watched it, borrowed from friend, whilst home alone. Unbelievable. A textbook horror, perfectly formed, excellently timed suspense, great make-up, brilliant pacing. I loved it. A horror masterpiece! **minor spoilers** I loved the way Ash, at the start, stands with an axe in the corner, whilst Scotty says - ""hit her! hit her with the axe!"" and he just stands there like, ""shiiiiiiiiit!"" and does nothing - totally different from the ash we all came to know and love. It rally is a Greuling experience - I feel drained. I think the best thing about it was the way that it could get away with so many clichés (creaking doors, thunder and lightening, spooky lighting, and the cabin in the woods scenario itself) - because this is it! This is the original, the trail blazer - it defined a sub-genre - survival horror (okay okay, there was Alien, but that's sci-fi) - and I loved every minute. Watch, see, feel sick, reel, close your eyes in digust = all of these are the Evil Dead Experience.10/10",The Evil Dead
700,cinderellanightsongs89,"I live In Morristown, TN",10,3 March 2005,"I live in Morristown, TN. This movie is awesome!!! Maybe I can fill some of you in on a few things..One of the local backers of this film was assistant producer Gary Holt. He and his family own a location called Renaissance Farm. It was a horse training farm. A Big red barn in the far western part of Hamblen County, Morristown, TN. Later on it was a flea market, for awhile. Now it is some other business. Note at the starting of the movie, on the screen, Renaissance Pictures. The local locations of the film are in Morristown and surrounding areas. At the first of the movie, when the yellow Oldsmobile is traveling down the gravel road, and met head on with the red truck, notice the concrete bridge in the background.. that bridge is non other than Old Highway 25 E in Grainger county. The Highway, 25E is now being widened into a 4 lane highway, they have been working on this road project for years and still are today. It is right on the border of Claiborne County, near Tazewell, TN. The dirt and gravel road sits directly on the other side of the Clinch River.... To access this gravel road, go straight across the bridge, take a right turn and go under the bridge and that will take you right down on the gravel road and on down to the river... Also, filmed in Grainger county, the scene directly after this one.... Where the car horn is being blown and you see the 2 men walking (fisherman I think). Look directly in the background and you will see the opening that was cut into Clinch Mountain for the HWY 25E widening project back in the middle to late 1970's. That part of the mountain is visible in 2 scenes. The road that the 2 men are walking on is the OLD HIGHWAY that was a 2 lane, winding road. As this movie was filmed a long time ago..... the trees have all grown up in that area now and you cannot see the top of the mountain from that area anymore. That road they are walking appears to be at the starting of what is left of the old road that runs near the Poor Valley area. If you are going to go north on HWY 25E from Bean Station and Morristown and upon the mountain, that road will be the first road on the left as you are starting to go up the mountain. The actual cabin where the movie was filmed is (was) located in west Hamblen County, Morristown, TN in the same general area as Panther Creek State Park area...just a bit of the way up from the park.....I have never been to the house....but I have heard about it.....It is not visible from any road. It sit (s) far back up in the woods. Some people make the mistake and get it mixed up with another old ""haunted house"", The Murrell Melville Home, that is in the area and sits near the road... THE EVIL DEAD CABIN DOES NOT, DID NOT SIT NEAR ANY ROAD. The entrance is in an unmarked driveway that enters a field. The cabin sat way back in the backcountry almost in the woods. This is plainly visible in the film. I will not give directions to the cabin or cabin site... they are posted on other Evil Dead websites, they are not 100% accurate though. Anyway, the reason I know all of the above information is that I am a lifetime resident of Morristown, TN and I remember this film being made. Mr. Holt is well known in this area. Anyway, that is my 2 cents worth.... I hope you enjoyed reading it....EVIL DEAD LOVER",The Evil Dead
701,SoylentGreenIsDelicious,horror gold,8,8 August 2005,"What can I say? EVIL DEAD was a horror masterpiece. First of all the story is brilliant,long dead demon ghosts possess college kids in a creepy forest, you can tell it's going to be good.But even better the director keeps you interested by using strange camera angles and using so many twists you cant even begin to expect the most cliché scenes in films.The makeup was, for the most part believable,and the cast was great ,especially Bruce ,using facial expressions and making the scene believable,and the eeriness of the movie gets you straight from the beginning. All in all if you like horror, WATCH THIS MOVIE!\best movie ever",The Evil Dead
702,suenamilyn,"Horrible film, yet all the more entertaining",2,2 July 2005,"If you are truly looking for a cheesy, horribly made film, then there is no better then The Evil Dead. First of all, you will laugh at the horrible film making. There are goofs and mistakes galore. Crew members visible in the bushes, disappearing blood, costume changes, etc., it is all here. Ed Woods Plan 9 from Outer Space does a better job at covering up its mistakes. The plot, one of the only good points in this film, besides the laughable bad acting, is very interesting and it is good for the sequel (one of my favorite movies) Army of Darkness. The only other good thing about this film is that it spawned the career of cult actor Bruce Cambell. But the very best seen is a rape sequence in which a girl is raped by... trees. Yes, trees. it still reminds me of the trees in the Wizard of Oz. ""These ain't your apples!"". So if you have had a rough day and just want to simply turn your brain off, pick up Evil Dead. if you are looking for a great old horror classic, pick up army of darkness. because evil dead is merely a five year old's rendition of army of darkness.",The Evil Dead

I had looked forward to watching this movie in our living room, nicely decorated for Halloween. This is actually one of the worst, most boring, most predictive movies I have ever had the displeasure to watch. I suffered through the entire movie but my wife only lasted 6 minutes before she went to bed to read a book. Thank goodness I did not invite a guest over to share the experience. I just can't believe anyone sober would give this movie any more than a 2/10 rating.

704,perikout,Ash is a hell of a character!,7,9 September 2016,"There were some things in the movie that would not disturb a real horror movie fan -like me. But for the majority of people, i think that its slasher effects like the death of the characters, are a little bit disturbing, only just a little bit. The make up is bold and the fog and smoke effects look fake. But, but, but, but... Don't get me wrong. It's an 80s movie. An 80s horror classic. You don't expect the perfect effects and graphics. It's all about the story and the perfect characters and perfect acting! Ash is a hell of a character. He has a great style. he is both sensitive and courageous. He also cares about his friends and only about saving himself. He is bold and straight,full of hope and ready to fight. He is a kind of a hero. These characteristics of Ash are those who make this movie a horror classic. I have not yet seen the new film but I think that if they kept the same format as this movie, it will be great! Looking forward to see Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness...7/10 from me. I am a little hard on this one...",The Evil Dead

It has influenced many other horror films. One can watch and rewatch this movie and see something new each time. The special effects were revolutionary for its time. This movie sets the standard for modern horror. Bruce Campbell truly made his mark in this one. Also, you can't go wrong buying the Evil Dead trilogy. Once you see all three movies, you will probably be hooked for life. As far as something current related to the trilogy, please go buy 'My Name Is Bruce' when it is released for DVD.

Well, I've read of how they sold their idea to dentists and lawyers to get small chunks of money, but shooting on film is so expensive! How can any filmmaker/video maker not respect Sam Raimi in that time for accomplishing what he did in 1983?! I have been making short videos/music videos since 1994. I have always had the taste of horror/gore, but was never ambitious enough to go full on and make a feature. Any movies i have made have been shot on video, and have been no longer than 40 minutes. Its too damn expensive to do a feature ... or so i thought until seeing Evil Dead again last week. Now, with a fresh perception in 2006, i hope to start my latest idea as a feature, and push it in festivals. Thanks Sam!!!",The Evil Dead

So, one night after my sister and nephew and niece went to sleep I decided to watch it. I didn't know what I was in for. The movie starts out a little slow and a little generic, but it gets terrifying when they find the cellar. I could hardly breathe! I sat on the couch trying to take my mind somewhere else, but realized that this would ruin the movie, so I buckled down and enjoyed the ride. I'm 20 and weigh 280 pounds, and several times I shrieked out loud. I love horror movies, and The Evil Dead zoomed straight up to the top of my list. I was a little disappointed in the ending, because it wasn't very original. I think it was trying to be like Night of the Living Dead where no one survives, but done a little poorly. The part where the demoninhabited people melting was a little goofy but still disturbing. All in all this movie is horrifying and bloody, but it really works.",The Evil Dead
