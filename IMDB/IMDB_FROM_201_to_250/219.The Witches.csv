0,TheLittleSongbird,"Very good movie, Anjelica is fabulous!",8,23 April 2010,"I loved Roald Dahl's books as a kid, and I still do. I have also throughly enjoyed the film adaptations especially Matilda, James and the Giant Peach and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. And while I admit I was frightened of it as a kid, I enjoy the Witches now. While Nicolas Roeg's direction could have done with more subtlety, the film is very well made, with incredible special effects particularly in the scene when the Grand High Witch turns the boy into a mouse. The script is offbeat and funny,the music is deliciously dark and the film moves quickly. And the acting is excellent, with Jasen Fisher likable as the boy and Mai Zetterling memorable as his granny. Anjelica Huston is superb though as the Grand High Witch, almost unrecognisable she was. Gene Wilder and Pam Ferris, look out, Anjelica gives you a run for your money. Overall, very dark, perhaps scary but very well done and enjoyable. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Witches
1,Leofwine_draca,Children's classic,9,24 November 2012,"I really like THE WITCHES. It was a childhood favourite of mine back at the time - I was born in 1981, so was roughly the same age as the kid in it. In addition, I think it's the film that most authentically captures the spirit of Roald Dahl's book, more so than either of the CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY adaptations. The combination of Nic Roeg's outstanding direction (who thought of using an art-house director for a kid's film? It was a gamble that really paid off) and Jim Henson's great puppet work makes for a truly superlative movie.The storyline is deliciously dark and, although it's kept simple throughout, the film achieves a remarkable level of world-building in a short space of time. Then there's the cast: Anjelica Huston, completely sinister in THAT role (forget THE ADDAMS FAMILY, that's nothing compared to this), a deliciously deadpan Bill Paterson, a hilariously pompous Rowan Atkinson, and a sweet Mai Zetterling holding it all together as the kindly granny.I still love the mouse puppets they use in this film, and the effects really hold up even today. I consider the big reveal with Huston to be one of the best, and most shocking, ever put on film. Yes, the sugar-sweet ending may be off-putting to some - and a departure from the original - but it doesn't spoil what is, in many ways, a perfect little movie.",The Witches
2,SnoopyStyle,delectable ugly witches,7,13 January 2015,"While on vacation in Norway visiting grandmother Helga, she tells young Luke Eveshim about the existence of real witches who hate children. As a child, she lost a friend to a witch who put her into a painting. His parents are killed and Helga takes him to England where she owns a house. They vacation at seaside Hotel Excelsior. There is also a convention for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children with Chairwoman Eva Ernst (Anjelica Huston). Hotel manager Mr. Stringer (Rowan Atkinson) has it in for Luke and his pet mice. While hiding in the ballroom, Luke spies that the convention is actually for witches and she intends to transform every child into a mouse. Luke and another boy get caught and changed into mice.The first 30 minutes have a bit too much to cover. There's no real need to start in Norway. The parents dying would be a great place to go darker but the movie doesn't spend much time on it. The movie finally sets up in the hotel. Huston is delicious as the Grand High Witch. It has the dark ugliness and some edgy fun. There is a tacked on happy ending to the story which doesn't make much sense.",The Witches
3,claudio_carvalho,The Witches Convention,8,8 May 2017,"The boy Luke (Jasen Fisher) is spending vacation in Norway at the house of his grandmother Helga Eveshim (Mai Zetterling) house with his parents. She tells stories of evil witches and how her best childhood friend was kidnapped by a witch. Out of the blue, Luke's parents have a car accident and die and Helga becomes Luke's guardian. They move to England and one day, a woman approaches and speaks to Luke, but he identifies that she is a witch. One day, Helga falls ill and her doctor tells that it is her diabetes. She decides to travel to a seaside hotel to recover from her diabetes. On the arrival, Luke befriends the fat boy Bruno Jenkins (Charlie Potter) and has problems with the manager Mr. Stringer (Rowan Atkinson) because of his pet white mice. Meanwhile a group of women from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children arrive for a convention with their leader Miss Eva Ernst (Anjelica Huston). But soon Luke learns that Eva is indeed the Grand High Witch and their convention is to distribute a magic potion to turn boys into mice in England. When the Grand High Witch sees Luke, she turns him into a mouse. What will the boy do?""The Witches"" is one of the most delightful movies from the 90's. This film has not aged and the timeless story is wonderful no matter the age of the viewer. That cast is perfect and Anjelica Huston is fantastic in the role of a powerful witch. The make-up and special effects are magnificent and still impressive twenty-seven years later. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Convenção das Bruxas"" (""Witches Convention"")",The Witches
4,kosmasp,Magic,8,11 March 2020,"Grandmas know best - not always but in this case. And especially when it comes to witches. I'm guessing the soon to be released ""reimagination"" will up the ante when it comes to special effects, but this is not too shabby either in that department.It really is fun and a family or rather kids movie. Can be fun for adults too if you let yourself on a journey. Anjelica Houston really relishes in her character and seems to have a lot of fun - fun that is being transmitted and laid on the viewer",The Witches
5,gavin6942,Terrifying!,7,24 August 2017,"A young boy stumbles onto a witch convention and must stop them, even after he has been turned into a mouse.This is a legitimately creepy and sometimes scary film... intended for kids. Allegedly Roald Dahl was not happy with the scary aspects and that is understandable. His work does have dark elements, but they are usually more subtle. (Willy Wonka is quite the devilish fiend!) Anjelica Huston is perfect as both the witch and her alter ego. The ""vamp"" look suits her and one might suppose this role is what lead to her being cast in ""The Addams Family"", as the similarities are striking.",The Witches
6,lee_eisenberg,Morticia Addams meets Mr. Bean meets Little Voice,9,30 October 2015,"When the creator of ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppets"" joins forces with the director of ""Walkabout"" and ""Don't Look Now"" for an adaptation of a Roald Dahl book, you know that you're in for something neat. And ""The Witches"" is just that. While the emphasis is the boy trying to stop the sorceresses from turning England's children into mice, the movie really belongs to Anjelica Huston as the Grand High Witch. The sequences in the conference room and the restaurant have to be some of the coolest scenes ever put on film. I suspect that they had a lot of fun creating those effects. This is the perfect movie for Halloween. I understand that the movie changed a number of things from the book, but on its own this is one enjoyable movie. I recommend it.And now for the other cast members. Playing the hotel owner is Rowan Atkinson, whom we know as the well meaning but inept Mr. Bean. Brenda Blethyn (Bruno's mom) and Jane Horrocks (the Grand High Witch's assistant) later co-starred in ""Little Voice"", although Blethyn had a lead role in Mike Leigh's ""Secrets and Lies"".",The Witches
7,jboothmillard,The Witches,6,22 September 2005,"You've probably read your kids this sometimes scary but lovable story book by Roald Dahl (The BFG, James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), this is the film version of the story, with only the ending changed. Basically young Luke (Jasen Fisher) and his Grandma go back to England to live after his parents died, she is his guardian. Then they decide to go on a short hotel holiday after Grandma gets mild diabetes. It is in this hotel that Luke sees a terrible plan by Miss Eva Ernst, or the Grand High Witch (Academy Award winner Anjelica Huston), leader of the many witches in England. They plan to cover sweets and chocolate in a special potion that will turn children into mice! Unfortunately, this is what happens to Luke and his new friend, rich kid Bruno Jenkins (Charlie Potter). Luke (as a Jim Henson made mouse) now plans to stop the witches by putting the potion in the soup for the ""Women's Cruelty To Children"" party banquet, that's obviously the witches, except not caring for kids. Also starring Jane Horrocks as Miss Irvine, Bill Paterson as Mr. Jenkins, Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Jenkins, and bumbling Rowan Atkinson as hotel owner Mr. Stringer. It was nominated for a BAFTA Film Award for Best Make-Up. Good!",The Witches
8,moonspinner55,"Better-than-average fantasy, but to whom is it intended to appeal?",6,7 September 2005,"Young boy and his wily grandmother (a surprisingly comfortable and energetic Mai Zetterling) vacation at a seaside resort and soon discover it is beset by child-hating witches. The almost-improbable screen-teaming of director Nicolas Roeg, writer Roald Dahl and effects wizard/puppeteer Jim Henson results in a predictably garish, uneven, occasionally off-putting venture which may actually intrigue grown-ups more so than kids. Some intense and amusing sequences stand out, as does Anjelica Huston's performance as the leader of the witches. Remarkable effects, a very interesting and colorful attempt, but hurt overall by too many chefs and a flabby final reel. **1/2 from ****",The Witches
9,Quinoa1984,"Fun stuff, but not my favorite Dahl adaptation.",7,11 July 2016,"The Witches, which features some surprising Nicolas Roeg direction (who knew he could pull off a movie for children, but then this seems like a fit if anything for his views of nutty outsiders and dangerous intrigue), and Jim Henson's creature shop effects and make-up, is Rrther creepy and wonderful, though I think the use of wide angles is so much in abundance Terry Gilliam might say 'ease up fellas'. The prosthetics on the actors, Huston most of all, is great as is the puppeteering (you feel the tension when a mouse is on a ladle hanging over a shelf over a giant pot of soup), though the child actors are pretty weak (expected) giving Angelica Huston ample room to steal the show as well she should. Rowan Atkinson is also a little wasted but does what he can. And at first I found the rather 'oh, I'm a mouse, OK then' reaction a little pat. But then kids I guess are resilient in the face of being transformed (presumably for forever) into another species amid a convention of witches.",The Witches
10,Coventry,All it takes are good special effects and great casting!,7,9 February 2015,"I was a tremendous big fan of Roald Dahl's books as a kid (who wasn't?) and ""The Witches"" has always been a personal favorite. I began watching this film once before already, shortly after its release on rental video, but since I was only 9 years old back then, I sat completely petrified in the sofa and my mother switched off the tape because she considered me too young for the eerie make-up effects and the continuous talk about annihilating all children. Having re-watched the film now, at the age of 33, I can finally relate to my mother and admit that I probably wouldn't prefer my young offspring to be exposed to several of the nightmarish imagery, either. This doesn't mean, however, that ""The Witches"" isn't recommended! Quite the contrary, it's a fabulously entertaining and compelling adventure that benefices enormously from the talent and craftsmanship from all its main contributors. There's Roald Dahl's writing, evidently, but also the masterful direction of Nicolas Roeg and the trustworthy overview of producer Jim Henson. Together they are responsible for the film's main success elements, including the fantastic casting choices – among the best in cinematic history – and the stupendous special effects. Young Luke enjoys to spend time with his grandmother Helga (and remains to live with her when his parents suddenly die in a car crash) because she always narrates Norwegian folklore stories about witches. When they spend a vacation at a fancy British seaside hotel, Luke accidentally attends an annual witch coven's convention and learns that the evil Grand High Witch has invented a potion to turn all of Britain's children into mice. Luke and his buddy Bruno Jenkins are turned into mice first, but they still fight back, together with Grandma Helga. The choice of casting Anjelica Huston as the Grand High Witch was downright genius! She has the ideally natural looks, charisma and voice to depict the ultimately evil battle-ax and then she still adds a delicious heavy German accent to her monologues. Speaking of the genius casting choices, Rowan Atkinson is excellent as the nervous and slightly sleazy hotel manager and the traditional Swedish actress Mai Zetterling gives a lovable performance as the grandmother. The make-up art and special effects are amazing, most notably when the doors of the witches' convention close and they reveal their true and hideous faces. Jim Henson's crew also delivers great work with the puppet mice. If the film would be remade in this modern day and age – God forbid – all the sequences with the puppet mice and witchcraft would be replaced by computerized effects. ""The Witches"" is yet another movie example to prove that good old- fashioned handwork is much better. The happy ending of the film is a bit of a letdown, especially because it differs from Roald Dahl's book ending, but that certainly doesn't prevent ""The Witches"" from being a terrific and highly recommended fantasy/adventure movie!",The Witches
11,preppy-3,Unjustly forgotten fantasy,8,29 April 2002,"Very strange fantasy in which a young boy Luke (Jasen Fisher) and his friend Bruno (Charles Potter) get in trouble with some witches (led by Anjelicia Huston). Luke's Norwegian aunt (Mai Zetterling), a former witch, helps him battle the others.When this came out in 1990 critics loved it, but audiences stayed away. Real witches attacked the film because it portrayed witches as evil, ugly and wanting to kill all children. They overreacted--it's just a FANTASY, not reality. Also it was way too strong (and strange) to attract a family audience...too scary for kids and adults assumed it was a kids movie. But it is a good fantasy for high schoolers and adults.Nicholas Roegs' direction is off-putting (he directs it like it's high art), but the special effects are truly incredible (especially the mice) and there are wonderful performances by Zetterling and Huston (going WAY over the top in her acting). It's a very strange movie--definitely a one of a kind. It's worth a look.",The Witches

13,view_and_review,Roald Dahl's Witches,7,27 May 2020,"These are not ""The Witches of Eastwick"" nor the witches of ""Hocus Pocus,"" they are Roald Dahl's version of witches.In this movie a boy discovers the heinous plot of a group of witches in England. Although he was transformed into a mouse, he has to figure out a way to stop these witches, led by the Grand High Witch (Anjelica Huston), before they execute their plan.This is a funny movie that is catered towards children, yet can be enjoyed by adults.",The Witches
14,neil-476,Excellent for scaring kids who want to be scared,8,2 November 2014,"When Luke gets a bit too suspicious of a group of women (following his grandmother telling him tell-tale signs of witches pretending to be ordinary), he gets turned into a mouse. He and his grandmother try to foil the witches' plans.Roald Dahl's The Witches is a book for kids which is funny, exciting, fast moving, and scary. Nicolas Roeg's film adaptation captures these elements very well. It is NOT a film for timid children - there are some elements in it which are amusingly grotesque if you are adult, but which might give some children nightmares.But, most of all, this is very entertaining, with a powerhouse performance by Anjelica Huston. Great stuff.",The Witches
15,Sylviastel,"Witches spend their time plotting to kill children, stalking the wretched child like a hunter stalks a bird in the forest.",9,26 August 2006,"I never read the book and I don't care too. I love Mai Zetterling's performance as the beloved Norwegian grandmother who smokes cigars and tells tales about witches. Angelica Huston might have top billing but don't underestimate Zetterling's role in the film. It is her grandson played wonderfully by Jasen Fisher who appeared in Parenthood. Brenda Blethyn OBE plays Bruno's mother in the film and Jane Horrocks plays the assistant to the grand high witch played by Huston. Rowan Atkinson does a superb supporting role as the hotel manager, Mr. Springer. Roberta Taylor has a small role and so does Anne Lambton who later appeared as a maid in Dan Ackroyd's sitcom. Anyway, they are there to attend the grand high witch's annual meeting. Angelica Huston does a delicious job in playing such a character. I love the music too. It has a great sound and I hope there is a soundtrack out for it. Anyway, they begin the film in Bergen, Norway where grandmother Helga lives, her son and daughter-in-law are visiting grandma with Luke. The son and daughter-in-law go out for the night and never come home. Luke's grandmother takes him in. They move to her house in England where Luke attends a prep school chosen by his parents. Grandma and Luke take a weekend at the seaside in Cornwall, England where the witches are gathering for their annual meeting. The film is always worth watching. I hate the television versions where they edit out scenes. It's a delightful movie all around. I just had some questions that is why I am giving it a nine because I think there was more they were not telling us like what happened to Helga when she pursued the grand high witch and whatever happened to Erica. Who was the assistant to the Grand High Witch played by Jane Horrocks?",The Witches
16,lasttimeisaw,The Witches,6,30 August 2012,"A PG-rated family-horror tale about witches, unlike THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK (1987, 5/10), this film affords a crystal-clear definition of the hidden witches among folks (wig, purple eyes and flat toes), adapted from Roald Dahl's children book, UK director Nicolas Roeg certainly taps a darker and eerier approach to visualize the images of witches (thanks to a vivd make-up feat and a grisly puppetry), which might scare off most tykes but as for an adult viewer, it has an eye-opening relish. However, up until the last moment, the adventurous rapture has come to a self-contradictory compromise, procuring a spot in the children-friendly zone, the film opts a rather arbitrary happy ending (overtly against Dahl's willingness) in order not to further upset its potential audience's feeble nerves, which cast itself out of the spectre of being an eccentric cult, a lame move with the benefit of hindsight and judging by its tepid box-office that year.The stellar Anjelica Huston has an uncanny brio to demonstrate a genuine grand high witch of Britain, the role, which instantly eclipses the 3D trinity in the TWOE (Cher herself was the original picking for the role) and would later stereotype hers in the impassive, ruthless, and alienated aura where she has been arguably hovering until today, unlike her contemporaneous Oscar- nominated role in THE GRIFTERS (1990, 7/10), where she exaggerates all her alluring poignancy in a shockingly sympathetic role, here she is the impeccable one-note villain. Mai Zetterling is well-suited in her benevolent granny role, although most of the time she is too composed in the tumultuous pandemonium as well as the rest human cast (sorry to see Atkinson and Blethyn are barbarously underused, the latter's only duty is to scream out of her lung).",The Witches
17,g-bodyl,Eh......,7,20 May 2015,"Maybe it's the fact I have gotten a little bit older and mature for this movie's intended audience, but I felt like this was a half-witted attempt to turn another Roald Dahl classic into a film. I'm not saying this movie is terrible, but it just doesn't appeal to me. I will say that this movie would have scared the jeepers out of me maybe ten years ago. The special effects are a bit outdated, but oddly enough, I did like the human-to-mouse transformations. A notice to parents: this movie will probably scare your kid, so beware if you choose to watch this on family night. Nicholas Roeg's film is about a recently-orphaned boy who moves to England with his grandmother. Staying at a hotel, he comes across a witch convention where he learns that they want to turn every English child into a mouse. Now he must try and save the day before its too late. Nothing is wrong with the acting I suppose. Anjelica Huston has a knack of playing in these kind of Gothic material, so this film is in her wheelhouse and I think she was appropriately scary. The rest of the actors, outside of Rowan Atkinson, are relatively unknown. I thought they did an okay job though. Overall, The Witches comes across as a mediocre children film and a shabby Dahl adaptation (when compared to the likes of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). There were plenty of amusing moments, and I liked the overall scary tone. This is essentially a scary movie for kids, so it's not my cup of tea. I guess kids will like this film more than I do, and that is perfectly alright. My Grade: C+",The Witches
18,cricketbat,Still holds some magic decades after it was made,8,9 October 2020,"The Witches still holds some magic decades after it was made. The transformation scenes in this fairly faithful film adaptation are impressive and the puppetry is top-notch. Plus, Anjelica Huston is absolutely fantastic as the Grand High Witch.

19,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,7,11 June 2013,"The Witches The most utilized potion in a witch's repertoire must be the starchy brew used to get their hats so pointy.However, the hags in this fantasy are more interested in a new concoction that turns children into mice.On his birthday, recently orphaned Luke (Jasen Fisher) heads to the shore with his ailing grandmother (Mai Zetterling).Checked-in at the same seaside resort as a convention of witches, Luke's exposed to a new serum that transforms him into a mouse.While the Grand High Witch (Anjelica Houston) and the rest of the coven try to exterminate him, Luke hatches a plan to give them a taste of their own medicine.Based on Roald Dahl's book, The Witches contains his trademark dark wit and an imaginative narrative, all of which are accentuated by Jim Henson's witch designs.Furthermore, with their surplus of brooms, the witches can clean hotel rooms for free board.Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.com",The Witches
20,filipemanuelneto,"For those who like horror-flavored comedies, this movie is a must.",5,4 November 2021,"In this light and familiar comedy, a boy travels with his grandmother to a secluded hotel so that the lady can recover her health with a few days of rest. However, he discovers that the hotel is hosting an annual witches' convention, under the guise of a different event, and that the national leader has evil plans to magically convert every child in England into mice.The film is slightly inspired by a Roald Dahl short story and works quite well. The story it brings is good and fun, and the film is light, unpretentious, funny and suitable for the whole family. Directed by Nicolas Roeg, the film can sometimes be a bit intimidating, mainly because of the witches' visual aspect, but I handled it well. There's a slight tension that runs through the entire film, but it's nothing to stop a child from seeing this unless they're really weak in spirit.The best part of the film is, without any great doubts, the excellent performance of Anjelica Huston, which people will recognize more easily, from her participation in the ""Addams Family"" movies. The actress is pleasantly dark, and her presence is dominant, stealing attention and giving us the feeling of a secure woman, but also menacing. Mai Zetterling has also done a pretty good job of it, and Jasen Fisher has known how to untangle herself from the challenges she faced, even though she's an underdeveloped character.On a technical level, the film stands out for the good special effects used, which include purple smoke, a very diverse list of challenging characterizations and other creative effects. In addition, the film also features good cinematography and excellent filming and editing work. The soundtrack, gothic with a touch of suspense, works reasonably well.",The Witches

By contrast, the remake seems so sanitized and soft that I barely have any desire to watch it despite the involvement of Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron and Robert Zemeckis.I would have loved to see the stop-motion version Guillermo del Toro wanted to do a couple of years, and it's such a shame it never come to fruition.",The Witches

Surely the boys from this movie did.Plus the story contains magic spells, a very tender relationship between a grandmother and her grandson, and a magical hamster adventure.This movie had it all back in 1990 when it was extremely popular and suitable for all ages.I remember this movie with tenderness because I used to watch it many times as a kid and I still think it works for children who are enthusiastic to watch a Fantasy movie.The f/x were very ahead of it's time; not to mention the very creepy witch incarnations that stood in my memory. Angelica Houston delivered a very creepy and intense performance and makes the movie watchable.Please give it a chance (again) and pass it to your children.

27,funkyfry,It's a winner,7,5 February 2007,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this 1990 kiddie fantasy film, but thought it was worth taking a look at for Dahl's original story and performances by Rowan Atkinson and Anjelica Huston. The film passes the grade -- it doesn't talk down to either its child or adult audience, and contains a dark sense of humor combined with memorable characters.The plot concerns a little boy named Luke (Jasen Fisher), recently orphaned, who is taken with him grand mom (Mai Zetterling, showing impressive gravitas in this role) on a holiday by the beach, staying at a posh hotel run by a ""stuffed shirt"" who sleeps with his hired maids, Mr. Stringer (Atkinson). They become enmeshed in a conspiracy launched by the Grand High Witch (Huston) to turn every child in England into a mouse. After he and a corpulent friend are turned into mice, Luke must attempt to save the future of the Kingdom and escape all cats in the vicinity at the same time.The film is somewhat remarkable for being so straightforward -- these witches just HATE children and that's pretty much what they are about. I'd say the screenplay was good; I haven't read the Dahl story but it had enough of the sense of irony and self-awareness that I've seen in his other books to believe it's a reasonably faithful adaption. Roeg tones down his sometimes chaotic style of directing and gets some fine work in here, even managing to make some of the film's more casual scenes memorable.I have to admit I'm a fan of Rowan Atkinson, and this was one of his better small roles. I've never seen him in a romantic situation as they showed which was a novelty. He's perfect for the role, which he invests with his best sniveling self-superior nerd act.If there's a problem with the film for me, it was with the lengthy sequences where the Grand High Witch explains her plan to the other witches. It went on for far too long for an expository scene in a children's film, and I can only imagine that the film-makers (chief among them Jim Henson as exec producer, one of his last credits) wrongly believed that the animatronic work on the GHW's ""true face"" would sustain the scene's dynamics. Instead we feel as if we are watching a puppet talk for 5 or 10 minutes, which is exactly what we're doing. At this point the scene fails to generate the excitement or dread that it should -- or that for example Walter Murch created in his scenes with the evil headless witch in ""Return to Oz"". We've seen too much already, there is nothing for the rest of the film to build up to. I felt that Huston is a great actress and they should have allowed her to do the scene instead of cheating with effects. The scenes with Huston in her campy witch persona without makeup are among the best in the film.Only other problem, the ending felt a bit rushed to me, the problems were solved a bit too easily. On the whole though, this is a film I would think kids would enjoy and adults will not feel insulted by, so people might want to think about seeking this out instead of a lot of the awful stuff being done nowadays. It's become an oldie-but-goodie in the fast-moving kiddie fantasy world.",The Witches

It turns out that Eva is in fact the Grand High witch in disguise who wears a prosthetic mask to hide her real appearance/identity.Also starring Brenda Blythn this film is actually pretty good. The acting is decent,the plot is easy to follow but the real star of this movie is the special makeup effects as well as the performance by Angelica Huston. I actually read the book of The Witches as a kid and thoroughly enjoyed the book which was wrote by the late UK author Roald Dahl who also wrote Matilda.It is funny that The Witches,Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and Matilda are the only 3 books that were turned into movies. Shame the likes of The Twits never got a movie of its own. Catch out the remake of The Witches coming 2020 with Anne Hathaway as The Grand Witch and Stanley Tucci.If you can forgive the bizarre goofs such as a few men are seen in drag when the grand witch tells them to take off their wigs and their shoes as well as seeing bald caps been worn by the actors.",The Witches
30,Polaris_DiB,I don't know what to do with it,4,16 April 2007,"Nicolas Roeg is my favorite director ever; Jim Henson stands as one of the best creators of children's and family entertainment in history, and his movies never really disappoint in terms of visual quirkiness and lovable characters; Roald Dahl has to be one of the most interesting individual children's author in the history of people assuming children's authors were really writing about very adult things (adult things even adults can't handle adult things). Whatever witch's brew mixed these together, the result has to be magic, and it is, it's just so hard to know what to do with.The problem with The Witches is that it's too scary for children and it's too childish for adults. I'm never scared by movies, but the mouse-changing effects (to the point of giant seizuring bobble-heads!), Anjelica Huston peeling her face off, and the weird rubber witch/mouse mix at the end are stronger and more shocking variants of the type of stuff you'd find in The Howling series of movies or other schlock horror. For kids, that's pretty intimidating stuff. The film tries to make up for it with comedic relief in the form of the actual adventure story involving the young boy and his fat friend, Bruno, along with repeated instances of people getting freaked out by the mice (everyone in this movie is either afraid of mice or a witch themselves, save the lead characters), but the little kid's voice over is incessant and annoying. The movie has many really silly and fun situations (especially involving the hotel manager and the grandmother), but some strange moments that don't really seem to follow any logic at all (the whole thing with the baby in the cart).It's certainly an enigmatic little film. I think if anything it shows that Roeg probably is a bit too zealous to make children's entertainment, and that Henson's well-regarded darker side can really go all out when asked. Oh, and that Roald Dahl was a strange man, but we knew that already.--PolarisDiB",The Witches
31,kevin_robbins,This is a tremendously well done film that is a great family horror film for the holiday season,9,1 October 2021,"The Witches (1990) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a little boy and grandmother who stay at a hotel that happens to be hosting a witches convention that may tie into the grandmothers extensive knowledge of witches. The little boy and a new found friend will have to work together if they want to stop the witches from capturing all the children in Europe. This movie is directed by Nicolas Roeg (Don't Look Now) and stars Anjelica Huston (The Addams Family), Mai Zetterling (Amorosa), Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) and Jasen Fisher (Hook). The storyline for this picture is a beautiful blend of child friendly, with some horror elements and comedic hijinks. The film does a great job setting the tone with a great opening and the grandmothers storytelling. The special effects, makeup and masks of the witches are over the top well done. I also enjoyed the mice sequences. I loved the casting - Hustin was an awesome villain and Atkinson was his usual hilarious self. Overall this is a tremendously well done film that is a great family horror film for the holiday season. This is a gem and a 9/10 for me.",The Witches
32,GiraffeDoor,Still disturbs me.,8,16 June 2019,"I'm a bit sour grapes about Dahl but I would be lying if I said the book didn't terrify little me and the Movie more so.This is that special brand of freaky, campy, in your face child horror that is just in-your-face enough to pass as a movie that's OK for kids but then haunts their nightmares for ever.They were not going for subtle here, like the Evil Dead before them, they decided they would not do this in half measures. Uncompromising, unlovely forces of evil trick children to their doom and they could be anywhere. As it lays its ground work, audacious cinematography, nightmarish make up and stylish direction make this modern fairytale ooze off the screen.It is somewhat less terrifying in its second half when it turns into more of a schlocky adventure but it's actually pretty refreshing. It remembers to through in some shocking images before the end.Very satisfying piece of juvenile macabre done with verve and imagination. Perhaps the best adaption of its writers works.Do not believe the PG rating! This picture freaked me out, man... if you watch this with your 8 year old they will insist on sleeping in your bed till they their first menarche. But hey, maybe you want that, I don't judge.",The Witches
33,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Awesome Dahl adaptation, wonderfully spooky",9,13 September 2015,"Nicholas Roeg's The Witches is, in my opinion, the only adaptation of a beloved Roald Dahl book that has succeeded. Not in being a good movie mind you, Matilda, the original Willy Wonka, Fantastic Mr. Fox were great, and James And The Giant Peach was excellent, but this one was the one to actually capture the twisted, scrumptious vernacular that Dahl lovingly poured onto his pages, and translate that into a piece of celluloid that retains that extremely specific style and delicious penmanship that made the man who he is. The Witches is his darkest novel, the only one to border on outright horror, and Roeg's knows how to play up the freaky aspects, utilizing grotesquely wonderful practical effects and a mischievously nasty tone. A grandmother (golden age Norwegian actress Mai Zetterling) tells her grandson (Jaren Fisher) eerie stories of 'the witches', terrifying creatures with long nails, bald heads and a penchant for killing children in nasty ways. They wear wigs and get all prim and pretty to disguise themselves, but, as granny says, there are certain specific clues which give them away. The boy inevitably has encounters with them though, and for a film based on a children's book, they sure will give you nightmares. The gore is spared, the effects are gruesome yet still not that bad, it's just the situational dread that gets to you. Pretty soon while on vacation, he finds himself at the same hotel that the witches hold their annual convention at, straight into the proverbial hornet's nest. After being spotted, they cruelly change him into a mouse, and with the help of his grandmother, must try to eliminate the evil threat for good. They find themselves at odds with the maniacal Grand High Witch (a strutting, acid tongued Anjelica Huston), the tyrannical ringleader of their disgusting race. The only complaint I have is that the filmmakers tacked on a syrupy, cathartic ending that the book most certainly did not have. Ditch that, and you'd have a near perfect flick. Dahl wrote a dark, delightful fable with monstrous elements, rooted in the fierce love between the grandmother and boy, like a beacon of humanity amongst monsters. Roeg's vision reflects that lovingly, recalls the book, and faithfully brings it to macabre, spooky life.",The Witches
34,ShootingShark,"Dark, Humorous, Captivating Story Of Plucky Boy Vs Witches Coven",7,27 April 2010,"Luke and his grandmother are taking a holiday in an English hotel when he discovers an RSPCC delegation are actually a coven of witches with a fiendish plan to kill every child in England. Things get worse when they turn him into a mouse. How can he and his Gran defeat these evil harpies ?Based on one of Roald Dahl's classic funny / scary children's books, this a great ripping yarn full of spooky moments, gruesomely gross scenes, hilarious characters and lots of amusingly heroic episodes. Roeg is perhaps an unusual choice to direct a children's film but he creates an evocative mood (the story of the girl trapped in the picture brings me out in goosebumps every time) and casts the film to perfection with great character actors who bring out all the laughs and scares the story packs in. Zetterling - the gifted director of movies like Scrubbers - is just fantastic as Grandma, with her sly glances, matter-of-fact delivery and ever-present cigar, and is well matched by the formidable Huston as the Grand High Witch (whose hands alone are worth catching this movie for). Paterson does a great schtick as a loudmouthed hotel guest (he briefly flusters Huston by asking ""Just flew in, did you ?""), Atkinson is on fine form as the officious manager, and Horrocks has a scene-stealing little part as a flunky. There are some great sequences; the big ""Weetches ov Heenkland !"" speech, Luke's daring escape from the conference room, the mouse-in-the-kitchen escapade and the suitably comic/violent finale. Dahl's stories are frequently gleefully horrible (one reason why they're so popular with kids), and this film, despite a happier ending than the book, exploits that quality to the full. The jaunty score by Stanley Myers, full of duelling violins and trumpets, bounces the whole thing along with gusto, bringing the humorous element to the fore and finishing off this delicious dessert of a movie. Sadly, this was the last film that the late great Jim Henson worked on before his untimely death at the age of 53, but it epitomises the imaginative, funny and enthralling love of storytelling which he brought to everything he did. Shot in Bergen in western Norway and Newquay in Cornwall.",The Witches
35,screenman,Great Comedy For Kids,7,19 October 2008,"Roald Dahl may not have enjoyed the towering (financial) success of J K Rowling, but he knew how to spin a good yarn for kids.'The Witches' screens an excellent blend of The Master's dark story and British slap-stick humour, the whole thing realised in a seaside hotel that might be run by Basil Fawlty.These witches have gathered at the hotel to finalise plans for the extermination of nasty, smelly children (good luck to 'em, I say). Ably led by Angelica Housten - who camps it up so far over the top as Grand High Witch that you almost wish she could win - they are going to put her master-plan into execution, using a particularly powerful magic poison.Our young hero, staying there with his invalid grandmother, accidentally discovers their plan, and being captured, is turned into a mouse.The whole adventure becomes a race against time to stop them before it's too late.Dahl has such a dark humour that - brought to screen - almost qualifies for an adult rating. Some of the scenes of - what are, in effect, child cruelty - are singularly out of step with modern political-correctness (now there's a real poison). And some of the scenes of metamorphosis, especially amongst the witches, are almost the stuff of nightmares. This is certainly not suitable for tots. Rowan Atkinson's groping of the hotel staff may also raise an eyebrow or two amongst more sensitive viewers.The movie has extremes. At one level it is hilarious, at another it is extremely creepy, then at another it seems oddly realistic, with people engaging in fractious and believable arguments. The switch from one situation to another is sometimes a little uneven. Rowan Atkinson plays a strange role as hotel manager; at once the rubber-faced clown of 'Mr Bean', then later as suave as one of his 'Blackadder' incarnations. Then, at other times he is the lecherous groper of room-maids. Once again, it's a little uneven.Dahl can be shocking. He is a phenomenon you really need to have grown up with. He doesn't baulk at belching and farting, or even torture and cannibalism. And most kids love his anarchic style of story-telling. Enid Blyton he ain't. Despite the wobbly continuity of this movie, it offers a worthy presentation of his work that will have most kids, grown-up or not, thoroughly entertained.",The Witches
36,mike48128,This is not a Muppet Movie. Too scary for young children.,8,12 May 2012,"Rated ""8"" because the special effects are outstanding. Otherwise a solid ""7"" because it is a disturbingly scary film that should be rated PG-13. Also, the pacing is a bit off, as the last 30 minutes seems rushed. As an adult, I can appreciate the fantastic make-up on Angelica Huston as the Grand High Witch, but it is really too scary for little children. Jim Henson's Creature Shop's work is superb and Rowan Atkinson (""Mr. Bean"") ineptly manages the hotel where the witches hold their convention. Luke and Bruno are turned into mice as a test for a magical formula meant to eradicate children around the entire world. The talking mice are amazing; animatronic puppets like the Doozers of Fraggle Rock. Please note that in Dahl's book, Luke does not become a real boy again. Luke remains a mouse and intends to do battle with the witches in America. In my Warner Bros. DVD release, the boy is returned to human form by the ""good witch"" at the very last moment which changes the film, making it more ""kid-friendly"". (I don't think that this is the original ending on the initial release of this film, after reading the critical reviews.) The make-up and special effects are outstanding for a movie made long before CGI. More fun to watch the second time around, as when the witches turn into mice it is truly startling but less disturbing! Angelica Huston's make-up and prosthetics are just deliciously scary!Especially recommended for all adult Jim Henson fans and children old enough to view ""Harry Potter"" movies. It was Henson's last film project before his untimely death. Great Halloween fun.",The Witches

It's a little dated and the script which is based on the same Roald Dahl book has some different plot threads but those who saw it first highly recommend it (and I think it is a little less terrifying for children than the 2021 production).

38,frankde-jong,A film for all ages,8,23 December 2020,"Children's movies made by directors who also can make good movies for grown ups are my guilty pleasure. I enjoyed watching ""Something wicked this way comes"" (1983, Jack Clayton) and ""Stand by me"" (1986, Rob Reiner). I also enjoyed ""The witches"" of Nicolas Roeg.Is it really a film for children only? Roald Dahl wrote story's for both children and grown ups, but ""The witches"" is generally considered a story for children. The adaptation Roeg made is however rather tense, especially in the kitchen scene the hero of the movie faces (literally) hot fires. The reference made to ""Battleship Potemkin"" (1925, Sergei Eisenstein) in a scene where a babycar is tumbling down a hill is certainly not directed to a young audience. I watched the movie on TV and the time at which it was scheduled indicated that also the TV station did not regard it as a ""pure"" move for children.Whatever the case, in 2020 Robert Zemeckis (who, by the way, can also make a good movie for grown ups) made another adaptation of the Roald Dahl story. The reviews were not positive. Lead actress Anne Hathaway falls as Grand High Witch short of Anjelica Huston and the computer generated images of Zemeckis are beaten by the make up department of Nicolas Roeg (which was only a fraction of that of Zemeckis).Anjelica Huston plays a fantastic role as the totally villainous Grand High witch. Sometimes great make up replaces great acting. Not this time!In my opinion the only downside is the artificial happy ending that Roeg apparently found necessary. It does not appear in the story of Dahl, nor is a happy ending a habit of Roeg in his movies for grown ups.",The Witches

The grand high witch and her transformation along with the children's transformations were great. The rat puppets were good too. There was a witch convention at the hotel and Bruno and Luke were it turned into mice. The grandma lowered her sewing to the hotel room of the grand high witch so that her grandson Luke in it can get the potion before getting eaten by Liebchen the witch's cat. They all turned them into witches except for the secretary who came over to their house and turned him back into human although he was loving to be a rat. It was a good heartwarming film along the lines of Home Alone without the good acting especially the child actor playing Luke's mediocre acting pulled me out of the film several times.

42,Ruskington,An ambitious attempt that never really stood a chance,4,13 April 2020,"Even though I devoured Roald Dahl books as a child, The Witches never quite captured me in the way that his other work did. I did enjoy the premise of the story; the idea of witches existing in normal society disguised as elegant women certainly had the potential for a great novel. But ultimately, it all became a bit far-fetched and the main characters were just not interesting or charming enough.The movie adaptation is a pretty good effort overall but still struggles to dress up a relatively thin story. Anjelica Huston is comfortably the best thing about the film; she is pretty much the perfect casting choice and delivers everything you would want from the Grand High Witch. The rest of the cast is fine but, Jane Horrocks aside, there is a lack of memorable or loveable characters.For a film that relies so heavily on its visual effects, The Witches is a bit of a mixed bag in this regard. The make-up is over the top in my opinion: many of the witches look like drag queens and the unveiled Grand High Witch just looks unnecessarily gruesome. I think the overall impact would have been better with a touch more subtlety. The mouse animation is acceptable, but it does kind of feel like you're suddenly watching Bagpuss and it contrasts harshly with the rest of the film.The choice to change the ending is basically sacrilege in my opinion. I have no idea why Nicolas Roeg felt the need to do this and I am glad to hear that Dahl himself was appalled by it.The Witches is a bit of a fail for me. Roeg seems to be trying too hard to create an artsy gothic feel to the film and it ends up looking a bit tacky. Funnily enough, as much as I disliked his adaptation of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, I think The Witches would have been much better off in the hands of Tim Burton.",The Witches
43,johnstonjames,"Paranoid , Chauvinistic And Totally Hilarious",10,25 April 2012,"this movie is so funny. it's also pretty terrifying as well. i don't think most kids under ten years old can probably handle these scares, but i would still recommend it for all ages because it is so genuinely quaint and witty and very cute. everything Jim Henson created was pure magic.i've actually read Roald Dahl's children book. i'm a big fan of Dahl's witticisms and having read this, i'd say this adaptation, except for the ending, sticks closely to the book. this is a strange work of paranoia and chauvinism, pretty much aimed at women and femininity. so basically Dahl should take most of the blame here. most children's stories are made to comfort or educate, Dahl's 'The Witches' mostly seems designed to alarm and incite. i don't see too much of a problem with that really, because it's done with such humour and well, life isn't always pretty or cozy.every time i see this i can't believe how funny it is. i mean just downright hilarious. and it's humour is very subtle and sophisticated for a children's work. it satirizes the very nature of the feminine. the horrible witches here are the very opposite of the nurturing mother figure. that's evident in the hilarious front the witches have which is a charity for the prevention of child abuse. rather than nurture, these women want to kill. and they don't want to kill just anybody, they want to kill children. the very opposite of the mother image.not every woman is a baddie. chubby little Bruno has a nice enough and normal mother, and Luke's cigar smoking granny is positively butch. and the witches themselves are diluted somewhat by the conversion of the littlest witch.Anjelica Huston almost steals the show away from Henson and director Nicholas Roeg's brilliantly atmospheric and eerily real stylization. Huston's witch is terrifyingly homicidal, masked by a thin acceptance of refinement and graciousness. she proudly asserts her dominance over the other's by belittling the others and occasionally killing some by zapping them into cinders. Huston does this with a complete restraint while still pushing the performance wildly over the top. it's honestly a little unnerving as to how well she seems to understand her horrifying characterization.the two little boys who play the unfortunate Luke and his chubby pal Bruno are outstanding. especially the kid who plays Bruno. he truly seems to channel the comic qualities of his role.this movie is definitely for kids. even young kids might find it exciting. but parents should be cautioned, i find this movie to be pretty chilling and frightening. and the horrors the witches inflict on the two little boys looks painful and horrible.this move is sophisticated and stylish, first rate entertainment for children. and it's message is more productive than you might think. don't be so trusting, life is full of cruelty. sometimes paranoids have real enemies.",The Witches

46,Min111,Witches,6,13 November 2017,"This film was made on the year I was born, so it makes it extra special for me to see. Ironically, Roald Dahl (one of my favourite writers) happened to pass away on that year too. ""The Witches"" was a wonderful film, and one of the best Roald Dahl films out there. In fact, most of his films were actually pretty good anyway. Personally, ""The Witches"" was my third favourite Roald Dahl film (the other two being Matilda and James and the Giant Peach), but ""The Witches"" is the most ""darkest"" of all the Roald Dahl films. That was a good thing by the way. It makes it interesting to see. That's something I liked. The film was very scary to watch as a child. It will scare the kids for sure. It's a scary film to watch for Halloween; just be sure to add it to your watchlist! The characters were really good. What I liked the most were those witches. There were lots of them. They're all very wicked. Many of these witches gathered together at the hotel. The film portrays these ""witches"" ever so well. In fact, it's one of the best films about witches. I also really liked Luke. He's the main character. He's a brave young boy. The kids will like him. I like how he takes on those witches. He's practically all on his own though he does get assistance from his grandmother who knows a lot about witches. The grand high witch, though, was scary. She's the leader. I couldn't believe how hideous, repulsive and ugly she really was. I never seen anything like it. These witches are very evil. I wanted them all defeated and destroyed, and that's what happened towards the end. You, the viewer, are always supporting Luke in his trip at the hotel. It's his ""little"" adventure. The icing on the cake would have to be that Rowan Atkinson was part of this film. He added that ""flavour"" if you know what I mean. You first have to see it in order to understand what I meant by that. I liked him in the movie. He made the movie exciting. He was funny. ""The Witches"" would've been a lot different without him. He was the trump card or something. Let's not forget Luke's new friend named Bruno. All he does is likes to eat. The only regret was that a sequel wasn't made given how the ending planned out though it wasn't necessary. It would've been nice if there was a sequel - The Witches 2 or something. I leave that to people's imagination. I can't believe that there are more witches out there given what happens towards the end. There's also a book titled ""The Witches"". It's a popular book. The family will like ""The Witches"" for sure along with the other Roald Dahl films.",The Witches
47,elicopperman,Frightening for its Time,6,25 October 2020,"In 1990, the year that famed children's book author Roald Dahl passed away, a notable film adaptation of a lesser well known book of his The Witches came out. Directed by Nicholas Roeg and co-produced by Jim Henson (who passed away before the film came out), the film was a box-office flop on its original release and Dahl himself loathed it (as he did with most adaptations of his work). However, the film was well received critically, and it has gained a cult following from those who grew up with it (many of whom were traumatized by its dark tone). Looking at the film now after 30 years, it's certainly an interesting albeit flawed effort.The film revolves around a young boy named Luke and his grandmother Helga residing at a British hotel, where a convention of witches led by The Grand High Witch takes place. They seek to turn all children into mice with their own magical formula, with Luke and another boy being one of them. So now Luke and his grandmother must fight back against the witches. With a concept like that, this does make for a very intriguing storyline for a dark children's fantasy, and part of the film's strong suit lies in its suspense. From the mythos of evil witches hunting children, to Helga's own experiences with witches, and even all the circumstances Luke ends up in around the witches, the movie does not hold back in putting its viewers on the edge of their seats. Even with little chunks of humor sprinkled in, the movie is mostly very bleak, and the touches of danger come from the main character as a mouse struggling to survive. It's not very often when a family film steeps into so many life threatening situations as unpredictable as this one.Unfortunately, for all of the movie's triumphs in its tone, it sadly left a lot to be desired substance-wise. While the decision to not explain Helga's past with the witches adds to the mystery of these strange beings, it also undermines her reasoning for fearing the Grand High Witch in particular. Also, as good as the actors are in bringing their roles to life, the material they have to work with is kinda weak, since the characters are fairly one note and don't offer much outside of typical children's stories archetypes. For example: Luke's the brainiac smart kid, Bruno Jenkins is the squirmy fat kid, Helga is just a timid old lady, Mr. Stringer is the overly strict hotel manager, so on and so forth. The plot itself is too straight forward for its own good as well, as it's more of a revenge on the witches film and nothing else, not helped by the secondary characters being too annoying and dim witted to be taken seriously. Finally, without spoiling the film's ending, it completely contradicted the book's original message of having to continue your life through a massive change you did not expect.In terms of other notable praise, the puppetry and makeup done for the film is so impressive for its time, even nowadays too. The way the witches show off their fake beautiful personas and their real ugly selves is nothing short of elaborately seamless, and one can tell Angelica Huston really had to work with that face gear to make the Grand High Witch's performance genuine. Considering this was one of the last projects that Jim Henson was involved in, there's no denying how much attention to detail he and his company put into the production design of the feature. Aided by Nicholas Roeg's intentionally scattered direction and Harvey Harrison's playful cinematography, these props and puppets really shine on the screen. Plus, Luke as a mouse is so cute that one could forget a real mouse wasn't even used that much. Perhaps some of the witch designs and mouse transformations could come off as a little too frightening, which might be why the film flopped on its original release, but they're still some of the most creative designs ever to come out of any Dahl movie.So for all its hits and misses, The Witches is still an intriguing family film that might not even be for the whole family. In a day and age where a lot of mainstream family films have lost a certain edge that wasn't afraid to shock its target audience, this film remains a nice time capsule to a more creepy time in cinema. Not only do I recommend this movie for a new audience, I would also suggest giving the original book a read. In addition to a brand new adaptation by Robert Zemeckis that's out on HBO Max, looks like one of the more obscure Dahl tale will gain some new limelight once and for all.",The Witches
48,DavidSim240183,"Wonderfully dark, and truly bewitching",9,31 December 2006,"The Witches is one of Roald Dahl's finest books. Not only is it a great read, just like everything else he ever wrote, its also one of his most terrifying. The point that it puts across is children all over the world are preyed upon by evil witches, and will kill them for no other reason than the fact that they can't stand children. Roald Dahl was often rather cruel to children in his books, and in The Witches he even goes so far to remark that they smell like dog droppings to witches.The film version was sadly overlooked upon its release in 1990. A shame really because of the talent assembled, and also because its remarkably successful in maintaining Dahl's trademark menacing overtones. In fact The Witches is a disturbingly sinister children's film. And really the only complaint I have is the disappointingly optimistic ending. If only it had the courage to see things through to their natural conclusion like the book, I would have given the film 10/10, and it may have even surpassed Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, the finest example of a Dahl screen adaptation.The villains in Roald Dahl's books are nearly always adults. And in The Witches, they get their most terrifying roles to play. The witches of the world are explained to us in a marvellous little vignette that has the actual feel of a lyrical fairytale. But written by the Brothers Grimm.Helga Eveshim (a charming performance by the late Mai Zetterling) is a retired witch-hunter. She explains to her grandson Luke how dangerous witches are. How instead of pointy hats and broomsticks, they look perfectly normal, have pleasant smiling faces, and work in ordinary jobs. But really they're bald, they have purple eyes, feet with no toes and a strong sense of smell for sniffing out children.After we learn the tragic tale of an innocent child entrapped in a painting by a witch, the story shifts from Dahl's native Norway to an English hotel. While Helga and Luke are staying there, a witches convention arrives, led by the Grand High Witch (a grandstanding show from Anjelica Huston).She is not satisfied with the witches dealings with children. And so she's come up with a way to get rid of them all in one stroke. A magic formula that can turn a human into a mouse. The witches will buy as many sweet shops as they can, and put the formula into the chocolate. Luke overhears the plot, and along with a greedy boy called Bruno, both are turned into mice. With the help of Helga, they must stop the witches here and now before they carry out their plan.The Witches is a fantastic kids film. In fact, I would say its far more enjoyable for adults, because they can appreciate more the technical skill that went into making it, not to mention the sly level of satire that went over my head as a child.It makes plenty of digs at British culture, especially the staff you get at British hotels. Check out Rowan Atkinson as a Fawlty Towers like owner, carrying on a relationship with one of the cleaning staff.But the chief pleasures of the film are the rousing adventures Luke and Bruno have as mice in the hotel. The makeup work and animatronic effects provided by the late Jim Henson (his last film as it turned out) are superb. The voices of Luke and Bruno are perfectly synchronised with the puppetised mice, who are a plucky heroic duo. And the true appearance of the Grand High Witch is as frightening as she is ugly. Even at the end of his life, Jim Henson was still a genius and everything he touched turned to magic. We miss you Jim!The acting from all involved is excellent. Mai Zetterling plays the part of Luke's grandmother with considerable charm and maternal warmth, and even Atkinson is amusing as he watches the events at his hotel descend into chaos.But its Anjelica Huston who dominates, bringing fire, zest and complete evil to the part of the Grand High Witch. She can command a whole room to silence by the power of her voice alone. Which is all the more remarkable considering her scenes where she's buried under tons of makeup. But her personality continues to shine through, and is equal parts hilarious and terrifying. Anjelica Huston is one of my favourite actresses, and she really impresses in one of her first starring roles.The film's more sinister side is considerably disturbing at times. The Witches is a very intense film, complete with tight angles showing the witches grinning evilly, scenes of Luke nearly getting his tail cut off, and the very uneasy scene when a witch tries to coax Luke out of his treehouse with promises of chocolate and friendship that has an almost disturbing residue of realism to it.But The Witches is also a lot of fun, especially Luke and Bruno's hijinks. Running across corridors, chased by cats, wreaking havoc in a kitchen, its all tremendously entertaining. But as I mentioned before, the only sour side is the ending.The film adds an unnecessary character of a good witch, played by Jane Horrocks. She sympathises with Luke, and turns him back into a boy, where the book more daringly kept him as a mouse. I do like Jane Horrocks, and she's likable in the part, but the happier ending feels out of place with everything else in the film, and spoils what was a rip-roaring adventure.Nevertheless, I highly recommend The Witches. Its a refreshing alternative to the sugary sweet pickings of todays kids films. Its smart, fun, scary and helped immeasurably by great music too.Fantastic stuff!",The Witches

50,EthanBJones_03,An entertaining flick but I would turn your brain off for this one,4,17 August 2016,"Overall: I known 4/10 seems quite low but in Gods honest truth, I didn't enjoy this movie half as much as some other Dahl movies. Entertaining? yes; worth a watch? Yes; 100% Rotten Tomatoes? I think this is a stretch. I would recommend a one time watch with this movie but just don't think about it at all.Good: The effects would have been good for it's time but do feel quite dated today. The music and cinematography is excellent and miles better than expected. It entertains you from start to finish and I was never bored purse. The pacing is decently done. They definitely made the witches look revolting even by today's standards.Bad: As stated above, the effects are sub par today but that can't be helped. The characters aren't interesting nor is the sub par acting that lifts them of the page. An absurd number of plot holes and inconsistencies that I actually lost count while watching. The ending was clearly done last minute and was just done to make it all nice and happy. It doesn't feel like it knows what it's doing; the concept of magic and evil witches could be good for children but the content is more suitable for older audiences who wouldn't be interested.Best Part: The grand and disturbing unveiling of the witches beneath their masks.4/10",The Witches
51,gpeevers,Another Great Roald Dahl Story,7,18 June 2009,"A young boy named Luke who has recently lost his parents, while traveling with his grandmother Helga (Mai Zetterling) they stumble across a convention of witches at a seaside resort in England. The witches masquerading as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are in fact launching a plan to turn all the children in England into mice. Apparently witches simply don't like the smell of children. It seems the Helga is somewhat acquainted with witches and the danger they pose. Unfortunately though when Luke attempts to spy upon them, he is caught and switched into a mouse while still retaining his mental faculties. It's now up to Helga and her grandson (now in mouse form) to stop this fate from befalling other children.This is another good family film based on the works of Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda) which should appeal to both adults and children, though it might be somewhat frightening to younger children.The wonderful cast includes a frightening Angelica Huston as the head witch as well as Jane Horrocks, Rowan Atkinson and Brenda Blethyn.This would be the only real family or children's film by Nicholas Roeg, a Director with considerable visual skills.This was the last film in which Jim Henson was personally involved before his untimely death. In addition to the contributions of his Creature Shop he served as a producer.Apparently both of the directors Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuarón have expressed interest in filming there own version of the book.",The Witches
52,Darkjak007,Your in for a treat,7,31 October 2021,"Based off the book by Roald Dahl The Witches tells the story of a boy named Luke who after losing his parents goes to live with his grandmother after his grandmotherfalls ill with diabetes. It's advises they spend the summer by the sea at a hotel. While there luke stumbles across a convention of witches who plan to rid the world of all children. The longest time this was the the only Dahl adaptation I haven't seen. I always heard mention of it, so I decided to check it out .I have to say this films has all that humor and charm that the other filmslike Matilda or Willy Wonka. The film has fun with the story and the characters a likeable. How the main kids are so calm about being turned into mice. Bruno parents who are just stereotypical rich. Even small role for Mr bean himself Rowan Atkinson. Though of the most impactful is is Anjelica huston as the grand witch. The makeup used on her the boils and the loose skin is great. Andher accent just help adds to that creepy crone appearance. Though I have to say it's a fun movie, overall want really helps is it tone it taking very morbid and serious in some part, but still so silly at the same time.",The Witches
53,mirosuionitsaki2,I can consider this a horror movie,9,2 August 2007,"As a child, I did not remember this movie at all scaring me. Now older, it was just the smallest percentage you can think of horrific to me. But I still consider this a nice family horror movie. I thought Anjelica Huston did a wonderful job as the Grand High Witch. Her appearance looks so.. powerful. I thought Jasen Fisher did an okay job though. Also, it's a shame that Mai Zetterling passed away, she did such a good job as Helga.Well anyways, this movie was a wonderful movie. It was directed in such a wonderful atmosphere and I loved the way that hotel looked. I just thought that the kitchen and the ending was too messy and unorganized so it was just.. aggrivating.I recommend this movie to everyone.

The special effects do seem to be impressive for the time it was filmed/released. I did notice a few plot holes. Oddly, despite the diversity in the group attending the witches' conference, visiting from all over (and including men in drag), there are no black women! Anyways, overall this is a pretty freaky movie. Would I watch it again? No. Would I watch the new remake? Yes.",The Witches
55,kingofdanerds,A very disturbing children's film but it a good one too,8,20 October 2020,"I remember this film. You bet I do. This is the film that as a little kid, scared the crap out of me!!! The Witches is a film that I decided to revisit after so many years when I saw the film on Netflix (and having heard of the upcoming remake as well). The Witches is a 1990 film that was based off of the 1983 book by Roald Dahl titled ""The Witches"". The film itself was actually kept on the shelve until Warner Bros. decided to release it. The film itself was a critical hit but was a box office bomb. The film itself was produced by Jim Henson and his production company and the film stars Anjelica Huston as The Grand High Witch and even has Rowan Atkinson in this film. While the film did get critical praise, Roald Dahl himself did not really care for the film (much like how he did not like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory).The film follows a little boy named Luke who is with his grandmother who tells him about ""The Witches"". Apparently his grandmother had some problems with witches in the past. The Witches are evil and they despise children and want to rid the world of children. Luke and his grandmother go to a hotel and Luke finds that a massive gathering of witches are at the hotel. In the group of witches is the evilest, most vile witch of all, the Grand High Witch. She has a plan to get rid of the children and it is up to Luke to stop them.First of all, I have never read the 1983 book on which this film is based upon. But I am aware that some things were changed, largely the ending of the book. Now, I have read a few of Roald Dahl's books and I am aware of the style that makes him fairly unique and for the most part, his style is very apparent in his films and this film is no exception. This film is a dark comedy made for kids and it does deliver fairly well in the dark comedy and in kids area. The dark comedy is very dark and even terrifying. The Grand High Witch's appearance is very creepy and through in the wide angle camera work and Anjelica Huston's performance, it makes it truly terrifying. The makeup work is absolutely amazing here. The overall effects are truly spectacular as well and...... effectively disturbing. Seeing the transformation of human to mice is done fairly well and can get just a little goofy at times. The acting is OK. The kid who plays Luke has some goofy line deliveries but overall, the acting is OK. Anjelica Huston obviously takes the top spot here as she gives an amazing performace as the Grand High Witch and appears to be having so much fun while playing her. Some of the events are a little predictable here but that is not too bad here. Apparently alot of the more scary parts were removed due to the director's child being too scared. But, it would have been nice to see some of those more scarier scenes.The Witches is a fun film to watch and a film that manages to be disturbing and scary and appeal to kids at the same time. Anjelica Huston gives an amazing performance here.",The Witches
56,LanceBrave,Provided Many Young Watchers with Vivid Nightmares,7,2 April 2014,"As a kid, Roald Dahl held a reputation as the ""thinking child's"" favorite author. His stories always had an undertone of darkness about them, a cruel edge. Even his lighter stories, like ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" doesn't spare its young characters. Later in life, when I discovered that Dahl also wrote dark thrillers and even erotica, it wasn't surprising. Dahl's style has always made him a rough fit for Hollywood, who like their children flicks to be safe and sanitized. When Dahl adaptations do turn out alright, like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" they tend to only loosely resemble their source material. Which brings me to ""The Witches,"" a surprisingly macabre family film.""The Witches"" starts appropriately, as a dark fairy tale told by a grandmother to her grandson. The old woman lays down the movie's ground rules. Witches are evil inhuman beings, with purple eyes, no toes, and bald heads. They live to murder children, who smell like dog droppings to them. The parents are killed in a car crash soon afterwards, leaving Luke alone with his grandmother. After a diabetic attack, the old woman is sent to a English hotel to recuperate, joined by her grandson. Fate would have it that the hotel, that same weekend, would be holding a gathering of witches, led by the Grand High Witch. There, the boy overhears the witches' newest plot, a plan to turn of all of England's children into mice.""The Witches"" is a children's film. Its protagonist is the kind of can-do, heroic kid usually seen in films of this type. The story's climatic thrust depends on a child outsmarting adults, another stalwart feature of the genre. There's almost a layer of ""gee-shucks"" sincerity to the way Luke interacts with his grandmother and the other boy his age. Luke and his friend Bruno spends the entire second half of the film in the form of a mouse, which allows for all sorts of cute antics. The emotional center of the story is the boy's relationship with his grandmother, one of safety and warmth. The film ultimately does not transcend the genre.But, boy, does it try. ""The Witches"" is amazingly grotesque at times, enough so that you can fairly categorize it as a kid-friendly horror film. The film makes it clear, from the beginning, that witches want to kill children. It doesn't use any softer synonyms or dance around it. The film's highlight is the witches' meeting. Angelica Huston's head witch removes her skin and hair, revealing a grotesque true face, her skin stretching, body contorting. It's a moment of body horror worthy of Cronenberg. The Grand High Witch has the wart covered skin, sunken eyelids, and hook nose of your stereotypical witch but the film extends the stereotypes to their extreme. That sequence also features a whole room of old women revealing stub feet and balding, scaly heads. The image of young boys similarly stretching and morphing into a mouse is equally unsettling. The finale, a room of witches shrinking into mice, maintains those nasty creature effects. Though the Jim Henson Creature Studio effects are somewhat cartoony I bet they still provided many young watchers with vivid nightmares.Another thing to like about ""The Witches"" is the mythological footprint it puts on the witch concept. The script treats witches as if they were vampires or werewolves, classical monsters with specific traits, powers, and weaknesses. The script speaks in sweeping, fable-like terms. All witches are evil, devoted to murdering kids. Why? Because they're monsters, that's why. Their nasty appearances match their attitudes, only able to disguise their evil for so long.The movie is also helped out by its strong cast. Anjelica Huston is delightfully over-the-top as the film's villain, the wicked head witch. She speaks with a cartoonish German accent, fully committed to the material. Even while under extensive make-up, the actress' mannerisms are visible. Mai Zetterling is also notable as the grandmother, warm but with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. Though a bit flat as the young lead, Jasen Fisher is a strong enough actor to carry his role. His performance actually improves when the character is turned into a mouse, the young actor's voice working quite well.Nicolas Roeg's usually stylish direction is muted a bit here but he still pulls off some memorable visuals. The film is uniformly strong up until the very end. The script wimps out, providing an unlikely solution to the hero's problem, de-mouse-fying him at the last minute. It's an especially lazy screen writing decision and the only blotch on an otherwise strong film, a surprisingly twisted kids flick.",The Witches
57,yongkang-27205,Quirky odd film,6,7 October 2021,"Well, it definitely was different from the other films that I've watched to say the least. Through it did give me the home alone vibes. Still, even then it is quite different. This film was neither funny nor was it very interesting. It was weird, I'll give it that.

It's a good movie to watch on family night, and it has a bit of laughs and puts a smile on your face.

I love the story and I love the way it's told and the pacing of the movie. The effects are amazing for the time and all the special effects makeup is amazing.

60,Signet,Weary and Wearisome,5,5 July 2003,"Perhaps it is the direction, but everyone in this film seems to be very, very tired.  The only signs of energy to be found are concentrated entirely in the mice, real and bogus.  The actors all appear to be in need of a good night's sleep that would put them in a better temper for their day's labor before the cameras.This film neither scares nor amuses: if it is made for children, I fear that most of them would find it a very good excuse for a nice, long nap.",The Witches

The Grand High With is then battled against by the two while Luke has been turned into a mouse.It's a pretty gruesome film due to the fact that children will be watching.

65,timefreezer7,"On a par with the rest of Dahl's movies (Willy Wonka , Matilda , James and the Giant Peach)",9,12 December 2003,"Yet another book by the famous storyteller Roald Dahl has been transferred to the silver screen. To be honest I have not read the book but I can assure you that the film consists of all the sinister irony, the creepiness and an amusing touch of morbidity which dominates all the fairy tales this fellow has printed on paper. The Witches is a rather forgotten little gem with a biting script, an engaging direction and entertaining performances from the entire cast. Roald Dahl (and consequently the writer and the director) made his own version of witchcraft. He used scary images and frightening themes not to insult the occult fans but simply to poke fun at some cliched lore and legends. As a result the film suffered from a severe identity crisis and failed to reach a target audience: a bit too dark for kids and the adults easily misjudged it as a run-of-the-mill childish corny movie. No wonder the film is to date an unknown fantasy flick. However for the lucky viewers it is a fondly remembered satire with a cult status.          Luke (Jasen Fisher) is a little boy whose parents take him on vacation to visit his grandmother Helga (Mai Zetterling). Helga has Norwegian origin and knows many things about witches, evil creatures which manage to lure small children only to kill them later. Apparently Helga has encountered a witch in her childhood. Luke seems to enjoy his grandmother's stories. When Luke's parents are killed in a car accident Helga takes the orphaned child under her custody and does her best to fill the void. When Luke is attacked by a strange woman who most probably was a witch, Helga realizes that her grandson has suffered enough already and needs a break. The two of them take a getaway trip to a luxurious British hotel by the seashore. During their residence in the hotel, a convention is being conducted by a group of women calling themselves ""The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children."" Their leader is Miss Ernst (Anjelica Huston), an aristocratic lady whose gothic and sharp characteristics seem to vaguely ring some bells in Helga's memory. Luke accidentally attends the convention only to find out it is actually a coven of the hideous witches his granny has described to the last detail. The witches hide their ugly real faces under masks. Miss Ernst is of course the notorious Grand High Witch, the most repelling, terrifying, powerful and infernal of them all. The Grand High Witch is fed up with her underlings and decides that enough time has been wasted: therefore she forms a master plan according to which they will eliminate easily all the children in the country. It is now up to Luke and Helga to save the United Kingdom from this massacre.            The imagery used by the director is effective and plays a crucial part for the atmosphere of the movie. Congratulations to the SFX and make up crew for their awesome depiction of the bare skulled sorcerers. Yeah, yeah it is quite scary for kids but whatever. Dahl never cared for stereotypes and neither should we. The whole concept is a multileveled parody: firstly the childish phobias of mean witches are depicted pleasantly. Secondly, the underlying metaphor the film tries to pull off at how cruel these social workers and charity people can be, instead of preventing the cruelty, is funny. There are also many other humorous scenes (obviously wanting to counter balance the scary ones) like when Bruno, an overweight spoiled rich bulimic boy who was transformed into a mouse by the witches, says compliantly to his freaked parents ""Don't take it so hard mom! You did after all want me to lose weight, didn't you?"" Speaking of the mouse, I would also like to make a reference to the professional puppeteering and dubbing SFX by Jim Henson which are very successful. Generally the effects for this movie are well crafted and not at all dated. The director also did a good job in setting the creepy scenes or the action sequences (like the finale).          The casting was also inspired. I liked seeing Fisher in the central role, not necessarily because he gives a standout performance but because we finally get a real character and not a piece of cardboard. Luke doesn't apply to any of the stereotypes we see in cinema generally. He is not the cute and painfully sappy sweet little boy, or the nerdy goof and he is definitely NOT the do-it-all superhero who destroys everything in his wind-blowing path (a la Dennis the Menace or Home Alone). Mai Zetterling (who is also the narrator) gives a warm performance as the wise grandmother and also the most dramatic one of the entire film. She provides therefore the human element of tragedy in the movie. Anjelica Huston arguably steals the show in a challenging role. She is exceptional being threatening and spooky (not necessarily in her real grotesque appearance but with her ice cold stare). The kid who plays Bruno adds much comic relief in an obviously preachy role about the sin of gluttony. Oh, there is also a cameo by a then obscure Rowan Atkinson who is sadly underused. For you obsessed Atkinson fans out there you may check him out in a verbal (albeit brief) character.        Enough said, I think. The Witches is a strange film which has a perfect (but misunderstood) balance between a dark fairy tale and a snicky adult satire. It is well worth watching for fantasy fans anywhere. I don't know if it is the best (or faithful) ADAPTATION of Dahl's novel, but I believe sincerely that it is the best MOVIE BASED on a Roald Dahl novel. Recommended? You betsa!!!!

My husband and I saw it at the cinema when it was original released because we liked the director, Nicholas Roeg. With Angelica Huston starring in it we had no clue that it was actually a kid's movie. A group of four year olds behind us clued us in. I wanted to leave and get our money back. My husband disagreed and said we should stay just to see if it was any good. It was. It was better than good. Written by the great Roald Dahl, this is a scary, black comedy which is not dumbed down in any way for kids. Both Dahl and Roeg understood that kids get wit and comedy even when it's black and also appreciate a scary tale. It was Jim Henson's last project- what better endorsement and stampof approval for a kid's movie!A young boy, Luke, who comes to live with his grandmother after his parents die, stumbles on a convention of witches and is turned into a mouse. Undeterred, he and his grandmother, who is well versed in witches, devise a plan to stop the witches from turning all children into mice. Rowan Atkinson as the nervous incompetent hotel manager is great along with a top notch cast. Huston revealing a hideous monster underneath her beautiful exterior is a chilling moment that will thrill kids. One joke that will fly over their heads is that a lot of the women witches at the convention are played by men, thereby lending to their extra witch ugliness. This film is wildly entertaining.Out in the lobby I queried one of the four year olds who was dressed up like Snow White for her birthday. ""What did you think of the film?"" She gave me a 30 second synopsis, obviously loving it. I asked her her age. She told me four.

71,rh86,Will appeal to kids and adults,9,30 April 2007,"There aren't that many films really that appeal to both kids and adults but The Witches is definitely one of them. Based on Roald Dahl's 1983 book (but with a few changes) it follows the story of an orphaned boy, Luke (Jasen Fisher) and his grandmother (Mai Zetterling in one of her final film roles) as they discover a coven of witches whilst on holiday in an English hotel. Nicholas Roeg brings both humour and horror to the film, at times filmed like a classic horror film but still accessible to children.Adding to this mix is the very good support cast (Rowan Atkinson, Bill Paterson, Brenda Blethyn, Jane Horracks) although all are overshadowed by Anjelica Huston's Grand High Witch, at times comic but still a fantastic film villain. Jim Henson provides the effects which despite being a lot of smoke, mirrors and puppets work extremely well.Back in 1990 this film wasn't greatly received by audiences but its a gem, definitely one for the DVD collection.",The Witches
72,vicdragon19-1,dark but amusing film...,8,24 July 2007,"The Roal Dahl book is a classic that kids can enjoy (though quite morbid and dark at the same time) and the film doesn't disappoint. The film is quite loyal to the novel, despite the changed ending, and the whole film has a real dark tone and dread to it. Luke, the protagonist is told stories by his grandmother about the so called women who are really witches that kill children, in their views that society is better off without them (from their viewpoint). Though you could argue that the witches would need to produce kids, well they don't, because there are no male witches existent! Anjelica Huston is terrific in this role, and though I'm sure her appearance is friendly in nature, in this film it is truly terrifying at times.Don't know if this can be called a kid's film but its somewhere between 12 to 15 year olds in my opinion. However, I think its worth a look and is highly enjoyable as a good fantasy flick, and won't disappoint Roald Dahl fans.",The Witches
73,minerals,This was a good movie,10,19 September 2004,This movie has a good main idea of showing how Good can win over Evil. when the boy and his grandmother go to that hotel and the boy sees another boy getting turned into a mouse and then he winds up being a mouse he gets help from his grandmother to stop the witches. I like how they figure out to use the Grand High witch's own magic formula against her. I liked how that one witch quit working for the Grand High Witch and when the Grand High Witch was turned into a mouse the hotel owner killed her and that made the one remaining witch in England become a beautiful good witch. I liked how that good witch changes the boys back although it does not show her changing Bruno back but shows Luke getting changed back. This was one great movie. Although at the start when the grandmother tells about an event that happened in her childhood to a friend of hers the rest of the movie should be safe for kids that are at least 7 years old.

75,Inliten,Stunning,9,12 December 2002,"The film adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic ``The Witches"" is a breathtaking spectacle that will delight a variety of viewers.  Anjelica Huston is simply outstanding as ""The Grand High Witch.""  She is the perfect actress to portray the dark, albeit laughable, character.Luke (Jasen Fisher) is a young boy living with his grandmother, Helga (Mai Zetterling).  Mai is perfectly cast as the doting, adventuresome grandmother.  Helga regales Luke with stories of witches, dangerous creatures who seek to harm children.I particularly liked the lack of Americanization in this film, as opposed to a similar counterpart, the adaptation of ``Matilda.""  The film stays true to the book for the majority.  Unfortunately, the happy ending, which was loathed by Roald Dahl himself, detracts from the seemingly perfect adaptation.In any event, 'The Witches' is sure to be a hit among kids (and adults as well).  Anyone who has enjoyed the book is sure to enjoy this film version.",The Witches
76,nellz_nivlecn,Apparently this gets a remake,6,4 October 2020,"I was around 8 when I accidentally came across this movie while browsing HBO all by myself at midnight. And I remember thinking heh this wasnt so bad, at that times I've never watched any movies about witches so naturally Im intrigued. I thought to myself this wasnt a horror movie, there are no ghost, I should be fine (while glancing at the clock which shows its 12.10, It was holiday season, so I was sleeping late). I also remember thinking wow this movie was kind of funny with the kids turned into mouse and trying to scheme their way round the witches. I was peachy, until the scene with all the witches removes their disguises and let me tell you, the kid me was frighthened, their makeup was truly horrifying and nightmare inducing. I legit got scared and almost turned off the TV but instead I soldiered on, convincing myself that it wasnt so bad.
And im glad when I finished it, its pretty good, almost smug at myself for finishing a scary movie at midnight all by myself.This movie, no matter how ridiculous the plot was, managed to captured the attention of 8 years old me where my interests at that time were pokemon and sailor moon and despite only watching this only one time, it stays with me. I would think of this movie once in a while later on and thought that maybe this was a small independence movie that not many people knew about, I dont even know what the title was. So imagined my surprise when I saw the new trailer for The Witches starring anne hathaway, octavia spencer and stanley tucci! I genuinely thought that Hey! They plagiarized that old movie! But apparently the OG movie was a well known and had a cult following.I dont really know what is it about this movie that has such lasting impressions for me that I can remember it clearly even if I've only watched them one time, maybe its the story, maybe its the talking rats, maybe its the harrowing make up, maybe its all of them. Its a weird cocktail of a movie, its a kid's movie, its s family movie, its a horror movie but also it's a comedy movie.Ps. I also remember that I truly salivating with the cress soup scene. They seemed so appetizing at midnight and everyone seemed so engrossed in eating them LOL.",The Witches

That's not to say there aren't many fun moments sprinkled throughout, but the tone more alligns with other traumatic family favorites like The Watcher in the Woods and Something Wicked This Way Comes. Anjelica Huston is having the time of her life vamping it up as the witch to end all witches and her transformation from glamour girl to misshapen ghoul will probably cause many children to hide behind the couch in fear.",The Witches

Which was a film that had become an unexpected treasure of the time. As many people who have become very fond of Jim Henson's movie magic. This was truly a film that I could reflect upon with the characters interactions.

85,enemyzero,"This movie is not just a Halloween classic, but a CLASSIC in every way possible.",10,25 February 2008,"This movie is not just a Halloween classic, but a CLASSIC in every way possible. This is one of only two movies i still own on VHS (the other is The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, but that doesn't really need to be explained does it?).I have seen this movie more times than I can count, so many in fact that the original VHS cartridge became worn out, the tape was transferred into another cartridge, then years later retaped on to a new tape to hold off the film from degrading further. This year I think I am finally going to force my lazy ass to get it on DVD.This movie is about an American kid who's parents die and he is sent to live with his granny in England. Soon the kid discovers that Angelica Huston apparently finds children stinky and wants to eliminate them all by buying up candy shops and selling goodies tainted (ha ha ha taint) with ""Formula 86″ that turns kids into mice. Now maybe it's just me, but as I watch this film as an adult I always want to tell Angelica Huston that if she really wanted to wipe those kids out she should have laced the chocolate with Anthrax and kill them outright rather then turn them into mice. Hell if she doesn't want to kill them why not just lace the goodies with herpes? Any way, The kid a.k.a. Luke and his crazy old granny (who apparently knows a ton about witches) are hanging out in this hotel where the witches are having a convention about snuffing out kids when he discovers their plans. After witnessing his fatty boom batty friend Bruno turned into a mouse he tries to tell his grandmother, but is apprehended and turned into a mouse himself.Now if it were me, I wouldn't be that upset. Think about it, you still have your human brain, you're just a mouse. You don't have to worry about money or bills or any of that stuff. On top of that it's the animal kingdom, if there is some fine mouse pussy that you want, you just mount up and go to town. No dating, no consequences, you're a mouse. Anyhow he gets his granny's help they defeat the witches, save his friend and go to America.It is a kick ass flick.http://heystupid.wordpress.com/category/stupid-movies/",The Witches
86,nastja97,Very endearing overall,8,11 June 2017,"To begin with, the main reason I rated it 8 and not 10 is the creepiness of the witches. Yes, I know they are shown exactly like Roald Dahl described them, but I really think that it's different to see it on screen rather than read about it. The true face of the Grand High Witch is absolutely repulsive to the point I feel sick looking at it and want to skip directly to her counter-transformation. As other reviewers have noted, it's for PG-13 more than for PG. The rest of the film is very charming. Grandmother Helga is splendid and exactly like I imagined her when reading the book. Luke's a bit shrill with his ""Graaaandma!"" but acts very well. Anjelica Huston (apart from the true-face sequences) is a perfect Grand High Witch, and the hotel staff and Bruno (a nicer incarnation of Augustus Gloop) are hilarious. Right, but I know it's always more interesting to read about flaws, soThe character of Miss Irvine is a bit underdeveloped and even if one hasn't read the book (I have), it can be noticed that it is a later deus ex machina addition (one moment she's cackling with everybody else and the next she ""never really wanted to be with them anyway""). I mean, the Grand High Witch burns at least one witch per year and does horrible things to kids – compared to that, merely not allowing her secretary to attend the banquet is nice everyday behavior; so it seems odd that Miss Irvine alone suddenly snaps and for a petty reason at that. But Jane Horrocks whom I like very much does a wonderful job of the part and manages to make it as convincing as the script allows. I personally liked the change to the ending in itself. I believe that the problem with filming the original ending isn't its bittersweet flavor – it just leaves too many threads hanging. Fine in a book, but, in my opinion, hard to film. It's a pity that the filmmakers took the other option to the extreme as well, and the whole Susan-Irvine-ex-machina thing seems rushed altogether, as many reviewers point out. Besides, although it effectively concludes the plot line of Luke's life as a mouse (the chief one that left the book ending open), it raises an entirely new question of the witches' nature – the book was very vague on it; Grandma said the witches are humanoid demonic creatures, but the Grand High Witch selected the elderly witches and said that they were the ancestors of others. And now we learn that a witch can turn human if she really wants (and I'm really puzzled about the hair – was Miss Irvine by the end still in her wig though with human hands or did her new hair magically grow exactly to match the wig?). Of course, it's Dahl and not Tolkien so no one expects a full story of witches from the creation of the world with all dynasties and rulers, but the witches are left a pretty mysterious species, and here even more than in the book. However, I believe that (again and again, save for the witches' true faces) it's a very nice family movie. The ending of the book is quite a depressing one for kids – I don't know firsthand as I read it at nineteen (it still nearly brought me to tears), but I'm sure that had I read it at around seven, at the same time as the Chocolate Factory, the Giant Glass Elevator, the Giant Peach, and Mr. Fox, I would have been terribly shocked, especially with the contrast. The movie ending is not so much rushed as to be a problem during watching. It's very funny and touching, I particularly liked Miss Irvine sending the white mice back to Luke. The questions only come to your head later, and they don't keep you from enjoying the film.",The Witches

89,karenevers-49804,Creepier Than Expected,10,2 December 2019,"One of the absolute strangest and creepiest children's films I've ever seen. My cousins have been telling me about it for years and how much it scared them as children and I believe it. It's hard not get a little chill from it as an adult as well.In classic fairy tale tradition, a young boy's parents are killed and he's sent to live with his grandmother. While on vacation, they encounter a coven of evil witches hellbent on destroying all the children in the world.There are a few humorous touches to lighten the load a bit and keep things from being too creepy, but it's easy to see why this one has been a staple of childhood trauma since the early 90's. There are some scenes in here that are pretty intense and spooky for a family movie.",The Witches
90,PeeJay,Disappointing,4,10 December 2007,"Disappointing Henson production. Not only does this movie lack story, character development, and tension it also misses Henson creativity and above all humor. No drama, no laughs and very little excitement make this movie too long and seem like going on forever. Basically the story is too predictable and almost by necessity develops according to very predictable lines and characters. Although the beginning of the movie gives opportunities, somehow it seems that the director and/or scriptwriters did not know how to build this into a good movie. For me the worst Henson production I saw. Only some of the actors save the movie from becoming a complete bore although Hustons role is below her skills and Atkinsons role is too boring to be really interesting or humorous.",The Witches

96,Dries Gevaert,Buy the book,4,28 May 2000,"Oh my god.I know how hard it is to put a book on the big screen, but they really failed on this one. First of all, the casting is TERRIBLE (the characters don't even come close to those in the book, and the kid could at least be cute...), and second,  the grandma plays like she followed a ""Learn to act in 30 minutes"" class. Rowan Atkinson and Angelica Huston are certainly not in their best roles either, but at least they don't screw up hugely like the rest of the cast.Jim Henson himself is about the only one who has done something good here: the mouse puppets are very good, and the directing and camera are quite good too.The story. The book is really nice, I read it and enjoyed it (although it's a kids book) but the movie makes the worst scenes longer and the best scenes shorter. What I'm also noticing is that everything is quite detailed and slow in the beginning and fast and disorderly near the end. Maybe some stupid deadline caused this, but anyway it gives a weird effect when you review the movie.Conclusion: buy the book, it's way better than the movie. As usual.4/10",The Witches

I like how the film is set on a small scale mainly in Cornwall, England and I feel like Angelica Huston and smaller roles from Rowan Atkinson really carry it.

Witches who hate little children. Witches who want them destroyed. His grandmother tells him that the Witches have one meeting every year, to think up of plans how to rid children off the face of the Earth! One day, Luke and his grandmother go to a hotel. The plan was simple. They were supposed to have a good time and relax. Instead, Luke accidentally stumbles into a meeting room where the friendly ladies from the RSPCC (royal society to prevention of cruelty to children) are supposed to have their meeting. but, Luke soon finds out, they're not the RSPCC... they're the witches! And so Luke overhears their horrible plan (to rid children from the planet, of course).When, the meeting is over and Luke is about to exit, one witch finds him, and turns him into a mouse! Luke knows what he has to do. He has to stop the witches' plan from happening. That however proves to be difficult as mouse have 2 deadly enemies. Cats and humans. Will Luke stop the witches?

Anjelica Huston's physical transformation into the Grand High Witch is terrifying and very realistic due to the masterful makeup artists.The only aspect of the film that falters is the ending, which chose to deviate from the source material and provide a ""happy"" ending rather than the bleak original ending in Dahl's novel.Overall, The Witches is an underrated children's film that should be watched.Highly recommended.",The Witches

To much melodrama at the beginning leaves you wishing there was a point to all this, then the convention scene, which is shocking, disturbing and gross, leaves you wishing you had never started watching this film. My 7 year old grandson said, ""this is boring"" but I have a feeling that was his way of saying he didn't like it. I watched the rest later.

119,parkguy505,One my favorite childhood ... and present.. movies!,10,18 July 2004,"This is a movie which is highly underrated. It is a fantastic adventure
about a young boy and his wise grandma who go on vacation along the
English coast. Unknowlingly running into Grandma's most feared enemy-
the Grand High Witch. When Luke accidentally crosses paths with the
Grand High Witch and her Witch minions, it is up to him, Bruno Jenkins,
and Grandma to save all the children of England! Anjelica Huston does a marvelous job at portraying the snobbishly
aristocratic Eva Ernst as well as her unmasked counterpart, the evil
Grand High Witch. She definitely steals the show in this one, although
Mai Zetterling does give one that warm nurturing feeling as the wise
but kind grandma. And Jasen Fisher did a good job as well.Not only is the acting good, but the special effects.. or should i see
puppets and makeup.. are marvelous! The grand high witch without her
face mask is really a terrible sight! And the little mice, really
puppets opposed to the technological computer created special effects,
really work out great and give a more earthy feel non animated animal
movies.If your an adult and your looking for a nail biting psychological
thriller your looking in a very wrong direction. But if you are looking
for a classic, fun, adventure for all ages- I suggest you watch this. I
give it an A+!!!!!!!!",The Witches

150,robbie_a,There's a moose loose about the hoose.,10,19 October 2008,"I haven't seen this film for such a long time, and there it was on the telly tonight. What joy! This is a super film, and a suitable testament to Roald Dahl (as is the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), though I suspect he wouldn't be too much bothered if no one liked it. Most of his tales are barbed to the point of mutilation, and for those of an impious disposition.Oh, and van (shrinkv), the only bigot around here looks like you, although it's quite hard to tell. What was your point exactly? Try ""The Wicker Man"" for a nice bit of Wiccan burning to the ground, ho ho. I understand that no animals were harmed in the making of the film either.This is another cracking British movie with a bit too much nous for the average US mouse, but do try it nonetheless.",The Witches
151,howiekent,"""It has been.... unforgettable, Mr. Jenkins""",10,22 March 2010,"A rare film where adults and children can enjoy watching together. It's unfortunate this film has been forgotten with the avalanche of the Vampire/Werewolves movies. Based on Roald Dahl's dark junior novel of the same title, this movie is about a boy whose Grandmother warns him non-stop about the dangers of the secret world of the Witches. After a health scare by his Grandmother, they check into a seaside resort where the Witches of England have come together for their annual convention.The movie is supremely cast especially with the ever-talented Anjelica Huston as the Grand High Witch. Dahl himself had favored Huston in the title role. She plays the character deliciously and truly seemed to enjoy herself. Her rapport with Mia Zetterling and Jasen Fisher is impeccable. This movie made me fall in love with Anjelica Huston and is a movie I would watch over and over without getting bored.Watch this movie if only to see how Anjelica Huston plays the role perfectly but I assure you you will enjoy the plot and scenery as well. Look for Rowan Atkinson in a comical role here as well.",The Witches

161,arando_huston,The Witches are Here!,10,19 January 2007,"It is a family movie for all ages, it is a wonderful adventure about a young boy named Luke (Jasen Fisher) and his witch expert Grandma (Mai Zetterling) go on a summer holiday to a England hotel owned by Mr. Stringer (Rowan Atkinson), but they ran into Luke's Grandma's enemy The Grand High Witch (Anjelica Huston). Luke stumbles into The Grand High Witch and the england witches plan to turn children into mice!!! it is up to Luke, Bruno Jekins (Charile Potter)and his Grandma to save the children of england! Anjelica Huston is fantastic in this movie portraying the mean Eva Ernst and also the unmasked scaring Grand High Witch, she steals the show with her beautiful costume, although Mai Zetterling gives a Grandma's performance and gives out a warm feeling and Jasen Fisher did a good job too.The effects for absolutely great and the make-up jobs were very good for a movie that CGI was not nearly came out. The Grand High Witch face mask was fantastic it took eight hours to transformed Anjelica Huston's face into the grand high witches face, another effect the green smoke was very good. i thought it was good ( and a bit disgusting)and the mice were very cute puppets were creative than CGI it worked out and it gives a more earthly fell for a non animated film.This movie is the best movie i will recommend anyone to see it if you want to see a fantasy ,family movie this is the one. THIS movie is a classic i give it A+!!!",The Witches

Let's accept it, Luke is a poorly actor but this never get low the magic atmosphere that you can almost breath from the screen when you watch this movie. I really recommend It for those kids who have the feeling that ... There's some magic out there and that the world It's not just a bunch of raw images, war and sex.Buy It!!! Feel It!! Enjoy It so much just as i do nowadays since my 10 years old...Thank you to all the people involved in this amazing, magical and lovely project call ""The Witches"". You made my magical Childhood!",The Witches
163,murphynigel3,An truly excellent movie,10,12 April 2009,"murphynigel3 This has to be one of the most brilliant adaptations of any novel ever. Anjelica Huston's performance as the Grand High Witch is just absolutely magnificent and superb. The one thing which lets it down though, is the ending. As anyone who has read the book will know, this is not the ending which is in the novel. Having said that though, it is an excellent adaption of Dahl's novel for the most part. The casting is pretty good too, though one would have to question the over-reactions of Brenda Blethyn's character, Mrs. Jenkins, in this movie. The score is excellent and very appropriate for this particularly story. I first read this novel when I was 11 years old and I have to say that, as well as being quite scary, it was also extremely entertaining. There is a good morale lesson for kids in this movie. A truly excellent film indeed.",The Witches
164,deverbeve,"Incredibly terrible acting, weak narrative",3,26 October 2017,"I really tried to give this movie a chance after reading other people's reviews. I haven't seen it as a kid, so I have no fond memories clouding my judgement so to speak. I coudn't even sit through it, though I generally love 80's and 90's family fantasy films. This one is an unwatchable mess, especially if compared to the quality of acting and directing seen in other films of the same genre in that era. Better acting could aid the film maybe somewhat; the actress who portrays Grandma is so awful, it breaks the disbelief dramatically. The narrative is very uneven and contradicting: some parts are overly dragged out or simply nonsensical (the runaway stroller scene does not advance the plot none), other parts which are supposed to be mysterious and magical (Grandma telling Luke the story about the little girl spirited away or the famous witch convention scene) are not scary in a good fun spooky sort of way, but more in a high fever delirium way, which is needless to say not appropriate for children and quite honestly unsettling for an adult. It seems as if the writers couldn't not decide on the genre of the film. It watches like a horror mystery at times akin to The Shining or Omen, for example when Grandma says to the parents of the ""fat"" kid turned into a mouse: ""I got your son in my purse here, he was altered a bit"", or when witches catch Luke and feed him ""the formula"", the mood of the scene is just unnecessarily surreal and creepy in the general framework of the story. At other times you are sitting there just annoyed at non funny repetitive jokes about the ""fat"" kid eating all the time because that is the only character definition he gets, people being constantly driven to the heights of panic over pet mice or the hotel manager rolling out of the towel closet with the maid (really?). Anjelica Houston is great for the role, but unfortunately the part does not give her acting ability justice. Overall it seems to be a very weak effort overall, do not waste your time on this one, watch The Addams Family (with aforementioned glorious Anjelica Houston) or Hocus Pocus (with really cool witches and great children actors) instead.",The Witches
165,claypeebles,A Waste of Film,1,2 November 2020,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. No one in it can act, (not even Angelica Huston, for some reason), and it seems to have been directed by a ten year old of less than average intelligence.",The Witches

167,ryanmcirish,i've always thought this was a great movie,10,10 March 2005,"i've always thought this was a great movie since i was little, it was one of those movies that you'd go over to see at your grandma's on Halloween, just scary enough for a kid, where the'd be afraid, but not usually enough to give nightmares(although i can remember having a few from this- those with very small children be warned!) i felt that the tales that the grandmother spins are the tantalizing part of the movie, with them being treated as a joke in the beginning, but then going on to, not only back them up, but to show that they actually happened. i feel that this was a very well put together movie, and Anjelica Huston as the grand high witch gives the movie a special flavor, like she was meant to play the role. If i talk much more i'll end up giving the thing away, so i'll leave you with this- it's a wonderful movie for kids, and, for hose adults who haven't seen it, when watching, keep in mind that this is a children's movie:) enjoy!!",The Witches
