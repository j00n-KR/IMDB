0,CinemaSerf,After we canoodled,6,15 September 2020,"It would be so very easy to just pan this film, for good it is not. That said, it is infinitely better than ""After"" (2019) and the two stars are perhaps, just perhaps, starting to look like they might just go on to achieve something more substantial should they ever be given some characters with more substance to portray. As it is, however, this is just a light and fluffy late-teen angst film that follows the continuing antics of feisty ""Tessa"" (Josephine Langford) and the erring ""Hardin"" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). The story hasn't the depth of a puddle - their on/off relationship is largely represented by sexless sex scenes; they can't keep their hands off each other for much of the film. However, he has ""issues"" from his childhood (broken home, drink problems etc.) that are creating plenty of bumps on their particular Yellow Brick Road. Hats off to HFT for not adopting a daft mid-Atlantic drawl, he is a Brit and that helps with a little of the charm of the story, for charm there is - and that's it's redemption. Perhaps if the director had given them actual dialogue, rather than just a stream of scenes riddled with profanities whilst they were snogging/shagging/showering then maybe we could have had a chance to appreciate the two young talents trying their best with this woefully banal narrative. I suspect it will only really attract those of us under 15, but I'd keep a look out for the two stars in the future.",After We Collided
1,Thanos_Alfie,Waste of time number 2...,2,9 November 2020,"""After We Collided"" is a Drama - Romance movie and the sequel of the movie ""After"", in which we watch the same couple trying to be together focusing on overcoming the obstacles they find on their path. This sequel starts where the first movie finished.Since I had already watched the first movie, I already knew what to expect from its sequel but ""After We Collided"" surprised me even more than ""After"" since it was far worse than the first movie. I could not believe that a movie that it's also a sequel can be that bad but ""After We Collided"" succeeded on it. The plot of the movie was worse than the first movie and did not make any sense while creating some major plot holes that probably they will cover them in the next movies. The interpretations of the cast were as bad as in the first movie and I cannot mention even one that was good or just above average. Lastly, I have to say that if you have not already watched the first movie and you are about to watch this movie, make yourself a favor and do not watch it because I am sure that you will regret it.",After We Collided
2,cruise01,"Annoying performances, dumb plot, and time you can not get back.",2,27 December 2020,1 out of 5 stars.After We Collided is a sequel to an already bad romantic drama film. Which is based on the second novel in an adult romance series.The plot follows Tessa (Josephine Langford) who got over a break up from her boyfriend Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) a bad boy attitude who has non stop mood swings about everything. When she starts a new company and meeting the charming Trevor (Dylan Sprouse) and coworkers who head out to a work party. She gets drunk and calls Hardin back over. Next thing you know one thing leads them back to getting with each other. With continuously going back and forth with Tessa dealing with Hardins mood swings and his alcoholism.The plot is dumb. Just non stop with Tessa and Hardin having a lot of steamy sex. And her questioning if he is right for her. While Trevor is trying to charm her with his awkwardness and wits.The characters are flat. Hardin played by Hero Fiennes Tiffin is the worst. He is whiny and having mood swings like in every scene. Josephine Langford is decent with her character. Dylan Sprouse is also decent but flat with there characters. The acting is just out of the question with this kind of film.Boring direction that is going back and forth with Tessa and Hardin. Tessa trying to leave Hardin for good. But surprisingly his mother shows up. So she acts to be his girlfriend for the weekend that lasts longer. Than she spends more time dealing with his mood swings. His father issues. And than being a man child. Almost the same as the first film. Makes you wonder if a sequel is necessary.Definitely one of the worst films of the year.,After We Collided

6,cjonesas,"[5.6] Anna Todd, what was that?!",6,24 November 2020,"The first movie was quite good in the sense that the two fragile characters were discovering themselves and had real constructive time together in building a relationship via trials and error with an emotional flowing storyline in the background. It was above average, but romantically touchy.The characters had amazing chemistry together and they still do, but with the second (movie), its shallow material and the over and artificial dramatization of almost every collision scenes, even having Anna Todd as the screenplay writer and one of the producers of the movie, doesn't save it from crashing gloriously.After We Collided, is empty, toxic and unrealistic with a way crowded cast, contributing to nothing.

9,fernandoschiavi,"After almost two hours on something that adds absolutely nothing to the story. Efficiently done to captivate your target audience, the film is only toxic and miserable",5,13 February 2021,"With a warm welcome from the specialized critics, but with prospects of still earning a few million to the studios involved, the sequel to After, based on the eponymous bestseller, arrives in theaters just a year later. Roger Kumble was responsible for directing the film and the author of the book, Anna Todd wrote the script. Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes-Tiffin return to the lead roles. Although the first part, despite chastity, proved to be a real cinematic success, especially in European countries, the sequence now must change some things: the author of the book Anna Todd had a prior contractual guarantee that the sex scenes in After We Collided they should be more revealing - she also wrote the script, after leaving that task to others in the previous film.In After, after finding out about the bet, Tessa (Josephine Langford) tries to forget Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin), the chaotic and angry young man who broke his heart. However, she is about to discover that some loves cannot be overcome. Hardin knows that he made the worst mistake of his life by hurting the girl so deeply, but he will fight with all his strength to win back the great love of her life.The first film adaptation debuted in 2019 and was a commercial success. Smooth and sweet, although there was no shortage of criticism from its own audience, ""After"" seems to have fulfilled the requirements for amateur and fan-made romance. Which is enough to have ""After - After the Truth"" now. If in the first film the torrent of criticism highlighted the lack of sexual intensity, opting to play safe and leave sensuality implicit, in this sequel the director Roger Kumble transforms the novel into what his target audience wants: a ""50 Shades of Gray"" for teenagers, with a narrative from one of those old books that were sold in the stationery stores named Julia, Bianca or Sabrina, made for summer escapism, full of sex, gummy dialogues and confusing plots, absolutely irrelevant in building ardor or even romance .In this sequence, Tessa feels betrayed and hurt after the events of After. As Hardin returns to his old and bad habits, the young student has the perfect opportunity to be distracted when she gets her dream internship at the Vance Publishing Company. And it gets even better: in her new job, she meets Trevor, a colleague as attractive and smart as Hardin, but who also has the significant advantage of being responsible. So, is there a happy ending in perspective? Unfortunately, not, because Tessa just can't get her ex out of her mind. He's the love of her life, and Trevor just can't keep up with him, despite all the obvious advantages. Therefore, the toxic on-off relationship is entering a next round.At the beginning of After We Collided, which now Roger Kumble takes over, Hardin crouches down with a somber look in a battered car in a junkyard, where he apparently spent the whole night. In the ""After"" series, simple looks are not enough to express emotions - instead, the whole scene, including aggressive background music, is always made explicit to the audience. This is certainly not subtle, but at least it is done consistently: when Hardin is plagued by a nightmare about terrible childhood events at the end of the film, the perfect storm boils in front of the window as if ordered.In narrative terms, After - After the Truth remains true to its predecessor: the constant coming and going between Tessa and Hardin continues - and when you think the two have finally met, it doesn't take long for a misunderstanding to separate the two lovers. again. That is why the film visibly sinks near the end of its duration - until then, the romantic drama is sometimes even fun, despite the idle time of the narrative. ""After - After the Truth"" is a drama where problems appear out of nowhere, failing to stir up any emotional state, lost between boredom and the eventual turns in the argument that end up making you laugh. Here, all the characters are commonly lyrical, with indolent attitudes and experiencing trauma with a short memory and letting primary sensations blossom with the naive rebellion of those who live in the ""moment"". But all this is an emotional embellishment of its real core: the film is fueled by the empowerment of a young man with adult problems, who, poor thing, has ""problems with his father"". To this is added the naivety of a capable girl, who shines on her demanding first day at work, but is highly tolerant of the occasional outbreaks of violence from her ""boyfriend who is not a boyfriend, but later turns out to be or not.One of the major problems with this sequence is not having enough history to hold the audience's attention. The dramas here try to develop what had already been said in the previous film, but without any deepening. And that feeling of the story practically not walking is what most bothers those who have seen the previous film. Tessa and Hardin spend most of the first movie fighting, and in After, that doesn't change. The film is filled with absurd discussions that are only there to add drama to a story that has nothing to tell. Every twenty minutes the couple fights, Tessa stops talking to Hardin, and he is aggressive in dealing with his own mistakes. That's it, nothing more. This time, at least, the more humorous tone helps the experience to be a little more bearable than that of the previous film. Ironically, the stern Hardin causes laughter, for example, when he goes to hot yoga with Tessa as part of a perfect day gift, where his many tattoos seem to clash with the environment - or when he just sits stunned while his mother (Louise Lombard), who came from England, and Tessa look at the childhood photos of the little rebel, until adult Hardin finally says goodbye to the room and says he wants to jump off the cliff.The moments ""shame of others"" - which, basically, were not meant to be - end up being fun to watch because of the absurdity they carry. It is almost impossible to believe that this is really happening, and that that was the decision of the film's creative team. Not to say that there is nothing new here, three new characters appear to add to the plot, but only one of them gains relevance. Trevor (Dylan Sprouse), Tessa's co-worker, shows a fun presence, and the most interesting character in the entire film. Kimberly (Candice King) and Christian (Charlie Weber) are there to make numbers and to the delight of the fans, but they have no relevance to the (little) story.The increase in drama, passion and sensuality that is visible in this feature film, in comparison to the first film, allowed the existence of a more intense and powerful soundtrack. This, therefore, provides the viewer with greater interest and interactivity with the cast and, clearly, with the plot. The songs ""We Belong"" and ""So Good"", both by Dove Cameron, were the big bets for a whole segment of scenes where the fiery, wild and incandescent feelings dominate. The choice of more hot songs is due to the increase in scenes in which the protagonists get involved, and where the level of excitement rises.The big problem with After, which remains in this second film, is the problem of the story. In the books, the relationship between Tessa and Hardin does not disguise being extremely toxic and abusive, even being romanticized by the author (Anna Todd) and also by most readers. In the film, however, it gets softened, even by requests from Todd who seems to have recognized the absurdities of the story itself. But, even softened, it is impossible not to notice that the relationship still remains quite dangerous. There is nothing wrong with showing toxic relationships in books or films. That was never the problem. However, considering the target audience and the way in which it is shown, the concern has always been with the way that this audience would interpret it: wishing something like this for themselves, and wanting a ""Hardin to call their own"".After We Collided generally looser than its predecessor, which, of course, also includes the sex scenes between Hardin and Tessa. If you still missed sex from the previous movie, this time he's in the hotel, in the shower and even in the office - with director Roger Kumble working to keep the balance right. The scenes never seem voyeuristic, but convey the essential messages that fell under the table in the first half: here are two protagonists who really want each other - and Tessa is now ready to make it clear to the dominant Hardin what is happening to her.Despite this improvement in the tone of the work, After We Collided is not concerned with improving the mistakes of its predecessor. Involuntary comedy helps to create a more bearable experience, but the toxic relationship and the absurd situations to generate drama still bother. The film leaves loose ends for a future sequel (after all, there are five books), but the hooks do not excite after having wasted almost two hours on something that adds absolutely nothing to the story. Although efficiently done to captivate your target audience, ""After We Collided"" only toxic and miserable.",After We Collided
10,brookenichole-98054,The worst movie,1,9 September 2020,"After We Collided has to be the worst 2020 movie- if not worst movie- I've seen so far. And trust me this years movies haven't been too great. The whole thing is a toxic mess that is just a trainwreck I couldn't stop watching. The acting was awful and I hated Tessa more this time around. Hardin was just as terrible as before and the script had to be the worst part. This is possibly the worst script ever.

13,movieman6-413-929510,"Despite some adjustments, the sequel hasn't gotten much better.",3,2 October 2020,"After We Collided is the sequel to the 2019 movie After. This sequel is directed by Roger Kumble, the director of Cruel Intentions and The Sweetest Thing.In the film, Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) and Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) are both handling their break-up in their own way. Their relationship ended after Tessa learned more about Hardin's mysterious dark side, which made her feel unsafe. Hardin retreats to a life of bad habits, while Tessa starts her dream internship at a publishing house. Here Tessa meets her new colleague Trevor (Dylan Sprouse) for whom she soon starts to have feelings.
Although Tessa tries to start a new relationship with Trevor, she can't let go of her thought of Hardin. Despite all his troubles and secrets, Tessa decides to give Hardin a second chance. The two now have to spend a lot of time and energy in their relationship to get everything back to the way they once had it together.Just like the first part, this film is again based on the book and fan fiction by writer Anna Todd. To make this film more consistent with her book, she has chosen to largely write the film script herself.For better film quality, this second part has also been given a more professional director. Director Roger Kumble has directed many other romantic comedies and dramas in his career. One of his best-known directed films Cruel Intentions was also partly the inspiration for Anna Todd's book series. If you are familiar with this movie, this second part may seem a bit predictable or copied. For a better movie, you can actually watch Cruel Intentions for yourself.The acting is better done by the cast in this film compared to the first part due to the better script and direction work. These improvements aside, the movie still doesn't come across as very original.",After We Collided
14,zac-04879,A Weak Romance Sequel,3,31 May 2021,"In case it wasn't implied to you, the sequel to After is heavily weakened by the amount of sexual content and language. Plus the story isn't even near as compelling as the first, but still manages to coat us with its immaturely dramatic issues.Firstly, the characters fighting for their toxic relationship is just a terrible idea, whether it's real or fictional. Tessa and Hardin are unlikeable characters who are frequently arguing, making out and making love, which just honestly gets people thinking: What is this film even supposed to be? The romance is completely immature and the whole plot is unrealistic. And even if After We Collided was a good story, it would still be ruined by the amount of explicit material.Now, the terribly-written script would probably have to be the most noticeable thing about this romantic sequel. Anna Todd and Mario Celaya rely on overstated voiceovers, ridiculous themes and swearing, which is disappointing considering that the first film wasn't as strong when it came to that unnecessary content.After We Collided's pace is slow and that's why it scores a bad review. There are so many ways to describe this teen romance film: immature, dramatic, boring, pointless, explicit and completely toxic.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",After We Collided

24,PerryAtTheMovies,Hallmark makes better love movies....,5,8 February 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
""After We Collided"" is definitely worst than ""After"" even though it has managed to get an equal rating of 5/10 from me. Since this is a series of movies I think they should try to maintain some consistency instead of trying to test the waters and see how people react. Maybe this makes me a bad person, but I think Landon's mother should have been black from the very beginning of the first film instead of having been white originally. This, in my opinion, was Hollywood trying to redact its mistake of the first film, but enough about colour of characters.The next bad thing about this film is bringing in a second ""love interest"" and not utilizing him to his full potential similar to what ""The Kissing Booth 2"" did. Dylan Sprouse gives an awesome performance in this mediocre film about young love. He's more of friendzoner and not as much a love interest as he should've been, therefore, it's a waste of his time being here, but I digress.The movie starts to get a tad bit interesting, but at this point it's too late. The emotion that is in the last twenty minutes of the film is what should have been shown throughout the rest of the film. Yes, we get that Hardin and Tessa are in this weird rollercoaster ride of a romance that borders on abusive, psychotic, and cute, but ultimately if you're going to do a story about love, you need the emotion to be there the whole 400 meters and not just the last 50 meters. All to say here with regards to the ""After"" series... oh for two.Overall:
The first film was enjoyable. This film was not. Honestly, this one is not worth the time, but if you're like me where you want closure, or at the very least hope for closure, then I suppose you could watch it. So far as a whole the ""After"" series is a dud and I'm still not sure what's made me want to watch them.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Honestly, no.

30,jseynopsis,"It's better than the first film in some ways, but worse in many more ways.",3,12 September 2020,"This sequel is better than its first film in some ways, but sadly it is worse in many more ways.A good attempt in the comedic parts in this sequel, and a good choice of new casts for the new characters, especially Dylan Sprouse. I think he did a good job portraying the role of Trevor, very close to what I imagined in the novel. The returning casts were also better than they were previously in the first film, except for Hero Fiennes Tiffin. I think his acting is weird, unnatural and exaggerating at most times.In the novel, Hardin is someone who has mood swings, someone who is mysterious & secretive because he has something to hide about his past, yet charming still. I really have to give credits to Anna Todd (the author) for charming her readers with merely words, but I'm afraid Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) has failed to charm us in this movie adaptation.As for the story, some parts were different than in the novel. But like the Anna Todd said, certain parts that seem romantic when reading the novel, may seem cheesy in the movie when being acted out. I agree with that, and it's perfectly ok when some settings in the movie are different than in the novel, and/or some parts were omitted. BUT...... It is NOT OK, when most parts in the movie are being rushed through, neglecting the development of it's original story & mood in the novel, which is a huge killer for me (this explains my low rating).In novel, there are a lot of struggles in thoughts, in emotions, in decision-making for these 2 main characters (Tessa & Hardin). The reason why people loved the novel is because it carries you along to an emotional roller coaster ride with the 2 main characters (T & H). The thoughts that ran through their minds, problems that they were struggling with, were meticulously & beautifully written by Anna Todd, allowing you to feel, understand and emphatize with them.But this 2nd movie adaptation has failed to do the same, it has forgotten the importance of the PACE in storytelling. PLUS, there is a lack of good music/soundtracks in this 2nd film. If you recall, in the 1st film during the scene where Tessa & Hardin spent their time at the river, it was beautifully filmed, not rushed and given time to develop its story and on top of that, a good choice of music was used to support the atmosphere. The scene where Tessa & Hardin shared a dance at his dad's house is another good example, a beautiful scene accompanied with beautiful music. It's a shame... It REALLY IS A SHAME. They could have spent more time allowing the story to develop in the 2nd film since its runtime is only 96mins.To be honest, I am still looking forward to the 3rd film, ONLY BECAUSE I love the novel.

33,Braindead09,Erotica foe teenagers,7,14 September 2020,"I saw a film was on release, no idea what is was. Just booked my seat and turned up. I know i wss late and guessed i maybe missed the opening credits and maybe another 5 minutes ie 10 minutes. I sat down opened my water and started watching. I found myself trying to work out the back story, Tessa had just turned up at the office to start her job, she connected with a young guy who knew her ex boyfriend, wh apoarently worked for the same company. She was next seen waking up after falling asleep overnight at her desk. The boss was friends with the mysterious boyfriends mother. The boyfriend is seen getting a tattoo with no pain killer. A drunken club night where our lead is commando results in a phone call and a bedroom farce. As i watched the film more and more plot was thrown at me, causing confusion. The young actors were fine in their roles though fiennes come across as too namby pampy to be a rebel, it was good to see a chunky actress as the leading actress, made a change. It was only after i got home to read up the film, i discovered the film is a sequel to the first film After (2019) which as far as im aware never came to a cineworld near me. Cut a long story short all the stuff i missed was actuallly in the first film. Makes sense to see that first. To sum up its Two Moon Junction for 14 year olds with no nudity, it could have been a TV movie without the F words. Its enjoyable hokum.",After We Collided

Skip ahead to After We Collided having read the 700 page book first and knowing the book's writer wrote the script, and the director of Cruel Intentions was in charge I was super excited. The movie was too rushed they tried to fit too much of the book in it and the director did not pull good performances out of the actors like the first one did. It didn't have the special thing that After did. I'm not saying it was bad it just didn't have the magic the first movie had.

From the getgo, i don´t know why, but the main characters just didn´t have the same spark anymore, the same little humor and quirky moments. And as the story went on it didn´t get better and at some point I didn´t even root for the main couple anymore. It was boring, underwhelming, it didn´t bring out any emotions in me, id didn´t excite me, the scenes were done very bluntly and there just wasn´t this little magic in it as before. Sad, really.

45,aimtrain1021,Disconnected and rushed. First movie was better,2,23 December 2020,"I liked the first movie and looked forward to this, but it fell flat. It was rushed and disjointed. It lacked flow and character development. Tessa is just as immature as Hardin is, so not sure why she is made out to be the good one and he's bad (although in these movies I wouldn't even say he's a bad boy-he's just immature and moody). She's almost worse than him, she jumps to conclusions way too fast and acts irrational. She also forgave him pretty quickly for the bet without ever really discussing it in depth. That should have been a slower progression of her letting him prove himself at least. A month apparently passed but that was off screen, so it just seemed like they jumped right back into bed and ignored their issues. There was just no communication.But young adult relationships can be like this, all hormones and impulsive and crazy with fights and makeups. Many of us have been there. I used to fight with my teenage boyfriend all the time, so in a way maybe it's realistic. But there was still something off about this movie and the script. There needed to be more. More communication, more connection. There needed to be something that made you really want these two to work it out.In the sequels to To All the Boys I've Loved Before and Kissing Booth, there were fights and jealously too with the couples (all bad boy/player type themes), but the core of the interactions still felt genuine. You still rooted for the couples to make up. They addressed their issues as best they could.Trevor was supposed to be the new guy I guess, but their interactions were more friendly and awkward, no chemistry, so it was almost pointless.The idea is cliche and has been done so many times, but it could still be enjoyable if done right. The actors are decent, but they aren't given much to work with. Sex scenes are fine if done properly too, not just thrown in randomly for wow factor.I may read the books to see if they are better.",After We Collided

Also the score and soundtrack is pretty decent and Roger Kumble tries in the direction department but it's not enough to save this film ....from being the pointless unnecessary stupidity that it is. When it comes to VOD and in theatres October 23rd, don't watch it unless you're a fan of the first movie and the books. YES, THERE IS A CLIFFHANGER FOR A 3RD AND 4TH FILM!!

This movie is now under fire from viewers on Netflix and Amazon for glorifying toxic and abusive relationships and I'm glad they're pissed off about this because it's a wake up call to say movies like this needs to stop NOW!! This could've been good if you had something to say about the toxic relationships instead of glorifying them.

54,thenza,Better Love Story than Twilight Yet Probably Similar,7,28 December 2020,"So, I watched this movie out of sequence on Netflix not realizing there was a movie before this one. Honestly I did not think this movie was half bad, I did find Hardin's characterization to be a little hard to take seriously but I believe the actress who played Tessa did a brilliant job and that the chemistry between her and Hardin's character was very good. In all honesty seeing the movie out of sequence somehow made it better I thought I wasn't watching it out of sequence and just thought there was just a lot of call backs being made in the other movie After so it explained a lot of things for me. I do find the film to be a little overtly sexual and romantic novel-ish at times but I suppose it appeals to the target audience. In total retrospect not a bad film if you like that twilight like romance bad boy good girl younger drama but there is some comedic charm as well so not all is lost, watch it on Netflix and if you read the book maybe that would have been enough. I see that with this movie you are going to either love it or hate it but watch it in entirely then make up your mind, or do what I did and watch it on a whim and then watch After after it.",After We Collided

I kept waiting for this movie to turn into a teaching moment, where people grow up and discover that toxic relationships are things to leave.
I dread thinking that teenage girls (or boys) are watching this and think this is a love story. It is not. It is a sick story about a toxic relationship between two very immature individuals. The drinking, the sex, the parties....
Hey, believe me, I am not a prude. But when people keep stepping back into the same toxic relationship that is truly bad for both parties, its gotta stop. Instead we have a mother who pushes her kid to go back and continue to create toxicity in his ""girlfriend's"" life.
Honestly, what is there to see in this movie that has any redeeming quality? Yes, sex is beautiful and we, as humans, love it. But that is the only thing I see that this couple has going for them. And lets be real folks, good sex does not make an entire relationship valuable or good. It just fools you into believing that you are ""in love"", when really you are feeling an animal magnetism which is what via biology keeps the human primate together with their mate (to raise children).
Sorry, human love is more advanced. It is about respect and honesty, and addictive or violent activities are not included in the definition of ""love"".

The caharcters are basically cardboard-cutouts, they exhibit absolutely zero personality, I have never been this uninterested in the main charcters of a movie. They also try to portray them as having this super dramatic, passionate, wildfire romance, when objectively, nothing interesting has ever happened to them or between them, so it's just really awkward to see them screaming at each other and acting like they are driving each other crazy, when again, literally nothing has happened lol. I loved Dylan Sprouse's character though, he was a breath of fresh air, and it was nice to see the charming Candice King again (even though she was given zero interesting material to work with).This movie was OK to watch once with a coupon for the movie ticket, but it was incredibly forgettable, I have no idea how this franchise blew up like it did lol.The soundtrack is really cool though, you should check that one out!",After We Collided

The movies aren't good, but this second one is still better than the third and maybe the first one.. Overall the whole series are triggering, they gets on my nerves with the spot on narcissistic behavior of Hardin.. Tessa is the typical victim - addicted to her abuser. About this movie in particular - it's evident how Hardin is turning her into a different person, not for good sadly. She is getting aggressive, impolite, with bad manners... He is turning her into the angry bitter person that he is.. They were fighting all the time, then coming back together, then splitting up. Then getting back together again.. repetitive, abusive, but still more entertaining than the 3rd movie which was a boring mess. The intimate scenes were meh, nothing unseen, nothing exciting.. she is slowly but surely becoming addicted to more brutal and harcore things in the bedroom :D he is projecting his personality on her.. she is constantly forgetting him things that should not be excused and tolerated.

82,Vassilikii,LOL,3,6 November 2020,"Okay so during the movie I was baffled by how overdramatic Tessa, Hardin and the girl with the purple hair were acting. It didn't seem like real people to me until I realised that yes, sometimes young immature people behave and talk like that (I'm 23). They scream and make assumptions and have trust issues. They are egotistic, overly jealous and completely ridiculous in how they act in their relationships. I mean they truly think that this is what real love is and feels like. If your significant other isn't toxic and doesn't make you cry 80% of the time then are you even in love?
And then one day you grow up and realise that true love makes you calm, and happy, and it makes you feel safe and understood. You never search for the knife in your back because it's not there. Sometimes real relationships are so good they get boring and that's okay. Of course there are always hardships but they don't look remotely like the ones in this movie.
Let me be clear. HARDIN AND TESSA SHOULD NOT BE TOGETHER. At least not at this part of their lives. They are both very immature and toxic to each other. The trust is not there and they keep hurting each other. They retaliate and purposely try to hurt one another. I hope young people seeing this don't mistaken this for what it isn't. On the other hand who hasn't made mistakes regarding their love life. So I guess at the end of the day you should do you.
Moving forward to the actual movie.. it's even worse. The dialogues, man, the dialogues. The direction makes me want to cry(not in a good way).

Most scenes are just filler. There are no deep emotions and no gripping moments. It's merely a cliché and shallow romance.The characters are empty and the setting is laughable. Tessa gets a job as an intern, and on her first day, she gets invited to a nightclub. Her whole job is basically just drink and have fun. That is not how it works in real life. But it wouldn't even matter that much if the rest of the movie weren't so bland. The love triangle is also incredibly forced. It was there purely to provide fake tension.A lot of the characters' actions come out of nowhere. The fight Tessa and Hardin have near the third act was beyond contrived. A girl who hasn't appeared in the entire story comes out of the blue to tell Hardin: I don't kiss and tell. Then Tessa gets all pissed.
WHAT?! That wasn't set up at all. It's lazy writing to its fullest extent. At least in the first movie their fight made sense.

The book is far more intense and gives many details that enrich the plot, but it's still not that bad of an adaptation, considered it kinda covers hundreds of pages in less than 2 hours.

Also I don't understand how any one can ship Theresa and that other dude because they are the embodiment of toxicity and Theresa is a terrible protagonist and an awful role model she is the opposite of a good female protagonist because she keeps going back into a toxic relationship she needs help.

first one had too many slow motion romance scenes with classical music in the background though.
this one gets an extra point for the fact that tonnes more hilarious unbelievable stuff happens in like 3 days & they both get cranky at each other but then just randomly have sex way more.

I didn't read the books.I'll start with the disappointments. I was disappointed with the opening to see that Tessa didn't go to Hardin on the dock. I was disappointed that she slept with Hardin after a drunk night at the nightclub. I would have liked it better if Hardin went to the hotel and saw Tessa with Trevor and left in anger, it would have set the story better for Hardin to have to try and win her back. I was disappointed at the misunderstanding at the party which lead to a huge fight. Too many fights between them.I liked the storyline with his mother. I like knowing why characters act the way they do. I like they dug into his childhood, abandonment by his father, watching his mother be attacked, etc does give you an insight into his current behavior. I love the character Trevor. He was a nice addition, I was hoping for a love triangle between them but that didn't happen either. That would have been predictable but way better than the current storyline.Overall the movie was ok, the storyline needed some polishing because it didn't flow well.",After We Collided

And one more thing, what is the target group of this movie?

If I could have a compilation of just Hero being Hardin and of course the scene of his wonderful bum thats all I would want. The movie unfortunately to me didn't do the books justice at all. I understand that they can't follow it to a T and fit it all in a movie but the changes made felt unnecessary but I respect the work that was put into it. With that said, the flow of the movie felt rushed making it sloppy. There was too much of pop music. It was certainly better than the first I will give it that. Not the best but support Hero and will watch the rest of the movies for him.",After We Collided

Though they are normalizing toxic relationships to be "" okay"" and "" good"" in the end just because the characters are attractive and are obsessed with each other. I respect they love each other and have love but Hardin does not know how to show that and has issues. The characters are also really basic it's just a basic genre mixed with a toxic genre.

132,marissacolaianni,Movie to book,8,24 October 2020,I am very happy I have finally seen it I waited so long for this film. I have to say I'm in ways disappointed. There was so much left out. There was just so much missing like college and fighting ( the Molly Tessa fight was even better than the book ) there was just so much still missing things that just seem important and that should have been added in. Like Tessa staying with with Landon more there should have been more of their friendship and things like Christmas they cut it so short shopping together was such an important part. The gifts from ken and karen were cut out the hockey game was cut out hardins birthday which was very important was cut out. There was just so much cut out that seemed more important that should have been in the movie. I loved the books and read them 3 times just honestly wished for the film to be better. But I was still excited even with the changes. I love Tessa and hardins story but the film just seems like she forgave him so easy when it wasn't at all easy for her I wish there was more of her raw emotions she didn't go back as easy as the movie seemed like she just fell into his arms so fast. It wasn't that easy for her the movie makes her seem weak and in love when really she was so strong in the books.,After We Collided

If you follow this advice, that's my good deed for the day done. You're welcome, I'm saving you precious time in life.Longer version:Dylan Sprouse is the only likeable character in thisThe acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. Tommy Wiseau feels threatened by this movie.The plot makes no sense. That and it is normalising toxic behaviour. We're what, 10 minutes in and the ex-bf has managed to locate his ex partner in the armpit of nowhere because apparently tracking your ex is normal behaviour (she seems completely unperturbed by it)it is incredibly rushed.Hero Fiennes Tiffin trying to play a badboy is unbearable. His accent is the least threatening accent out there (at least be a cockney if you're going to have a South English accent) and apparently his character is in the habit of pushing women about. Throw into the mix his attempts to kick a door open in the real world would result in him bouncing off the door with a kick the strength of a wet noodle and you have a recipe for the least scary badboy going.I've not read the book but, if this movie is anything to go by then I imagine it to be equally abysmal.

You can feel you're heartbreaking for him! It is impossible not to smile, laugh, or cry. The first time he appears on the screen to the last. His first and last words. It is breathtaking.

That being said I had hoped that we had moved away from passionate yet very toxic relationships. This why it sometimes takes a while for many of us to realize that love does not have to be hard to mean something. The constant up and down and Hardin not actually getting help. Yo its not your job to fix someone and that's the message I feel the movie is putting out. Also can we talk about the uptick on the sex and the swearing. I mean we get it they have a good sex life there was no need for so many sex scenes, cause again good sex does not equate love. Tessa girl choose that other man",After We Collided

Sadly for this film, it falls flat to really build the characters into what the book did, I also think if I didn't read the book, I would have no idea what even happened in this movie it's so broken up and odd in the structure it was in. I know Anna Todd influences the film by being the writer and you simply can't make the movie as detailed as the book but it really didn't even feel like the same story or characters and I hope they do better in the next films.",After We Collided

I have been in a relationship like this, except the feelings on his part were not as I thought and the things Tessa thinks Hardin has done, my ex was actually doing. I can also relate to the addiction of Hardin from a family standpoint. I think this movie does a good job hitting on what people classify as a ""toxic"" relationship but there is actual love there and I feel this movie depicts that in all its glory.

Yes, it's more accurate to the book, but the way it is paced and directed is just not it for me.Although the first movie had less dialogue and was less accurate to the books, I still enjoyed it better than this one.I've mentioned bad things about the movie, but there were some good things as well. Josephine Langford and Hero FT's chemistry is always great. Also, I really liked the way Dylan Sprouse portrayed the character ""Trevor"", although he's not really relevant to the story.Overall, I've watched this movie more than once trying to convince myself that it deserves more stars... but I think 4-5 stars is the accurate rating.The trailer for the third movie called ""After We Fell"" recently came out and it honestly looks more promising than ""After We Collided"" with the new director.",After We Collided

I think this one explored their more emotional sides and what the breakup did to both of them and how they handled it. They both come from very broken families and webs of lies. I really did like this movie and I will watch it again. For those that say these two have no chemistry??? You're crazy.

I feel that the toxic relationship, bad acting, and horrific writing have already been destroyed by the masses already, so I'll just talk about the pacing...or to be more specific the lack of it. The film will just randomly jump into sex scene after sex scene with no sense of flow or romantic rhythm, with the spaces in between categorized by a story so boring and uneventful that I forgot what exactly happened in it. Every film has a climax...ok not all of them but most films do. Can you guess what the climax for this film is? (Jeopardy Theme plays)They have sex on New Year's Eve and climax on the exact moment when it becomes the New Year.I don't necessarily know if that classifies as a spoiler, but as someone who has read the 10 star reviews for this film I know there is a large subset of people who would see it as such.

I began seeing ads for a new movie and i decided to give it a watch, because the last one gave me so much joy in the hilarity of it (Especially if you remember that everyone is in one direction, and Hardin is Harry Styles.) but jeez this one is just a mess.

After We Collided movie is emotionally charged and intense... maybe even too intense (struggled to swallow my popcorn at times :) So much was going on in this movie, it was overwhelming. If I haven't read the books, I probably wouldn't understand all scenes, because everything was a bit rushed and fragmented. On the other hand, it will be still interesting to rewatch.
Hero has improved his acting so much, I was pleasantly surprised! And comedic moments were nice for a little breath of air.However... Being a young adult, I didn't like how much alcohol was in the movie. It was unpleasant to see Tessa drinking so much, being a mess. She has gotten drunk twice and, what even worse, Hardin seemed to like it. In the books I admired her purposefulness and dedication to work no matter how bad things with Hardin were. But in the movie, it seemed like her intelligence decreased. In my opinion, this movie is very bad for teenage girls, as it sets a terrible example of unhealthy relationships and bad alcohol habits. For young adults though, it's quite entertaining to watch.",After We Collided

When I go in seeing a movie that is adapted from a book I know we are never going to get exactly the book or else that movie would be 10+ hours long which I know some people don't mind, like me, but realistically that just can't happen. I think for what they had to work with, with what happened with the first movie, I think Anna, Roger, and the rest of the crew and actors did an AMAZING job trying to give us the books as much as possible but still give the people who haven't read the books a great storyline too. Both Jo and Hero, I think, went above and beyond what I could've ever imagined, they truly gave us Hessa. And then the new additions of Vance, Kim, Smith, Trish, and the new Ken and Karen were all amazing as well.

I mean, sci-fi is a pretty unrealistic genre, but a story about an alien coming to Earth and getting back home with kids on flying bikes? It sounded absurd to me. Let's just say I was very incorrect in my assessment. This was one of the greatest movies I've seen, and I think it has to do with the pure light-heartedness of the story. I'm not usually one for movies with child actors, but Elliotts performance was simply moving. It amazes me how great the practical effects have held up after all these years, Spielberg is a genius and his hard work has not been overlooked. The pacing was excellent, the story was moving, and the performances were great. E.T. is just a family classic and my heart goes out to those who have never been able to experience the movie for the first time with their family. Moving. While watching it with my son, I'm pretty sure I shed a few tears. Part of the reason this experience was so great to me was because recently my best friend passed away, so it was nice to see the bond between Elliott and ET. Moving as hell. Let's not even get to the Halloween scene. A comedic yet moving scene if I've ever seen one. This movie is great. A masterpiece. Can not be beaten. Spielberg? Genius. ET. Amazing. My best friend?

The main characters are so bland, and I can't get over how the author of the book this is based on wrote this about Harry Styles, without going into detail about how strange that is, standing alone, this movie is one of the worst I've seen this year. Sufjan Stevens' record label should not have sold the rights to ""Should Have Known Better"" because now that song is associated with this horrible movie. Both of them are bad people, and good sex shouldn't fix their ""relationship"". Wish we could stop using audience surrogates, and actually have interesting characters where you're pulled into the story instead of having to fill in the gaps with your own interests for a female lead.

This movie, however, lacked so much. It lacked a clear plot, good acting, and logic in general. Hero did a much better job in After playing a ""bad boy"", while in this movie he came off as more of a lovesick emo drama queen. It was cringey the whole time.
I had high hopes for this movie because they were supposed to be staying closer to the books, but everything was rushed and I feel like it would be confusing to someone who hasn't read the books... it was confusing to me and I HAVE read the books.

The script was awful and the line delivery was so forced it was like the actors were reading off of a piece of paper/cue cards. But, After We Collided was pure trash, oh goodness, it is way worse than the first film. The directing is so sloppy, the characters are even more annoying this time around, and that horrible acting! I am convinced that it isn't just the script that's awful but the actor's line delivery. Especially, Hero and Josephine. Their acting was pretty bad in the first film but this time it seemed to worsen, by a lot.Overall, the film is a disappointment and I really couldn't finish the whole thing.

Secondly, the amount of the f words was just unmeasurable. Also what's about all those sex scenes? I know they were in book but come on, this was supposed to be a teenage romance right? Well, if not and you people thought that fully developed adult would watch AND even enjoy this movie, I'm just sorry for you.

I wanted to like it, as I quite liked the first one but it just seemed very rush, no real story line and very very cringe.Within the first 5 minutes of the opening scene there are more 'swear words' than in the whole of the first movie, it just seemed like it was trying too hard to be more 'bad' that it was coming off cringeworthy. Also there were way too many sex scenes, I feel like half of the movie was watching them have sex.The movie was basically Tessa and Hardin falling out, arguing, making up, having sex and repeat. Elements of the movie were just completely unrealistic too.I only gave it three stars because hello It's Hero, obviously - and Dylan Sprouse's character was funny.

I loved the books, really love them.
First movie was a cute movie for teenager. Not at all as in the books.
They told us the second one would more for adults.
But really, the scene were tessa dances in a nightclub like if was a commercial for deodorant.
The ver very very bad sex scene. No chemistry, no intamcy, no connections between caracter.
U can tell, its was there to please the audience but it doesnt fit in.
Does it happen to you to hide yourself sometimes when you watch a movie/ tv show when you re embarassed for the actors?
Let me say, i did this 1 million times

Yes the books are always going to be better but there is literally no depth to this movie. The books have so many important themes and moments, and that was not present in the movie. My rating of 6/10 is literally because I love the actors and the books and need to see this through to the happy ending. It should be illegal to do this to book series.

No intern gets their own private office straight out of college. And they would never be invited to go to such an important work event. The relationship between Tessa and Hardin is toxic as well. Passion shouldn't always be mistaken for love. They're not in the right headspace to even be in a relationship. There is lack of character development too and so many cliches. Tessa's acting isn't bad and I like Dylan sprouse and Candice king as actors but that's about it. This movie is not a good example of what love is.",After We Collided
234,starryemogirl,I'm not sorry!,10,31 December 2020,"I was going to apologise for loving this movie because so many didn't, but I'm not sorry! This movie was raw and true (as far as some romances go anyway). Maybe I've just been unfortunate, but show me a young relationship that isn't a little bit toxic. It felt real and I felt just as connected to the characters in this movie as I did to them in the first movie. They didn't get their instant happily ever after and who's to say they ever will, but that's what makes it real. They have to try and they have to change if they want to make each other happy and that's the truth, even if people don't want to except it!! The actors were great and I loved the quirky comedy that the character Trevor brings and the fact that he wasn't the stereotypical girlfriend stealer. This movie is not your average romance slush and that's ok. Sometimes you need something more than bad boy gets good girl and they live happily ever after because let's face it, we all know that's never the truth!!! I'm rooting for Tessa and Hardin all the way because they deserve to be happy together and help make each other become better people. Their love is so powerful and intense. Who doesn't want love like that, something that's worth fighting for!! I loved this movie and I'm not ashamed to admit it. It's about the fight to make love last even though it's hard and that makes perfect sense.",After We Collided

238,sharicmstewart,A lesson in life,8,6 September 2020,"So, I watched the movie and I won't lie, for me, it's much closer to the book (which I read before watching the movie). The two leads, they really did bring the characters to life. I felt their chemistry. For anyone who has not seen the first movie or read the first book, the book and the movie are very different. But this movie, helped me understand their relationship from just a side character. There's a second character who was better in the movie than in the book. He opened my eyes when it came to the relationship of the two main characters. Without giving much away about the movie, or the books, I feel this franchise is giving people a view/ understanding of what addiction can do. How it affects lives and what happens when you think you can change someone or want to stick around and help them. This franchise makes people question their own relationship and possibly recognise the similarities and realise they need to walk away. This is just the second movie. I feel the first movie introduced us to the characters but only showed us the puppy love version. This film showed the characters from the books. Unlike other movies which are probably similar to this movie in terms of problems in earlier life, this film shows the audience that sometimes love may not be enough. The person themselves need to understand what the problem is and get help. Not rely on their partner. But like I said, there are two more books, and apparently they will become movies so let's just see what happens in this journey.",After We Collided

240,netaslonim,The difference from the books is implacable,1,24 October 2020,"I have read the book and throughout watching the movie, this one and the first, i've noticed a big differences that bothered me. The first one is the bet- the bet was the cliffhanger of Tessa's and Hardin's relationship, he took her virginity for a bet against Zed. When in the movie it was about making her fall in love with him then brake up with her and had nothing to do with Zed. Zed is not a significant character in the movies as he is in the books. In the book he, Tessa and Hardin have sort of a love triangle where the two boys hate each other. Where in the movie, they seem to be friends when Zed actually appears on screen, and Tessa and Zed have absolutely no relationship, even though he loves her in the book. The second difference is Hardin's behavior. In the books Hardin is a very violent and aggressive man, who hurt everyone around him. Where in the movie, he is pleasant and nice to others around him, and his relationship with Tessa is much better than in the book. We don't get to see his outbreaks and the way he apologized to Tessa after her mum came to their house before Christmas and Hardin's mum found out about the bet. He wrote her a letter to apologize, using the first paragraph from Darcy's letter to Elizabeth. The letter is what made her forgive him and the movie didn't portrait that properly. Also, in the movie, when Tessa is telling him about Trevor Touching her, he seems unbothered when in the book he would flip. The movie opens when we see Tessa and Hardin haven't spoken in a month, which in the book didn't happen at all, the first time they went nine days without speaking is after they got into a fight over Tessa's job offer in Seattle. Another huge difference is the relationship between Tessa and her coworkers. In the movie, they didn't build it to make it look like Tessa and Kimberly are friends. Where in the book they are. For example, in the movie Tessa answer the phone because her boss called and when she asks her to watch Smith they go to the office to watch him. Where in the book they are friend and Kimberly is asking Tessa for a favor to watch Smith- at Tessa's and Hardin's house. Where Hardin doesn't want to communicate with Smith and the little boy only speaks to him. In the movie, Hardin initiates the conversation. In the movie, after Tessa kisses a stranger in the new years eve party, she goes home and he stay's the night at the frat house. In the book, Hardin leaves Tessa at the house without her phone and Zed takes her home. The movie make it seem like Tessa does nothing wrong, but in the books she keeps her relationship with Zed in spite of the pain it causes Hardin. Another thing that bothered me is the lack of relationship with Hardin's family. Karen and Tessa don't have a relationship, and she doesn't live in their house. In the book, Tessa is particularly a family member at the Scott's and has a good relationship with Karen. Also, Mr. Vance didn't offer her a job or took her from the office to Seattle in the book, but in the movie he does and it's unrealistic. In the book he invites her to Seattle and she asks him for a job in the new office which he gladly gives her. The movie does not contain a proper plot-line and the difference from the books is implacable, I wish they stayed true to the books",After We Collided

Hessa will forever be in my heart and After will always be my number one way of spending money! I wanted a little more sneak peak of the 9 days but really I am proud of the outcome of this movie.

If I'd say I was disappointed, that would be an understatement. Hence I was reluctant to see the second one, but after a friend of mine told me that it was good I was like ok let's see it.
The inaccuracy in this movie was huge!! Ok I get it that some scenes must be cut off and that the script couldn't be very accurate because in the first movie they blew it. However I cannot understand why they ruined the timeline, or why Hardin and Tessa had sex in almost every scene, it why Trevor had to have an addicted sister.

It's never okay to be in such a toxic, abusive relationship like that. Talking, cursing, yelling at one another like they did is never okay. Hardin needed to figure out himself first and be healthy enough to care for and respect himself before he could be in a relationship. That didn't happen. He didn't go through the healthy process and therefore their relationship will continue to be toxic. Tessa didn't have respect for herself either if she thought being treated like garbage is okay.

I wasn't sure I was going to like the new dynamic of adding Trevor into the mix BUT Dylan makes it impossible not to love him. Jo is absolutely amazing and the evolution of Tessa is striking in every way but Hero absolutely steals the show.

The storyline was closer to the book & the acting improved majorly. There was more dialogue of the book added this time around, and the mix of action, romance & comedy in this movie definitely showed off the characters true personalities, which wasn't really shown in the first adaptation of the After saga. Roger Kumble did an incredible job of bringing the true book essence to the big screen, props to him. As for the actors, they did a phenomal job at bringing book Hessa to live.

312,marcyraev,Good movie-if not a bit rushed,8,6 September 2020,"My favorite thing about this movie is that Hardin is the one telling it. Sure it's from both their POV but there is much more from the side of Hardin and they come back to his narrative near the end. I feel that while the story between Hardin and Tessa is being told relative to the book it's lacking the outside parts that make their story that much more in the books. It's much less a college romance based around navigating school, clicks and romances and more of an adventure of young adults exploring themselves in a world of ""grown ups"" and familial hardships. The movie itself seemed a bit fast some scenes not falling into one another smoothly or making sense in transition in my opinion. I will however, despite that tidbit, watch it again and again just because I'm a fan of both the books and what the team is trying to convey with the movies.",After We Collided
313,leahdavies-87432,Amazing,10,8 September 2020,"I found this movie so much better than the first awc shows book Hessa and is much like the books in my opinion.

People make a bad name of this movie because it did start as a fanfic but it has nothing to do with Harry styles it's about Hardin Scott the movie is not distasteful and if you have a problem with it being a fanfic don't watch the movie

The romance between the lead pair and the drama and comedy that surrounds them as they try to get back together keeps you attached to the screen until the end. The director did an amazing job of maintaing the harmonization between characters and casts. Though Josephine and Dylan did a pleasent job bringing Tessa and Trevor to reality, what completely fascinated me was Hero's acting. He completely turned Hardin 360° and made up for the Hardin that the audience was missing in the previous film. The actor made it possible for us to love Hardin despite all his flaws. In conclusion, even though there is place for betterment and earning perfection in the plot it's a good film to watch if you like drama and romance.",After We Collided
320,ferberjessica,After We Collided Movie,9,6 September 2020,"Hey guys,
I saw the movie yesterday and I think the movie is way better than the first!
The movie is close to the book and the most important things from the book are available in the movie.
You can see that Hardin and Tessa had a huge glow up, which is very important for their story. We finally have our book Hardin and Tessa was as perfect as ever!
One thing that disturbed me was the beginning! The movie starts with Hardin sitting in a car and Tessa's dad walks by and wants to ask Hardin a question. That scene confused me a bit because it never happened in the book and I can't understand why they put that in the beginning, because in my eyes this scene was unnecessary. I mean, they meet Tessa's dad Richard at the end of the book and not from the beginning and that confused me.
Another thing that disturbed me, was the scene after Hardin meeting Richard. Tessa had her first day at Vance Publishing and I don't know why they started directly with that! Of course, they have to find a way to connect it with the ending of the first movie, but in the time where Hardin and Tessa broke up happened so much. She wasn't at Vance Publishing at the beginning and everything happened so fast. The day they went to Seattle was so fast I didn't like it.
The last point that disturbed me, was that aftermovie posted too much scenes on Instagram!
In my opinion, they should post some pictures of a scene but not a whole scene because sometimes it ruins the movie, because you can figure out what happens in the next scene or you already know it. The scenes that they posted were a bit long and one thing that I was sad about was the meeting of Tessa and Trevor. They just posted the scene and when I saw the movie it wasn't a surprise anymore of how they met. I often knew what will happen in the next scene, because they posted so much. Of course, they didn't post so many scenes from the second movie as from the first movie but it still felt the same.
I just hope that aftermovie reads this and they will accept the criticism and implement something about it. I just hope that they won't post scenes from the third and the fourth movie, because it would be better if the whole movie is a surprise and no one knows what will happen. (Except the Trailer, there has to be scenes from the movie but I hope you understand what I meant with posting some scenes on Instagram.)
In all, the movie was perfect, a lot happened and they put as much as they could from the book into the movie. Roger Kumble did a great job and all the actors too! The chemistry was everything and the plot was definitely better than in the first movie.
I'm looking forward to the next two movies and of course I will watch After We Collided again in the cinema! The movie and the people deserve this.
I hope you agree with me at some points!
Have a good day!",After We Collided

I really like how they stayed true to the books and the acting improved. There were some things I didn't but they were little things such as I wish the movie was a little longer or if next time they focused more on the relationship itself rather than the sexual aspect. Even though I wished they would done things differently, those things didn't take away from me liking the overall project. I just hope for the next two movies they make them longer to focus more on the relationship.

332,mellyloud,Mmmm??,8,10 September 2020,"I watched it twice so I must have enjoyed it or was I looking for more? In my opinion the film was rushed. The film didn't capture Tessas and Hardins emotions after their break up. In the book the author captured their pain. In the movie it was a case of ok let's go and have sex. The book was sexually orientated but there was a good story to it too. In the movie the characters were different. I didn't like it..not just Tessa and Hardin but Noah, Tessas mum, Steph, Stephs girlfriend and Molly. I feel the director let the actors down. They were all different from the first movie. Tessa turned over night from a quiet polite lady to a totally different person. Is this because of what she had endured. I don't think anyone would change so much so quick. It was like where's Tessa? In my opinion there should have been a lot more shown about the turmoil Hardin went through whilst he was in London. It was just too rushed. Candice Accola was amazing as usual and Charlie Weber was a good choice for Vance. Would have loved to give 10 for the actors but I feel the Director has let them down.",After We Collided
333,leilaokelezo,I'm sad 😭,1,10 September 2020,"I'm so sad. I was into the books but this.. This must be a joke. Hardin in this movie was NOTHING like in the books.

But we GOT OUR HESSA! it's not even the sex scenes, it's the development of Hessa, and about their journey! My favorite scene has to be Hardin baby-sitting Smith! I would definitely definitely recommend it",After We Collided
335,tpaiva,"no,no,no.",2,11 September 2020,"There are so many things wrong in this movie. I'm upset with how it turned out. Hardin is problematic, chaotic, and so toxic. He had no character development, other than the same cycle of being ""hot"", to fighting someone, to throwing stuff, to forgetting anything happened. Where's Tessa's independence? Where's the female empowerment? Where's the individuality? It's almost as if she has nothing to her other than being with Hardin. She even works in publishing, reading, and writing, and they STILL couldn't give her ANY independence and personality? This movie poorly represented diversity. I saw no plot other than s*x, and swearing. There was a bit of sl*t shaming in there, along with Hardin having s*x with Tessa TWICE while she's under the influence of alcohol. Even if she said yes while she was drunk, it doesn't follow the guidelines for consent. If you give full consent to s*x, YOU CANNOT BE DRUNK! Their relationship hadn't changed at all from the first movie. It's a shame people will see this movie, and begin to romanticize a relationship like the one Tessa and Hardin has. Although, because of the toxicity, I'm not sure I can even say they had a relationship, due to the horrible lack of communication. Please stop giving the antagonist, assumably Molly, nothing but the title of a ""mean girl."" I get it, she's the villain. But sl*t shaming her, calling her a wh*re, and giving her no personality is boring, classic, and cliché. Oh, and I'd appreciate it if you would NOT romanticize and glorify using alcohol as a coping mechanism, along with destroying physical objects, therefore worsening the love interest, and their relationship with the main character.Oh, but it's ok, we can continue to pretend it's okay to do the following things I've just listed, because we like to ignore those points, do we?It's not a good movie, just don't waste your time on it.",After We Collided

340,annahoustan,Entertaining but...,8,13 September 2020,"The film was way better compared to the first film. They tried to keep the true spirit of after series as close as possible. As an after fan, I was glad to see so many notable scenes from the book into reality. But let's be honest it could have been a bit better. First of all, the film seems to be rushed in some places. Of course, they couldn't have put all the scenes from the book but I kind of wanted a few more dialogues at some scenes. Secondly, nothing against the actress but I was kind of disappointed with Josephine's acting and Tessa's character in general. She didn't seem as into the character as she was in the first film. She looked lost and Tessa seems to lack purpose rather than being strong as she was supposed to be. Where Josephine seems to be a downfall, Hero's acting seems to be redeemed. Of course, it wasn't perfect but it seemed like he was finally started to get the rhythm of Hardin character. As a result, Hardin was only the character that kept me captivating until the end.

342,poramas-34798,"Hero FT, you make this movie so so worth it",8,14 September 2020,"First of all, great improvements on acting abilities for the main characters. Hero did an amazing job portraying Hardin and all of his issues, and Jo is the perfect Tessa.
The movie covers a lot of the main scenes from the book, however, some of the scenes felt rushed. There are times where you are just grasping the situation and beginning to feel an emotion, but suddenly something else is happening and you are still trying to process what happened before.
I loved the comedy, however, there was just too much comedy for a book that is supposed to be angsty and dramatic. For example, the shower sex scene was displayed as a comedy, and it took away from the sexiness.
I cringed during some sex scenes. The office sex scene was the worst. The way they were moving was just unrealistic and uncoordinated. Sometimes they appeared as if they didn't know how you are supposed to move during sex positions, which was a huge turn off because that makes sex scenes look too technical, unrealistic and too choreographed. Jo and Hero have repeated over and over how choreographed and technical the sex scenes are that it is palpable on screen and not sexy at all.
I still loved to see my favorite book series come to life, and Hero Fiennes Tiffin is just makes the whole movie worth it even with all its faults. There were a lot of cute Hessa moments and that's what we are here for. Also, the new cast members were spot on and made this movie even more enjoyable.
I would recommend it, if you have not read the books you may be a little lost, but if you are a fan you will get to see these characters come to life.",After We Collided
343,carrolinee,Opinion AWC,10,14 September 2020,"In my opinion, the movie deserves 7.5. More like the book, there are all the more important moments, I miss Zed because he was very messy with the book. HERO & JO is a masterpiece, besides, it's hard to reproduce a book in 100% of a movie. The action is a bit too fast. After all, the movie is brilliant! 😍",After We Collided

348,shaleeblackstone,Not long enough! We need more!,7,14 September 2020,There is so much that has been rushed. I love the books and I love the characters being portrayed. If it wasn't so rushed then I think there could have been more that the actors could have done with their roles. I think Hero Playing Harden is such a big undertaking and he isn't given enough credit for how he actually does. Also compared to books it is not near spicy enough. Harden is a sex god in the books and this isn't even close to what happens in the movie. Otherwise I still love forward to the future!

I have read some complaints about sex while drunk--come on. Couples have sex when they are drunk- they aren't on a first date or just getting to know each other. I am probably being generous with my rating as the storytelling could be better: less planned out sex scenes, more dirty words like the book, and a slower pace to really show character growth and introspection. But hey, they took this amazing roller coaster of a book series, found two gorgeous people to act it out, and by God, I am not going to complain.",After We Collided

356,wdsgta,What happened?,2,29 October 2020,"One: I felt more character from all of the actors in the first movie. The more seasoned actors in here, Dylan, Candice, a few others; they weren't as painful to watch. I actually found the only scenes I cared for involved Sprouse because of his ability to stay true to form with his character: charming, intelligent, and sensible. However, this was (hands-down) a rush job. Little to no flow. The actors can only do so much with what they are given, but come on. I honestly expected better.Two: The fault most certainly originates in the script. Why? Just why...? I admittedly enjoyed After more than this one because of the simple fact that I did not read the book series until after I watched the film. After I read the book series, I appreciated that with such an annoyingly repetitive, drawn-out storyline to go off of, the film had potential to make Tessa & Hardin's story more interesting, and thus, more appealing. But they ruined that chance with this film.",After We Collided
357,lilyrose-17866,Weird,6,22 October 2020,"Okay so I am a big after series fan well the book at least and this movie Definetly was not what I was waiting for. The first movie After was
phenomenal. I Definetly understood it. But for this second film like why change Karen and Ken. I love hardens mom Definetly pictured her in the movie. Some parts were good other parts felt rushed. Love the ending. No where in the book did it mention the uber driver talking little throwed off about that. All in all a good movie. I wish there were more sad parts in it. The book had a lot of sad parts that made you cry and laugh. Hope the next movie isn't rushed and that they take there time.",After We Collided

367,theamendizabal,Way better than the first movie- AND THE BEST ON-SCREEN CHEMISTRY,10,7 October 2020,"To be honest- this felt rushed, I kind of wished it was longer because they have so much of the story to tell- BUT it was good LIKE REALLY GOOD. Hero and Josephine's chemistry ARE ON FIRE. LITERALLY THE BEST CHEMISTRY. They carry the movie. You can really feel what they're going through throughout the entire movie. Also, their acting was amazing- especially in the emotional scenes. (LIKE, DAMN) Kudos to the other actors as well! I read the books ever since it got published and even though if I didn't read them, I would enjoy AWC so much. It has romance, comedy and drama. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST ROMANCE FILMS THIS YEAR. PERIOD.ALSO, THIS HAS TO BE CLEARED OUT------People say its CRINGEY, but have you seen OTHER NETFLIX/Awesomeness Films ROMANCE MOVIES? SPECIFICALLY- THE HIGH SCHOOL ONES- BECAUSE THEY ARE WAY CRINGIER THAN THIS, so yeah there's that (some examples: To all the boys, Work It, The Kissing Booth, Spontaneous- need I say more?) And I know a lot are really comparing this to the twilight and the 50sog franchise- IT IS NOT. BECAUSE, its a COLLEGE ROMANCE drama that is real and authentic- IT DOES NOT HAVE VAMPIRES, WEREWOLVES, BDSM AND FULL ON RICH STUFF. IT IS ALSO NOT A 1D FANFIC (NOT ANYMORE)- Anna Todd CHANGED ALL OF THE CHARACTERS NAMES before OFFICIALLY PUBISHING IT. AND- HARRY STYLES DID NOT FILE A FREAKING CASE ABOUT THIS. (Really don't get why some are mad about the After Series because it was a 1D fanfic- BUT HAVE YOU SEEN the 1D Fanfic story (LARRY) from Euphoria? Well.. ) And A LOT OF AUTHORS FROM AROUND THE WORLD, USE DIFFERENT ACTORS AS FACES OF THEIR BOOK- NOT THE ACTUAL CHARACTER- JUST THEIR FACES. I mean, some can't just move on.. But anyways, this movie is WORTH IT. AND I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE LAST 2 FILMS- After We Fell and After Ever Happy :)",After We Collided
368,caitlinmahony,True to the book but almost to a fault,6,10 October 2020,"I'm a huge fan of the after series. I watched the first movie about a year after it came out and I hadn't heard anything of the after fandom and books when those first came out either. So I basically just watched it on a whim. When I watched the first movie, I found it extremely confusing because Tessa and Hardin had had very little and insignificant interactions with each other that the sudden jump to the lake scene and their relationship moving forward made no sense to me. I thought the ending was a bit unfinished until I realised it was a book series. I was interested enough in the movie to read the books and was instantly hooked and even more excited to learn the sequel was coming out soon given the trailer seemed jam-packed with drama and a lot more true to the books. Anna's role also became more significant in the second film that they made a huge effort to be true to the book where the first one didn't. The only problem with this was that a lot of things missed in the first film made the sudden changes in the second tasteless as they were not sufficiently thought-out. In the books, Zed had a lot more to do with both Hardin and Tessa's development and not including him in the first movie meant going into the next books/film his character was/will be completely irrelevant to the story. The fact that the ending of the first movie allowed some time between Tessa finding out about the bet and beginning to move on with her life and starting at Vance, left a huge gaping hole in the recovery process of their break up. I didn't feel the pain of their separation like I did in the books. The second film is dated a month later but their experience and emotional journey in this time is not touched on. How has Tessa been handling it? In the book she is destroyed and lives between Landons house and her Mothers and a motel. Where does she even stay in the film once they break up since she can't go to the apartment and has no relationship or screen time with her mother at all? Why does she not have any real relationship to Karen like she does in the books? Why do they never mention Hardin has a job and how will this translate to his future career as a writer? In the second book, they spent so much time adding complexity and anger to Hardins character that was lacked in the first book that Tessa lacked any substance. There was so much drama and scenes from the book they wanted to keep within the strict 1:45 time limit that there is not enough pacing and felt distress of their break ups and fall outs to make a real emotional impact on the audience. That being said, the characters are quite brought to life and the chemistry between Hero and Jo is incomparable. I think for a story like this that is so human and character driven, they should have made it into a one off TV series like normal people.",After We Collided
369,doppie-livery,Just bad,3,12 October 2020,Better than the first one but still bad storyline. Nothing against the acting skills but the storyline is so overated. Break up - together - break up - together same story over the whole movie,After We Collided
370,jessica_susan,*sigh*,8,15 October 2020,"I'm going to keep this brief and to the point.I enjoyed the movie purely because I enjoyed the book (admittedly a guilty pleasure) and it was a fast, easy way to spark memories of the pages I so loved. However, all but cutting out Zed (a significant character in the novel) both confused and saddened me... Where was he? Why was he snogging a twiggy bitch? Why doesn't he love Tessa? And most importantly HOW will they make the third book into a film with Zed being struck from the script? His relationship with Tessa and war with Hardin is paramount to the events of in After We Fell.A am absolutely completely and utterly convinced that Zed was struck out due to his actor being less famous than Dylan Sprouse, as they neglected Samuel Larson' s Zed in favour of over amplifying Dylan's Trevor. I don't even really like Trevor in the books, why oh why is there more of him in the movie!?I am disappointed.",After We Collided

I gave three stars because if you have read the books and you know the series of events it's easy for you to put it together .

I understand that you can't put a whole 300-400 page book into a 1 or 2 movie with out it getting boring so I understand they need to change stuff around which is why I'm not that harsh with it but I just which It would go as fast from one thing to another cause I know what's going on cause of the books but those who haven't read them it might be harder to keep up or understand. THE CAST IS SO AMAZING though everyone new that came in was so perfect 👌 I couldn't imagine any different. Love love love the cast. Love the movie two and love the director.

I didn't mind the first movie adaptation, it was diluted, sure, but it told the story essentially. This movie though... Just nah. It feels like they started with every fight and sex scene they wanted to include from the book and attempted to connect those in the time left over. It failed. It was so disconnected. There was no plot. The main characters are unrecognizable from one movie to the next. Tessa goes from a near virgin, heartbroken college kid to a grown woman with a job, high sex drive and alcohol habit in 'one month' with absolutely no explanation. It's silly, really. The one positive thing about this movie was Dylan Sprouse as Trevor; I would give him 10 stars. I was actually watching it rooting for Trevor?! There was just no reason to root for Hessa. If you haven't read the books I wouldn't recommend trying to watch this. If you are a fan of the books you will probably watch it no matter what, we can't help it :)",After We Collided

With all the other reviews saying it's unrealistic because of her internship, what movies aren't out of this world? What movies don't have unrealistic things happen..... ? The movie was great!

403,natchill-96174,They should have let me direct the movie,3,4 November 2020,"The movie is rushed and it lacks a climax. A lot of problems between the couple but none that would stick around long enough to be considered the main problem. Just different variations of issues couples go through, which is fine sometimes but doesn't really help paint a picture of a whirl wind romance. Dillan Sprouse's character provides no threat really, he was kind of irrelevant. I think they really missed the point when making the movie. All the different problems made it hard to focus on what was the main issue.",After We Collided
404,alyasafia,Found simply immature and unrealistic!!,1,4 November 2020,"I personally think that this film is way overrated and I have no idea what is found enjoyable in watching two people struggle in a toxic relationship that's bad for them. Through the entire movie, all that happens is fight scene, make-up scene and then sex scene then the order repeats over again. Their is no plot or theme or purpose of the movie except watching adults yell at each other and act way too immaturely for their age. There is a lot of spins in this movie that you can't focus on one detail.
The movie also mentions Tessa going through a ""life changing dilemma""!! A dilemma that is not approached or pointed out in the movie so basically, there is no backbone or a point to the movie except the bad life choices.",After We Collided

Its trash, really bad!

The books show Hardin in a MUCH darker tone so it's ironic that people think he's so bad in the movies. If you read the books you'd see it's downplayed a LOT of Hardins issues. Even the bet from the first movie/book was a lot darker in the book.
Also if you think they had sex too much: again read the books. The movies downplayed how much they have sex, and how fast they start having sex in the book compared to the movie. Honestly, the movie wouldn't have been a good retelling of the book if they didn't have sex a lot.
But personally, I think the actors are amazing in their roles and I'm so glad I found this series. I've watched the movies a few times already. I can't wait for the next two movies! Especially to see people complain about how dark those get!
And let me say, I absolutely loved the book series. I read all the books after I watched the movies and I finished all of them in a week because I was so hooked. And now I can't stop reading books in general Because this series made me obsessed with books again. #teamHessa!",After We Collided

For people who have not read it, it may seem problematic, toxic, etc. The whole series is about real relationships and how people are affected. Not every relationship is rainbows and unicorns and this series really shows. Overall this is an 8/10.Pros:
Spoke true to the 2nd book
Better directing
Improv
Funny
Lots of chemistryCons:

These two are a codependent mess and, as usual, Tessa thinks she can fix the damaged bad boy. But she can't.

It was extremely frustrating watching the movie after having read the books which were well done.A lot of reviewers are upset about the toxic relationship in the movie... did you read the book? The whole series is about a toxic relationship and verbal abuse that is what this book/movie is about- you don't have to like it but we can't use that fact as a reason to rate the movie low.What we can use is the fact that if someone were to watch the movie they would probably never pick up the book and read it because the movie was terribly done like a low budget lifetime movie sorry.. not sorry.Maybe the problem is the fact that the author is also the screenwriter?

Trevor was the only good thing about this movie so this made it 100x better than the crappy first movie. The ""I saw a tampon on the floor"" scene was the highlight of the movie. Trevor being in the movie is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of one.

However the film doesn't match up to the story very much, yes it includes certain aspects of the book but not much. I just found the film hard to watch at times. Like the ice skating scene for example. I just feel like the actors don't show any chemistry. In the books Hardin and Tessa are supposed to be madly in love with each other to the point where there are loads of arguements and they are both extremely jealous of each other. But in the film it doesn't even feel like they are friends.

436,f-09008,Review,10,21 January 2021,"I would like to start by giving a little detail of this movie and addressing a fellow reviewer on here and take a chance to possibly change your mind on how you view this movie. After We Collided is a sequel to the movie After and there are two main characters named Hardin and Tessa they both had completely opposite personalities, he was the bad boy type who didn't really care about anything and she was the more quiet and studious type. But there was one thing that we saw from the first movie and to the second they both liked reading and literature. Hardin helped Tessa get a job and she reviews articles that is what she wanted in the field of work. But they were a bright couple in the first movie and had a rough patch in the second.
While I understand the impulse to say that Hardin and Tessa should not be together, my own view is they need each other more than ever. Love is hard it is never easy but it is always helpful to have a loved one right by your side to share the good and bad. They are in the real world now after graduating from college from the first movie, they both think about each other every day, and even when they were together they both were motivating each other to do better But that is an interesting point she made by saying they shouldn't be together ""At least not at this part of their lives. They are both very immature and toxic to each other."" Maybe you are right by their immaturity and at this point in time, they are not in the right mindset for a relationship. But I still stand by that they should be with one another.
Another point is while Vasoulababyv (her user name) argues that what Hardin and Tessa have isn't love, and I argue what they have is in fact Love, love can be in many shapes and forms and their relationship is definitely a unique one. I do agree ""that true love makes you calm, and happy, and it makes you feel safe and understood."" Hardin would do anything for Tessa, in fact, he became a better person for her, and Tessa would stand by his side and try to understand him for who he is, and she even lost touch with her mother because she disapproved of Hardin. We do see in this sequel that Tessa tries to move on and forget her past love but she realized how much love she still has for him. Even though the jealousy and trust issues are there which makes it seem that they are not in love, in a way we are both right. Cannot wait for After We Fell another sequel.",After We Collided

In addition, the interactions between characters were to say the least cringeworthy, and the film was overall bland.

In reality these relationships are exhausting, sometimes frightening and not romantic at all. They did portray the toxic guy accurately though- addiction issues, family issues, anger issues, jealousy and mental abuse. I think it's a good thing to make young viewers aware of the red flags, but this movie essentially tells them those relationships are fun and exciting and worth persevering with.

451,ldenhaagdk,REALLY LOVED IT!!!!,8,30 May 2021,"First off where does all the hate come from, this movie is really great. I love this movie immensely, although I must say that Anna Todd is also my favorite writer. I do have to say that the books have a lot more detail and the storyline runs differently as well. The movies are a bit more condensed of course, but sometimes it's annoying because in the books there are some pretty funny or sad moments that happen and you don't see them in the movie. I would definitely recommend reading the books. I think it is so beautiful to see how Hardin changes for her but also for himself. He tries to be a good person. Also the poems in the movies are beautiful and it is well acted. It's just a shame that the actors keep changing. I also really like that you learn more about Hardin's past and why he is so distant. Yes and of course that Hardin is just sickly handsome and his tattoos are just so manly. I also have to say that Tessa stands up for herself well and left Hardin at the right time. Only in the books it takes her much longer to forgive him and in the fim she does come back to him very quickly. Trevor is so annoying like from me you could have left him out in the whole storyline. He adds little, in the books he has a much larger role in her life than in the movies and therefore makes no impact on me in the movie. Same case with Molly and Zed. One day I hope to find a good friend like Landon. Even though he is Hardin's stepbrother, he just let her sleep in his house when Hardin ruined it again. He always took her side. In the books it is much more elaborate and you realize what a good friend he is and you also learn much more about him and his girlfriend Dokate. In the end, I love the movies and am so curious about After we fell.",After We Collided

In fact I found book Hessa's tantrums, break ups and make ups quiet obnoxious. So i personally liked that much of the back and forth were cut out.

Yes. Did it feel more like Hessa? To an extent. But it was still a let down.The movie was far too rushed, scenes were choppy, Causing the movie to not really flow properly. And the story didn't entirely go in the sequences it should have like in the book.Adding the Trevor love triangle actually made even less sense than it would have if they just re-introduced Zed as the other half of the love triangle.Was Dylan's portrayal of Trevor good? Yes. But as I said this whole thing didn't really go with the movie.Another thing that really bothered me was the fact they tried to make it like a romantic comedy... AWC is anything but a comedy.And the R rating is just absurd.... there isn't anything R - rated about it other than 1 bare bum. And a bigger F- word presence. The sex scenes I'd rate as PG-13 ; 14a at most.Dare I say that despite AFTERS lack of book likeness it was actually a better more beautiful film, and actually made more sense than this choppy mess.I am actually shocked, because I LOVE Rogers other projects especially Cruel Intentions. I just feel he wasn't given the opportunity to really shine here, because of other *people* holding him back and not allowing him to express his creative talent.Josephine and Hero did a wonderful job (as did the rest of the cast) their acting has really grown with them.

I now wish I had. I've NEVER felt this way about a film but it almost had me leaving the cinema.I saw the first film on Netflix, thought it wasn't too bad so decided to see the sequel. There were so many story lines crammed in - it was obvious it was based on bad FanFiction. If you had added some BDSM it would have been a knock off of fifty shades - if you have watched both, tell me that, at its basic, it's not the same story line...The only reason this got 2 stars was because even with the horrific writing and awful story line, the acting was good enough to semi redeem it. I honestly feel sorry for the actors, so many of the lines were obviously direct dupes from the fanfic that would never be said in real life.In short, if you have any form of taste in a film, do not watch this.

At the end it felt like all the puzzles fell into one. The movie was more dramatic and sexier than the first one. The whole story felt mature and more grown up just like in the books. It absolutely had the intensity to it! Honestly if felt much longer than it was in the best way possible. I didn't want the movie to end at all. Tessa and Hardin have both changed and are just like they were in the books! I can honestly say I loved all the characters, even Trevor who was a bit different from the books but I didn't mind one bit. Dylan's performance was every bit of amazing and he brought a new kind of vibe to the story. Plus he is super hilarious! Jo and Hero did such a great job! Jo portrayed the change we see in Tessa beautifully and so did Hero. Hero's portrayal of Hardin definitely screamed the desperate boy hopelessly in love with a girl! He had the book Hardin feel to him throughout the whole movie! From Hardin's dry British sense of humor to his intensity. Jo was mind-blowing. After watching AWC and interviews with Jo, I can honestly say Jo IS Tessa in so many ways. Her performance felt super real and utterly believable. We hit a jackpot with her, no kidding. Plus I applaud them for the steamy scenes, their chemistry is off the charts. Anna is a superwoman! Not only is she a talented writer, but apparently she can write one hell of a script as well. I would say it is thanks to her that the movie was so close to the books. And Roger's directing - just wau! He also wasn't kidding about the sex, sex and more sex lol. He definitely knows how to keep the audience entertained and give them what they want. Only thing I didn't like was how they used the camera (and I guess it's an issue of editing as well) in some scenes where they would switch very quickly between the characters. But I think that's also about personal preference. I'm not a fan of it but I'm sure many people won't even notice it. Of course I do have to mention secondary characters - Inanna as Molly blew my mind! So did Louise as Trish, I fell in love with her instantly. Candice as Kim was super cute and Charlie as Vance? Hilarious. I can't wait to see more of them all in the next movies. All of them were just perfection. The talent in this movie is ubelievable.",After We Collided
470,elizamilam,"Corny, Cringy, Perfect",7,16 November 2020,"The first movie was me hiding my face from embarrassment for most of the romantic scenes. The plot line itself wasn't super original and probably wasn't fleshed out as well in the movie as in the books. Could be wrong. I haven't read them yet. I will say that I enjoyed the second movie much more. It was less about Tessa being some fragile goody-good and more about her coming into herself. There were still many moments when I was making eek sounds because I was so embarrassed by the dialogue, but honestly if you love romantic novels then you have to be able to deal with that. Even though I haven't read the books, the film translated like a book to me in many ways. I actually thoroughly enjoyed After We Collided. I may be cynical and jaded from my own real life experiences. I may yell at them about how dumb and naive they're being, but I feel like the second movie showed them maturing to an extent. People are too critical. Like they want something to complain about. I saw all the bad reviews and that's the only reason I posted mine, because I actually liked it. The ending was weird and was obviously meant to keep things open for a third movie. I actually think this would have made a great tv series or limited series. It has the potential.",After We Collided

477,shannaheksmith13,Growth over Plot,7,31 October 2020,"It's always exciting watching the opening of a sequel hoping it's better then the last, with extra romance, dramas and story line. Although there were raunchy scenes that made the cheeks glow red and body run hot, there was little in depth explanation with the rival romance, only showing small scenes of flirtation.
More details or back story would have been better.
Josephine Langford (plays Tessa) did a great job growing the character into her own person, from a quiet and sturdy person fresh out of high school to a free spirited, experimental individual finding her path in both romance and career. Hero (Hardin) also did a fantastic job showing the more vulnerable and emotional side of the character in this movie. Both actors/actress did a great job bouncing off of each other, BUT the movie itself seemed to be focusing on the characters growth, which was a little bit boring, more than it did with a plot line which could have been more exciting and interesting. I do think they did not give any justice to the Trevor character and pretty much added it in like it was a forced requirement.
All in all, it was a movie that was great to watch and be entertained in certain scenes, funny and sexy.",After We Collided

The Hardin actor is wooden, uninspired and rubbish in all aspects. Loads of sex scenes set to dodgy music to make teenage girls who know no better think it's romantic when in reality it's not. This will give plenty of the teenage girls who see it a totally skewed perspective on what is a healthy relationship and what it means to have a life outside of it. The writers should be embarrassed by how poorly written it is. Razzies will come its way if it isn't completely ignored, which it probably deserves to be.",After We Collided

491,meolibra,Simply the BEST,10,4 September 2020,"I read the After series 2 years ago and it was a life-changing experience. I re-read it again recently cause I've miss the characters so much. The second movie has done such a great job bringing our book Hardin and Tessa into real life. Anna, Roger and the crew have created such beautiful and amazing storyline. Of course there are differences, but like Anna said, something is better written than being displayed in front of camera. About the actors and actresses, all of them did such a great job, I almost thought the main characters are actually in love. Hero successfully brought Hardin's love for Tessa into real life, and Josephine is so talented. Love how they give Trevor some more stories than the book, but I was still hoping for more Zed stories. Overall, this movie is better than any romance I've seen. This movie carries depth and lessons, even if you haven't experienced but can still relate to. I'm glad that the 3rd and 4th movies are in production soon, but I hope more countries (for example in Asia) can watch the movie. Also, waiting for a release day on Netflix or DVD announcement. This movie is worth the watch.

As a fan of the books, there are so many dynamics they are completely missing out on, which are really important for character development. So many of these scenes that people are saying were done right from the book are completely wrong. Tessa's birthday? She spent her birthday in a motel room. They also got a new apartment together, not staying in the one from the first movie. The fight with Ken was supposed to be huge as well at Christmas. And Tessa was supposed to have actually gotten home before running back to Hardin. Overall this was just really sad. I actually liked the first movie better. It's a shame that the book was incredibly written, and then so poorly represented on screen.Also, we really are completely normalizing toxic relationships to an age where this was a Harry Styles fanfiction? We gotta do better than that.",After We Collided

I think critics are being too harsh as like I said it so hard to please everyone. Love the addition of Trevor.

Also , they omitted on the story to have more sex scenes, which doesn't make any sense , you need content to have a proper movie and this movie was lacking a lot of it , the storyline was so confusing , and I know the whole story !

507,casualwatcher_,Disappointing,2,13 January 2021,"(Haven't read the books)The intro will give you the feeling that it won't be a happy ending and that the story will give focus on the individual journeys of the two leads during their break-up.However, basically, it's about two people who can't move on from their lust and love on each other. All I can remember from the film is that the two leads always tried to get it on after their brief ""break-up"" - they didn't shy away from this. There were a lot of ""sex"" scenes. It also got pretty obvious after the first 20mins and much more as the story went on that the two leads would end up together despite their problematic and toxic dynamic and individual issues.There would be no real effort given by the lead female character to actually move on even after expressing such sentiments. The lead male character did try to fix his mess up but it seemed like he wanted to fix it while being with the girl and not actually do it on his own. Whatever character development there is served them more as a couple and lesser on their individual growth, and the conflicts were only convenience to them being together, officially or not. Not much maturity in their handling but a lot of sex instead.The story also tried to create conflict by introducing a new potential romantic interest, but failed in building up the chemistry properly and genuinely. It felt like the new guy was just introduced for the male lead to react on and not really for the female lead to explore and actually learn from. They failed to build up a potentially more mature relationship to dive on.In addition, this also doesn't give as much focus on the career of the female lead. Her job plus her bosses were mostly there to provide a setting and to try to create another conflict in the latter part of the movie. This is proven by her ""accidental"" hotel room upgrade literally on her second day as an intern, and her promotion later on, which are also unrealistic. Her relationships with her workmates and her journey in her career weren't explored much or given much attention or depth.2 stars for the effort of the actors. Got annoyed at the male lead and the female lead did make me roll my eyes at her. However, the chemistry of the whole cast and between certain actors weren't established enough for me to really connect with them.The story got predictable and boring, and will make you skip a couple of scenes. Will definitely not pull you in to be invested in the characters or the story.",After We Collided

The dialogue could have been better between Tessa and Trevor since there was supposed to be a love triangle but there's no chemistry whatever. Their attempt of making a love triangle happen just falls flat.Hardin & Tessa chemistry is off the radar which is the saving Grace in the movie but their relationship essentially glamorize toxic relationships.

We waited all this time with delay after delay and paid extra money to watch it at home because not all theaters are playing it and, in my opinion, it was a waste of my time and money.

After We Collided delves deeper into the characters, their relationships with one another, the story, defining moments from the novel, Tessa and Hardin's sensual yet rocky relationship, and so much more. Not to mention, the chemistry was sooooo much more improved between Josephine (Tessa) and Hero (Hardin)! I feel like I can say for all After fans that this film hit the mark spot on.
