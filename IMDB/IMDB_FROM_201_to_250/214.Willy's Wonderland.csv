0,Leofwine_draca,Didn't do it for me,4,3 November 2021,"Another low budget oddity featuring Nicolas Cage, returning to the horror genre after MANDY and THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE. WILLY'S WONDERLAND (2021) is a typically schlocky low budget and cheap-looking production that goes through the motions and offers an entirely superficial viewing experience. The story is set in a run-down and disused arcade, where a mute Cage plays the janitor looking after things. A group of teenagers visit, looking to burn it down due to a rumoured curse, but nobody realises that the animatronic figures inside come to life and have homicidal instincts...it's all very much par for the course here, with gory deaths and action, and if you like the set up you might just enjoy it...but it did very little for me. COLOR is the only recent Cage film I've enjoyed.",Willy's Wonderland
1,SnoopyStyle,funhouse B-movie,6,19 February 2021,"A driver (Nicolas Cage) suffers a flat tire on a remote road. He gets a tow into town where he is hired to be a janitor at a closed Willy's Wonderland. It's essentially a Chuck E. Cheese's with animatronic figures in individually themed rooms. The place is a mess and he's locked in overnight. Local girl Liv (Emily Tosta) tries to burn it down and gets arrested by Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant). Her friends help her escape and the group returns to burn down the place.I like the general premise and the place. I love Cage's obsessive cleaning although his character should start differently. Instead of a bad mother driving a muscle car, he should be a simple workman driving a beat-up truck. He should be poor which would explain him working as a janitor more easily. I like the teen group for the most part and they are good cannon fodder anyways. I like the animatronic killers although the killings get a bit repetitive. It's lots of fun the first time around but it gets a diminishing return with each kill. All in all, it's fun for awhile but the fun does diminish.",Willy's Wonderland
2,Prismark10,Willy's Wonderland,4,3 March 2021,"Nicolas Cage has still not paid off what he owes the American tax man.So he has gone on strike. Now he makes movies where he refuses to utter a word.Cage plays a drifter in a fast car. Some burst tyres mean he is stranded in a small town. Unable to pay the mechanic as he does not take credit cards.Cage makes a deal to work it off. All he needs to do is be a janitor for one night in a rundown abandoned amusement park. Just clean it up and his car would be ready for him to drive away the next morning.Unfortunately the townsfolk have also made a deal. The park has murderous animatronic creatures that inhabits the souls of the serial killers which previously ran the park.As Cage cleans up, the mascots come to life with an intent to kill.To add to his problems. Some teenagers turn up to burn the place down.The Banana Splits Movie released in 2019 had a similar concept. That was bizarrely more fun as it trampled on childhood memories.This one boasts an Oscar winner and is rather dumb and cheap. Still there is some delight in seeing Cage bash the mascots without uttering a sentence.",Willy's Wonderland
3,nogodnomasters,It's your birthday,7,14 March 2021,"Nicolas Cage gets four flat tires driving over a rumble strip driving into Haysville, home of Willy's Wonderland. It is arranged for him to clean over night at Willy's to pay for getting his car repaired, He is locked inside as the animated creatures come to life and try to kill him. Meanwhile a group of teen wants to burn down Willy's but need to get Cage out first.Cage is a caricature of a tough guy. He never speaks and is completely without care or emotion. He uses duck tape for wounds and I am sure he would have super-glued his arm back on if needed. We are given the back story to the film about 40 minutes into it, a sort of Chucky Doll type of thing. This could be a good cult film for marketing action figures.Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity",Willy's Wonderland
4,kosmasp,Silence! I kill you,8,27 May 2021,"Now that is a reference to a doll ... which I falsely thought was the main bad guy(s) in this ... but it is animatronics. Not just any animatronics as we learn during the run time of the movie. But more on that in the movie. There is not much ""story"" here and while I thought our ""Janitor"" would get some backstory himself, this never happens ... as the filmmakers say, it is in the tradition of the Western movies ... the silent, nameless ""avenger"", who comes to clean town ... or hallways/rooms/bad souls.Having said all that, the movie is as insane as you may think when you read what it is about. And what better choice than Nicolas Cage to play the main/lead role? Exactly - you may have issues with the twenty something year old being attracted to him - but it's a movie and it's Nicolas Cage and ... I mean is that really the main issue you have here? Well congratulations then! This is a movie you shouldn't think too much about ... it is simply there for the viewer to have fun ... blood and gore and one ""sexy time scene"" amidst all the madness. Though I think it's even worse that they don't even take off all their clothes, if they are as horny and mad as they claim to be (not Cage and his admirer, some side characters).Again just do not think about this in any way shape or form ... just enjoy the mayhem ... and maybe call Cage to clean up your house ... though his rate might be high, he's doing an awesome job!",Willy's Wonderland
5,Woodyanders,Nic Cage versus killer puppets,8,5 November 2021,"An enigmatic tightlipped loner (a remarkably expressive mute performance by Nicolas Cage) agrees to spend a night cleaning up a rundown family center called Willy's Wonderland in exchange for free repairs to his car. The man must fight for survival when the place's animatronic mascots all start coming to deadly life.Director Kevin Lewis relates the delightfully bonkers story at a zippy pace, stages the ferocious fight and attack scenes with rip-roaring go-for-the-throat gusto, delivers a handy helping of outrageous gore, and derives lots of huge sick belly laughs from a wickedly funny sense of gleefully twisted dark humor (our drifter hero continues to keep cleaning the joint after every encounter with a killer puppet and even takes periodic breaks to pound an energy drink!).Better still, both director Lewis and writer G. O. Parsons go whole hog with the gloriously gonzo premise. Cage does an ace job of carrying the film without ever uttering a single word, plus there are sturdy supporting contributions from Emily Tosta as the spunky Liv and Beth Grant as the sassy Sheriff Lund. An absolute wacky blast.",Willy's Wonderland
6,BA_Harrison,One Night at Willy's.,4,15 February 2021,"A drifter (Nic Cage, with a stupid 'manscaped' beard) is tricked into working as a janitor at a rundown children's playhouse called Willy's Wonderland, unaware that he is being offered up as a sacrifice to the animatronic animals within, which are host to the souls of a group of serial killers.Did you see The Banana Splits Movie? Well Willy's Wonderland is a bit like that, both films beating Five Nights at Freddy's to the punch with their killer animatronics plots, but both films failing to do the premise justice. Not even star Nic Cage, who has been enjoying something of a renaissance as of late, can help this film; if anything, the fact that he fails to deliver only goes to make the film all the more disappointing.Cage puts in one of his trademark oddball performances (he doesn't utter a word, scowls a lot, and in one scene, pulls off some bizarre dance moves while playing pinball), but this is calculated Cage craziness, the actor going through the motions to please director Kevin Lewis, who clearly intended to help sell his movie on the strength of another deranged turn from his lead.The film also suffers from too many unanswered questions - Why is the janitor silent throughout? Does he know about the animatronics from the outset? Is he related to one of their previous victims? Why does he need a can of soda at regular intervals? And what is his obsession with pinball? It feels to me that, once again, these were calculated moves to create some mystique about the character. All it did was irritate me. I also fail to understand why the animatronics only attacked the janitor one at a time: surely a group assault would have finished him off in a jiffy. Oh, and there's a sex scene where the girl keeps her bra on (as if).I guess I could have been a bit more forgiving of these niggles if the direction was better, but Lewis fails to generate any tension, atmosphere or scares, and his style consists of lots of flashing lights, rapid editing and wobbly camerawork, which make it hard to follow the action.With such a weak movie following on the heels of The Banana Splits Movie, I'm beginning to think that the whole 'murderous animatronics' idea hasn't got legs. Chris Columbus isn't exactly a great director, so my hopes for Five Nights at Freddy's aren't very high either.3.5/10, rounded up to 4 for IMDb.",Willy's Wonderland
7,paul_haakonsen,It was pretty bad alright...,4,25 February 2021,"Well, I will say that ""Willy's Wonderland"" was exactly as I had expected it to be, for better or worse.I mean, a movie that is loosely based on the laughable Five Nights At Freddy's games is not exactly bound to prove to be stellar entertainment. And then you throw in a non-speaking, energy drink guzzling Nicolas Cage, and it is the recipe for a success movie, right? Well, hardly so.Sure, I mean, if you are like 10 years old and enjoy the Five Nights At Freddy's games then you will get some enjoyment out of this 2021 movie titled ""Willy's Wonderland"". But if you sit down to watch the movie with the purpose of watching a wholeheartedly entertaining and enjoyable movie, then you will be sorely disappointed.But it should be said that ""Willy's Wonderland"" was watchable enough for the pointless and mindless movie it turned out to be. It can be watched a single time, and never visited again, because the movie just doesn't have contents for a second viewing, no matter how you turn and try to look at it.It was the mindless violence and the caricatured animatronics that made the movie bearable to watch. But if you are looking for a well-written and properly thought-through storyline, then ""Willy's Wonderland"" is not the movie you should be sitting down to watch.The characters in the movie were just ludicrous. Especially the young adults, wow. Talk about a bunch of brainless lemmings milling about. And the Janitor character that Nicolas Cage portrayed was just so ridiculous that it was actually funny to witness.My rating for this from writer G.O. Parsons and director Kevin Lewis lands on a generous four out of ten stars. Chance are, actually, that ""Willy's Wonderland"" might actually turn out to become that particular guilty pleasure movie for some viewers, I think.",Willy's Wonderland
8,Coventry,Ka-Ching! Another easy paycheck for Nic...,5,27 September 2021,"Since a few years now, I am wondering how Nicolas Cage manages to lead star in so many different (up to 5 or 8) movies per year. Admittedly, most of these films are terrible, but he nevertheless needs to be physically on set and memorize his lines, right? Is Nic maybe homeless and living on film sets nowadays? Does he have a small army of clones working around the clock to pay off his debts and alimonies? Quite frankly, it doesn't really matter, because a) Nicolas Cage will always remain one of the coolest dudes alive, and b) he also turns up more and more frequently in over-the-top gory and violent horror movies! And I love those. After ""Mom and Dad"", ""Mandy"" and ""Color out of Space"", this is once more a gloriously insane B-movie starring the one and only Nic Cage!And, well, the argument of memorizing lines at least doesn't count for ""Willy's Wonderland"". Cage's character is a mute and nameless weirdo who speeds around in a fancy car, drinks gallons of energizer-soda, and has a fetish for old-fashioned pinball machines. He strands in a godforsaken little town where the locals trick him into spending the night in a rundown funhouse called - you guessed it - ""Willy's Wonderland"". The barbaric plan is to sacrifice him to a bunch of animatronic killer-puppets, who are actually possessed by the spirits of child murderers who committed ritual suicide, but they didn't count on a ""victim"" being thoroughly unimpressed with the situations he's facing. Nic beats the murder-dolls to pulp and splinters, has a soda, plays some pinball, and carries on with his janitor work.Sounds like mindless fun and great entertainment, and that's correct, but ""Willy's Wonderland"" is also a forgettable and sorely lacking film. Cage's character being silent is the most annoying flaw, in my humble opinion. It's okay to have a strong and silent hero, but he could have at least said a few things to give a bit of insights in his thoughts and personality, right? There are massive holes in the logic and continuity as well, but there's hardly any use in elaborating on those. The special effects are good but not great, the supportive cast members are literally just there as cannon fodder, and the supposedly lewd girl keeps her bra on during sex. That's a horrible rookie-mistake.",Willy's Wonderland

10,deloudelouvain,Another stinker for Nicolas Cage.,4,23 February 2021,"Nicolas Cage did it again, and by that I mean he accepted to play in a movie without paying too much attention to the script before agreeing to it. He's getting paid and that's apparently the only thing that matters to him. He isn't a bad actor, played in some really good movies, but the stinkers he played in are now taking the upper hand. In this one it must have been the easiest job ever for him as he doesn't speak a word, but it's not a good enough excuse for me to play in this movie. Willy's Wonderland is beyond dumb, and I'm normally easy going but this plot is just too dumb for words. I watched it and I got bored pretty quickly and I'm sure a lot of other people will also.",Willy's Wonderland
11,Edvis-1997,4,4,14 February 2021,"Horror movie? Yeah ,right, that's not what it is. Idea is very good and likeable but how it was fulfilled that's different subject. Acting was somewhere above average, CGI,special effects just hideous. In 2021 we're seeing something that was normal back in 80-90s. I believe that this movie had potential but it gone to cheaper way and we have what we have. I wouldn't recommend to watch this because it's neither scary or interesting to watch, instead of this film watch new ""Wrong Turn"".",Willy's Wonderland
12,A_Different_Drummer,And Now for Something Completely Different. And odd. And strange.,6,12 February 2021,"A completely off-the-wall B movie that seems to be a cross between CABIN IN THE WOODS and A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. With animatronics. Starring what used to be the top A-list actor on the planet. Who seems to have no actual dialog to deliver. And partly paid for by product placement for GM because all the vehicles in it are branded for the camera. There are a number of theories. My personal favorite is that this was actual footage shot by a reality crew following Nic Cage on a typical night out. In other words, this s**t happens to Nic on a regular basis. The other theory is that Nic got tired of being in everyone else's B movies, so he decided to make one of his own. Fun and holds the attention. Like a car accident where the victims get back into their cars and crash all over again. Could easily become a cult classic.",Willy's Wonderland
13,westsideschl,Lets Hear it For the Puppets,4,26 June 2021,"DVD lacked subtitles for the elderly, disabled, hearing impaired, and ESL viewers. Disrespectful & cheap on the part of the producers especially when audio & enunciation is poor. Add the typical sign of a cheap production - the visual introductory hook of overhead & other views of a car on a road.Story had potential (hard to miss with an abandoned scary amusement park as our central hook). The usual animatronic scary characters. Usual mix of teens to act as victims. The predictable survivor(s). The interesting scenes were of Cage doing lots of tidying up & cleaning. But, most interesting was Cage's memorable lines & dialogue - do words act louder than action?",Willy's Wonderland
14,ops-52535,its surtainly aint...,6,13 February 2021,"Russian caviar or alaskan lobster served to the feinsmaeckers of silver screen entertainment, so if youre looking for good script, intellectual dialouges, existensial human ethics, vertigizing filmatographics and senior editing management et cetera dont even try this out. and just a warning to all prone to epilepcy, there are large amounts of blinking lights that may give you the shivering hi!!because its has bad sound, lame special effects, incoherent plot, extremely bad lightsetting and unsteady camera movements, crank call musical score, and stupid children songs chiming outta silly animatronics.so this said, its all bound to become a cult classic for the gory horror nerd, even though just covered in hydraulic oil and for the rest itll become a see-saw within 15 minutes.acting is pretty operational decent from mr cage, but the rest of the cast seems like a bunch of dyslectic whimps that has to be told what to say. its allthough some nice idiopathic comedy in there somewhere, so behold when the grumpy old man gives a small recommend on this one. it would for surtain have been a buster 30 years ago, but 2021 with mr cage at the brink of retirement i can for sure guarantee there are better b-movies out there to choose.",Willy's Wonderland
15,cruise01,B horror comedy film that is cheesy and dumb.,5,22 April 2021,2.5 out of 5 stars.Willys Wonderland is a pretty bad comedy horror film about a mute Janitor (Nicolas Cage) which his car breaks down. And he takes an overnight job at Willys wonderland. Which is a kids party place with animatronics. Which he is supposed to clean up overnight. While all the animatronics comes to life. And a group of teens wanting to break in and take the place down cause it is a towns curse.Dumb plot. Dumb direction. The film is just stupid and has its fun moments. Which is the direction it is trying to aim for. Nicolas Cage never speaks in the film. Just giving that glare stare down throughout the movie. Sure he must had fun playing the character which just pokes fun at what it is trying to be.The rest of the cast is forgettable. The direction feels like a bad comedy horror film that was made in the 80s. The premise almost seems similiar to Five nights at freddys. With animatronics characters coming to life and attacking the living. The teen characters in the film were stereotypical as stupid characters. And getting killed off.If your looking for a dumb horror comedy that does not take itself seriously. This movie would be perfect for you. Sure the willy wonderlands theme song will get stuck in your head by the time the movie ends.,Willy's Wonderland
16,eddie_baggins,A bizarre and exciting premise gets lost in a dull final product,4,20 June 2021,"A fabulously over the top sounding premise that see's Five Nights at Freddy's join together with a wide eyed (and completely silent) Nicolas Cage, Willy's Wonderland would appear to be the exact type of daft and ridiculous B-grade affair we need at this moment of time but unfortunately Kevin Lewis's bland and dull horror/comedy is neither scary, funny or bonkers enough to become this years Mandy.Good for what's likely to create a few more readily used Cage memes and viral clips (here's looking at you intense Pinball session), Wonderland isn't without its moments of bizarre joys and the sight of seeing a wide-eyed Cage go toe to toe with a collection of grungy animatronics gone rogue is the exact type of goodness that makes us all love Cage, even while his sinking to the depravity's of such low-balling affairs such as this but Lewis's film never maximises any of these components as we instead get a sub-90 minute film that becomes rather tiresome long before its loony finale takes place.Viewers coming into this odd hybrid (one that lacks much in the way of genuine horror) seeking Cage shouting verbal gold or regularly getting involved in action beats will be left disappointed, firstly by the grunting Cage who does all his performing here via looks and eye movements and secondly by the fact we oddly get far more screen-time of Cage washing appliances and drinking than we do of outrageous moments as Cage's nameless drifter spends a night at the long abandoned Willy's Wonderland restaurant/play centre that harbors a dark past and even darker inhabitants.The setting of this bloody wonderland seems ripe for a video-game like run through of boss fights, frights and exploration of various areas of the facility but almost all of this lowly budgeted film takes place inside either the establishment's kitchen or dining area and by the time Cage has listened to his fourth or so song and dance number from the evil creations of Willy and then quickly dispatched a member of their squad hellbent on blood, the films rhythm is so entrenched and unsurprising you begin to quickly realize the potential of this set-up is never going to be met.With some decent imagination and some more thought about how to bring this wild premise to life (one that brings to mind a classic Simpson's episode from yesteryear), there's no reason why Wonderland couldn't of been a gloriously shlocky affair that could've bounced off the shoulders of its game leading man to become a cult classic of the modern era, instead we get a tired and lazy film with only splattering's of fun and life.Final Say -The premise for Willy's Wonderland suggests a lot of good silly fun but what we end up with is a wasted Nicolas Cage and a tiresome loop of incidents that becomes more of a chore to sit through rather than a B-grade joy.2 t-shirt changeovers out of 5.",Willy's Wonderland
17,Tweetienator,Some Potential Missed,6,26 September 2021,"Lately, Nicolas Cage's added a lot of odd, weird and bizarr entries to his line of work: Mandy, Pig, Prisoners of the Ghostland, Color Out of Space comes to mind (titles in no particular order). Willy's Wonderland does fit well into that ""breed"" of movies: the idea of Cage fighting bloodthirsty muppets is just fun. Sadly, the execution is a little uneven regarding quality. With a better production (and some more real gore, I should add) Willy's Wonderland could have been easy a new Cage classic, but as it is, it is mainly worth watching for the Cage die hard. Not too bad, not too good either, but worth a try - there are still a few fine moments waiting for you.",Willy's Wonderland

He is wonderfully over the top as he dominates the movie from start to finish.Lots of fun moments and oodles of blood/oil spilt to make it a good time for all.One of my favourite aspects of the movie is they don't explain anything about Cage's character, you can literally put your own story (the who is this guy) onto him.

24,alindsay-al,A Below Average but pretty fun film,4,25 February 2021,"With the crazy time the world has been in, sometimes we just need to watch a silly film and Willy's Wonderland fits that criteria and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drifter tricked into becoming a janitor for a former funland where he has to fight for his life.Main Character
The great Nicolas Cage plays the lead role here and he just really fits this film and shows his charismatic demeanour. He is a character that doesn't say much and through just his actions and facial expressions you get all the information that you need from his character. I mean though I will argue that maybe we could have done with even more crazy Cage here and a bit more intrigue added, I just felt like there was a bit more that could have been done here with the character.Supporting Characters
I mean the rest of the cast isn't worth anything, there are a bunch of younger actors who are here for one clear reason. I'm not gonna say what that is but I am pretty sure everybody knows and they are all bad actors and were bad here. Emily Tosta and Beth Grant play the largest supporting roles but they offer nothing and really feels like they are here for exposition sequences that are really forced and feel out of place.Story
The idea of the story is fun, seeing Nicolas Cage go against these robots in this setting is good and there are some pretty glorious fights that range to the absurd. But this film gets a bit too bogged down on its plot, it is at its best when it is Cage versus the robots but it brings in these other characters with back stories and I just didn't care and it took away from the film.Script
The script is pretty awful, the dialogue is really bad when it happens, the writers bogged down the plot too much and tried to do too much, I mean they could have done it but at least try and do it better then long exposition sequences.Style
The film looks like it was made for about a £100 but I actually thought that was part of the charm. It looks unpolished and cheap but works and makes the action scenes feel more gritty. I mean these scenes are great and had me laughing throughout and that made me enjoy the film way more then I should have, also the film has a great runtime of only 90 mins.Overall
Overall, I would say this is a below average film and it is. But I can't deny that I had some fun with this film and if you aren't a film purist and want something to laugh with and turn your mind off then I would actually say this could be worth a watch.",Willy's Wonderland

28,kirbylee70-599-526179,CAGE STYLE FUN,8,20 April 2021,"There are some movies out there that defy definition. They combine various genres into one completely different movie offering something unique and different. Nicolas Cage has made a career out of starring in these kind of films. Cage has been an actor with a tremendous talent but who's had his career rise and fall. Taxes cut his rise short and he was forced into taking movies beneath him. The thing is he never treated them as such. He always gave his best effort.Recent years have seen Cage taking on numerous action flicks while most actors his age sit back with something less strenuous. But he's also taken on roles in movies that stunned viewers. Films like MANDY and COLOR OUT OF SPACE have shown he can take a genre film and turn it on its head. He does the same here with WILLY'S WONDERLAND, a movie that seems to combine humor, horror, action and the classic western format all into one film.Cage stars as ""The Janitor"". Driving down the highway he runs over a spike strip the local police lost not long ago. The two truck driver picks him and his car up telling him he'll have it ready by morning but it will cost $1,000. Knowing he doesn't have the money, the driver sets him up with a friend named Ted Macadoo (Ric Reitz) to help him earn the fee. All he has to do is clean up the restaurant the man owns, a place called Willy's Wonderland.Willy's is no doubt influenced by Chuck E. Cheese. A family style place with games and oversized animatronic animals that at one time performed songs for the kids. The place is fairly well wrecked now and needs a good cleaning. Graffiti stains the walls, trash is on the floors and dust covers nearly everything. Macadoo shows him the cleaning closet filled with supplies and even a stack of Willy's Wonderland T-shirts he can wear while working. He also reminds him to make sure and take frequent breaks.Macadoo locks him in the building commenting to his friend the truck driver that they need to leave before they begin to hear screams. Cage changes, stocks the fridge with his bag of soda and gets to work. It isn't long before one of the animatronic creatures reveals its true nature and attacks Cage with the intent to kill. Instead Cage take it out before heading out for his first break in the night.While this is playing out young Liv (Emily Tosta) and her friends sneak out with the intent of burning down Willy's. The daughter of local Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant) she knows the history of the place. It's not good and it's not safe to be caught in Willy's. Everyone knows that. But knowing why is a whole other story. Breaking into the place before torching it to save this stranger locked in finds Liv and her friends trapped there as well. Now they look for his help between his cleaning duties and dutiful breaks.Imagine if you will a movie that combines WALKING TALL with KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE with HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER and you will know what to expect. The silent hero who comes into town and finds himself having to fix things and re-establish justice and the weird bad guys who look like children's friends all work together to make a film that is interesting and fairly funny throughout.Cage's performance here is muted. I mean that literally. I don't think he has more than a page of dialogue from start to finish here. He does have a nice scowl and no nonsense attitude towards the creatures that attack him throughout the night. We don't know where his survival skills come from but they come in handy. He also does a great job of cleaning in the process.Newcomer Tosta is convincing in her role as wronged individual seeking retribution for past injustice. What that is becomes revealed as the movie unfolds. The rest of the cast is more or less fodder for the animatronic monsters and less notable than these two.The movie isn't made to provide a platform for political speeches, it isn't about grand ideas, it is nothing more than a fun time. This is the kind of movie that was made decades ago for the drive-in circuit, a fun movie that doesn't require in depth analysis or explanation. It's just made for laughs and that's a good thing in today's world. We have enough troubles in our lives. Better to let Cage handle his problems here and let us take a gander as he does so.",Willy's Wonderland

But every now & then Cage delivers a ""Gem"" amongst the trash & this wacky flick may not be ""Mandy"" quality but it's still pretty damn good.Cage plays a drifter who gets mixed up in a hick towns curse where robotic characters come alive & murder anyone they can but they ain't met Cage yet lol & that's all you need to know about it's weird plot.""Wonderland"" is a bizarre, 80's vibe nightmare drenched in wild colours & arty cinematography with a crazy storyline & an even crazier Cage, who is have so much fun beating the crap outta cartoon character robots!!! Cage is good here in a mental role in a mental film, so it pretty much works out lol

32,kluseba,Campy fun that walks off the beaten path,7,28 June 2021,"Willy's Wonderland is an absurd, creative and surreal horror movie with a few comedic elements. The story revolves around a nameless protagonist who gets stranded in an isolated town after a car accident. Since he cannot pay for repairs, he is given the opportunity to clean up an abandoned family entertainment centre for one night to pay his debts. What initially sounds like an easy task soon becomes a fight for survival since the animatronic mascots are possessed by criminal satanists who committed suicide.This film convinces on several levels. First of all, the location of the abandoned family entertainment centre is quite sinister, intriguing and creative. The eight different mascots who turn out to be the movie's villains are also quite unique, memorable and distinctive. The light and sound effects add a lot of atmosphere to the film. The soundtrack meandering from country, folk and rock classics to creepy children's music also leaves its mark. Nicolas Cage convinces as tough protagonist who doesn't say one single word in the entire movie and delivers the goods with excellent body language and facial expressions.On the negative side, the makers of the movie didn't quite seem to know what they wanted their film to be. It's not sinister enough to be a serious horror movie. The action scenes are too simplistic to make for a convincing genre entry. The humorous elements are too shallow to be considered funny. The movie meanders from one genre to another and back again without ever being truly convincing. The story is creative upon first contact but soon follows genre tropes and ends up being very predictable. The supporting actresses and actors are lacking charisma. Emily Tosta is the lead actress next to Nicolas Cage but her skills are exchangeable and forgettable.At the end of the day, Willy's Wonderland is interesting for a party night with a couple of friends who want to discover a campy flick that walks off the beaten path. Especially fans of Nicolas Cage's more recent movies such as Mandy and Color Out of Space should appreciate this film for what it is.",Willy's Wonderland

You'd think putting Nic Cage in a movie where he doesn't speaks would be a mistake but it totally works here. It's bloody, violent and goofy all in wonderful balance. It doesn't really make sense, doesn't really try to and I really appreciate it for that. There's something to be said for a movie that knows exactly what it is and just embraces it and that's WIlly's Wonderland to a tee.",Willy's Wonderland
35,aidanratesmovies,Nicolas Cage vs. Chuck E. Cheese- What more could you want?,9,15 June 2021,"Fully committing to its absurd premise, and with yet another brilliant over the top performance from Nic Cage- Willy's Wonderland will most likely go down as an incredibly fun cult classic- similar to films like Killer Klowns From Outer Space. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes, it can be a bit ridiculous at times, and t has some struggles on telling the backstory of Willy's Wonderland itself- but its just so fun to watch. The action scenes are brutal and over the top, every scene is lit so dramatically- an incredibly forced neon vibe- and we get to see Nic Cage drink a lot of soda and play pinball so that's always fun too. The animatronics themselves are quite well done surprisingly, feeling oddly realistic in terms of design and their forced characters- considering they were made in the 90's. There is also a lot of creative use of the songs throughout the film, some classic and some incredibly annoying, but it totally fits the mood the film is going for. Honestly I didn't really care for the main girl's friends to be as big a part of the film as they were, there character were just rather bland and they served truly no purpose in the scheme of things except to make the film a bit longer. The fight scenes between Nic Cage and the animatronics were fantastic. Cage doesn't speak a single word throughout the course of the film, but you just know he's having a blast with the role at every moment. In the end, Willy's Wonderland is far from perfect, but it's very enjoyable, and may just be a horror flick I watch again with friends someday soon.My Rating: 8.5/10.",Willy's Wonderland
36,I_Ailurophile,Fantastically fun and clever,9,1 May 2021,"When I first heard about this movie I fully expected to enjoy it. And so I have. Yet this is so much more than I bargained for, or could have anticipated: 'Willy's Wonderland' is genuinely brilliant.Let's get this out of the way now: I was expecting a wild splatterfest as animatronics suddenly begin running wild, lots of blood and screams rounded out with another outrageous performance from Nicolas Cage. But if you go into 'Willy's Wonderland' expecting anything like the typical horror movie, you're going to be disappointed. 'Wonderland' takes a very different approach.Where to begin? How about the fact that Nic Cage doesn't have a single line of dialogue in the entire film, at most only uttering yells of exertion? Or that we are given no information whatsoever about his character except for the dog tags we see hanging from his rearview mirror? Clearly he has training that makes him an efficient destroyer of animatronics, but we get no further detail - and we don't need it, either.What really speaks volumes about 'Willy's Wonderland' is the flow of the narrative for the first 30 minutes: Having taken on the temporary job as a janitor, Cage's unnamed character works fastidiously to clean the attraction. He sets an alarm on his wristwatch to take very punctual breaks, during which times he meticulously cleans an old pinball machine in the break room and faithfully downs a generic ""Punch"" soda from his collection. What we get is essentially a cleaning montage - interspersed with fights that end in gruesome fatalities. When they're over, it's time to clean up, put on a fresh shirt, then get back to work.Even after those first two kills, even after Liv (Emily Tosta) and her friends show up with intent to burn Willy's to the ground, even when blood begins flowing freely, even as the climax approaches - when that alarm goes off, the fighting and cleaning stops, and another soda and round of pinball ensues. The most emotive Cage gets in the entire picture is during his great triumph at the cabinet.THAT is the sort of movie you're watching.The absolute joy of 'Willy's Wonderland' is that it doesn't take itself seriously, but it pretends that it does. Everything is portrayed with 100% deliberate deadpan delivery. I'm immediately reminded of John Carpenter's criminally underappreciated 'Ghosts of Mars' - 'Wonderland' is ridiculously over the top in every way, employing every trope and boneheaded narrative choice that it can. In another movie we'd laugh at these things and rightly point at them as detractions, but in the right hands, with sharp and pointed writing, it becomes a brazen, shameless delight.There are amusingly needless Dutch angles (one in particular with lighting that reminds me of 'Mandy,' arguably Cage's most perfect film), characters choosing to make out in the middle of a bloodbath, and an incredulously ignorant supporting character who consistently makes all the worst choices. Every bit of actual background plot, every bit of information about Willy's, is spilled out in two big chunks of dialogue by two different characters. Complicit locals, Satanic rituals, a minor ""gotcha"" ending, gratuitous lens flare, over the top shaky cam as Cage's janitor makes kills, the decidedly biting borrow of a line made famous by a well-regarded graphic novel: You name it, 'Wonderland' has got it.G. O. Parsons' writing is impeccable, absolutely matching the drily sardonic wit Carpenter demonstrated in my beloved 'Ghosts of Mars.' I love Émoi's original score, music at once atmospheric and driving that perfectly complements every scene as it plays out - and the small songs they crafted for the feature are very enjoyable, especially the titular theme that we get to hear in full during the end credits. The animatronics look great - suitably creepy, as they would be even without being monstrous murdering muppets - as do the blood and gore effects, which are just plain fun. The whole picture is crisp and clear, and Ryan Liebert's editing is exquisite.Nicolas Cage of course gets the most focus from the camera, and his understated performance is riveting. Still, everyone else is just as fine. I think special mention must be made for Jessica Graves Davis, seen here as animatronic Siren Sara. The most humanoid of the antagonists, there's a bit of Uncanny Valley going on here in her very appearance, and Davis apparently did her own stuntwork as Sara, too. Those athletics remind me of Daryl Hannah's Pris, in 'Blade Runner,' and the overall result is that she's decidedly the most creepy part of the movie.I do have to wonder how much of the budget went to securing the rights for 'Free bird.' But again: It's use is just another perfect addition to the mood of the film, and part of an ending I truly love, bringing the narrative to a deeply satisfying close.By the nature of the narrative, 'Willy's Wonderland' is going to appeal to a certain niche audience. The flavor of the narrative means it will genuinely appeal to an even more select number of viewers. It's not what you expect, but it's what we needed, and it's altogether splendid.It won't be for everyone, but I will never not sing the praises of 'Willy's Wonderland' or withhold a recommendation. It's such a great pleasure, a joy, and you're truly missing out if you don't give it a watch.",Willy's Wonderland
37,masonsaul,Crazy fun,7,16 May 2021,Willy's Wonderland is crazy fun that's really good when Nicolas Cage is on screen yet struggles when literally anything else is happening but luckily has just enough Cage madness to outweigh the bad. Nicolas Cage is perfect despite having next to no dialogue which makes up for the rest of the cast's weak performances. Kevin Lewis' direction is really good however there are too many lens flares.

38,vengeance20,Surpisingly Ace!,9,6 September 2021,"So, got around to watching this after getting it on DVD some months back & wasn't too sure how this film would be given its a comedy horror with Nic Cage. The film was suprisingly good after watching.The film follows a man known as ""The Janitor"" who finds himself cleaning up the infamous restruant ""Willy's Wonderland"" which has a dark past in the deaths of kids, in exchange for getting his car fixed. But the Mascot Animatronics in the infamous restruant come to life & a group of other teens who want the place burnt to the ground get caught up in the carnage with The Janitor.I found the film to be pretty ace. At first I thought the film was pretty dumb & would continue to be dumb. But as it progressed, I started to really enjoy seeing Nic Cage as a mute beating the living crap out of the anamatronics. Never mind the gore & violence on screen. It was spectacular. The film was short at 80 minutes & fairly well paced.Overall, its a wild gore fested ride with Nic Cage. 9/10.",Willy's Wonderland

40,omendata,"Unbelievable, miserable, disgraceful, excruciatingly tedious - Yip Its a REAL stinker!",2,18 June 2021,"Now I know Nic Cage has been choosing a lot of bad roles since his US tax problems to help pay the bills but perhaps he is choosing movies based on how outlandish they are and perhaps, just perhaps he choose this one because he does not have to speak a single word in the movie (Yes is this a first?), so perhaps this attracted him to it? Along with the out there premise? I always like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt as Nic is indeed a very individual and unique actor, unlike any of the usual Hollywood clones - Then again, perhaps it was because he only had to take on 30 mins worth of acting (If you can call cleaning toilets and smashing up animatronic puppets acting?). Who knows but he is as mad as a hatter, that no on can disagree with and which adds to his allure as an actor but this choice was not a good one and that is putting it mildly!Nic can still act and pull in the crowds as he has always been a bit of a loner and refuses to be stereotyped with recent movies like Mandy and the excellent Colour Out Of Space but oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, what was he thinking when he took this utter stinker on is anyone's guess. He probably read the script; which in his case would have been a blank page so am sure this would have enticed him and who wouldn't to pick up £50,000 for 30 mins of no acting required, just smashing up some puppets and cleaning a toilet bowl or two.I must admit as a sufferer of OCD i was most impressed with his excellent attention to detail, cleaning the mirrors and graffiti perfectly with a spectacularly clean result most OCD cleaners would be proud of - Almost worth an extra star! Pardon my sarcasm but that is all I can find to complement in the movie so am clutching a bit at straws here to review this celluloid calamity with any positivity!The story is completely bonkers, unconvincing even as an experimental project with terrible acting from everyone concerned; even the animatronic puppets were terrible, zero and i mean zero characterization, no scares, no real gore or decent kills and goodness me, it just dragged on and on.When you start to check the Media Player timeline to see how long it has to go; and I always watch every movie to the end; part of my movie watching OCD but also to give every film a fair shake but this is one of the ones I really wished I could have switched off within 20 minutes.For once the 1 and 2 star reviews are spot on with this one, it is truly one to be wiped off the bottom of your shoe with extreme prejudice!",Willy's Wonderland

42,Stephen_A_Abell,It's Your Birthday... Here's Your Present...,8,18 June 2021,"Welcome fellow movie fans to my review of Willy's Wonderland 2021The Story gets a 1.25 out of 2:
Okay, for Willy's Wonderland, you may consider leaving your brain at the door. But don't forget your check-stub as you don't want to check out with somebody else's noggin. There's not much of a story and only just a tad more backstory in this film.Once upon a time, there lived a child molester by the name of Willy. For some reason, the local authorities believed it was a capital idea to allow Willy to open up a family restaurant; and hire his child molesting cronies as table-service and entertainers. I mean, what could possibly go wrong(?) When the inevitable happens, and the cops finally move in on Willy's they find he and his cohorts have committed ritual suicide. During this occult practice, their souls moved into the mechanical automatons of Willy, the Weasel and his band. Sadly the townsfolk thought the nightmare had ended. Until Willy and his band of miscreants began to make house-calls, then they realised the nightmare had only just begun. So, to save themselves, they entered an unholy pact with the evil animatronics and offered them yearly sacrifices.Enter this year's sacrifice, the man with no name, no background, and no history. What you will discover about him is his OCD for energy drinks, his pride in his work, and his joy at kicking demonic arses. And that is about it, let the fun and games begin.And in many ways, the lack of a substantial story works well to amp up your enjoyment level. You're not relating to the anti-hero because he's a blank entity. However, it is impressive when he opens up his can of whup-ass on the evildoers.The Direction and Pace receive a 3.5 out of 4:
The insubstantial script additionally allows the director, Kevin Lewis, to go to town with the eye-candy filming. There is nothing I can fault with Lewis's techniques in this film. He can even make the opening of a can appear captivating and cool: A close-up of a hand gripping the can; zoom out as a finger pulls the can's ring; keep zooming out until you have a gratifying full-face side-on profile of Cage taking a long and deep gulp of his energy drink. To gain greater effect, Lewis uses a heavy sepia filter to produce an early summer evening. I'm not a keen fan of filters as too many directors use grey to try and add an atmosphere of gloom and doom. However, in this sequence, it works wonderfully.Lewis is equally adept at keeping the pace to a steady gallop, though, now and again, he drops to a trot. He achieves this with quick cuts, striking camera angles, lighting, and soundtrack. When he wants to create tension or a more palpable ambience, he slows the change between cuts. One scene that stands out is when Liv tells him of the towns pact. Once she and the flashback have finished, Lewis produces a perfect shot of indifference. Cage is finishing off the polishing of the kitchen's metal meat table. It's a prolonged clip, shot from the height of Cage's head. The angle allows you to note how dedicated he is to getting the table spotless. While in the background, Liv shrugs her shoulders and looks at her friends. Brilliant.Lamentably, not every scene is so delightful. There are times when Cage tussles with the gorilla that make the film a tad silly. These are when we see Cage at the end of the gorilla's grasp. The shots are filmed from the gorilla's chest cam. They're ridiculous and cringe-inducing. Fortunately, it's a fight sequence meaning the cutting is swift, and the horrid shots are soon gone.Sadly, I realised that because Willy Wonderland is uniquely and well filmed, these little hiccoughs are notable. Worse still, they are awfully memorable.At this point, I will also give respect to Emoi for such a good and oftentimes, spooky soundtrack. For this style of filmmaking, you need a soundtrack that will emphasise, support, and strengthen the film. And this does.The Performances get a 1.25 out of 2:
Not too much to say here, as the film is pretty much a slug-fest. Nicholas Cage is okay as The Janitor (the man with no name). He adds lots of delightful quirks to his performance. I particularly enjoyed his pinball boogie. Though, at times, I thought his character was lacking.Beth Grant delivers a convincing performance as the hard-nosed Sheriff Lund.And, Emily Tosta produces a similarly agreeable performance with her character Liv.But, for me, the stand out actor was Chris Warner as Jed Love, the garage owner. He possesses a screen presence seldom seen these days. When he's on camera, you know he's there, even if he's standing in stony silence. I found myself wondering, would the film be better had Warner secured the Janitor role(?)And my Enjoyment level hits a 1.5 out of 2:
The terrific thing about having next to no story and a lead character with no background is there are fewer holes you're required to fill in. You can't say the janitor would act in a certain way because we're given no character traits. We don't know what type of person he is, so he could do anything. You can't detect the inconsistencies in timelines, plot, or structures. All of which allowed me to sit back, relax, and enjoy the hell out of this film. Thank you, Kevin Lewis, G O Parsons, Emoi, and the entire cast. It was my pleasure.These ratings give Willy's Wonderland a 7.5 out of 10:
So, if you've read down this far, you must have an inkling as to what I'm about the write. Go on, give yourself a treat and take a trip to Willy's Wonderland. It's worth at least one visit, and who knows, you may become a fan and decide to visit again.Now I better go and retrieve my brain from the cloakroom. I hope the girl on the desk doesn't mix me up with that woman from the other town. Now that was a nightmare.Willy's is closed for refurbishment, so please take a minute to review my Absolute Horror list and see where I ranked that wonderful establishment.Take Care and Stay Well and Get Inoculated.",Willy's Wonderland
43,IonicBreezeMachine,Just enough moments of fun insanity to overcome a very anemic premise and repetitive structure.,6,1 May 2021,"When a drifter (Nicolas Cage) blows out all four tires in the remote town of Hayesville, he finds himself without the means to have the tires replaced and the car repaired. The mechanic works out a deal with a drifter where if he can spend the night cleaning the dilapidated children's play place, Willy's Wonderland, he'll have the car repaired and ready the next morning. The drifter agrees and soon finds his job offer didn't mention that homicidally insane animatronics that inhabit Willy's. Meanwhile Liv (Emily Tosta), the teenage daughter of the town's sheriff organizes herself and her friends to rescue the drifter and burn down Willy's knowing the secret behind the murderous animatronics.Willy's Wonderland is an expansion of the 1 minute short by writer G. O. Parsons titled Wally's Wonderland. Parson's was dissatisfied with the original short and sought to iron out the flaws by making a feature film and putting it on the Blood List where it managed to gain traction and managed to hook Nicolas Cage for the lead who was quite passionate about the project even going so far as to suggest the species of the various animatronics (notably requesting more reptilian creatures). When the trailer was released it found itself compared to the video game Five Nights at Freddy's not unlike an earlier animatronic based horror film, The Banana Splits Movie. Both director Kevin Lewis and writer Parsons deny any influence from Five Nights at Freddy's, but the fact that a legal team apparently analyzed the script for any possible copyright infringement shows that was probably a major factor in the movie. In terms of movies that the internet has compared to Five Nights at Freddy's, Willy's Wonderland is much better than The Banana Splits Movie in both craft, skill, and passion, but even at a rather brisk 80 minute runtime (not including credit) the film does feel rather stretch with material that does fall into the trap of repetition.One of the stranger parts of Willy's Wonderland is Nicolas Cage's mute protagonist. From the first time we see Cage's nameless drifter he doesn't utter a single syllable and conveys everything in his character through facial expressions and body language. It's definitely an interesting choice giving how well known Cage is for both his distinctive voice and his trademark yells and rants that have made up many a YouTube supercut, but as a performance it's definitely a good one. The performance is definitely a throwback to ""men of action"" protagonists who say little if anything archetypes. As far as archetypical characters go while Cage's drifter is stone faced and stoic for much of the running time, he does get a good chance to cut loose especially when we see him drinking energy drinks and playing pinball. There's a very surreal humor at play with Cage's stoicism where he takes getting attacked by killer animatronics in stride yet remains dead set on fulfilling his agreement to clean up the place.The animatronics are actually really well done. While some animatronics hide the ""suit"" illusions better than others, the animatronics are well choregraphed and for the most part convey what we'd expect killer Chuck-E-Cheese characters to sound and look like. The animatronics aren't all that scary past the 25 minute mark, but in the initial build up there are some scenes that did get some solid jumps out of me while I was watching them. Director Kevin Lewis does a good job of establishing Willy's Wonderland and the animatronics and it feels like a fully fleshed out character in and of itself with it glowing mazes, creepy songs, and neon lighting giving the film a strong sense of style and identity.The movie's main drawback is that it runs into issues of keeping the novelty of the concept fresh. After the second Animatronic attack sequence, there's a noticeable Rhythm at play with the drifter cleaning, the animatronic taunts him, drifter fights the animatronic, drifter cleans again, drifter goes on break to play pinball, repeat. The movie never really breaks from that formula and the only thing it can do is have it take place in different locations in Willy's Wonderland, and it's not big enough considering how many animatronics there are. The movie adds in Liv and her friends who are all basically slasher movie characters (final girl, loud mouth, promiscuous one, nerd, etc.) and they've pretty obviously been inserted to rack up the body count because when they do come into Willy's Wonderland, the drifter pays them almost no mind as he continues mindlessly cleaning and doing his pinball breaks even when the slaughter happens. There's definitely a dark humor at play as he'll continue going on breaks even in the middle of a showdown with another animatronic, but like the early section it pretty quickly falls into formula and the pattern becomes predictable.With that said the movie does keep just enough surprises to keep it from becoming dull (including a sequence set to ""Head Shoulders Knees & Toes"" that was gleefully insane, and the explanation of what's going on and how Willy's Wonderland came to be shows the makers of this movie aren't taking it seriously and are just trying to have fun with the premise. Luckily most of that fun is experienced by the audience and there's enough bizarre ""What the f---!?"" moments that I was never bored. I don't think the film reaches the levels of gleeful insanity it wants to but it gives a good try and you can tell it's giving a good try. If this had been a 30 minute segment of a horror anthology film or a segment on the Creepshow TV series I'd probably be giving this a better review than I am. I don't want to sound like I'm Damning with faint praise because I'm not, I really did enjoy most of this movie. And I think if you give it a rental, you will too.Willy's Wonderland takes a gleefully insane premise and delivers it with passion and energy to spare. While the film does settle into a very noticeable rhythm at certain points, the filmmakers sprinkle in just enough to build upon set pieces and keep the film moving with fun shock and spatter moments and an offbeat sense of humor. Nicolas Cage still manages to give a good performance despite playing a mute character and there's a sense of passion and drive in the movie that makes it enjoyably crazy.",Willy's Wonderland
44,jeremycrimsonfox,Not Meant To Be Taken Seriously,8,14 April 2021,"Willy's Wonderland may have flaws, but I am liking this over The Banana Splits Movie (a movie from two years ago that also tried to make money off the killer animatronic craze that Five Nights At Freddy's sparked). It is not meant to be taken seriously, as it starts Nicolas Cage as a drifter who finds himself stranded in a Nevada town when his car breaks down after running over a spike strip that looks like a police officer was too negligent to pick up after use. To pay the repairs, he takes an offer to be a janitor for the night at Willy's Wonderland, a Chuck E. Cheese rip-off. However, like in the games it is inspired by, the animatronics of WIlly Weasel and friends come to life to kill. However, the eight animatronics have one problem that Freddy Fazbear and company never had to face: the drifter (now known as The Janitor), a fresh victim, being able to fight back.Basically, this film, despite it flawed characters and the fact it's only 90 minutes long, does not take itself seriously with how it needs to be done. The film plays it straight despite how silly and cliché the plot is, but in the end, its ridiculousness is its strong point, and Nicolas Cage does a good job playing a guy who basically drinks soda, plays a mean game of pinball, and tearing animatronics apart with his bare hands.",Willy's Wonderland
45,meddlecore,"Nicholas Cage Cleans Toilets, Plays Pinball & Goes Beast Mode On A Bunch Of Demonic Electronics...",3,18 October 2021,"I am of the camp that Willy's Wonderland is a s*** film.The basic premise of the film is that a cabal of occult murderer's committed mass suicide when the chuck-e-cheese style restaurant- they were running as a murder nest- was raided by the police.They all drank the kool aid together in a ritual designed to transfer their souls into the animatonic robots in the restaurant...which subsequently began feeding on the local townsfolk...until they made a deal to supply them with people to satiate their needs.To ensare random passersby, the local sheriff leaves a spike strip on the road, so unsuspecting drivers hit it and become stranded in their town.After which they are given an ultimatum to try and ""clean up"" Willy's Wonderland in exchange for getting their car fixed (or be sol).Enter Nicholas Cage- who's the rugged silent type, in this picture.The remainder of the film is literally just him cleaning things up, playing pinball, and going beast mode on these demonic electronics.There is a sidestory that focuses on the daughter of the sheriff, who tried to help this silent, but effective man, in his bid to rid the town of their murder problem.But it goes nowhere, and is more or less pointless, in the end.The main problem with this film is...that 2019 saw the release of a very similar film called The Banana Splits Movie...where a group of kids- and their mom- have to battle a bunch of animatronic furries gone haywire.Not only is incredibly similar...it's also vastly superior.Because this film has virtually no story, whatsoever.Everything I described above is detailed in a backstory-sequence in the film, that runs for about 2 minutes...tops.The rest is just as the title explains: cleaning, gaming, and killing...(in that order...over and over...).And that's literally all that happens.Which may have sufficed...but even the kills are, meh.I'm genuinely curious...whether they are trying to fashion Nicholas Cage as the next Charles Bronson or something?Cause I'm not buying it.This wasn't entertaining enough for me to say it is worthwhile.Do yourself a favour and watch The Banana Splits Movie instead.It's better in every conceivable facet.This sucks.Period.2.5 out of 10.",Willy's Wonderland

47,HabibieHakim123,Piece Of Trash,2,23 February 2021,"""No wonder why Nicolas Cage want to play in this movie, it's because he doesn't have to say anything even a single word and i think that was a really bad decision to make at this character, Cage perfomance is boring, the supporting actor and actress is awful too, i hate the cinematography, sometimes the camera work is like a freaking earthquake, ridiculous story, the only good things in this movie is the ripped off five night's at freddy robot and the teenagers even though all of them perfomance is terrible, but if there is no them this movie could be even worse, so many weird things but i think they doing pretty good job at the robot like i said before, i like the design, i like how they walk but that doesn't help anything, that just one of the two good things in this movie besides that it's a piece of trash, so far Willy's Wonderland is probably the worst movie i've ever watch, i highly don't recommended""",Willy's Wonderland
48,kjproulx,If you know what to expect you'll have fun,6,13 May 2021,"It's hard to dive into a detailed review of a film like Willy's Wonderland. It's the kind of film that's trying to do one thing and one thing alone; Entertain people. If I don't end up praising the film for anything else, that's okay. Willy's Wonderland is a straight-up B-Movie and uses a heavy grindhouse feel to tell its story. Am I going to recommend this one to mainstream audiences? Absolutely not, but if you know what to expect, I think you'll have a blast watching it as I did. There's nothing here but the novelty, but here's why it works.Right off the bat, something felt off about this film. It opens with a very drab look and Nicolas Cage is revealed as the stoic cool guy (which is done incredibly over the top). Willy's Wonderland is an old arcade/birthday party place that has been closed down, due to the fact that the mechanical robots inside all come to life and murder people. Nicolas Cage's character's car breaks down and the mechanic tells him he can get it fixed for free if he cleans this building and makes it ready to reopen. Spending a night in Willy's Wonderland as his car is being fixed, this movie is strictly a film about a Janitor cleaning rooms and killing robots. When you look at it like that, it really works, but if you're looking for something note-worthy, you need to look elsewhere.It's no denying that Nicolas Cage likes to have fun with the roles he chooses. He used to be a very solid dramatic actor, but the craziness of his performances has been there since the beginning as well. This is why I found the choice to make his character mute to be very surprising. Not having one single line throughout the entire film was a bold move, but it made it that much more enjoyable honestly. His facial expressions and the fact that he just really loves soda is enough to know that he means business and has no fear. If that sounds dumb and ridiculous, that's because it is, but it also works.As I said, if you go into this film looking for anything else other than Nicolas Cage fighting robots, you're going to be let down. With that said, the film also gets very repetitive along the way. Once you realize just how many of these robots there are, I found myself counting until he was done. This took away from the little tension (or lack thereof) there was. It's an enjoyable movie that begins to feel its length on multiple occasions.In the end, Willy's Wonderland promises Cage fighting robots and it delivers. This is also G. O. Parsons' very first feature film as a writer and this might sound crazy, but I hope he gets the chance to write another film. I think his wacky ideas could lead to something great one day. Now available on-demand, Willy's Wonderland realistically will likely be hated by many viewers, but I had quite a bit of fun watching it. Take that statement however you like, but if you know, you know. That's about the highest praise I can give this film.",Willy's Wonderland
49,kuarinofu,It is what it is,6,21 February 2021,"The trailer perfectly represents the film. It's a relatively short mindless b-movie that simultaneously acts as a testosterone vehicle for Nicolas Cage.It is done mostly well, rarely feels too cheesy although it gets a little repetitive by the end, still comes off as OK entertainment.It looks good, the scenes are well-shot, even some of the dialogue is somewhat clever.I know this may sound weird, but I wish it was just a little more violent and less restricted.Other than that, there's little to complain about. You know what you are getting into, and the creators actually deliver.",Willy's Wonderland
50,raybennetthays,It was great,10,13 June 2021,"Nicolas Cage is awesome, I love the guy, he made the right choice being in this, his crazy performance was awesome to see.There was also a very good supporting performance from actor Emily Tosta as Liv, one of the only characters other than Nicolas Cage that I cared about.And Nicolas Cage destroying animatronics?

51,apryla-58795,This guy! He got paid to say nothing!,3,17 July 2021,"I've tried to come up with a review but I can't even with this. All I have is questions. I would have loved to have been in this pitch meeting. How did they deliver it with a straight face? Nic has become like Eric Roberts and Bruce Willis...acting in anything and everything. It's sad that he has become a joke. I know he's pry laughing all the way to the bank but why doesn't he stop for a second and reevaluate
his life choices? If he did so he could choose to act in films with some credibility behind them rather than going all in on the crazy simply because he just needs money to fund his inability to control his spending and his poor choices of life partners (why he always gotta marry these trifflin' women? Can't he just partner up without putting himself in a situation where he has to pay out to get rid of them?!) NIC! If you're reading this STOP GETTING MARRIED!!The reason I didn't give this zero stars is because believe it or not I have seen worse. This one at least plays upon childhood fears. Animatronic characters are super creepy in general. Nic Cage acts in garbage but he has better acting not saying anything at all than some actors who have lines throughout an entire movie. Even still avoid this - but if you must give it a go at least you've been warned. I guess if you are under the influence of something this could be more interesting otherwise you'll just scratch your head the whole time saying ""What in the world?!""",Willy's Wonderland

54,Stanlee107,Nobody can keep Nicolas in a cage!,7,19 February 2021,This is what I imagine if you combine the chain restaurant chuck n cheese and video games 5 nights at Freddie's! This dark comedy film is as unexpected as not hearing Nicholas Cage utter a single word throughout this film. I supposed that is one of the joke at the viewer's expense like you would find in a sitcom. I was willing for him to Cage out with an ott speech but all we get is him grunting and kicking robot butt. On the side note he is a domestic god & that injects some dark humour before the action scenes. Kudos to the writers. This is a film that gets the right Nicholas Cage's performance unlike the appalling Wicker man one.It manages to capture the dark humour I last saw in the Babysitter & Babysitter 2. This film allows the viewer to watch it without you requiring much brain power. The teenagers are very cliched so are the antagonists whose origin story for the killer robots is purposely dark & stupid. The ending is very predictable & very tongue and cheek but I did enjoy it.,Willy's Wonderland
55,trinaboice,C for Cult,5,12 February 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
We all think the Country Bear Jamboree at Disneyland is charming and creepy at the same time, right? Willy's Wonderland is the Country Bear Jamboree on evil steroids. If you're a cult fan of ""Cage Rage"", you'll get a laugh out of this comedy/horror movie where Nicolas Cage kicks animatronic butt with a mop and dances, all without ever saying a single word. If that sounds like a terrible way to spend your time, skip this one.Screen Media launches this quirky horror film directed by Kevin Lewis. It's about a quiet loner (Nicolas Cage) who finds himself stranded in a remote town when his car breaks down. Unable to pay for the repairs he needs, he agrees to spend the night cleaning Willy's Wonderland, an abandoned family fun center. But this wonderland has a dark secret that this ""Janitor"" is about to discover. He soon finds himself locked in an epic battle with possessed animatronic mascots that roam the halls. To survive, he must fight his way through each of them.The first-time screenwriter, G. O. Parsons, liked the idea of a simple story. In a press release, he stated, ""I didn't plan on it being a major motion picture."" He was a struggling actor and a friend urged him to write a screenplay. He admits he has a love of watching breaking robots. When the screenplay wasn't immediately picked up, he utilized an Indiegogo campaign and as soon as it was announced that Nicolas Cage would star in the film, the money flowed. Well, it's still a low-budget movie at $5 million dollars, but enough to bring this wacky concept to the Big Screen....or your small TV screen in the case of this Video On Demand release.THINGS I LIKED:
The director stated that Nicolas cage is his own genre. Agreed! I've always liked Nicolas Cage, even though my kids make fun of him. He definitely has a cult following and that's who this film is for. About the script for this movie, he said, ""I thought it was original and absurd and I like things that are absurd. I found it hilarious and potentially terrifying. I don't get opportunities to act with giant stuffed ostriches or alligators or turtles or weasels. So I thought that would be a lot of fun."" His character never says a word during the entire film. He said he got his inspiration from other actors who never spoke in movies, like Harpo Max and Buster Keaton. This Nicolas Cage's 8th horror movie.
The film was shot in only 20 days and finished right before the pandemic hit the United States.
The animatronic suits were designed by Ken Hall. The movie had to be shot chronologically because the suits couldn't be used again after Nicolas Cage had his way with them.
With so much crazy in front of the lens, sometimes director Lewis would be tempted to set up a vertiginous canted-angle camera shot, a so-called Dutch angle. ""And we'd think, Gosh, is it too much?"" he recalls. ""And then I'd think: You know what? This is Nic Cage beating up an animatronic weasel. No. Nothing's too much.""
The cast includes Emily Tosta, Caylee Cowan, Terayle Hill, Grant Cramer, David Sheftell, Ric Reitz, and a lot of voice talent to bring the creepy animatronics to life.
I thought Beth Grant did a great job as a psycho sheriff.
Thankfully, the film doesn't take itself seriously. For example, there's a King Kong moment where an alligator gets its jaw cracked open by none other than good 'ole Nic Cage. If you go into the movie knowing it's going to be a classic B-level horror film from the '80s, you might have fun. Remember, this movie isn't for everyone's taste.
Watching the trashed facility get cleaned by a persistent Nicolas Cage was somehow therapeutic.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There's a LOT of exposition at the 40-minute mark that tries to make sense of the ridiculous plot. Fifteen minutes later, there's another long exposition scene.
The director loves to aim the camera at the actors' boots.
Cliched, one-dimensional characters.
I was disappointed that the fight scenes weren't very creative. It's pretty straight-forward brute violence.
The teens are supposed to be terrified by the location, but then two of them decide to ""go at it"" amongst the horror. Dumbest horror movie characters ever.
Some of the acting is really bad.
This type of movie is really not my cup of tea.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is NOT a movie you want your kids to see.
Lots of violence with blood splatters and gore
Profanity and F-bombs
A couple of teenagers go at it. You see lots of movement and hear noises.

Then years later he did Mandy (2018) hey wanna film like this but it's Nicolas Cage, Raging killing cults is miles better then this movie here, then Kill Chain I enjoyed then you got this worst crap film that everyone enjoyed??? I thought this movie was nothing to me look I understand Nicholas Cage is mystery character he is quiet drifter all that I totally understand but besides that this is a campy movie it takes place entire film. Nicholas Cage did good in movie nothing to say about his performance, but I thought cute hot Mexican girl Emily Tosta she did fine in movie I liked her character she wanted to burn down abandoned family entertainment center I like girls with tough personality character but she can't hold this movie up sadly to say, I hated this kids song it's playing all over again, I thought other characters were annoying other kids and Sheriff hated that I love silly horror like this movie but I am not into animatronic mascots horror type because Ithink it's silly but I enjoyed Nicholas cage beating crap of those animatronic mascots I really do it was funny, but their wasn't enough of that action I wish their was guns in involved so Nicholas Cage and Emily Tosta shooting blowing those evil animatronic mascots up I wanted something more out of it but it wasn't I like I hate campy movies where movie it takes one place nah problem is movie is too generic and it felt cheap, keeping Nicholas Cage quiet was just weird director wanted film to be like Pale Rider meets Freddy Five Nights cool idea but I don't know movie wasn't for me. Film was Boring, slow and changed just enough to avoid copyright to Freddy Five Nights I am surprised that they haven't sue director or writers of this movie for copyrighting that idea for this movie expect it's not called Freddy Five Nights. I thought most stupidest idea of movie is that group of people that were owners that were satanic ritual to transfer their souls into the animatronic characters witch I thought it was stupidest idea ever dumbest idea how about someone made those animatronic were built to kill people designed animatronic that's idea I prefer, and it's hard movie to sit threw never liked it expect when Nicholas Cage kills animatronic that's was about it but rest of movie sucked I highly not recommded seeing it unless you risk it and see it for free I don't know why people liked this movie it's wasn't for me it sucked.",Willy's Wonderland
59,Cinemaniac1984,That was one weird movie.,5,24 July 2021,"I thought Nicolas Cage was a legend in my early teens. The Rock (1996), Con Air and Face/Off (both 1997) were his best movies. He deserved his Best Actor Academy Award for Leaving Las Vegas (1995). The rest of movies were certainly hit and miss while he was a box office draw. And then, his star power diminished and he's been reduced to eccentric and run of the mill movies. Willy's Wonderland is another weird movie that he has appeared in.Nicolas Cage plays a quiet drifter (credited as The Janitor who doesn't say a word throughout the entire movie) who is driving through town when he runs over an abandoned set of tire spikes. He gets help from a mechanic named Jed (Chris Love) who drives him into town to get his car repaired. After being unable to pay for repairs, The Janitor strikes a deal to act as the night shift janitor of an abandoned family entertainment center named Willy's Wonderland which has been condemned following several horrific incidents. The owner of Willy's Wonderland Tex Macadoo (Ric Reitz) also agrees to have The Janitor work at Willy's Wonderland. The Janitor is attacked by several homicidal animatronics but The Janitor is able to brutally fight them off and destroy them. At the same time, a group of teenagers including Liv (Emily Tosta) her friends sneak in at night to set the exterior of the building on fire however once she sees The Janitor in the building, she tries to get in the building to get him out along with her friends who reluctantly join in. The Janitor and Liv and her friends find themselves fighting for their lives against the animatronics who have come to life and murder the unwelcome guests of the building. It is revealed later that Willy's Wonderland has been condemned after the original owner and the employees were serial killers who would murder the families who held parties at the beloved venue. To evade arrest, the group committed mass suicide but not before committing a satanic ritual of transferring their spirits to the animatronics. A deal is struck with the animatronics and town Sherriff (Beth Grant) and the owner Tex that the town would be left alone as long as they would give them any drifters every now and then to satisfy their bloodlust.Nicolas Cage's The Drifter is one bizarre character. As mentioned before, he doesn't say a single word throughout the entire movie. His prized possession is a dark blue Chevrolet Camaro, he routinely consumes energy drinks, he plays one of the abandoned pinball machines, and he performs first aid on himself with duct tape after being attacked by the possessed animatronics.Nicolas Cage was the main reason why I thought I'd check this movie out, and I enjoyed all the scenes he was in. Without him and if the movie just focused on Liv and her friends, I would have not bothered with the movie. I don't think I'd be merciful with completing a review.Willy's Wonderland was one weird movie. It wasn't that good, but it wasn't that bad either. It's gruesome, it's crazy, and it's certainly not for everyone. It was a movie that passed the time.5/10.",Willy's Wonderland

Combined with an end that didn't really end just let me unsatisfied. The only reason I watched it all was for Cage, so if your a die hard fan I recommend. If not you will not enjoy this movie. I wish I had not watched it but oh well. Surprisingly Cage is hotter the less he says, not sure if that is a compliment or not. I did not like the girl, she was hot up until the end when she drinks the Punch soda and a huge line of drool hung off her lip. Not to mention, what was Cage going to do with her in the end?

62,TwistedContent,Self-Aware and Gleeful B-Movie Awesomeness with just the right Man at the front,6,13 February 2021,"""Willy's Wonderland"" is the antidote we currently need and deserve, and I'm endlessly happy just seeing Cage in this very self-aware offering from director Kevin Lewis and writer G. O. Parsons. Nobody could conclude that ""Willy's Wonderland"" is a great, compelling, substantial, or original film, but ain't no mistaking what kind beast this is. An 80's-throwback-trash-splatter-B horror in the best traditions, with Cage sailing this ship with unbeatable charisma and content. It's the kind of cheese fest that just begs to be loved.A Quiet (absolutely literally) and mysterious drifter wounds up crashed by a small town, where the locals trick him into a janitorial gig at the condemned ""Willy's Wonderland"". In the empty family dinner parlor with huge animatronic dolls as the entertainers, the drifter starts his mundane mission that soon becomes a battle of survival against satanic fluffy beings. How can you not be interested in Nicolas Cage fighting animatronic animals with mops, toilet plungers, and more... Doing it all in visceral, all-out fashion. Meanwhile, the thin backstory reveals, as the rest of the characters, the typical ones, also are on a mission to destroy the evils of Willy. The core idea is essentially ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" and the backstory is much the same as Chucky's from ""Child's Play"". These elements are mashed in ""dead by dawn"" scenario, and we got ourselves an adventure. It is the drifter, who's the most interesting and gimmicky character, although many teases about him, and more, are left unfinished. It's rather impressive though, Cage gave an awesome performance without ever saying a single word.It's a film hinging on a singular idea & the abilities of Nicolas Cage, but being aware that helps a great deal, because there is a sense of glee and fun throughout, it is all weird and wacky, violent and colorful. The space is limited, Cage is wordless, and yet filmmakers manage to fill the runtime consistently, though originality, in the end, is not one of the underlined qualities of ""Willy's Wonderland"". Fight sequences can be repetitive, and quite obscured, but for a slasher-type, it's no different than most, in regards of flow. Even though it is unmistakably a real B, perhaps at times even C movie, the visual panache pleasantly surprised me, I was never bored. There are plenty of fun songs in the package as well, and I have very conflicting feelings about the inclusion of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"" near the end. Must have cost them most of the budget... Conflicting feelings, because it is the ending song of one of my favorite horror movies of all time, ""The Devil's Rejects"". Felt like a steal.The very fact that we now have a no-frills B horror comedy where Nicolas Cage goes through bloody battles with huge fluffy animatronic creatures, is amazing. A slasher that delivers the expected, with a side of mmm cheese sauce. Cage is on the right path, and I'm always legitimately happy to see him work, he's the Man and can make my day. Thank You. I'd also suggest not wasting your time and hating, if B horror is not your jam, ""Willy's Wonderland"" is balls-to-the-wall exactly that. My rating: 6/10.",Willy's Wonderland

65,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,7,28 April 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.Spiritual ""Just For Men"" beard dye spokesman, Nicolas Cage has wandered into another bizarre movie. His days of making quality films such as Leaving Las Vegas and National Treasure are long behind him. I counted at least four Production companies that pooled their funds to finance this; never a good sign. I like Cage, have always liked him - don't like all his movies, but overall, I find him entertaining and he's good in this ridiculous film as well. The decision to have his character say literally nothing - not one word - the whole movie is an odd one. It didn't ruin the experience, but part of Cage's charm is his manic delivery, oh well.Make no mistake, he's manic in this film about fighting Chuck E. Cheese type mechanical animals. Substituting dialog and any character development (there is none at all, we learn nothing about The Janitor's story), is an addiction to a caffeinated soda called Punch. If you're old enough, you'll remember a similar product called Jolt from the 80's, a decade in which this movie is clearly inspired. It was removed from the market for all the reasons you can imagine. The soda gimmick is odd. The pinball playing is odd. Setting a watch timer to know when to drink it is...odd.Of course, when you have possessed animatronics you need to have people to ""off"" and teens have been historically the best at that skill in slashers. No different here. The Final Girl, and her friends show up to Willy's intent on burning it to the ground. If you're a horror fan, you'll be annoyed knowing that the group is only in the movie for their demise so all the jabbering they do is meaningless...just get on with it! Do something dumb and end it already!Of course, they all end up in the place and - of course - they all end up as expected (except Final Girl, of course). Another reason we need the gang is so somebody can dump a massive amount exposition, which Final Girl does in a lengthy speech about Willy's and why it's out of business. Cage's ""The Janitor"" just stands there, seemingly annoyed, asks no questions and that makes no sense to me. Even more, he doesn't even really give any indication that he's listening or cares. He's there to clean. Period. Oh, and to kill the creatures.Let's talk about the Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant). Was it me or was her performance absolutely horrible? Miscast, misdirected, mis-something, I can't put my finger on it, but it was noticeably bad. I don't want to say it was her advanced years, but perhaps. I didn't like her character and the fact she rescued Final Girl from Wally's when she was an infant was ridiculous...her demise was fun. She also has an exposition dump scene where we learn that The Janitor was supposed to be a human sacrifice.I did want to mention that The Janitor's ability at cleaning, unbelievably quickly, is impressive. At one point he turns the restroom (which looked almost like the one in Trainspotting), into a sparkling jewel. As a type-A clean freak myself, I found the scrubbing almost soothing and when he ends up in battle with a mechanical great ape and destroys all his hard work with oil splatter (or whatever the black goo was in the creatures), breaking mirrors...I felt that.This is a good enough film and if you're a horror fan or a fan of 80's style slashers, this will fit the bill.Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",Willy's Wonderland

67,fciocca,"Interesting and funny concept with ton of potential, but bad developed with a chaotic plot that leads nowhere",5,16 March 2021,"This could have been a great movie. It is clearly a parody and at the beginning I was hooked. Nicholas Cage portrayed this voiceless janitor fighting animatronics. I mean, what else do you want? Action sequences are all over the top, but this is exactly what I was expecting from a movie like this. It is a decent choice if you want to just have fun, with some meaningless violence and nonsense. It is basically a meme.What I did not enjoyed at all were all were the kids. They are useless and they do not add anything to the plot. This could have been just the typical ""single guy vs. everyone"" kind of film. Honestly there is nothing much to say about ""Willy's Wonderland"" as it is such a basic movie that is impossible to sum it, without spoilers.

70,dasa108,All young people must die! With a superb Cage it is a film that stands out.,7,29 September 2021,"Finally we have Cage who portrays someone like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti western: he is a tough guy, he does not speak and he follows his routine with the precision of a Swiss watch - regardless of whether some idiotic teenager dies as a result. Cage is a perhaps mute guy who after a trap is involved in a pact where they will fix his car in exchange for cleaning a place that could potentially be his grave. Cage when he agrees he does so with the vigor of a kamikaze. He cleans up no matter which robot after robot tries to kill him. The group of young people that appears is made up of idiotic and unfriendly beings; they all deserve to die.The film has a happy ending and it is pleasant and above all it lasts just the right amount of time: less than an hour and a half. Recommendable.",Willy's Wonderland
71,leesimon-26357,"Nicolas Cage at his most Nicolas Cagey (non-verbal, and kick-assy)",10,21 February 2021,"This movie almost lost me in the first 10 minutes, because the acting, the youth characters, and the dialogue was incredibly bad, up to that point. Then the movie made it clear what it was, and I realized this everything in it is a goof. From that point forward, I enjoyed it more and more, never, ever taking it seriously.That said, the violence was awesome. The movie did a great job of making the goriest, most exaggerated violence against the non-humans. There was violence all around, but it would have been impossible to enjoy that level of gore against humans. Those scenes were also shot very well, in that the constant, frantic camera movements zooming in and out, and changing perspective made the scenes somewhat more serious. It would have been extremely goofy to see anyone fight the non-humans, without those camera tricks.Overall, I think this movie is what it feels and looks like both to take acid, and to be in the room with teenagers that also took acid. In that the movie itself is a total trip; the colors, the lighting, the story, the characters , etc... and the teenage cast sound like what a room full of tripping idiots would sound like.
Without spoiling anything, there is the obligatory scene of simulated sex between consenting characters (like in every slasher,) which usually turns me off of a movie immediately, if the characters are underage. But again, in this movie, that scene is played as such a huge joke. It is the most unrealistic scene of simulated sex ever in a movie. It's like they asked a bunch of 13 year olds what they thought sex looked like. So, of course, hilarious, goofy, over the top, and like the rest of the movie, so dumb, it's fantastic.For me, the self-aware goofiness was hilarious, the violence landed and was thrilling, and the complete lack of explanation over how these events are taking place is more of an homage to classic supernatural slashers. The baddies keep coming, and the goodies keep coming. I loved it.I will definitely see it again, and highly recommend it.",Willy's Wonderland
72,darkreignn,"Completely entertaining, if oddly underwhelming",6,20 February 2021,"Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors of all time, so you can imagine my excitement when I found out that he was starring in a horror film where he gets to stand off against evil animatronics. I mean, if that doesn't sound like a role that Cage was born to play, then I don't know what does. And let's get one thing straight right off the bat here: ""Willy's Wonderland"" is entertaining from beginning to end, never once boring me, having more than enough Nicolas Cage goodness to satisfy even the most hardcore Cage fanatic. On the other hand, I couldn't help but find myself feeling slightly underwhelmed.Listen, if you're watching a movie called ""Willy's Wonderland,"" you're not looking for high-art. And this movie is not attempting to fool anyone; within 15 minutes, when you see Nic Cage bash an animatronic rooster's head into a gory, oily pulp, you know exactly what kind of movie you're getting. The movie knows how ridiculous its premise is, and fully plays into the inherent ludicrousness, making no attempt at all to frighten its audience. The campy nature of the movie, along with Cage's silent but badass performance, adds an absurd amount of entertainment value - this is popcorn (or binge drinking) cinema at its finest. Like I said, you know just what you're getting into here, perhaps to a fault.Because of the movie's choice to embrace the camp, it leaves off the table any attempt to seriously scare the viewer. I can imagine a truly frightening, cat-and-mouse type movie, because the animatronics do look genuinely creepy. Instead, however, you'll witness Nicolas Cage face off against one evil robot after the other, rinse and repeat. If you enjoy seeing that, you'll definitely enjoy this movie. But I can definitely see this film's schtick getting old quick to viewers who don't share the same ludicrous taste as I do. So yes, you'll get Nic Cage violently destroying his enemies for an hour and a half - so where does the movie go wrong? In its editing of its action scenes.There is a very high-octane, chaotic feeling to this movie's action, which, granted, does fit the tone. However, this decision to depict the action in such a goofy way makes many of the action sequences incomprehensible. I really wanted to enjoy watching Cage fight a bunch of evil robots, and in a way I did, but my enjoyment was cut short because of the fact that the editing didn't clearly depict the action. I mean, it's almost unforgivable to be completely honest; if you're movie centers around a badass action hero who is single-handedly taking down a group of children's animatronics, why would you choose to hide most of the action? The shaky camera and extreme-closeups detracted from what was otherwise a well-directed movie.With all of that said, however, I still had a blast watching this movie. Nicolas Cage is absolutely hilarious, and the ludicrous premise lends itself to comedy - if you don't laugh at least once during this movie, it's simply not the film for you. But, if you're the type of person who chuckles at the thought of watching Nicolas Cage beat creepy robots to death, you'll definitely have some type of fun with this.",Willy's Wonderland

74,berg-74532,"Not great, but definitely has its moments.",6,16 August 2021,I'm not sure if the people responsible for the Banana Splits movie are involved with this and frankly I don't care enough to stop to look it up but if they aren't they need to hand over some of their meager earnings to the Splits. This is my favorite Cage movie since he started releasing a movie a week but that's less about his acting and more about a excellent choice about his character that I won't spoil but I will say it's the gift that keeps on giving. The millennials within the cast are as annoying in this movie as they are in everyday lives and I was really looking forward to their corpses to begin to pile up. I see no need to delve deep within the plot because the incidentals are pretty obvious. Like the Splits movie or if you went to Chuck E Cheese or Showbiz Pizza as a kid the $1.99 I paid to watch this was well worth it for nostalgia alone.,Willy's Wonderland
75,itsbobr,Enjoyable Non-Horror Movie,7,15 April 2021,"In order to pay for his 4-flat tires, the Janitor (Nicolcas Cage), agrees to clean up Willy's Wonderland, owned by Tex Macadoo (Ric Reitz) and he says he wants to reopen Willy's Wonderland. The Wonderland was condemned by the town because there were many kinds of supernatural goings on and many people were killed by the animal figures that made up the wonderland. A group of kids led by Liv (Emily Tosta) were in the act of burning down the Wonderland, but had to make sure that the Janitor made it out safely as the doors were chain locked. This can't be good.I know the promo for the movie said Horror and I figured I could always shut it down to sleep another day, but I did not find any real horror within. Add to the fact that Nicolas Cage was in it, I thought it might be a funny ""horror"" if there is such a thing. No not really, and people do get killed by the animal figures, but things happened so fast there was no time to decide if it was horror.The Janitor goes about his task of cleaning, drinking soda pop, and playing the pinball machine. When encountered by one of the Wonderland Animals, who have taken on real-life abilities, he defeats them as a matter of course. He is not afraid. And after each encounter he dons another Wonderland tee shirt.Notables: Beth Grant as Sheriff Lund, and she holds the terrible secret of Willy's Wonderland; David Sheftell as Evan, the Sheriff's Deputy; and Jiri Stanek as Willy.I am not sure how the Nicolas Cage Impersonators are going to react to Mr. Cage this time as he doesn't speak one word the entire movie. He does, however, do several celebratory dances when he scores high points on the pinball machine. Let's see what they can do with that. Ha! As for me, I wanted to see how it all ended. Oh, some of the music was really good.I have a feeling that this movie will become a Cult Classic. You know Nicolas Cage could get an Oscar for this. Not kidding. Could happen. (7/10)

77,AdrenalinDragon,Willy's Disappointment,5,19 February 2021,"Willy's Wonderland was a movie I was kind of looking forward to. A Five Nights at Freddy's-esque scenario of a guy working overnight in a restaurant filled with killer robots sounds awesome on paper, but sadly this film even with Nicolas Cage in the lead doesn't deliver. I kind of like the silent protagonist angle. On the other hand, Cage hamming it up could have lead to Evil Dead II-like situations. He's still kind of badass and has okay moments here and there, but I feel it would have been way better with him speaking.The costume robots are cool and there's some fun room designs and goofy humour here and there. A shame the other characters are a bit crap, but I suppose its to fill the Slasher film genre stock characters quota. They're just there essentially as kills for the robots and don't really have any character. The film at least gives an explanation and some background as to why the robots are killing people, but it's nothing really surprising or unique to the genre.On the technical/acting side, it's kind of a bit of a letdown. Most shots are conventional and a bit bland at best. Very few take advantage of the colours and location potential of interesting shots and compositions. Fights and deaths are a bit sloppily executed, and sometimes it's hard to tell what exactly is going on. The young actors are pretty weak in terms of performance, but I wasn't expecting anything amazing as it seemed to be going for a goofy/B-Movie film approach. There is some music and songs unique to the film, so I'll give it credit for trying in that field.It's a real shame Willy's Wonderland wasn't good. There are a few little glimpses of fun stuff with the gore and humour, but it needed to be more wackier. The Banana Splits Movie was another similar film that didn't quite reach its full potential as well. Sadly, not even Cage could save this, despite the feeling like there was passion behind it. In the end, Willy's Wonderland is a mediocre, watchable 90 minute Horror film, and honestly I'm feeling generous because of its cool premise/ideas.5/10",Willy's Wonderland

81,grygotis,Maybe if you are very stoned and accidentally stumble upon it,1,1 July 2021,"What can one say at this point in time about Nicolas Cage?! He can be great, mediocre, interesting, boring, intriguing, terrible, romantic, touching, original, bad, hammy, haunting, baffling and the list goes on. Most of these more positive attributes were earlier in his career, but he can still just surprise you with a good one at any point in time. The man has talent when he wants to use it. His career in more recent years resembles one of a man who needs to make money as quickly as he can and take on roles simply for that sake. This would definitely fall into that latter category except that he also produced it implying this is the movie he wanted to make. I was interested in seeing this after some things I had read as he was clearly nearly making fun of his near gonzo performances as a man stuck in a funhouse with killer automatrons without speaking one word of dialogue. One of the of the film's major problems is that the other actors do have dialogue and every word is apparently supposed to be bad and they are. So are all the other actors. Nic Cage wanted to make a terrible movie, a joke of a movie and he has. The joke, however, is not funny. I had some high hopes when I saw Beth Grant in the cast as she knows how to have fun in a bad movie, but even she is defeated here. I think Cage enjoys his long and strange career and I know some join him in that, but count me out. He has made a truly terrible movie, Perhaps among the worst ever.

It is fun watching Nick beat on some evil oversized puppets seeing the black oil spray all over the place. The movie has a pace you can get with and completes nice.

I do however think that they used it well and it didn't really need any more spending on it. I think where it shows it most is the other actors. Some feel like they may have actually just found them in the town they shot at. It doesn't detract from the film it just kind of sticks out a little bit.I think the story is pretty interesting too. It was a little bit different which I appreciated. I think the action was pretty engaging too. I will say at some points the film did sag a little bit and I was like this feels a lot longer than an hour and a half. But for the most part it clipped along.I do think the comedy let it down a little. Some of the jokes were just awful and not funny.

96,tresm87,A zany tribute to people that grew up in 80/90s going to Showbiz/Circus pizza/Chuck E Cheese to witness the Rock-afire Explosion animatronic band.,8,13 February 2021,"The director and writer had to have been inspired by the timeframe where the animatronic bands were all the rage for pizza/arcade establishments in a simpler time of yore. Give it a more brutal twist and add the legendary Nic Cage and you get this wacky blast of a humble budget horror comedy that's sure to become cult classic material.The story starts out in rather predictable stranded horror setting fashion and introduces us to Cage's nameless character as subtle as possible . As things take shape it becomes abundantly clear that things aren't normal at Willy's Wonderland and the insanity ensues into an extravagant conclusion. While the plot is never groundbreaking, it's enough strange fun to keep you wanting more.The standout aspects in this film are obviously Cage and the stylistic visuals throughout that take you back in time while adding the horror aspects. Nic is at his all time level of true brilliance and does it in one of the most nuanced and eccentric ways so far in his career. The throwback settings are so spot on accurate to what we as kids had for pizza/arcades, it's incredible. The animatronic creatures are hilariously gruesome and the practical effects and makeup are very well designed. When they need cgi it's for fast paced parts it never looks too ridiculous with them. The voice overs for the creatures can be really hit or miss but the overall weirdness level was achieved especially with the songs. Also a very good use of lighting to create fantastic atmosphere.Overall this is just a flat out awesome film full of nostalgia for me. If you can look at it like an old school 80s horror, it will definitely help the experience. Definitely better than I thought it would be.",Willy's Wonderland

99,BeanieCore,"Dumb fun, with a double order of crazy Cage.",6,16 February 2021,"If you enter ""Willy's Wonderland"" expecting a straight-faced horror film that places great emphasis on story and sense, you only have yourself to blame. This is a film about Nicolas Cage beating the crap out of murderous demonic animatronics. If that premise sounds like it could offer you some popcorn fun, then this is the film for you. If you find yourself rolling your eyes and heaving a sigh, move along, and maybe learn to lighten up a bit. Now, that's not to say ""Willy's Wonderland"" is perfect, even as the brainless, bonkers kind of genre offering it's trying to be. But if you're the target audience, it certainly has it's charms. Chief among them actually being Cage himself. This is the exact sort of film that Cage is known for at this point in his career, the kind where he can lose his mind completely. The icing on the cake is that in this case, there are no cringey one-liners for him to spout. The script smartly portrays him as a silent, OCD-riddled badass. This is a man who stares demonic Chuck-E Cheese's props in the face, beats the battery acid out of them, and then continues mopping and playing pinball, as if this is just another day for him. It's a simultaneously hilarious, and badass performance full of energy, that plays up to Cage's strengths as an action star and and absurdist. Even when the effects and gore are in full swing, watching him silently go nuts is still the most enjoyable aspect of the production.While his character is never given much backstory, the film itself has a surprisingly thought-out mythos. It's nothing more than the usual ""urban legend"" type stuff, but it's easy to swallow because the film doesn't take itself too seriously. The effects are quite good, and the animatronic critters are imposing, creepy characters, though not quite as inspired as the ""Five Nights At Freddy's"" characters that so clearly inspire the film's premise. Direction is choppy as well. The film has a bit of a cheap look, but it does employ some stylistic flourishes that make it feel like a gonzo comic book at times. It's greatest downfall is that during the fight scenes, the cinematography devolves into sloppy shaky-cam style. You'd think by now action film directors would have learned that audiences prefer articulate direction that actually allows you to see the punches landing, but this feels like ""Crank"" on acid. The fight scenes are still enjoyable thanks to Cage, but they can become numbing at moments. Meanwhile, whilst acting is decent, Cage is the only one that stands out. The group of teenagers does add weight to the plot, but when focusing on them, the film is much less interesting. All together, I don't quite think it has the chops to be a cult classic, but it's a fun, frantic one-time viewing for those with an appreciation for midnight madness style horror flicks. While not entirely successful, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a giddy smile on my face watching Nic decapitate, curb-stomp and disembowel some foul-mouthed animatronics. The film doesn't take itself seriously, so as long as you don't either, you'll have some good old, dumb fun with it.",Willy's Wonderland

But you have some painfully cliche, trying-too-hard-to-be-hip young adults tossed in the mix of an obvious Five Nights at Freddy's rip-off that has the killer animatronic family-friendly machines working some major corny lines and some rather sad attempts to be ""scary"" (although the group moving at the beginning was rather creepy AF) with some ""too-cool-to-talk"" hardcore bada**ery.In short, it tries too hard to be edgy. BUT, that being said, it's still entertaining enough to check out, for a late-night viewing, preferably with the help of our good buddy, Alcohol. The story is wholly predictable and banal, as are the characters. It's good for a low-brow laugh and some entertaining violence, with some seemingly innocent child-like hellions to make things interesting.Ok, there are some parts that generate some spine-tingles. But when the ""main attractions"" get all in-your-face, they lose their composure, and thus, their ""scare factor"". It's creepy when it's early on and they make subtle movements, but after they ditch the subtlety, it gets rather old, fast.All in all, it's exactly what you think. Don't expect it to win any awards, but you gotta appreciate its attempt to keep practical special effects alive, and the horror genre unique. Have fun with it, that's my best advice.One more thing that rubs me the wrong way: It tries to be SO DARN DRAMATIC.

For the fans of Nick Cage this is a treat, he is giving the audience what it needs. If someone remembers the SNL skit ""why am i not in that moviee?"" then they know that Cage could not have said no to this one. The story is simple: he gets stuck somehow in a random town and agrees to work for a night in Willy's Wonderland. Shortly after he has to fight against an evil bunch of animatronics, while consuming energy drinks and being nick cage. I have to admit that the work on the animatronics was good, sound mixing was good and the fight scenes were ranging from funny to fun. Don't expect to be very (or at all) scared; maybe just creeped out by the animatronics. Obviously, don't take this film seriously.

116,ianwagnerwatches,Hack Disguised as Camp,3,4 October 2021,"I love a campy movie, but I believe that a better term for this movie is hack. Now, a lot of elements work very well in this movie: Cage nails the role of the silent, blank-slate hero, the production design is generally a success. However, pretty much every other element of this film is weak, unmotivated, or seriously botched.The cinematography is generally cheap and uses all sorts of trendy techniques, like dutch angles and fake lens flares, and does so without purpose and without heart. The way that the action sequences are shot consistently leaves me disappointed, unable to see what were often genuinely hunorous combat sequences. Unstead, it's all violently shakey closeups and zaney wide angle shots cut together as if to hide, rather than show, the choreography.Perhaps the most damning aspect of this film for me is the combination of digital and practical effects for the anamatronics, which us consistently inept and laughable, especially considering that Hollywood has been using puppets and anamatronics successfully for decades. How, in the year of 2021, do you screw up an anamatronic that's SUPPOSED to look like an animatronic? Why use CGI, especially on such a low budget?Cage's role as the Janitor is the only successful performance, and this is because he has no lines. The writing in this film is derrivative and embarrassing, but more than anything else, it's desperately hackneyed. Every non-Cage character is annoying and non-essential, except for the female hero, but only as a backboard for our silent protagonist. Every time the film verges on unique, the dialogue ruins it. Beyond that, the story is a blatant rip off of Five Nights at Freddy's, which is no secret, but the fact that Five Nights at Freddy's is able to tell their story much better, and with far less, is seriously disappointing.In summation, the movie was disappointing at every turn. I went out of my way to watch it, which I rarely do considering the seemingly endless supply of films on streaming platforms, and I couldn't be more disappointed. Cage did great, though, so if that's all you care about, might as well give this trash a look.",Willy's Wonderland

135,darrenbjones,High Plains Drifter meets Chuck E Cheese,7,16 August 2021,"Before you say anything, yes I know. But hear me out below (Spoilers aplenty just to warn you).First let me set some establishing parameters. I unashamedly love Nicholas Cage films, even the ridiculous ones. His commitment to the role and some of the acting choices he makes are always fun.Secondly I raised my kids in rural West Virginia and spent several birthdays with them at Billy Bob's Wonderland (seriously) so this horror really isn't a million miles away from the animatronic nightmares that still haunt my sleep.Cage is The Janitor, a mysterious (and silent) drifter who drives into town and takes a night job at Willy's Wonderland in exchange for the cost of repairs to his car.The fun house has a dark past though, it was created by a serial killer who then hired a supporting team of killers, perverts and more who used the kids' party location to continue killing. This reign of terror culminated with Willy and his staff committing suicide in a satanic ritual that transferred their souls into the animatronics so they could continue to kill and maim.Having spent several birthday parties at Billy Bob's, it really doesn't feel too far fetched as a concept.Throughout the course of the night the possessed animatronics try to kill the Janitor without luck, he's a man with a very well regulated caffeine addiction, a disturbing love of pinball and some serious fighting skills. On top of that he's a fantastic janitor.It's soon clear that (to paraphrase Emily Tosta's, Liv) ""he isn't trapped in with the animatronics, they're trapped in with him."" Unfortunately when a group of teens, concerned about his safety and determined to end the cycle of death, break in to warn the Janitor, the fun and body count really starts to ramp up. Ultimately the town's dirty secret is revealed. The locals, having been attacked repeatedly over the years now offer undesirables, drunks, derelicts and the 'immoral' as sacrifices to satisfy the blood lust of the animatronic killers.The Janitor is here, like an avenging spirit to clean up more than a children's birthday party.It's absolutely predictable, it's clearly inspired by the same brand of horror as Five Nights at Freddy's. The animatronic designs and costumes are terrible and as a result, absolutely perfect. The practical effects are simple and great. The whole thing is completely in keeping with the dirty, grimy experience that so many children and parents have had on a Saturday afternoon or evening, celebrating a birthday and hoping their TB shots are up to date, at a place like Willy's Wonderland.",Willy's Wonderland
136,bwdude,Has the Janitor himself written the script?,1,4 March 2021,"Mr. Cage, you won an Academy Award once for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and it was well deserved.
Ever since it seems, you are working hard to never let this happen again.
There were some amusing and watchable flicks after that, but in the last years I've been avoiding the movies you were in because they were SO bad. And you as well.I rarely watch trailers, but Willy's Wonderland was an exception and it looked like a harmless popcorn flick that does not take itself too seriously.
I was wrong.From the very first scene I could tell that this would go nowhere. The script feels like the janitor you play wrote it on his loo break. The cast of shockingly bad actors did not help either. 15 minutes of it were painful enough, then I gave up.

Just cheesey and gory and funny and campy and pure enjoyment.I've watched enough let's plays of Five Nights At Freddy's to have recognized the plot just from the description, so I was expecting Nic Cage to chew on the scenery of gore and jump scares. I would have been fine with something a little lame but with that certain Cage flair.Instead, I got something surprisingly good. The cinematography was balanced, with little bits of surreal and fun angles, but never so much to become distracting. Good color scheme and lighting, and the creature design really captured that slightly terrifying look of way-back-when Chuck E Cheese.I enjoyed how the script was full of tropes, but the actors carried it well, and everything came across well. Almost like everyone was having fun, wanted the audience to enjoy themselves, but they took it just serious enough to deliver good performances.The whole movie is right on that edge of camp and parody, without necessarily being played for laughs like a comedy. Something more like Evil Dead 2 or Kung Fury; love and enjoyment of the genres without mockery.That being said, this is NOT a horror or even really a thriller. It gets those labels because it needs some kind of genre, but it really fits in its own little niche, and it will NOT be for everyone. But as a popcorn/drinking-with-friends movie, it really hits the spot.And I cannot understate how much Nic Cage was absolutely himself, dialed to 11. Sold every scene, and stole most of them.

I especially enjoyed Nicholas Cage taking a break from time to time as instructed.
It is just funny how his character is a master cleaner. This was definitely included to make it more funny and it worked. And the monsters well, they were just play things for the mighty Nic Cage. 1.5/2 for cinematography and directing.The acting slides down a notch but they were very serious making it all the more comic. 0.5/2.

Alas, instead of becoming the kind of movie you can watch a dozen times, you will struggle to get much enjoyment out of a single viewing of Willy's Wonderland.Where this film goes horribly wrong is in its execution. Instead of wacky characters and zany antics soaked in blood, this film offers a disjointed mess that fails to deliver on horror, comedy, or suspense. There are no jokes, no jump scares, and not much in the way of depth. The dialog is forced, the characters one dimensional, their actions illogical, the plot one we've seen a thousand times before, the cinematography lackluster, and the editing disjointed, at best.To be clear, the problem was not with Nicholas Cage. He seems to have an almost preternatural gift for playing anti-heroes. Even without saying a word, he can come across as a likable bad guy with a heart of gold. No, it is in spite of Cage's involvement, not because of it, that this film falls flat.Watching this movie I could not help wondering what a more experienced and/or talented director might have made of it.

It's a horror western blend with all tropes associated with said genres flipped upside down.

After taking the job he cleans, fights, takes a soda break regularly, even mid-fight, then cleans again. Not your typical horror hero figure. The Janitor's unfazed and indifferent demeanor and unwavering focus on getting the job done is somehow more unsettling than the possessed animatronic mascots, murdering people.

150,holyraine,is there anything nick cage wont say yes to?,7,15 March 2021,"In all honesty though, this is actually a pretty enjoyable movie as long as you dont take it seriously (which it clearly doesnt want you to do anyway) its got some pretty good action sequences, although the amounts of cuts in them were excessive, and it had some funny moments too, the fact that nick cages character literally cares about nothing other than paying off his car mechanic fee and not the murderous satanic animatronics can actually be pretty funny sometimes. for what its worth, id say this was a good movie. its like hardcore henry, youre really supposed to enjoy it based on how much fun it is to watch rather than for its story, thats not to say it didnt try SOME story, and to be fair, they did have a pretty decent backstory to the whole ""willys wonderland"" place and why the animatronics want to kill people, which was a nice touch. the horror aspect of this movie was also done fairly well

152,Filmiarvustus,The purest form of a superb and mindless entertainment,8,29 March 2021,"""Willy's Wonderland"" is about a quiet drifter, who is tricked into a janitorial night job at the condemned children's birthday venue. The mundane tasks become an all-out fight for survival against a wave of demonic animatronics. The movie has no intentions of being anything but what it is - brainless entertainment. So we get Nic Cage fighting robots for an hour and a half to trance music. And it's awesome. It is right on the edge of camp and parody, without necessarily being played for laughs like a comedy. Similar to Evil Dead or Kung Fury, where love and enjoyment of the genres merge without mockery. Cage is the star here, stealing every moment and all without a single line of dialogue. Just cheesy, gory, and funny instant cult classic that will entertain, so just sit down and enjoy.",Willy's Wonderland

Meanwhile some teens go and try to burn down Willy's but end up inside the hellhole.Cage despite having no lines still manages to be fun to watch and its nice and bloody.

Exposition is delivered in the least creative voiceovers I have ever seen. Most of the movie's runtime is dedicated to Nicolas Cage cleaning things, which is-oddly enough-more entertaining than the action scenes.Literally all they had to do here was make Nicolas Cage a fun character (which he can do by himself) and make the action bloody, gritty, and over-the-top. But they did neither of these things.This is one of the worst films I've seen all year.

Also by showing the plot instead of telling the plot there could have been more to figure out by the viewer. AND if the lead character should have showed surprise or fear about what was going on, this could have been a nice simple movie.

A group of teens led by Liv (Emily Tosta) try to warn the drifter of the truth but Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant) is hot in their trail.The plot of this film is enough to have anyone interested. When you add Nic Cage, it becomes a no brainer. Keeping the film contained to one central location, with a few outside locations, benefits this. The use of practical effects is also a wise decision.While there are good performances in here, Cage, Beth Grant, and Emily Tosta, the rest of the cast feel like filler. They do a serviceable job but nothing memorable. Aside from the premise and Nic Cage, not much is memorable. Pops of vibrant color could help the muted color palette.When you look at this film as a whole, the good outweighs the bad. Cage's performance is fabulous when he is fighting off possessed, family friendly robots. This is a fun ride that can also be a great introduction to horror.",Willy's Wonderland

It was just his quirks. And that felt more like a problem with director/writers than with Nic Cage, because honestly, he was still the most bearable thing about this movie.He was perfectly cast in a crappily-written movie.

Maybe someone in Hollywood has it in for him, but he's just not getting the good parts any more and the slide into trashy, low budget poorly written parts reaches a new low with this one.This is the sort of film you would expect from a film student or a bunch of wannabe film makers who fancy themselves the next Michael Bay. Its poorly written, very poorly directed, poorly scripted, poorly choreographed, and poorly shot.There is really not point going into details, but if you want to know how not to make a film, or if your a lecturer highlighting the poor use of resources for film making to your students, you could well use this as a great example.Cage has no lines in this film, and I mean NONE, and if you are going to make a film where the lead character has no lines, it had better be a fantastic screenplay, This most certainly isn't and the attempt at a quirky implementation falls completely flat.I'd say see it just for the experience, but even that would be a waste of time.",Willy's Wonderland

170,cyguration,Five Nights At Freddy's + Drive Angry 3D,10,19 February 2021,"What a delightfully weird little action-horror film. I was originally going to give it a 6 or a 7, but I honestly can't think of anything else they could have done to make the movie better.It is what it is.Nicholas Cage turns in a completely wordless performance as a stranger drifting through towns with an uncanny ability to dish out (and take) pain, while guzzling down what is essentially a power-up pop drink.His character acts very similarly to the one from Drive Angry 3D, almost giving the impression that this could very well be a non-canonical prequel to that film.However, take that character and throw him into what's essentially the basic premise of Five Nights at Freddy's and you get Willy's Wonderland.I agree with a few other reviewers that this film acts on certain levels of B-movie camp without going too far into the realm of the absurd (based on the worldbuilding it receives), and is definitely worth comparing to films like Evil Dead 2.The effects are oftentimes cheap (due to the budget) and there aren't many locations on display, but with the little they had to work with the film is instantaneously a cult classic.Unlike some of Cage's other flicks, like the infinitely unwatchable Jiu-Jitsu, which was just bad all the way around, Willy's Wonderland has its heart (and gore) in the right place, and is a fast-moving thrill-ride from practically start to finish. The quick-edit segments reminded me a lot of Sam Raimi's style of directing, and the use of practical blood effects were sparingly but wisely used.If you want something a little bit different from the typical horror fanfare, I would definitely recommend Willy's Wonderland. Also, if you're a fan of horror films where the hero actually FIGHTS back, then you will love this movie to death.",Willy's Wonderland
171,NotAFilmCritic101001,This is a B-grade film.,3,19 February 2021,"If you're going into this knowing it's a B-grade film (Possibly C), purposely designed to be nothing more than a silly movie to pass your time, then you'll have an okay time.I look at it this way, when watching a film there are two ways to view it: 'Objectively' & 'Personal enjoyment.' When I rate movies I do so objectively, so objectively this movie is a 3 out of 10 film. However, personally I didn't mind the movie, so my own enjoyment was about 5 out of 10.My personal enjoyment level is based on the fact I knew what I was in for, had I just started watching this without knowing it was a B-grade affair I would've been thoroughly disappointed. However, because I knew what I was in for, I was able to turn my brain waaaaaay off and enjoy the ridiculousness on offer.The story line exists simply to make the events of the film happen, there's no depth to it and it basically doesn't matter. The bi-racial guy they hire to play the black guy is literally a caricature of what it means to be black. He says things like ""Dayuuum"" and ""ya'll's crazy"" and opts to leave his friends behind... Very poor representation of 'being black', but it's something I've noticed B-grade films do A LOT! Black people are nothing more than a caricature to ridicule in low grade films. It's a real shame, wish movies would stop doing this.The film clearly doesn't have the best budget, so the gore isn't even as much as you'd expect, the actions not shot particularly well, lots of cuts, and reactionary shots (like blood splattering on an attackers face) rather than shots of the actual impact, especially when it comes to the human victims. One human they kill isn't even shown dying on screen, another is killed so effortlessly you wonder if all the money dried up before they got to him.TLDR; If you want a crap film you can turn your brain off to and just watch the carnage unfold... have at it. If you're looking for substance and want plot, good characters, theme, attention to detail and competent story telling... look elsewhere, this is definitely not the one for you.",Willy's Wonderland

Very poor execution of a non-speaking protagonist!Also, I really hoped he had some background for example his wife and kid(s) were killed but he somehow survived and returned to avenge their deaths, or maybe he was a kid that witnessed some killings taking place and had so much trauma he couldn't speak after it - NOT!

Firstly, Nic Cage is pretty great in this film. I've missed him these past few years with very dialed down or tone deaf roles he's been given. He was free to basically have fun... AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T SPEAK. I'm not kidding, he has no lines in the entire movie. I imagine the film only had enough money in the budget to get him on set, and not enough to get him to speak. The plot is basically Five Nights at Freddy's but the walmart brand and intended to appeal to a much larger audience than 2010 zoomers. That said, the action sequences are fun, but don't carry the film far enough to be enjoyable. The characters are ignorant to an annoying point. The cops, and basically whole town are in on the scheme when they could just as easily nuke the building, or shoot up the animatronics. That'd be too easy. Instead, it takes 1 teenage girl with a pocket knife and 1 mute 60 year old to take on 8 or so 90's power rangers villain extras in a span of one night... or 90 minutes. It's super campy... almost as bad as The Dead Don't Die. Complete with a recalled joke of ""punch pop"" soda, mandatory break times, and a pinball machine mysteriously placed in the kitchen of the restaurant. I get it... once again, this is an ironic horror with a low low budget. Is it good? No. Is it awful? Yeah it kind of is to a degree, but you can likely sit through it and not be completely disappointed.",Willy's Wonderland

198,anton_carlsson,Unfortunately a disappointment,6,1 March 2021,"I was pretty excited before watching this film. I watched the fantastic ""Psycho Goreman"" a couple of days prior and was still in the mood for more gory fun. 20 minutes into the movie I was convinced that I would have a good time. But then something happened. Or should I say not happen.
Many people compare the film to ""Five nights a Freddie's"" and after a while the film felt like a video game. It's just level after level of Nick Cage beating up a forry robot over and over again. The kills were nice but they all felt the same.
Another problem is the fact that you never fear for Nick Cages safety. He doesn't really show emotions either. I understand his character is based on the silent drifter but you love Nick Cage for his excentric emoting and here you see nothing of that.
Sure, many of these kind of movies exists for the gore but there must be someone or someones you care for and want to see survive and grow. There are a little bit of these things but not enough to keep you invested. It's a shame. I hope the creators next film will be better because I see that somewhere in this film there is something really good.Watch ""the banana splits"" if you want a killer animatronic movie. It's not perfect but it's a bit better this film. Or watch both. I'm not the boss of you.",Willy's Wonderland

200,daphleung,Nicolas Cage VS Animatronic mascots,4,20 May 2021,"It was an unexpectedly surprising cult film in 2021 because of showing its violent and gory scenes with headshots, spilled organs, and blood. If you were a fan of cult movie, you must be enjoyed the scenes that Nicolas Cage violently battled with possessed animatronic mascots.One of the reasons the audience watched this movie was because of Nicolas Cage. This time he acted a dialogue-free role, faced off against the eight animatronic kiddie characters. Though he recently spent his career in B-movies due to personal issues, this one was successful.",Willy's Wonderland
201,intorchard-101,Not sure again,7,5 June 2021,"Don't really know what to really say about this movie. This movie might make you think twice about going to your local Chuck E. Cheese, is this movie does portray animatronics as killing machines. Possessed by serial killers that have died . However this movie does have a sinister synopsis . The whole idea of this movie is about reincarnated possession of animatronics. The idea is kind of cool but to me they don't revisit the characters inside the animatronic characters. Nicolas Cage does not speak the whole movie but talks with his body so he has a very good actor. It's not too bad. Not sure what else to say.",Willy's Wonderland
202,crom-dubh,"Not completely without merit, but overall disappointing",5,4 July 2021,"However entertaining you think this is going to be based on the trailer, just go into it realizing that it's probably going to be less so than you expect.The plot of the movie is basically that Cage's character gets a flat tire in a small town and has no money so he is hired to work off his bill at the local garage by cleaning up an abandoned children's attraction where we find out some bad things have happened. As we were watching it, I joked to my girlfriend that the real plot is that real life Nicolas Cage got a flat tire in a small town and had to work off his bill at the local garage by being in this movie.The direction is competent enough, but just about everything else feels rather cheap like you'd expect from a 90s TV movie, and I'm talking about the ones that were just usually too boring to really be ""so bad they're good."" The acting is almost all incredibly amateurish. Cage does his usual thing and is actually a little more restrained than you might imagine he would be for this kind of thing. The best thing about the film is how unperturbed he seems by all that's happening, and his dedication to finishing the job he was hired for. The action itself is actually fairly uncompelling and starts to feel repetitive after the first scene.Overall I wouldn't say this is 100% not worth watching, but unfortunately it's surprisingly tame and feels too cheap, and not in a good way. Lower your expectations and watch in a group of friends and you'll probably have a decent time.",Willy's Wonderland
203,Left_Hand_of_Dog,One More Take: Willy's Wonderland,2,10 July 2021,"We take a break from our regular schedule of ancient programming, tonight, to look at a movie that might have been good... Were it a completely different movie.If you know me at all, you know I love Nicolas Cage, horror movies, and general schlock (Dead Alive is a masterpiece of cinema, and not nobody gonna tell me otherwise). And if all three of said ingredients are in the mix? I'm there. Granted, this has about the success rate you would expect, but I consider it a worthy endeavor. Take that as you will. The best example of this trio in action can be found in 2018's Mandy, or, more classical in structure (Mandy essentially being an experimental film), 2019's Color Out of Space. Willy's Wonderland is neither of these pictures, and barely deserves to be seen by anyone, save for a few fun elements.First things first, you can click out of this review right now if you don't like slasher movies. I won't hold it against you. If the idea of light-hearted movie murders don't appeal, luckily there are plenty of other options. Unfortunately for the rest of us, Willy's Wonderland cannot even reach the low standards set by a fairly simplistic genre archetype.Let's set the scene. Demonic animatronics are murdering people in an abandoned theme restaurant, a-la Chuck-E-Cheese. The townspeople are luring drifters for sacrifice, and choose Nic Cage as their next victim, baiting him with the promise of fixing his car should he clean said restaurant overnight. In a fun, voiceless performance, he proceeds to thrash said animatronics, and there are some stupid teenagers who get involved for the sole purpose of dying at the hands of the bad guys, in service to the classic slasher structure. Pretty simple stuff, although the plot immediately loses points for being a more or less direct ripoff of an inexplicably popular video game franchise.The plot, such as it is, is explained through tedious, uncreative dumps of exposition, and is pointed at here to highlight the general dumbness of the writing throughout the movie. The teenage characters, for instance, are infuriatingly stupid and annoying from the outset. Now, this doesn't have to be a problem in a slasher movie, as generations have been drawn to the screen to watch Jason dispatch hapless young'uns in the woods in a never-ending string of Friday the 13th movies, but it all just grates so much here when you want the movie, and not just the characters, to simply shut the hell up. This is especially exacerbated when the big payoff, the kills themselves, are lacking, and Willy's Wonderland bungles the execution. The kills made by the puppets are dull, robbing the movie of potential genre-inspired kicks. Concomitant with this, the monsters indulge in some of the most rote, uninspired, and lazy dialogue ever to be lifted from the hack-writer handbook: ""Playtime is over, girlfriend!"" Zero effort, zero reward. My eyes were rolling and my groans were probably audible.Needless to say, the movie is not scary, although I can't actually say if it intended to be. Rather, it plods along, often feeling twice its 90-minute length, and indulges in so much general audience-irritation (special shout out to the unnecessary and distracting CGI) that it's not even worth a further explication.And yet...Whenever Nic Cage is on screen, the movie becomes fun. Something about this voiceless man, slowly cleaning a dilapidated fun palace, taking periodic breaks to chug soda, play pinball, and brutally smash animatronics (after which he invariably changes his shirt), is magnetizing and odd in all the right ways. Those little details, to the movie's credit, are unexplained. Cage remains a thorough enigma, and his performance is perfect. Even on a meta level, Cage is like an audience surrogate, going through the motions of this stupid movie with a passive face, just doing his job, whether its cleaning toilets or smashing Andy the Alligator to pieces. On top of this, most of Cage's kills are really fun, if not creative. This is due to both the actor himself and the juxtaposition of his stoic character to the irritatingly talky animatronics and their terrible lines. He even ignores the teenagers, leaving them to their fate if his watch beeps, signaling break time. In yet another sense, then, he becomes our avatar, the counterpoint and executor of the movie's lack of cleverness.In this way, Willy's Wonderland could have almost been brilliant. Here's how we fix it:1. Hire a writer with even a remote semblance of talent. We'll be getting rid of most of the dialogue anyway, so it only needs to be serviceable. Some memorable quips from the animatronics, and we're good to go.2. Strip out anything related to the plot.. Exposition as dumb and lifeless as this would be better left unexplained. Spoilers, some serial killers did a satanic ceremony and got trapped in the puppets. Riveting. So, like Nic Cage and a robot spinal cord, just rip that stuff out. The movie should revel in its nonsense. Logic need not apply. Alternatively, you can just scatter visual cues throughout the movie, as Cage explores and cleans his surroundings, that point to a vague explanation. Let the audience engage in some sleuthing. Either way, you're making ground.3. No ancillary characters. Besides what's needed to contrive the situation in the first place, getting rid of all other character stuff not relating to Cage is just cutting unnecessary fat.If we did all this, and focused on the rhythm of the cleaning and the killing and played to the weirdness of some of the imagery, Willy's Wonderland would have just ridden that line between dumb and amazing that is the hallmark of many a classic B-movie.FINAL TAKE: Willy's Wonderland is stupid and corny in all the wrong ways. Stupid and corny, in a very specific mixture, can make for amazing entertainment, tapping into a very specific tone characterized by classics like Dead Alive and Evil Dead 2, to name but a few. Instead, outside of the diamond in the rough that is any sequence solely focused on the core element of Cage himself, it ends up being a movie I can't really recommend to anyone. Maybe for idiot teenagers, looking for surface level scares and memes? Ugh. Such a waste.All this being said? If your life just isn't complete without the pure magical bliss of Nicolas Cage curb stomping a gorilla into a urinal, I completely understand. You are one of the few, the proud, the beautiful, and I solute you. For you alone, the endeavor may be worth the pain.",Willy's Wonderland

208,freqeteq,I Don't Know What I Just Watched,8,13 February 2021,"First off if you're looking for a plot that makes any kind of sense with well written characters that aren't just superficial stereotypes and who make smart decisions then I suggest looking elsewhere, but if you're looking to watch something that is unlike anything you've ever seen before and is so ridiculous that you can't stop watching then this is the film for you.Cage is our silent protagonist driving through a small town when a series of events orchestrated by crooked locals leads to him spending the night cleaning a derelict fun house full of animatronic creatures that turn out to be possessed by psychopathic killers. A group of local teenagers aware of what is happening try to rescue him but end up becoming trapped inside as well.So yes, this is a very B-grade film where Nic Cage engages in hand to hand combat with a bunch of people wearing animal costumes, which would get old very quickly if the film took itself seriously, but thankfully for us the filmmakers not only gave the film a unique and interesting visual style, but they were also well aware of how silly the plot is so they had some fun with it, and although there's no real jokes or one liners in it I did find myself laughing out loud quite a few times at the sheer absurdity of what was happening on the screen, an example is how Cage's character very early on in the film is attacked by a giant animatronic ostrich yelling ""I want to feast on your face"", so a fight ensues that ends with a Mortal Kombat style finishing move and after it's over Cage goes to the storeroom puts on a clean shirt then goes straight back to his cleaning duties like this kind of thing happens to him all the time.This is the most ridiculous film I've seen in a long long time, nothing made any sense and I loved every minute of it, it's pure B-grade movie genius.",Willy's Wonderland

I think I would have paid to see this in the theater had it not popped up on Hulu. He is fully present for this role from start to finish and, IMO, shows why his Oscar was well deserved.

249,haunt_freak,Don't Believe the 10 Star Reviews,4,13 February 2021,"A man runs over a set of police spikes on a highway. Unable to pay for new tires, he is told he can work to pay for them. The job entails fixing up a former Chuck E. Cheese's-style restaurant called Willy's Wonderland. The animatronics start to come alive and attack the man (who is credited only as The Janitor) as the night continues. He is aided by a girl named Liv and her uninteresting friends (who are only there to serve as a body count later on), who want Willy's Wonderland destroyed. The teens were annoying AF and had some terrible acting/dialogue. Liv, ultimately, proves herself to be a pointless character that really adds nothing to the story except to explain the backstory of Willy's Wonderland.The Janitor never speaks and, for some reason, needs to consume a can of soda every hour and play pinball (and we're treated to witnessing this more times than needed). Because he never talks and doesn't have any backstory, we don't care about him. It also never feels like he's in any danger when the animatronics attack because he so easily dismantles them each time. There's nothing more boring than a protagonist who has no weakness. It also makes zero sense why all of the animatronics wouldn't gang up and kill him at once.This wanted so badly to be a campy Five Nights At Freddy's movie but it just failed. The Banana Splits Movie did the ""murderous animatronic"" thing much better a few years ago. I actually cared about characters and there was a more entertaining story. Watch that instead.",Willy's Wonderland
250,mgtrock,Awesome!,8,15 February 2021,"This film is not a star studded Oscar biopic, but good films don't need to be!It has a simple plot that is carried out well and Cage delivers without uttering a single word throughout the whole film and without going completely off the wall, I'm not a massive fan when goes full Cage and he hit the sweet spot in this.The effects are good, the colour visuals are good, the soundtrack is great and you'll be singing the creepy signature song for a long time.The film has the feel of many genres, a bit of grindhouse, a bit of b movie, a bit of western, a bit of horror etcI hope this is an upward direction for the director and not his peak as I'd like to see more at this level from him",Willy's Wonderland

253,mlwcsc,The FNAF movie we never got,7,17 July 2021,"Obviously don't go into this movie expecting it to be serious. It is dumb, it is silly and it is definitely entertaining.Cage's character is...weird and never really explained. My advise is to just not think too much about it and just go with it.The animatronics are largely on point, being different enough to not blend together and most being strange/creepy enough to work (a few of them kinda fell flat for me, but it is what it is).What keeps this movie from getting a better score from me is the rest of the human characters. The problem is twofold. Firstly, they simply don't really add anything to the story for the majority of the movie. In my opinion the movie would have been better off just leaving out the teenager subplot and focusing on the main storyline. Now I get why it was there, they needed bodies to kill, but it could have been accomplished in a better way. Secondly, and I don't know if it was the writing or the relatively inexperienced cast that is to blame, but the people just didn't work. They just seemed unrealistic and not in a fun caricature kind of way, but rather in a ""this is badly written"" kind of way.So overall an entertaining movie, with a good (albeit borrowed) premise, but it was weighed down by some of the acting and subplot.",Willy's Wonderland

The ""storyline"" is some kind of weird nonsense about the town sacrificing people to possessed animatronics which now house the souls of serial killers?I don't know... The action sequences are poorly shot, even more poorly choreographed, Ava ultimately stuck fun of of the movie. I mean, it could have been very entertaining with some effort, but none was given, and so it is not. We watched PG: Psycho Goreman right after this, and we loved that... I mean PG is ridiculous, but it's hilarious and clearly a labor of love for 80s and 90s shows imagined through a lens of bizarre humor.I only bring that up,bbecause that is what it feels they wanted WW to be, but falls short everywhere; its just not a good movie, at all.",Willy's Wonderland

While he's known for award winning and AAA blockbuster performances, I always enjoy seeing him in projects no one but him would accept and pull to their best potential. In recent years, Mom and Dad, Mandy & Color out of space really gained points with his mere presence, and boy does he shine when he's having fun. On par with those, this is a refreshing flick and I'm really hoping we keep seeing more pop up from time to time.

This is pure Nic Cage weirdness at its best. It's campy and stereotypical and over the top slasher beauty. This movie is a lot of fun and although filmed in a serious manner, it obviously doesn't take itself too seriously. All the characters are textbook stereotypes and they are acted well. There isn't too much of a script to ruin the action. The gore is there without being distracting. It's exactly what the world needs to just enjoy and not get too serious.",Willy's Wonderland
265,jasonleesmith6,"Not a Good Movie, But Sorta Fun",4,16 August 2021,"As I did when the ""Banana Splits"" movie came out, I am going to ask again ""Why don't they just make a Five Nights at Freddy Movie?"" This is yet another movie that clearly wanted to, but they couldn't get the licensing.The plot is simple: Nicolas Cage plays an autistic man who cannot speak. His car breaks down in a small town with an abandoned children's restaurant, ""Willy's Wonderland"" in it. The deal is the local mechanic will fix Cage's car if he spends the night cleaning the restaurant.The first problem is that everyone watching the movie knows exactly what's going to happen: The animatronic characters are possessed and try to kill Cage while he's locked in with them. There is absolutely nothing scary about a movie when you essentially know the entire plot from the movie poster.The second problem is that the evil animatronics are pathetically easy to kill. In Cage's battles with them, they appear so flimsy and off-balance that essentially the only thing you have to do to defeat them is to fight back in any way.The third problem with the movie is Cage, himself. While I have no trouble believing in him as an autistic janitor at a children's restaurant (which I think we all can agree is what he would be if his uncle wasn't Francis Ford Coppola), he is so robotic in his affect, that there is no sense of victory or even accomplishment as he defeats the bad guys. It is really no different from the scenes of him cleaning the bathroom or kitchen.Which brings me to the fourth problem: A WHOLE lot of the movie is taken up watching Nic Cage clean things. I get it, he was set the task of cleaning the restaurant and he intends to do just that, but that doesn't mean that it is, in any way, interesting to watch.So, this movie is sort of fun -- it gives you what it says on the box: Nic Cage fighting animatronic mascots. But there are no real thrills, and very little of the dark humor that one would expect in a movie like this. Essentially it is as robotic and lifeless as Willy himself.",Willy's Wonderland

I love how the janitor was so mysterious and you don't know who he is like he could be death coming back to steal the souls of the murderers in the animatronics or maby he was there as a kid and they killed his parents and now he's coming back for revenge.

This is a self aware black comedy with some decent gore and crazy kills, and another fun performance from Nick Cage. He's fully aware of the roles he's taking nowadays and he clearly has a blast making this one too, without saying a single word. His presence really helps this movie too, as he knew exactly what tone to go for.

Character development is pretty much non-existent and honestly not necessary anyways.While they probably spent most of the budget on the Camaro and Nic's hair, it looks decent enough and they happily went overboard on the spraying of guts and goo.Some nice middle-of-the-road camp for when there's nothing else to watch or to view with some friends for a few laughs (at most).

I think mainly because he doesn't mutter a singly word LOL. The films got a bit of a throw back to the late 70's horror movies. Old Nic is a drifter and while driving through the country, gets some flat tyres from road spikes. After being picked up and towed by the local mechanic (as he doesn't speak throughout the movie what did he say??) is informed they only take cash (no credit cards). So in order to ""pay his debt"", the local Mayor offers him a job cleaning Willy's Wonderland amusement for the grand re-opening. Nic takes his six-pack of energy drinks inside to get started. During the night however, he encounters various demonic presences which he'll need to sort out while doing his job. Un-phased by what's going, he changes empyee shirts and continues to do what he's been paid to do - clean Willy Wonderland. Some good gore, not too slow and a few funny moments.

Much like Clint and other stars of westerns, Cage is the lone wanderer who doesn't talk much, but speaks with actions. Ya know, the strong silent type.

It's all about Nic Cage doing one of his crazy Nic Cage performance (he doesn't utter a word for the entire movie), but I have to say it really works! A turn like this in a big budget action / horror film would just look stupid, but Cage and the filmmakers know exactly what they're doing; they keep everything low budget & garage enough to find the sweet spot between not taking yourself too seriously and not treating everything with utter contempt.

Made it all the more entertaining - not.

314,therealdklo,A fun twist on the haunted animatronics genre!,7,2 August 2021,"It's odd how many horror movies have come recently based on the unsettling appearances of mascot animatronics, but Willy's Wonderland is a different kettle of fish that deserves a special mention.Usually in these movies, the protagonist is completely powerless and is consistently in danger of being killed. In this movie, Nic Cage's character is a BADASS and it's kind of interesting to see the script flipped and technically HE is more of a danger to the PUPPETS.Some of the storyline, which is given in a full-length exposition form (that I appreciate - I always like knowing a film's proper lore), has holes in them. For example, what prevented the sherriff and everyone in the town from taking shotguns and just blowing off all the puppets one by one? Also - it's funny how Nic Cage's character is SO powerful that they had to add unnecessary teens trying to help him just to have a considerable bodycount. It all feels like manufactured, but in the end it's all in good, campy fun.",Willy's Wonderland
315,steilberg,It has its moments,4,24 February 2021,"Its a bad written script yet occasional fun to see the over-the-top stupidity unfold. I think Nicolas Cage don't even has one line.

316,tcslink,Why not?,8,19 February 2021,"Honestly? It was better than most movies I've seen this year. Is it the best thing ever?

The satanic ritual that brought the robots to life is supposed to be stupid and cliche - it's mocking the trope. This was obvious in the way the lines were delivered, and how ALL of the characters knew so much in extensive detail despite not being alive at the time.
This movie is a parody of movies, but still has much better characters than what Hollywood offers these days.

I love how Nick Cage said absolutely nothing through the whole movie and they just have scenes of him cleaning things. Obviously inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's, but it doesn't try to be a knock off, more of a parody. I'm not a person that can handle horror well, but this movie never gets to that point, though I wouldn't let your kids watch it. Some of the stuff that's presented to you ends up being a rollercoaster of information and then there's a sex scene where one of the animatronics is just watching them and rather than run off terrified, they keep going, which isn't even the weirdest part of that scene. It's meant to be a joke and you should watch it expecting nothing to make sense.",Willy's Wonderland

I found the mix of thriller, horror and comedy to be just right with the animation characters reminding me of Peter Jackson's ""Meet The Feebles"".I'll be honest and found the fact that Nicholas Cage didn't utter one single line to be refreshing and made him more entertaining to watch.But it wasn't all Cage through the movie with the rest of the cast doing a fine job and production was snappy with good camera views and sound levels. I must say the jingles that were done for this show are very catchy (as they should be) as I still have ""Six little chickens"" running around in my mind.Both the writer and director get my vote for what I consider good work but that is just my view.Cheers.",Willy's Wonderland

329,YoureAllRavingMad,Everything you could ask for in a Nic Cage movie,8,10 November 2021,"I get that this movie isn't for everyone, but I watched it on a Saturday night with a few friends and we had a blast. If you love B movies as much as I do, this one's for you. I was sold as soon as I saw the Netflix advert for it, which involved a sunglasses-wearing Cage staring down a sign with a cartoon weasel on it.Nicholas Cage plays a send-up of all the quiet, brooding, tough-guy loners you have seen countless times in action movies. He literally doesn't have any lines in the whole movie, but still manages to convey his character while getting increasingly more ""Nic Cage"" as the story progresses (read: insane). This could also be explained by the number of caffeine drinks he consumes as the night goes on. The animatronic puppets are sufficiently creepy, but if you want genuine scares this is not the right movie. After Cage deals with the first puppet assault, you never fear for his character's safety again. The teenagers who show up to torch the place provide adequate cannon-fodder, but for the most part this plays more as an action-comedy gore-fest, as Cage John-Wicks the s**t out of the puppets one at a time, until the kids come and try to ""save"" him, but just end up getting in the way.Overall, this is the best of B movies - lots of fun and clearly intended not to be taken seriously. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great movie night with friends who are fans of a good scenery-chewing Nic Cage performance.",Willy's Wonderland

One of the most different and unique movies he's been in to date is 2021's Willy's Wonderland.The basic premise of the movie involves a man looking for work who's offered a job cleaning at an abandoned children's playhouse. Upon working there he soon finds that the place is not as it seems when he's attacked by a group of singing and dancing characters inside.Meanwhile, a group of adolescents approach the place and upon learning of it's sinister history decides to burn it down. They see the man inside and try to lure him out. Seeing his refusal, they go inside to warn him of the danger. They soon see that he has it under control when he attacks the creepy characters that attack him. Meanwhile, the group engages in a struggle for survival against the creatures.The police hear of the people killed inside and upon seeing the man inside believe he is responsible for the deaths, even though one of the girls in the group try to tell them otherwise.This movie is very similar in tone to the Banana Split Movie and is recommended for fans of that movie or perhaps Child's Play.

Nicholas Cage's. The Janitor just does the normal Doom and Doom II (1993, & 1994 respectively) grunts that doomguy does when searching for a secret area.) and even the backstory of the animatronics could've been a little better aside from a satanic sacrificial ritual where the previous owner and employees (all serial killers and mass murderers by trade) sacrifice themselves to posses the animatronics and kill countless families in storage and back rooms of the restaurant. Even other horror tropes throughout one teenager gets trapped in the restaurant after trying to talk Nicholas Cage's character to leave while the others spilt up and are picked off one by one (with two of the teens getting killed shortly after a sex scene) verdict: while not good and definitely a so bad it's good type of movie this was still just a meh for me.",Willy's Wonderland

365,jamhough,Some questionable creative choices let it down,5,1 March 2021,"I'm a fan of the Five Night's at Freddy's video game series and the similarities between the games and this film had me intrigued. Obviously going into Willy's Wonderland I wasn't expecting a cinematic classic and was looking forward to a fun B movie. Five Nights at Freddys, Nicholas Cage, some 80's inspired cheesy
horror, how could it go wrong!? Turns out pretty easily.The film struggled to find an identity. Is it a horror? Well there's no real suspense or scares. Is it a comedy? The majority of the jokes fall flat. Is it an action film? Cage awkwardly beats up a couple of animatronics, so it has that going for it.The decision for Nicholas Cage's character to be mute throughout the film was a brave decision and one that didn't work in my opinion. Would have probably have been better if they gave him some dialogue (Think Arnie levels in Terminator) especially early on as some scenes just felt empty.
Emily Tosta was good as the young heroine playing opposite Cage, although she probably needed a little bit more direction in the action scene's. Her character definitely came across as the most real, overcoming the limitations in script and direction.Like most horror films the film is filled with stupid people making stupid decisions. Cage could easily have just left once he realised what was going on. But after every attack by an animatronic he went back to playing pinball and cleaning the restaurant like he was trying to become employee of the month. The group of teenagers who were too scared to enter and wanted to burn the building down to end the curse predictably ended up going inside. Then once inside rather than leaving again they split up and sneaked off to have sex.Sadly a film that had the potential to be a cheesy fun filled over the top action scare fest just fell flat and even the star power of Nicholas Cage couldn't save it.",Willy's Wonderland

367,mange01,Chicken soup for the soul?,6,21 February 2021,"One of the productions companies for Willy's Wonderland is ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"". A film about a mute, scowling Nic Cage beating satanic, animatronic animal mascots to death is clearly not going to qualify. It's more like a half-serving of fried chicken: cheap, cheerful and leaves you feeling slightly unsatisfied.I say slightly because while some things were pretty good, there's ultimately too much repetition and too little ingenuity for this to become a stone-cold cult classic. Things get off to a familiar start when Cage's unnamed drifter arrives in a desolate Nevada town needing to get his car fixed. Unable to pay for the repairs for unconvincing reasons, he instead is badgered into doing some light janitorial work at the abandoned Willy's Wonderland. Mopping the floor and scrubbing a few tables seems like a suspiciously good deal when the owner is offering to pay for your $1,000 repair bill in return, but that's because the Chuck E. Cheese-style restaurant is populated by various possessed, anthropomorphised animals, led by the titular Willy the Weasel.When Cage starts cleaning, the animals start attacking him and the revenge-seeking local teens arrive. Unfortunately, they're mostly anonymous and blandly-acted. The only two that stand out are gang leader Liv (Emily Tosta), daughter of the local sheriff; and Kathy (Caylee Cowan), Liv's bubble gum-popping, long sock-wearing best friend. Kathy's boyfriend Bob, Liv's fawning friend Chris and two other anonymous men round out the half-dozen. Try and guess which two die first. From there, it's pretty much 60 minutes of repetitious teen deaths, robot beatings, fizzy drinks and pinball. There's a certain amount of fun in watching Nic Cage beat a robot to death with a piece of wood but the unfortunately thin budget doesn't stretch to much in the way of imaginative kills and the film suffers from having a main character who is clearly never in any danger and supporting characters we're not really bothered about. You know who's going to die, so it's just a pity there's not more fun to be had in watching it happen.But, it does skip past and it's competently made. That probably sounds like a back-handed complement but it's not a bad film, just a missed opportunity to do something a lot more fun. At least Nic Cage is clearly enjoying himself while working off his tax bill, unlike the dour and miserable Bruce Willis. Mostly recommended, but it's got no rewatch value.",Willy's Wonderland

370,ratchetrizzo,This movie is worth paying $150.00 to see,10,14 August 2021,"Look, this movie has NO budget, is pure crap and completely unrealistic. What makes it worth paying EVERY CENT I SAID in the title is Nick Cage looks 35 (how they made him look 30 years younger with NO budget is beyond me but anyways). He looks like he's 35 and says like ONE word through the whole movie while killing Chuck E Cheese animatronics and POUNDING energy drinks like they're whiskey. It's completely and TOTALLY worth the time and money. I watched this and literally P*SSED myself from the enjoyment of seeing nick cage sell himself for like $2000, and a couple of shirts and a ride in a camero.Give the guy $10 for this on digital, seeing him go from leaving las vegas to main lining redbull to fight show-biz-pizza (NOTE, i specifically said showbiz since chuck e cheeze devoured them, so they left Nick ""National Treasure"" Cage with a $2000 paycheck for one day of work fighting whatever they could find at abandoned pizza palours. Its GREAT! I'm STILL P*ssing myself over this cause it had NO budget yet was 10000000000000000x better than ghost rider 2, but then again he pumped out Pig this year too and that was a serious movie that was REALLY good and to his standard. This movie is like watching someone get paid to smoke crack for a day and improvise 5 pages of a script while they constantly apply hair color for men.I *LOVED* it!",Willy's Wonderland

This film is in the Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness genre.Nic Cage rolls into a town whose Chuck E Cheese ripoff is haunted. The animatronic characters come to life and are quite murderous. He ends up spending the night inside the building and hilarity ensues.Cage's dialogue is brilliant. No joke. From the second the movie starts to the final frame, everything he says fits his character beautifully.While there is some exposition during Act 2 to really give you a break down of what's happening, other things go totally unexplained.This isn't The Godfather or Sophie's Choice.

It's a higher end B-Movie in the vein of 'good' B-Movies like Evil Dead 2 and is just a joy ride.
This isn't a masterpiece, but high marks for possibly creating a new kind of genre.
It has troupes galore, it keeps itself from becoming campy, is kinda hazy in the serious department but is saved by everyone giving an honest performance when opportunity for hammy it up was ripe.There's a little mix up in some of the artsy cinematography. From a B-movie it's the main thing that keeps it from reaching 'masterpiece' B-Movie territory. There's many other things to nitpick, and with some better acting here, better dialogue there, and a more cohesive alignment with various things....could have launched it to the stratosphere.Point being. This is great, for what it is. Overall, this is something. Refreshing and possibly new.Nic Cage has been kicking out tons of junk movies for years now. But about once a year, he's in a Diamond of a movie. Zero lines? He pulls it off. It's his 2021 diamond.",Willy's Wonderland

It's the strangest movie I've watched, by far, but it doesn't mean it's a bad movie, this is probably one of the funniest movies I've seen, and while some of the graphics aren't as good as some other 2021 ones, it's a really good movie!",Willy's Wonderland
381,liammarklh,FNAF but the security guard has had enough.,4,8 September 2021,"I'm just gonna say that I know full well what type of movie this was meant to be. It's one of those campy, over the top and nonsensical kind of movies that don't make sense in execution, has a lackluster story, flat characters and really terrible attempts at horror/comedy with passable action scenes, but you know what.... I'm still gonna critique it.As someone who loves FNAF, a friend recommended I check this one out and oh boy, they weren't lying about how wacky this movie was. As goofy and insane as the premise was, it was enjoyable to watch at points, but there were tons of flaws that just made me lose that sense of immersion.My personal enjoyment rating is a good 7/10.As for spoiler territory, the good parts about this movie are when Nic Cage fights the animatronics and they're the best scenes in the movie by far. He's a silent main character, but he really seems to be enjoying himself on set, given the improv pinball dance, so at least he's having fun with this small indie film.I also love the idea/concept of the story and the animatronics designs felt just original enough to be unique and also inspired by FNAF to seem like a nice nudge to the game series.Those are my only praises, the bad outweighs the good.As cool as making Cage this cool anti-hero who can destroy all the animatronics with nothing but a broken broom handle, a bag of soda and his bare fists, he becomes a Gary Stu, which is the male version of a Mary Sue.He's fun in the role, but his character is so overpowered in this movie that it was always inevitable that the side characters were dumber than a bag of bricks. If you have to make a character cool or likable by making the other ones weak or unlikable, then that's not really good character writing, its a power fantasy disguised as ironic horror comedy.When I say Cage is the only good actor in this movie, he truly is, because everyone else is bad in their respective roles.The teenagers are by far the dumbest characters I've ever seen in a movie, they're the clichés that you'd see in any horror film; the main girl who survives at the end, the token black guy, the promiscuous chick, the nerdy kid, the lover boy and the jerk (I love Chris, but he was better on Vine than acting in this movie).Their goal was to burn the pizza place to the ground, but their character motivations flip flop so much I almost got whiplash. One second they're determined to do this task, but then as soon as they end up trapped inside the place, it's like someone hit the dumb dumb switch and now they act like mindless drones who just stare into space or have little to no emotion when someone is killed right in front of them. Heck the main girl, Liv, watches all of her friends die before her eyes and all she can muster up is mildly shocked looks and some half hearted words of regret and sorrow, which makes no sense since they're her best friends, you'd think she'd be more heartbroken over their deaths, but whatever.I know it's supposed to be ironic comedy making fun of the genre, but these teens are so brain dead, you'd wonder if the Darwin Awards would do them justice.They argue and bicker with each other and end up falling through the roof, they split up and turn their backs on the animatronics when a few go missing from the stage and the horny girl and black guy think having woohoo time in the room where a satanic ritual took place was so titillating and gritty. It's just....wow.The sheriff is hands down the worst character in this film by far. I understand why she made a deal with the killer animatronics, but the second she's aware that this new guy is single handedly solving the problem, she decides that tying him up to be used as bait is gonna fix things. I'm sorry, but why are you incapacitating the man who's GETTING RID OF THE KILLER ANIMATRONICS THAT HAVE TERRORIZED YOUR TOWN FOR TWO DECADES!?Seriously woman, why are you so hellbent in aiding these robots when this man is dispatching them one by one? If he's able to do this by himself, then how were you not able to stop them with your guns or even a freaking stick of dynamite, they're machines with souls in them, not indestructible beings with infinite health. The new owner and the mechanic were overjoyed when all the animatronics were destroyed, so what's your excuse missy?(I will say if she had been a former accomplice to the original owner of the restaurant and kept up the pretense of saving the town, but partook in the killings, then I'd excuse a lot of her actions. But no she bends the knee to Willy and his goons, keeps up the notion that she's doing good and was willing to sacrifice teenagers to appease them despite the fact her problems all stem from them, so hogtieing Cage was the worst choice imaginable.)And another thing, if Cage was able to defeat these machines so easily with little to no weapons and no help, you mean to tell me that no one ever thought to blow the place up, set it on fire or even nuke it to high heaven!? Also this takes place in the South, so don't even tell me there's a gun shortage or strict gun laws around there because I find it hard to believe that guns wouldn't be able to take these things out in a flash. Heck a freaking stun gun is more efficient, but I guess logic flew over the writer's head when thinking of that.If these animatronics showed no mercy to even kids, I find it hard to believe that they'd let kid Liv stay alive out of everyone else, it's so contrived that it mind boggling.This is what happens when you make the main character overpowered, in order to make them look cooler, you make the other characters idiots to boost him up.The gore and graphics were alright, but the strobe light scene was harsh on the eyes and it was hard to get invested in the deaths when these characters were either flat as pancakes or so insufferable, I craved for them to die painfully.I'm sure people are gonna have concerns with me getting worked up over something that's basically mindless entertainment, but if the fun comes at the cost of making everyone stupid to facilitate the weak plot, choppy editing, boring deaths and lackluster lore, then I might as well turn my brain off completely and not even bother.If I could rewrite this film, I'd keep the premise, but instead of telling us the lore we'd learn about it through the Janitor's eyes, maybe explain his past through flashbacks, he could have been a kid who was traumatized by these machines hence his memories of pinball. I would suggest removing the teens from the movie entirely, they only serve as a pointless body count or failed comic relief.A better idea is to have Cage eventually go insane from killing the animatronics with some kind of sanity meter or have the energy drinks he keeps chugging down affect his physical and mental health, the more he drinks, the more he hallucinates and the subversion could have been that he killed these kids thinking they were animatronics, which honestly would have made this movie a 10/10 for me and then had the sheriff reveal she was helping Willy and his former human self from the very beginning.Instead we got this and.....I don't get it, maybe I'm just not cultured enough.",Willy's Wonderland
382,waynewashington,I guess people give 10/10 to anything nowadays,2,5 July 2021,"I give the movie two stars for two reasons. One is for the interesting concept, having a Chuck-E-Chese meets Child's Play with hints of Five Nights At Freddy's. The second is Nicolas Cage of course because it's Nicolas F'n Cage but that's me being generous. Overall, I found this movie to be underwhelming even for Nicolas Cage. I can see why Cage would be interested because he gets to fight animatronic mascots. But even the fights were bland. It felt like whoever made this movie was just doing their best to compensate for their low budget. I did my best to turn my brain off but I couldn't enjoy it. I know people will complain and argue ""What did you expect?""I'll answer that question with what would've made me enjoy this movie A LOT more than what was given. This movie could've had tons of new MEMEs and GIFs for Nicolas Cage fans to enjoy.1) Make Nicolas Cage's character actually be a Fictional Version of himself desperately looking for work and he ends up at Willy's Wonderland. Have him speak because Nicolas Cage is known for saying and doing outrageous things. Cage would've given killer one-liners while fighting the animatronics.2) Have fun with the fight scenes and setting. I would've loved for Cage and the animatronics doing wrestling moves, kung fu moves, and Mortal Kombat-Style Fatalities. All while using the Willy's Wonderland environment. Have them going through tables, the play-pin, slides, etc. If I had a Chuck-E-Cheese setting in my movie, I would use it to my full advantage in every way. They could've cranked it to 11 by having Cage lose his mind and eat one of the animatronics.3) Have Cage's character progressively lose his mind in a similar fashion as Ash from Evil Dead 2. Then once the teens get involved, Cage has been trapped inside Willy's for so long that he's lost a good chunk of his sanity and tries to kills them not knowing the difference between reality.4) There was a scene in the actual movie where a pair of teens randomly have sex inside Willy's when they were previously aware of the place's dark history and had a goal to rescue one of their friends. Would've made more sense if there was some Cabin In The Woods element to Willy's with there being an occasional smokescreen that hinder's rational thinking and increases libido. This justifies why the animatronics are successful in killing people and why the teens act stupid.5) In addition to the drug-inducing smokescreen, Cage is combating the effects with the Energy Drink/Soda Cans he keeps drinking. The movie was focusing on the soda cans as if they were an important aspect to the story. This would also justify why Cage is fighting back but also losing his mind because of the combination of the energy drinks and the smoke is too much to bear.",Willy's Wonderland

384,OriginalMyke,When 5 nights of Freddy's meets Nicolas Cage,9,26 October 2021,I personally loved this movie. Sure Nic does not speak the entire movie but he does not need to. That was actually the writers doing because he planned on doing the role himself.It is a lot like 5 nights of Freddy's except the main character isn't scared of animaltronics at all and is a total badass. Why shouldn't others make a run at this type of film sence 5 nights at Freddy's decides to take 20 years to make a movie about their idea that they have made millions off of already. It is long overdue to say the least. The animaltronics were a lil creepier looking too. They are not a cute like in Freddy's.In my opinion this was a comeback role for Nicolas Cage.

I have no idea why Nicholas Cage had no reaction to what was going on. He didn't even flinch when he started getting attacked by fluffy robots, it was just a thing that was happening.

399,daviddevilliers-91982,One Night at Willy's Wonderland,6,14 February 2021,"Okay, so as a massive Five Nights at Freddy's fan, I was really excited to see this movie. The icing on the cake was that Nicholas Cage was going to star in this movie. I saw the trailer and was definitely hype to see it.The story follows an unnamed main protagonist (Nicholas Cage) who's car breaks down in a small town. Without any money to pay to get his car fixed, and unable to pay by card, he is forced to work in a restaurant for one night as the janitor, where he is to clean up the place. Unfortunately, it was actually a lie. He was sent in there to be a sacrifice as the animatronics in there are actually alive and they're bloodthirsty. Together, with a group of teens, they have to survive the night.One major problem this movie suffers from is the characters. I found Nicholas Cage as silent throughout the whole movie to be weird, but it was still fun. However, the rest of the cast is either not very well acted, or they are just not likable enough. The reactions are just not at all what I expected. I was fine with the Janitor not being afraid of the animatronics, but the supporting characters, who were clearly there to be killed to show just how dangerous and terrifying the animatronics are, were just also so weak.The movie feels a lot more like a comedy than a horror, but it does have a few scary moments here and there.Overall, the CGI is pretty good and the practical effects are just wonderful. If you are a fan of Five Nights at Freddy's, you may actually enjoy this movie for what it is. If you're not, you may either like it or hate it. I thought it was good, and it definitely made me even more excited for the upcoming Blumhouse film, Five Nights at Freddy's.",Willy's Wonderland

It follows a lot of overused horror tropes which means it's really predictable, but it's all delivered in a satisfying way.There was plenty of ""blood"" and gore in the movie, but I honestly wanted it to go even further. If the animatronics made for some better fight scenes rather than ""getting their asses beat"" scenes, I would certainly have enjoyed it more.

419,joeyyyvela,A Work of Art,10,13 February 2021,"The verdict is in! Willy's Wonderland is an instant classic. Unique and original concept, flawless cinematography, Oscar-worthy performances from pretty much everyone, some of the best writing and dialogue I've heard in a long time, and groundbreaking special effects add up to a truly atmospheric, thought-provoking and genuinely moving film. Not only that, but the fight scenes are so well shot, choreographed and edited that they put Gareth Evans to shame. And beyond that, they provide incredibly deep and in-depth commentary on our glorification of violence. There's also fantastic symbolism and visual storytelling, such as the girl in the movie clearly representing Nicolas Cage's innocence that was stripped of him so long ago, and provides a path to redemption for him. The evil animatronics also represent the childhood trauma he suffered, and also explains why he breaks from his cleaning to viciously brutalize them.Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, this film was incredibly well crafted and every little bit was carefully thought out. Easy 10/10.",Willy's Wonderland

The comedic cutting in some scenes was spectacular, and you get a true Nic Cage experience.Don't go in expecting a serious plot, or anything other than what a Nic Cage movie promises.

465,olddaniel,Another horrible FNAF rip-off,2,2 March 2021,"Despite not being a huge fan of FNAF, the concept is pretty cool, but to make it a good movie takes dedication, a good script, a talented director and a decent budget. ""Willy's Wonderland"" has none. The opening sequence starts with Nicholas Cage who is 60, pretending to be on his late 30's driving a sports car and has an unhealthy obssesion with energy drinks. He has no lines during the entire movie, I guess he's supposed to play the silent protagonist in video games since obviously this movie is inspired from a video game, but it just doesn't work. His character has no backstory and gets boring since he doesn't get any character development as the movie goes on. He also seems to have some sort of superhuman strength as he is the only one who is capable of destroying any of the animatronics with little effort. The other characters in the movie are either there just to be killed or for some plot exposition. And some of them do REALLY stupid things! There is one moment in the movie where two teens have sex inside the ""Willy's Wonderland"" while being perfectly aware that killer animatronics are watching them and are about to kill them, one of the teens even say ""let's give them a show!"" Absolute cringe. As for the animatronics, it initally starts good with them being pretty creepy and staring at the actors when they're not looking, but once they start talking it goes downhill from there. Most of their dialogue consists of insulting the characters with crude language that is neither scary or funny. Having them not talk would have made them scarier. The special effects are cheap too. Some of the animatronics are clearly people in costumes, and it really ruins the movie's concept. Overall I don't recommend this film.",Willy's Wonderland

467,dreebilodeau,"Okay, I loved it.",8,7 March 2021,"First of all, this movie goes around the concept of Five Nights at Freddy's...but instead it's one night and there's Nicolas Cage.
I loved the looks of the Animatronics, the songs (it still ringing in my hears dammit) and of course, Sir Nicolas Cage. You just love the guy. Also, I want to start cleaning my whole house now.
The fact that Nicolas Cage doesn't speak at all in the movie makes me think of when you play the main character in a video game and you never hear its voice, only the other characters. Same concept here.
The reason I didn't give it a 10 is the sheriff. She should have mentioned a bigger incentive of why she wanted Nic to die when he offed more than half of the demons. It doesn't make sense. For exemple, she could have been stealing money off the dead corpses or reselling kids on the black market and she likes the deal going on, but just being scared and feeling sorry for one kid that survived doesn't make sense to me, that's why only 8 stars.
By the way, drinking that many sodas all the time, every hour...Nicolas Cage shouldn't have any teeth left (too much acid and sugar all the time). His mouth should hurt like hell...or maybe that's why he doesn't speak, he has no teeth anymore and he's shy about it, lol.
Anyway, that movie was pure fun. Better choreography and less shaky camera to cover it up would have been better but still, love the storyline.
Keep it up. Would love to see this character come up in another movie.
Like this guy just end up in bad small towns and get sucked in a trap but ends up getting rid of the problem without the townspeople helping him.
He could also have one new character each time to follow him around on his quest to ....well... I'll let the author fix that one.Just watch the movie. It's inspirational.

All the actors do a pretty good job, being your standard kind of cast to follow with the troupes.

But the funny parts and violent parts weren't great enough to make this more than a 5/10 (just a movie), and some other choices like the weird fisheye on the edges of the screen and not giving Cage any campy one-liners brings this movie down a peg.",Willy's Wonderland

Which he has some idiosyncratic tendencies that are NOT best left unexplained... But, they do leave them unexplained. This is just another example of how those making movies are not the artists but the ones that know who you need to know these days...As for the kids toys killing people, yea, same as the 1000 other times you've seen it so average scores for that part of the movie...",Willy's Wonderland
507,lfhlaw,Wickedly Funny without much gore,8,13 February 2021,Nicolas Cage chews scenery without even having to speak a word. This leans more toward an independent type film...think the first Evil Dead.....The plot is very straight forward...add kids and animatronics and mayhem ensues.

It has mild humor, quite a bit of gore and action.Go in expecting a flop, and you just might enjoy it. Hey, it's under 90 minutes. What've you got to lose? I've liked several of Nicolas Cage's recent movies, so I had to see this one.",Willy's Wonderland

Sure it was silly but it was different in a good way. Sure it was b-movie but it was funnier than other movies. Sure most of the actions and fighting didn't make sense but it doesn't matter anyway. That wasn't the point. Of course everyone in the movie made the wrong decision like any other thriller/horror movie. And I don't really care about the janitors back story. He is a right man in a wrong place trying to do only one thing that it's basically funny. To clean the place and go.
The acting of most of the actors will make you angry or frustrated and that means that they done their job right. They pass to you the feeling. I personally will remember it in a good way among other movies which trying to be serious or try to be something that they are not. This movie is making it clear from the start~",Willy's Wonderland

The acting was pretty terrible, and none of the characters were likeable or memorable but Nicolas cage made it pretty enjoyable nonetheless. I can't say much about his acting because I don't think he said a word the entire movie, but it was pretty cool watching him beat up animatronics. The gore was pretty cool but only about 1 or 2 decent kills. Obviously this movie isn't realistic, but it was just unfair against the animatronics. They easily kill the friends but can't kill the janitor at all even though it's so easy. The long tongue lady snapped some kids neck with her tongue but couldn't do the same to the janitor. It was a same with a lot of the other kills and it brought the movie down a lot for me. That's all the stuff I could remember off the top of my head though. Fun movie, maybe not for the whole family but it was really nice to watch a movie like this not thinking about the meaning of everything.",Willy's Wonderland

Does a good job of setting up the atmosphere and Nicolas Cage just kills it, literally. As for everyone else, you might be better off muting it when anyone has a speaking part. Acting is horrible... Sad they used so much shaky cam, took a lot away from the fight scenes and there's no reason to use Shaky Cam with Nicolas Cage. If you are looking for a stupid, fun movie, give this one a go. Don't expect ANYTHING from the acting, though. Probably the biggest reason Nicolas Cage has no lines and is just badass throughout the film.",Willy's Wonderland
528,jeanensmith,Cinematic Masterclass,10,26 October 2021,"Stumbled across this film when looking for a horror to watch with my housemates. Little did I know I'd discovered one of my new favourite films of all time.The title had us curious so we thought we'd watch the trailer to see if it looked any good and about a third of the way into the trailer I had to stop it - I had seen enough. We had to slap it on.25 minutes or so into the film, through our tears of laughter we decided to stop the film and look for a drinking game as there just HAD to be one out there already created. On Reddit we found one titled ""An Alcoholics guide to the One True Gods latest masterpiece"" and the rules are as follows:1. When Nic Cage drinks - drink
2. When Nic Cage changes shirt - drink
3. Nicholas Cage moment (You'll know it when you see it) - Drink.4. When Nic Cage takes off or puts on his sunglasses - Drink
5. When someone or something dies - Drink.Surely these rules won't get you that drunk? Seems a bit tame right? Nope. I can honestly say that after about 20 minutes of following these rules, myself and my housemates were sufficiently plastered.Back to the review.Nic Cage's performance was a masterclass. If you love Nic Cage, give this film a shot. You'll love it.If you're looking for a fun film to watch with friends or family you cannot go wrong with Willy's Wonderland. After watching the film I went online and bought a T- Shirt. We all did.Top film. 10/10. Without a doubt it'll be a film I revisit time and time again.",Willy's Wonderland

He just went there to phone it in,collect his paycheck and absorb most of the budget. I bet he doesn't talk because he only agrreed to do this if he doesn't have any lines to memorize so that he can half ass it. And he did.

540,mangosteak,Everything we wanted. And more.,10,15 February 2021,"What to write!? This film was never going to be a Tarantino-written, Spielberg-directed Nic Cage film. It was going to be a goofy, gory, zany and quite frankly iconic horror flick Nic Cage film to make your Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays just that much better.
At the end of the day, it's a ""has-been Chuck E Cheese"" knock off or FNAF knock off shoot-em-up starring an actor who doesn't have to speak to steal the show.
The animation style is absolutely spectacular - it's certainly unique in one sense, and in another, unnerving, disconcerting and downright uncomfortable.
The camera angles add to this, and from one perspective, it can be quite scary.
My tiny tiny problem that doesn't warrant losing a star in my opinion is that the opening scenes are paced too quickly, which makes the rest of the film seem one dimensional. You don't really feel attached to any of the characters because you don't really know anything about them, and if it was released when it was meant to be, which I think is October/November 2021, I think it would have achieved this much more successfully.
Overall though, it's exactly what was advertised. A dumb, self-aware, ironic film that has a rock-based soundtrack and an overused storyline. And because it was what was on the tin, I'm giving it 10 stars. Absolutely class work from an absolutely class actor.",Willy's Wonderland

Not gonna lie i thought this movie was decent for a cult slashing B movie riot, and knows that is not totally a horror film it has a few comedic elements that makes you have a thrilling ride. They way it potrays is like evil dead 2 and killer klowns from outer space meets pale rider especially FNAF Their will be goods and bads about it but mostly good so lets get started.Postive :
. Nonstop Action
. Suspense Rock music
. The Sets And Animtronic Designs
. Simple story telling but nicely presented
. Cool voice editing and animtronics movements.Mixed :
. Freshly well fast paced but could've been longer
. Average amount of blood and gore but wish it had creative kills
. Werid weapon choices that charcters use.Negative :
. Low budget used for big budget screenplays
. Some cringy dialoge in cheesy tones.Although people will get mad because its a FNAF ripoff but at the end of the day you got to realise that this movie wasn't made to give you nightmares it was made to have you honor and respect the quality it has so just have a great time from it and make it worth buying and watching, for that i will give it a B, by the way thanks for reading my review and have a good day.",Willy's Wonderland

Nicholas Cage. There's some creepy animatronics, occult back story, Campy teen sex, humor, blood and violence. What else were you expecting to see?

This is one of those movies that you could watch with even your grandma.Watch a guy beat some animatronics to death...YesHonestly if nick wasn't in this movie, I probably wouldn't be watching it at all and I think the role fit him well. Not to mention you're getting what the trailer showed you and I can't be mad at it. Also this movie brings some nostalgia, I haven't seen a movie so cheesy and authentic in years and I'm glad the quality was way better than other cheesy movies like a ""cabin in the woods"" or something.",Willy's Wonderland

This movie comes off as a B movie but it'll have you wanting more. Nic cage is in my opinion the only person who really suits the roll of ""the janitor"". A really fast paced movie makes you wish that there would be a second movie. At the end of the day it's anyone's preference on how you know this movie is supposed to represent, a five nights a Freddys theme, and with knowing that many people might enjoy the movie more.",Willy's Wonderland

It definitely doesn't take itself seriously one bit, and knows what it wants to be. It definitely succeeds at that for sure. The people giving this a low rating probably went into it expecting a masterpiece. It is a masterpiece, in its own way. It has amazing visuals, and most if not all of the animatronic characters are memorable and sometimes even funny. Some of the acting from the teenagers isn't great, but ill let it slide because Nic cage, while not saying a single word, is a total badass. This movie caught most peoples attention because Nicolas Cage is in it, and I hope those people enjoyed the movie outside of Nicolas Cage. While not a perfect film, its still a must see and is extremely enjoyable, especially with friends. 10/10.",Willy's Wonderland

582,sanonov,Great nostalgic movie,10,18 February 2021,Movie was really good for a low budget movie. I want to cover few things. 1st it was really nostalgic and I could see those old blod effects and stuff. In some parts it was pretty strong and you could see that those effect weren't real but I won't take a star for that because it was expected with low budget horror movie. 2nd Creatures were pretty well made and they really looked like animatronics. Kinda reminded me of fnaf. I also see how it goes like in every horror movie that everyone can be killed except the main character which is invincible. Well in some parts it was kinda unreal like when he was beating that animatronic with wooden mop and it didn't break but it was also funny in some parts. I can surely say that the best part was when Nick sat on Siren Sara and she was screaming and just throwing her hands and legs around. Also you've got a point for making nick killing them the same way as they did killed those kids. I was also hoping that Nick would say something at least in the end of the movie but it was really great showcase that movie can be good even if it's pretty silent. I can surely say that this was one of the best movies of it's kind and I can recomend it to everyone who is interested,Willy's Wonderland

584,jakediremain,My Review Of Willy's Wonderland (Spoiler-Free),10,19 February 2021,"Hi all, just a quick disclaimer, I have never written a review of a movie before, so I apologize in advance if this seems unprofessional.So to start, I would like to say that for a low-budget production company, this film was AMAZING.First I will start with the acting.
I can see how the average viewer would consider some, if not most, of the actors to be inexperienced, and thus not as good as someone like Nicolas Cage. However, because of my love for animatronic horror, and even just this movie in general, I am able to completely ignore whatever other people may consider ""bad acting"".
The animatronic costumes seem as accurate as can be, they actually make me think of them as animatronics. This is special for me, as the costumes in The Banana Splits Movie did not make me think of them as animatronics, due to the fact that they moved like humans in costumes.Now on to the effects. (Mostly the gore)
The effects seemed pretty great to me, especially for a low-budget film. The lighting, haze, and pyro all seemed very realistic and well done.As for the gore, I can see why most viewers would consider it cheesy, or even comedic. However, again I am able to set this aside due to my love for the movie. Now as for the amount of gore, I am very happy that they didn't overdo it, or unnecessarily prolong the scenes containing it. One thing that I do not like about horror movies is when they add unnecessary amounts of gore that would normally not be required in order to get the point across. I feel that The Banana Splits Movie heavily overdid it with large unnecessary amounts of gore, and disturbing injuries, which at times was hard for me to stomach.Now for the soundtrack.
The soundtrack was amazing. I loved every single song throughout the whole movie. Every song sounds awesome and they really go well with their respective scenes.Overall, this movie is amazing. People assume that it is a bad movie because they assume it to be bootleg Five Nights at Freddie's. Well, it sort of is, and at the same time, it isn't. It is FNAF-inspired, but at the same time it is its entire own thing. I really recommend you watch this movie if you haven't yet especially if you are a fan of FNAF or animatronic horror in general.",Willy's Wonderland

602,gavinrogers-21859,The most innovative masterpiece in not only film but media altogether,10,16 March 2021,"Nicolas Cage is now the single BEST actor ever. I have always been a big FNAF fan, ever since I saw Jack Black (a.k.a Jablinski Games for those of you who do not know who Jack Black is) sing the Living Tombstone's Five Nights at Freddy's song. Now this movie here has the GREATEST soundtrack I've ever heard, with classics such as: Heads Shoulders Knees and Toes, and It's Your Birthday. These add to the overall complexity and message of the film, being about, get this, society in a whole, as those who are lesser than those living Hayesville, Nevada (in their eyes, of course) who are subjected to the horrific events inside of Willy's Wonderland. The characters in this movie are not exactly its strongsuit. The best characters are probably all of them but my personal favorite is Nic Cage as Nic Cage, all of the animatronics, DaBaby, and Jordan Peele. All of these are in this movie. The action reminded me of DOOM (2016) and DOOM ETERNAL. These are video games. But this is not a video game. It is an hour and a half of pure ecstasy, watching Nic Cage beat the FLIP out of animatronics (even the really hot fairy one). The ending made me cry--not because OF the ending--but because the movie ended. It left me wanting more. Nic Cage should be able to pay off his debt with more and more of these movies, hence why I left it a 10/10. This is The Godfather of Nic Cage Horror Animatronic films.",Willy's Wonderland

But the whole scenario was unexpected. Like when the first robot started moving, Cage destroyed it in like a minute. And that was the fait to every robot basicly.

That being said, as someone who loves movies that are slightly... well, stupid, I loved this. It also helps that I'm a Five Nights at Freddy's fan. If you're a FNaF fan, and you found out about this movie through people saying it was a ""cash grab Freddy's knockoff,"" let me assure you that it really isn't. It has a very similar concept and you can even draw some comparisons between the stories of the film and the game, but at the end of the day it's a well made movie and if you love the FNaF concept then you'll probably like it.",Willy's Wonderland

626,Hank867,People are missing that this is a revenge movie.,10,20 June 2021,"The only backstory that makes any sense is that the one family who was killed in the opening of the movie was The Janitor's sibling and their spouse and kid, (who survives).The Janitor knew where they went missing and had to have researched the situation. He knew, or at least had a pretty good idea, of what he was heading into. He **wants** to hit those road spikes and get put in Willy's Wonderland.And it also explains his silence and his complete lack of surprise as the attacks start. And knowing exactly what he was walking into is the only explanation for why he knew he had to pace himself and take breaks and drink the ""Punch"" to get through the night. And that's why he wouldn't have anything to do with being rescued - Because this was a revenge movie.And, he figured out, or already knew, that Liv was his niece. And that's why they drove off together at the end - He at least reclaimed one member of his family who was lost.That's my take on it, anyway, that makes this movie rise to a ten for me.",Willy's Wonderland

The story was well put together, the violence with the animatronic characters was very amusing and over the top, and I ended up having a good giggle right up to the end.I loved Five Nights at Freddy's, and Willy's Wonderland (IMO) is an awesome homage to well enjoyed game.Definitely not the best work Nicolas Cage has done, but most enjoyable and worth a laugh.",Willy's Wonderland

Just like Killer Klowns from Outer Space from the 80s, this isn't a serious attempt at film-making. It's a serious attempt at presenting something that's over-the-top in how serious it is not, and it is simply perfect in its execution.Combine that with how hilariously bad it is, the 80s/90s horror movie tropes...everything is just dialed up to 11 to make it an instant cult classic.

661,angelinejhanson,"Movie errors up the wazoo, this movie sucks.",1,17 June 2021,"1) Where did that bear come from in the last bathroom stall? It literally popped out of no where. There is absolutely no way it could have just appeared. It is too big to move like that. I would have believed it if tinker bell was the creature in that scene but a massive bear? No. Poor choice.2) When the main girl wants to go in and save Nicholas Cage, literally when she was looking up at what we have to assume is the roof, she was standing in front of a GLASS window with wood covering it. Idk about anyone else but I would have taken those pieces of wood down and broken the glass. Very simple. Somehow she gets into the air vents from the roof, which we don't see how and it is so unrealistic.3) When the teenagers fell through the roof, somehow they all magically landed in the ball pit, unharmed with absolutely no injuries. A fall like that would easily harm anyone. The ceiling/ roof ended up looking like 8-10 pieces of 1 square foot pieces of sheet rock. How were they so perfectly shaped? Why was there no wood in the roof? With a roof concaving in that large of a scale, much more would have come down with them.4) When the teenager was trying to escape the tinker bell looking creature, she was attacked by her and screamed. All of the other attacks ended up with the kids/ people being killed. She somehow shows up in the next scene unharmed and not phased. We never saw the outcome and are left wondering, what happened? Somehow the director and writers left that important detail out.5) If Nicholas Cage is such a ""bad ass"" in this movie, how come he chose to play pinball, drink his stupid ""punch"" soda and continue cleaning while teenagers were being murdered? He literally walked away from the main girl as she was about to get attacked. That was so dumb. Does he have OCD/ autism? Is he intellectually disabled?6) Is Nicholas Cage a pedophile? That girl looks like she is about to graduate HS but they drove off together like they are about to be the next Bonnie and Clyde like wtf?This movie was awful. I didn't want to finish it but my husband insisted that we finish it. I was too tired to get my ass off of the couch and I enjoyed making fun of the lack of accuracy while he was enjoying the movie. Never can trust his judgement on movies again, after he excitedly said defensively ""this is going to be a cult classic.""",Willy's Wonderland
662,paisley066,Would have been less stars without Cage,4,17 June 2021,Nicolas Cage is too good of an actor for this movie. The filming style of it was B all the way. The movie would have faired much worse without Nics presence. Was this movie made on the cheap? Was the script written/produced/directed/filmed by people on some heavy drugs that all know little about making a movie? It definitely seemed like it. Then they thought the only way to get an audience was to get an A list actor for it. Why Nic? Why?!,Willy's Wonderland

The base story line was fnaf like, but this was so much more than I expected, the fact that the humans were able to fight against the animatronics was awesome.I highly recommend this movie because it's awesome.",Willy's Wonderland
664,randomtrp,So bad it's bad,9,14 March 2021,"Let me be clear: I did not willfully watch this. This movie is quite masterful in that it masters the art of telling nothing. With an hour and a half, Nicky Cage and 5 million dollars, it managed to tell nothing. There is no plot. Half of the characters have no lines (or I'd wish they had no lines, they're just that bad). This movie is a black hole. It sucks in your time, your will to live, and your brain, feasting off of it all like a parasite. In this way, life imitates art. Just as the animétronics suck away life, this movie also sucks away life. Just like Kathy sucks ****, this movie sucks ****.My friends pressured me into watching it, despite my best senses. In this way, my experience with this movie is my fault and I ruined my own life. At times I was secretly hoping that this movie was real, for then I could sacrifice my godforsaken friends to the animemetronics and then join them in tormenting my friends for eternity.A lot of people call this a B-grade film. I think that's quite generous. Those people are kinder souls than I. However, not all is bad. This film is definitely an experience, and your life will be changed forever once you're done. Whether that's for better or worse, it doesn't matter because you just wasted 90 minutes of your life and you will never get a chance to fix that.If you have nothing left to lose, and yet you still want to lose something, I'd recommend this movie. Or if you want to give someone the mens rea to go through with your murder, I'd also recommend it. Or if you're deranged enough to watch it for the meme, then go ahead (and promptly get some help following that).",Willy's Wonderland

Anyway this movie is very very fun!! I didn't want this to end. Nicolas cage is awesome and makes short work of the animatronics.. I actually wish the fight scenes lasted a little longer. But you get a major dose of evil animatronics.

Nicolas Cage has outdone himself once again, and thrown his name in the mix for best actor with his beautiful portrayal of the traveler, a man bearing great pain that we can all see our own reflection in. He faces off agains one of the most mysterious and complex antagonists in recent cinema history; Weasel Willy. The writing, acting, setting, and use of lighting are nothing short of spectacular.

You could tell from the way that Nic Cage played the lead role that even he had fun with it! Even though Cage doesn't have a single line in the movie, that just makes his character even better! The expressions and mannerisms that he puts into his role is done to perfection!I would love nothing more than to see a sequel to this amazing piece of art.",Willy's Wonderland

I raised my hopes when I saw the movie's trailer and then when i saw it it was just a waste of time but if you looking for some fun movies you'll give it 7/10",Willy's Wonderland
696,ld-46343,What?,2,9 April 2021,One of the worst movies ever. Does Nicholas Cage want to be paid extra per word he says? Did they not want to spend the money. Basically like FNAF but Nicholas Cage kills the anamtronics.,Willy's Wonderland
697,westleysmith,DID WE WATCH THE SAME MOVIE???,1,23 April 2021,"10/10 are you kidding me?Acting 0/10
Plot 0/10
Cage 0/10
What a fall from grace for an actor who used to be one of my favourites. He doesn't utter one word in the whole movie. A few wide eyed stares and bit of poorly choreographed violence is about it.A plot that is a bit of a rip off from Chucky, no originality there. You know, psycho killers reborn in animatronic bodies killing everyone that crosses their path. Oh but the acting. The idea seems fun at first but no, it's not. Maybe a comedy horror would have worked but this is only funny at it's direction. Actually hold on, the acting is laughable. Oh my it's shocking. Did I mention about the acting??Guys, give this one a solid miss. Nothing to see here.",Willy's Wonderland
698,fayeistooldforthis,The animatronics are better actors than most of the cast.,3,16 February 2021,"The dialogue is so bad, Nicholas Cage decides to spend the entire movie glaring into the camera rather than speak a word of it. The poor guy just wants to clean the set and get this movie over with as soon as possible, but the other actors keep getting in his way. Fortunately he has a ready supply of bin bags...This film would have been far better if you literally stripped out every scene that didn't involve Nicholas Cage.",Willy's Wonderland
699,mindybee,Just What It Says on the Tin,9,22 February 2021,"This movie is exactly what it's billed as - Nicholas Cage in a C+ slasher film. If you're not laughing the entire time, that's on you.The only thing we didn't like was the kids. Did not need that subplot at all. Could've watched a full 2 hours of just Nic Cage beating up animatronics with some backwoods townspeople to give exposition and would've been just as, if not more, satisfied.",Willy's Wonderland
700,keuys,Amazing movie!,10,6 September 2021,"Original, amazing and funny. Looks like 80's movie, trash and hilarious.",Willy's Wonderland
701,dmaumau-45354,A new low for Cage´s career,1,14 February 2021,"When you think Cage has hit rock bottom with his movies he show us he can sink a litte deeper. This is the biggest piece of crap I´ve watched in a long time, and let me tell, they have been making some high end crap latelly. Basically you´ll see a completely mute Cage fighting demonic muppets, playing pinball and drinking purple pops. That´s the movie. A secondary cast so bad your theet will hurt. We use to say the movie is so bad that makes you laugh. Not this one. It will only make you mad. Run Forest, run.",Willy's Wonderland
702,kentonfleischmann,Enjoy it,6,5 August 2021,Come on this is just great Nick Cage does this without one word. Silly. Awesome fun.,Willy's Wonderland
