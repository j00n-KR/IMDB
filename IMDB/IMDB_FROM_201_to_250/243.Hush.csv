0,SnoopyStyle,simple small horror,6,1 November 2018,"Maddie Young (Kate Siegel) is a deaf writer living alone in an isolated house in the woods. She lost her hearing at 13. Sarah is a neighbor friend who admires her writing. She gets killed by a masked man with a crossbow at Maddie's door but Maddie is unable to hear the commotion. Maddie becomes the next target of the sadistic killer.This is a really simple small contained horror perfect for Blumhouse. It's very solid with a couple of minor issues. The house, being such an important setting, needs a through tour to show the layout for the audience. John's arrival leads to a couple of more problems. First, he's tapping on the glass like she would hear him when he knows she's deaf. Second, he's suspicious but he can't know for sure about anything. It's more logical to separate yourself from the other guy and call the cops. The scene straddles a fine line between tension and disbelief. It slips over that line a little at a couple of points. The best scene is her considering all the possibilities and tying it back to her murder mystery writing skills. A cool way to end this would have been for the movie to go silent as the cops with their sirens come driving up the road. Instead it's only fading out the sirens which is fine but it doesn't trust the silence and insists on a sound effect. Honestly, the closing credits should all be done in silence. These are all little annoying choices which subtracts from my enjoyment of a really simple horror concept. Also I would figure this is scarier for women who live alone in big houses.",Hush
1,nogodnomasters,Can't run. Can't hide or leave.,8,8 January 2018,"Maddie (Kate Siegel) is an author who lives in an isolated community. She is also deaf and mute since age 13. Add a psycho killer with a crossbow and you got our story of the typical fighting, hiding, oops a neighbor type of film we have seen before and even with blind people. Kate sometimes hears voices in her head that help her write, now they are trying to save her life. This was a pretty good home break-in type of film. it follows the formula and as such was too long in the middle during the run and hide scenes. Guide: 1F-word. No sex or nudity.",Hush
2,kosmasp,Stuff happens,5,18 November 2016,"I don't know if it's supposed to be ironic that the main actress who plays a writer, also co-wrote the story here. Maybe it's supposed to have that Meta level feeling and for some that may work more than for others. Other than that this tries to distance itself from the usual home invasion shtick, by having its lead being deaf. It's made clear from the beginning what you are about to get.Overall it's decent, but even with that ""different"" approach (and without any major jump scares, for better or worse), this is pretty decent. But it doesn't really have the weight to carry itself even with only around 80 minutes to ""play"" with (no pun intended). Major character flaws and holes in logic/script in general may give you pause, if you actually try to tackle what you see. If you just watch and enjoy, not minding anything and just being gripped by the ""hunt"", then obviously you'll enjoy this more",Hush
3,Sleepin_Dragon,"A gripping watch, brilliant.",9,3 February 2018,"I've skimmed past this film several times and paid it little attention, a few minutes in after the opening pleasantries the film switches in tempo, and what follows is a gripping, unnerving and at times uncomfortable watch. I think because the victim is initially unaware of the perpetrator, the film is given a different twist, plenty of thrills follow. Listed as a horror, I suppose the premise fits it into that genre, but in reality it's very much a psychological thriller. Don't get me wrong there were some scares, like the bath scene, but generally it's a thriller.Kate Siegel and John Gallagher Jr. are just incredible, two particularly good and contrasting performances. Perhaps because the film features less dialogue then the norm you are encouraged to watch it without looking away at phones and tablets etc, you are forced into a greater concentration.So much more then the usual house invasion film.",Hush
4,gavin6942,A Strong Horror Film,7,4 August 2016,"A deaf writer (Kate Siegel) who retreated into the woods to live a solitary life must fight for her life in silence when a masked killer (John Gallagher) appears at her window.Stephen King tweeted about the film on April 20, 2016, saying, ""How good is Hush? Up there with Halloween and, even more, Wait Until Dark. White knuckle time. On Netflix."" Now, I don't necessarily always agree with King. He's a giant in horror, of course, but that doesn't mean taste can't vary. However, an endorsement from him never hurts and in this case I think he is right.Maybe this is not as good as ""Halloween"" (that seems outrageously bold), but the comparison with ""Wait Until Dark"" is perfect. While that film is a classic, in some ways this one goes an extra step -- the movie is not silent, but is very, very sparse on dialogue. That would be like ""Wait Until Dark"" being a radio drama.For ""Hush"", we have an excellent use of reflection, the smooth camera movements are great, and everyone involved makes this far better than the average horror film. In fact, while I would say horror on average is getting worse, this film allows me to believe it can get better. I just have one question... is the title a ""Buffy"" reference or what?",Hush
5,jboothmillard,Hush,5,4 July 2020,"I would often see the image for this scary movie, produced by Blumhouse Productions (Insidious, Sinister, The Purge, Get Out), every time I would look at my list of things to watch on Netflix, it looked and sounded like it could be good. Basically, Maddie Young (Kate Siegel, also writing) is a deaf and mute woman who lost her hearing and speech as a teenager following meningitis and a failed corrective surgery. She has since become an author and lives an isolated life in the woods with her cat. One evening, her friend Sarah (Samantha Sloyan) visits her to return a copy of her latest published book. While discussing her writing, Maddie says that she visualises her stories, considering numerous endings before deciding on one. Later that night, a masked killer attacks Sarah and chases her to Maddie's house. A bloodied Sarah bangs on the door shouting for help; her cries are unheard because Maddie cannot hear her, and the man stabs Sarah to death. The killer realises Maddie is deaf and decides to make her another victim. He sneaks into her house, steals her mobile phone, takes photos of her, and sends them to her by email. Maddie realises she is being stalked, but the stranger cuts the power and sabotages her car to prevent her escaping. Maddie uses lipstick to write on the glass panel door, ""won't tell, didn't see face, boyfriend coming home"". The man (John Gallagher Jr.) responds by taking off his mask and revealing his face. Maddie tries to distract the man with her car alarm long enough to grab Sarah's phone from her body but fails. Mocking her, the man pockets the phone as well as one of Sarah's earrings. Maddie then tries to escape the house from the second story window, climbing onto the roof before climbing down the side. She is shot in the leg by a crossbow bolt, but she manages to knock the man off the roof and steal the crossbow. She staggers back into the house, removing the bolt from her leg before trying, unsuccessfully, to reload the crossbow. John (Michael Trucco), Sarah's boyfriend, arrives at Maddie's house looking for Sarah. The man appears and poses as a police deputy responding to a call. He claims he was knocked unconscious by an intruder. John is suspicious of his story, eventually seeing through his deception and gets ready to attack him with a rock. But Maddie knocking to get his attention distracts John and he is stabbed in the neck. John bleeds to death but gets the man in a chokehold long enough for Maddie to escape. However, Maddie realises that any attempt to escape or hide will result in her being caught or bleeding to death; her only chance for survival is to kill the man. Outside, the man is struck in the shoulder with a bolt, fired by Maddie. While retreating into the house, she drops the last bolt outside. Before she can grab it, the man slams the sliding door shut on her wrist, crushing her hand, until he allows Maddie to pull her mangled hand inside and close and lock the door. When he threatens to enter the house, Maddie writes ""do it, coward"" on the door with her own blood. As the man begins bashing the door to break the glass, Maddie rushes to her computer, typing up a description of the man and a message to her family. She concludes by writing that she ""died fighting"" before shutting her laptop, arms herself with a knife, and locks herself in the bathroom. The man has given up trying to break the glass and is making his way through the bathroom skylight, unbeknownst to Maddie. She is alerted to his presence when he inadvertently breathes against her neck. She narrowly avoids his attack and stabs him in the knee. Maddie stumbles into the kitchen, where she blinds the man with bug spray and the loud vibrating smoke alarm, disorienting him. He regains his sight and starts to strangle her. On the verge of death, Maddie grabs a corkscrew and plunges it into his neck, finally killing him. Maddie retrieves her phone from the man's body and dials 911 before stumbling outside. She sits on the porch and sees the blue police lights approaching, and strokes her cat smiling as she will finally be rescued. Also starring Emma Graves as Max. Siegel gives a good performance as the deaf woman terrorised by an unnamed killer, and Gallagher Jr. revels playing the killer who is having fun stalking the poor defenceless silent victim. It is a clever mix of a home invasion movie, crossed with some slasher conventions, the format is a little questionable at times, but it is well-paced, and has just the right amount of violence, tension and thrills, a fairly good horror. Worth watching!",Hush
6,BA_Harrison,Deaf and very dumb.,4,18 April 2016,"As the result of a bout of meningitis at the age of 13, author Maddie (Kate Siegel) is now unable to hear or speak. One evening, while struggling to write the ending to her latest book, she comes face-to-face with a psychopath (John Gallagher Jr.) armed with a knife and crossbowI have to question the wisdom of an attractive deaf and mute woman opting to live alone in an isolated house in the middle of the woods without any form of self-protection: doing so makes her dumb in more ways than one. She's not alone in her idiocy, though, because the men in this film make equally bad decisions—choices that prove very costly indeed. The attacker frequently allows opportunities for his victims to gain the upper hand, despite supposedly being experienced at the killing game, while neighbour John (Michael Trucco), who comes looking for his missing girlfriend Sarah (Samantha Sloyan), clearly possesses the IQ of a potato: he actually believes that the bad guy is a cop, despite him looking more like a textbook criminal than a lawman (unshaven, wearing a hoodie and sporting a neck tattoo).Although directed with style by Mike Flanagan (Absentia, Oculus), and well acted by its limited cast, Hush is still plot-hole ridden, derivative dreck that delivers very little in the way of innovation, save for a single scene where Maddie uses her analytical writer's mind to run through the potential scenarios and come up with a plan. She opts to fight, which leads to the inevitable bloody showdown that, once again, offers nothing new to the home invasion genre.",Hush
7,paul_haakonsen,"Predictable and generic, sure. But still entertaining...",6,23 August 2017,"I had no expectations to ""Hush"" because I hadn't even heard about it prior to happening to find it in the horror section. I read the synopsis and found that it sounded interesting enough. So I decided to give the movie a go.Writer Kate Siegel and writer/director Mike Flanagan had put together an entertaining enough movie, though this was hardly a revolutionary movie within the genre. The movie was fast paced and well-told, although it did suffer from being generic and predictable, as many movies in this particular genre tend to be.The ensemble of acting performers on the cast list was fairly limited, so there was a bit more of a performance pressure on their shoulders. It should be said that the actors and actresses in the movie did carry themselves and the movie quite well. Kate Siegel was really outstanding with her performance in the movie, and she was the one doing most of the lifting.This is more of a thriller than it was a horror movie, so don't expect to be scared out of your seat. This is the type of movie that slowly sinks in and creeps under your skin.""Hush"" doesn't make much use of special effects or CGI, but director Mike Flanagan proved that the movie didn't really need to rely on such effects in order to be effective and entertaining.This movie is actually well worth taking the time and effort to sit down to watch if you have the opportunity. But I have to say that I hardly see myself returning to watch the movie a second time, because it just doesn't really have that repeated viewing quality to it. My rating for ""Hush"" is six out of ten stars.",Hush
8,blanche-2,made me a nervous wreck,6,7 September 2017,"Kate Siegel stars in ""Hush"" from 2016, a thriller co-written by Siegel and her husband, the director of the film, Mike Flanagan. The main character, Maddie (Siegel), has been a deaf mute since she contracted meningitis in her teens. An author, she lives an isolated life in a house off the beaten track, and at the moment, she's working on a new book.A masked intruder cuts off her electricity and terrorizes her.This isn't a horror movie, which is the reason I watched it. It's very exciting in spots, and I was very happy when she finally did what I had been screaming (mentally) for her to do the entire film.""Hush"" is entertaining, but it's full of holes. Normally in any film of this kind, I don't ask for realism, but despite an excellent premise and a wonderful performance by Siegel, it doesn't hold up under scrutiny.First off, why is a deaf mute living in a place with so little civilization? Her lifelines are her phone and her computer and without them, she's without help. Second, who is this guy? We don't know. He's a murderer, and I guess he's just out seeing who he can kill tonight. We get no background. And he takes his mask off too early - it would have been eerier if he'd kept it on.What would possess the neighbor to believe this maniac is a cop?Finally, Maddie and the killer's cat-and-mouse game is strange. I don't know where she was planning to go the times she left the house - somehow that seemed unwise. The killer made some unwise choices himself, and either one of them could have killed the other many times and did not.This film had unrealized potential had the script been better. I do applaud them for not doing one usual cliché - you'll realize what it is. I give it points for keeping me on the edge of my seat.",Hush
9,Quinoa1984,We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!,9,17 May 2016,"As with the first major film from director Mike Flanagan, Absentia, and to an extent Oculus, the originality of a set-up isn't the most concerning thing. Everything for him comes down to storytelling, storytelling, g-ddamn visual storytelling. How are you going to set up your shots, get your actors to connect with the audience, to make sure that past the set up that he knows we've seen before - a man comes back after years being 'missing' but what he missing; two adults fight back against the demonic entity that took their parents; a woman who is deaf has to stop a home invader-killer - and make it CINEMATIC? I put the emphasis on that last word because many horror movies tend to forget that last part (the most awful and excruciating example being Unfriended, but I don't want to crap on Blumhouse getting something right here so I'll let that go for now). It can't just be the situation, and a director has to keep that in check when putting forward all of the dots together. This doesn't mean a movie like Hush is anything perfect - in fact it almost falls apart in the last five to ten minutes, and I wish they had used the fact that this protagonist is deaf a little more, at least as something dramatic that could be used against her (it does happen, just not enough) - but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.Why should you stop what you're doing and check this out on Netflix? Well, the larger question is why didn't this get a theatrical release? This is shot as something that really should be experienced in a theater, or at least in the dark with awesome sound and a bright, large screen. For lack of a better term, Flanagan's canvas is sharp as a tack, and as much as I can praise the cinematography (and I do), the writing from Flanagan and Siegel is what's sharpest of all.All of these actions that the characters take, whether it's Maddie or the killer, have to be written out and thought out. In this sense it's closer in scope to No Country for Old Men for major portions, with those set pieces where the characters face off, go from one part of the house to the other, and there's barely a word (if any at all, usually there isn't) in the space of five, ten, fifteen minutes at times. I felt in the grip of this film not because its concept was anything mind-blowing (though, for once in I don't know how long, it makes sense and is logical to be set in a rural environment surrounded by trees), but because I get caught up in what each figure, hero and villain, will do next, and the vulnerability of her position made me think what I would do in that position, deaf or not.Are there some contrivances? Sure. And in the time this evening since I've seen the film I've thought of some things that can be nitpicked or taken apart. It's not as complex as Absentia or as visually warped as Oculus. But for what Flanagan and his co-writer/star Katie Siegel set out to accomplish (she completely sells every moment she's given, every breath, every time she has to do things like pull back the bow and it doesn't quite get all the way repeatedly), and within their limitations they set for themselves, it's an awesome success. If you like (honest to goodness ie Halloween 78') slasher flicks, or when a home invasion movie has reasonably solid logic (note: this isn't The Purge in case you're wondering, there's no politics or any big questions like that) and just want to get completely scared out of your minds, this is the thing to watch right now, and Flagan is one of the dependable young filmmakers working in horror.",Hush
10,michaelRokeefe,Quiet for a slasher movie,7,8 July 2020,"In some ways not your ordinary horror movie. Director Mike Flanagan is also credited as co-writing with star Kate Siegel, who plays a deaf writer secluding herself in a home in the woods. She has learned to live with her disability; but how is she to tell when a killer is peeping in her windows. Not a lot of sound cues to warn you of shocking moments...and there will be some jumping in your seat. The psychotic killer's motives are pretty hushed. Flanagan hasn't revised how to tell a home invasion story, but sure gives you enough wiggle room.The cast also features Michael Trucco, Samantha Sloyan and John Gallager, Jr.",Hush
11,Calicodreamin,Suspenseful!,6,29 October 2019,"This movie ticks the suspenseful box for sure, I've never screamed at the tv so many times. Now that being said, most of the times were due to the complete idiocy of the main character. She takes forever to get a weapon, wanders around the house with no plan, lays on the floor crying... it's so annoying! get up and kick this guys butt. But it had some great moments and the cinematography and special effects were well done.",Hush
12,evanston_dad,Gimmick Horror Film That Doesn't Sustain Its Gimmick,7,28 April 2016,"Home invasion horror movies aren't even worth making anymore unless there's going to be a gimmick that sets them apart. In ""Hush,"" the gimmick is the deafness of the protagonist, a young woman who lost her hearing to meningitis as a teenager and now lives in a secluded cabin in the woods (of course). The man who wants to kill her wants to kill her just because, and he enjoys terrorizing her first. Her deafness is portrayed as both a hindrance and an advantage. On the one hand, she can't hear her stalker but he can hear her; on the other hand, she's forced to think creatively and act in ways that her attacker isn't necessarily expecting.The film's set up is handled well. In an opening scene, we're almost overwhelmed by the snap, crackle, and pop of the heroine making dinner, sounds we would normally take for granted thundering at us over the soundtrack. This primes us to pay attention to aural cues throughout the rest of the movie, and indeed one finds himself cringing at each little squeak and rustle the protagonist makes as she runs and hides from place to place. At one point, she realizes the only way to beat this dude is to do the one thing he won't expect, and that's to fight back and kill him. And while I agreed wholeheartedly with this sentiment, I also found that the air goes out of the film a bit from that point forward. The filmmakers make such a point of establishing her deafness early on that I wish that condition had played more of a role in her actually triumphing over her attacker. But in the end, her deafness becomes beside the point and she deals with him much the same way as anyone would. It's refreshing to find a heroine in a horror film who doesn't act as a ninny, but by the end, gimmick aside, there wasn't much to distinguish ""Hush"" from any number of similar films. The film it most reminded me of in recent memory is ""You're Next,"" which wasn't a great film either but did a better job of sustaining its gimmick premise all the way through the film.""Hush"" does have some nail biter moments though, and horror fans will probably want to check it out.Grade: B+",Hush
13,morrison-dylan-fan,Hush Hush Sweet Maddie.,9,4 October 2016,"2013:Left with my nerves shredded by the reflecting Haunted House film Oculas, I kept a look out for film maker Mike Flanagan's next production.As time passed the only thing that I would hear about Flanagan's next project was it being caught up in studio issues (with the resulting offering Before I Wake finally coming out now after a long delay.)2016:Taking a look at what has been recently added to Netflix UK,I was completely taken aback to see a brand new movie from Flanagan on the site! Which led to me deciding to speak up.The plot:Attempting to come up with a fitting ending for her new novel,deaf author Madison ""Maddie"" Young is visited in her quiet woodland cottage by Sarah,who talks to Maddie about how much she has enjoyed reading her latest book. As Maddie sits writing her novel completely unaware later that night,Sarah rushes back hammering on the door,which is stopped when a masked wearing man kills her. Soon realising that Maddie is deaf,the killer starts making plans to use Maddie's silence for the sound of death.View on the film:Continuing the masterful use of sound turned up in Oculas,co- writer/(along with Kate Siegel) editor/directing auteur Mike Flanagan brings noise to Maddie's life with a blending a crisp echoes and minimal visual effects casting waves from the reverberation of the killers footsteps. Taking place in the ""real world"" Flanagan retains his supernatural Horror roots in close collaboration with cinematographer James Kniest and sound editor Joshua Adeniji,as long drawn shadows of the killer are scatted across the outside of the house in dazzling crane shots coiling up the tension, unleashed in bursts of ultra-stylised violence that seep under the shaking floor of the porch.Shot for just $70,000 in 18 days,the screenplay by Flanagan and his wife Kate Siegel keep their sit-in lean and very mean. Dicing the Home Invasion Thriller with the blood dripping Slasher,the writers brilliantly link both genres via the merciless attacks from killer (who is only one of five characters!) hitting the Slasher gore notes,whilst the locked-in Maddie gives the movie a brittle hostage Thriller atmosphere,as Maddie looks out of the windows to the pitch black silence of the killer.Ripping up his nice guy looks, John Gallagher Jr. gives a gristle- chopped,ruthless performance as ""Man""/the killer,with Gallagher finely walking between giving the psycho an unsettled mood for random acts of violence, whilst talking to Maddie in front of the windows in a chillingly calm manner. Spending 70 minutes (of an 81 min film) without a single line of dialogue to react from, Kate Siegel gives a superb performance as Maddie. Spending time with people in the deaf community,Siegel subtly expresses the horror waving outside Maddie's house with her care-free body language hardening into a mould of horrified anxiety,as the killer tries to hush Maddie up.",Hush
14,Wizard-8,"Not dull, but there are definite script problems",5,13 July 2018,"The Blumhouse production ""Hush"" may have got a little inspiration from the 60s movie ""Wait Until Dark"", though this time around it involves a woman who is not blind, but is deaf. And probably due to the low budget, the woman this time around is only threatened by one intruder instead of several. Despite the low budget, the movie does not really come across as cheap, as is usual for Blumhouse productions. And the whole package overall comes across as watchable... but that's all. As I indicated in my subject line, there are some elements in the script that really scream for a rewrite. The bad guy's motivation is basically that of a masked killer from a 1980s slasher movie - namely no motivation (or real personality) at all. And it seems very silly that he keeps toying around with the heroine for a very long time, even when she starts to inflict some serious hurt on him. There are other elements hard to swallow, like how he manages to impersonate a police office despite not having a uniform or badge, but I won't bore you with those details. The movie still commands your attention despite such plot stupidities - there are some suspenseful moments, for one thing - but the sometimes bad writing really holds it back. Had the screenplay been a lot smarter and realistic, we might have had a sleeper of a thriller here. But as it is, it just passes the time, and not much more.",Hush
15,FlashCallahan,The silence deafens my ears.......,7,19 April 2016,"As high concept horror/home invasion movies go, this can be filed under 'why didn't anybody think of this before?'.And it's a wonderful concept. We have a woman whom has obviously just come out of a terrible relationship, and does what any sane person would do and seek solace in a cabin.......a nice cabin mind you........but in the woods.She has all her friends and family at hand via technology, and she just wants to concentrate on writing her next novel.And talking of novel, she just happens to be deaf, so already the tension has risen above your standard home invasion horror, because we automatically know that the killer could literally walk up behind her and kill her.But that wouldn't make for a very interesting film would it? anyone who is a fan of the horror genre knows that the killer likes to taunt his victim, the main victim that is, the other people in the film (in which there are very few) are offed before you can shout 'he's behind you!!', but that is the usual Cliché in this type of films.So it's a taut cat and mouse game between the victim and the victimiser, Gallagher jr is a formidable villain, and it makes the film that little bit more sadistic when he takes of his mask very early in the film and reveals himself to be, for want of a better word, a normal looking fellow.Siegel makes great use of the disability and adds an added depth to the film.There are a few very difficult to watch scenes, one of the kills is particularly gruesome and is borderline exploitation, and when you know the killer is in the house, and the film goes into 'deaf-mode', it almost becomes unbearable to watch.the film does have the traditional tropes of the heroine being a terrible shot and running one way when she should go the other way, but in this instance, it only adds to the fun of the film, which is nothing more than a well executed high concept b-movie.The ending is a bit of a letdown and screams of lazy writing syndrome, it's your old last ditch attempt to foil the killer, if the ending had been different than this one we see over and over again, this could have been something really special, rather than just being very good.It could start a trend in making disability based home invasion movies Night Vision: a blind voice actress is subjected to a night of terror by an unmasked assailant.Oxygen Tent: A COPD suffering architect is subject to a night of terror by a cigar smoking assailant.And don't get me started on Boxing Helena.",Hush
16,trashgang,pure horror old style in your face,9,1 June 2016,"Oculus (2013) directed by Mike Flanagan wasn't my cup of tea so I wasn't that eager to go watch his next flick Hush. Haven't seen any trailers or reviews I didn't know what to expect but what can I tell you, this is completely the opposite of Oculus.Even as it just has 5 people throughout this flick it just doesn't matter because it will get you by the throat. What an excellent horror this is, Oculus was a perfect example of the new style of horrors, not that scary at all and mostly about the supernatural but Hush is back to the old style horrors. It's suspenseful from the beginning until the ending. This shows that a simple story, a house invasion not being explained who exactly is the killer, I suppose it's her ex but later on his weapon you can see marks, is it the account of victims, I don't know and it doesn't matter at all. It starts rather simple with a girl cooking but quickly you will notice that she's a mute and that's exactly the strength of this flick. Once the home invasion starts you will have a few jump scenes but not only that, when the red stuff if is flowing it's done in a messy gory style. A great horror flick worth picking up. About the end you can have your doubts when you hear the police car but it didn't bother me at all, straight in your face pure horror, finally a excellent one.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3,5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Hush

18,KineticSeoul,Decent short thriller.,6,12 April 2016,"This isn't one of the scariest horror movies I have ever watched. As a matter of fact this is more of a thriller. I however thought it was well done, especially since it goes away from most formulaic horror movie elements. Such as jump scares, with a movie like this I was expecting some jump scares. But it's like the director was like ""No, that is so generic and it's getting old...Let's not do that"". This is a home invasion horror movie where you don't know the killer's motives or why he does the things he does, except that he is a psychopath. The plot is about a psychopath that tries to invade a deaf and mute woman's home that is located in the and tries to play a game of cat and mouse with her instead of just going for the kill. So yeah, so aspects of this movie doesn't make much sense. Like why would a deaf and mute woman being doing the middle of the woods, even if she is a writer. I did like the way the deaf woman tried to use her wits to survive although she made few annoying decisions then and there. But when you are deaf and mute and crazy stuff is happening, you might not be able to think straight. The reason why this movie wasn't all that scary to me was because the killer came off more like a incompetent doofus than a menacing figure. I guess it's too give the deaf and mute girl a fighting chance, but the killer just seemed so weak. Your as an audience won't be on the edge because of what the killer will do next, but will be looking forward to what he is going to do next that will screw up his chances. Fear comes from the unknown and not having control, it doesn't really give off that vibe much in this movie. Overall this is more or a thriller than a horror movie and it's a decent one. I especially like the thought of how a amateur filmmaker could make a decent film, with the right acting and direction.6.8/10",Hush
19,sddavis63,Slasher Movie With A Twist,2,29 May 2017,"Maddie's deaf and mute. That's about the only thing that differentiates this from a lot of other movies that do basically the same thing. The first 15 minutes or so set us up to understand without any doubt that Maddie's deaf and mute, and then the killer shows up - having killed Maddie's friend and now trying to break into her house to kill her as well. He cuts the electricity to the house, making this a very dark movie (yes, in plot - but I'm talking about the lighting.) It's really dark and you can't see much, so you have the irony that Maddie can see but she can't hear and the viewers can hear but can't really see. A lot of this depends on noises - footsteps, breathing, sobbing, alarms ringing, etc. But for me it fell kind of flat. I wanted something more visual and I found that the movie (mostly in darkness with little or no dialogue) was difficult to remain focused on. In fact, the first time I watched it I fell asleep. I did give it another try and I made it all the way through - but not without some effort.It's a pretty simple movie (one with more than a few plot holes and/or pretty dumb scenes and/or characters) with a small and little known cast and a very simple set. Simplicity appeals to me, and from the description, I thought this had some potential, but in the end it was pretty tough to slog my way through it and it disappointed me. (2/10)",Hush

So, I'll try and get through this as quickly as possible.This is yet another home invasion movie with only two slight twists: Our victim is a deaf mute and there's only one attacker.Not to spoil anything and I understood why he didn't, but there is one simple solution from the bad guy throughout this middle-of-the-woods serial killer/stalker tale. Anyone that sees this will know right away what he should do, even if we're supposed to be rooting for the deaf mute writer woman. This was frustrating.Additionally cringing, the movie is shot mostly in the dark. Yea! Realism! But, it's hard to watch for the most part.That all said, the woman, Discount Julia Roberts, actually did some fairly good acting and I believed her throughout. The villain was not fleshed out, but acceptable.Worth watching for free on Amazon or Netflix on a night when nothing else is on. Wasn't the worst movie I've seen, not even in this subgenre, but it did feel like a chore to get through.***Final thoughts: Not sure why this was made. It brought extremely little to the table and the ideas that were good weren't expanded on enough.

22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A competent and confident thriller that does exactly what it sets out to but not much more.,6,16 October 2017,"'Hush (2016)' is a taut and often tense thriller that wastes no time getting straight into its small-scale story. It provides several fantastically suspenseful sequences, but sadly struggles to keep up the pace as its plot wears itself a little too thin in the second act. It feels like it lacks a major plot-point or twist to really sell its worth as a feature-length narrative. Yet, simultaneously, it does what it sets out to with a confident and swift verve. Its core concept of a deaf-mute protagonist is handled surprisingly well, with the audience never being given a cheat and with most of the picture playing out without any dialogue whatsoever. The result is a unique spin on an often-seen premise. It actually allows for some interesting set-pieces without, perhaps surprisingly, being pushed to the extreme or becoming the sole identity of the entire picture. The film always stands on its own as a competent yet unsurprising example of a tried-and-tested sub-genre. 6/10.",Hush

Basically there are two characters who ""plays"" in cat and mouse when the prize is life or death. While the premise is simple and many times seen, movie is done so well that it kept my attention from the very beginning till the last frame. Acting by Kate Siegel was nothing short then great - she holds the film together with tight script, directing and editing.

Sure every once in a while a high profile slasher movie pops up but the interest never seems to last.I'd say a primary reason is that they're all the same but that could be said about a lot of horror sub-genres.Here we have the story of a mute/deaf author who lives out secluded in the forest and you guessed it she falls foul of a masked killer.The fact she's deaf actually adds more of an element to the movie than you'd imagine and though Hush suffers from the same Slasher tropes as every other it manages to stay fresh regardless.Well shot, well written and well acted by both little known leads I came away from Hush very satisfied.

26,Reno-Rangan,"Inside and outside, a cat-mouse game!",6,14 November 2017,"A limited cast film. One night event. The whole film was shot within the three weeks. Minimised dialogues, maximised actions. This film has such a good record those. But apart from the performances and settings, there's nothing special. The same old home-invasion concept with so many flaws. If you are looking for nothing but an entertainment, then this will provide you that. But you should not expect more than that, it will foil you from having a nice time with the film. I enjoyed it too, though when it comes to the rating, I should be honest.Maddie, an authoress who lost hearing and voice in her childhood is now living in a remote place, somewhat isolated from the people. On an ordinary day, unexpectedly, a masked man who killed her neighbour, is now after Maddie too. When she comes to realise that, the cat and mouse game begins. She locked herself inside. On the other hand the stranger trying to get in. As it goes like that for hours, so many twists and turns take place. How the remaining tale would turn out is should be watched.Simpleness was the highlight. They did not try too much. Particularly, for a thriller like this, they usually scare the viewers with sudden and loud sounds. This film had those, but minimised. You can't blame for isolated settings too, because such crimes can be easily committed on those backdrops. It's all about Kate Siegel. Her best film, according to me. Nice direction, from one of the latest horror flick maker. But this is not a horror film. It is a terror, a thriller. Short running time and it is worth a try.6/10",Hush

It is indeed a very different stalker film, as the stalker wanted his victim to see him, as if to terrorize her. The quiet moments in the film are highly effective, emphasizing the fact the protagonist is deaf. Kate Siegel's acting is (once again) very good, but even she couldn't save the film for me.There are just way too many plot holes and unanswered questions. Sure, this is a home invasion film and ultimately a story about survival, as she fights the intruder. But why did the intruder do that? Why did he kill the neighbor, but toyed with Maddie (Siegel), or should one assume he did the same with the neighbor? What was his intentions for wanting to kill her? If this was a robbery gone wrong, where Maddie got in the way, it would make perfect sense. The guy surely must be a psychopath, but still, what were his motives? I found this to be a very undeveloped idea, and the film never really blew me away. On the contrary, I eventually wanted this to end.The film is also almost entirely in the dark.

29,TheMovieDiorama,Hush silences noisy distractions with its deafeningly precise direction.,7,21 October 2018,"Flanagan is certainly a director I've had my eye on. 'Oculus' was a surprisingly neat horror/thriller and this domestic slasher is no different. Clean, concise and packing plenty of thrills. Just make sure you stay quiet throughout. A deaf mute novelist is trapped in her own abode by a sadistic killer, using only her survival instincts to stay alive. Diminishing not one but two sensory organs allows this thriller to experiment with its suspense. Unable to hear her killer and unable to communicate for help, she must use her other heightened senses to outwit her opponent. It's a simple plot, however its overly simplistic narrative never detracts from the stylistic suspense. Her perceptions of touch and vibration is accentuated through to the audience by maximising the inventive sound editing. Background noise is often nullified in order to assist in portraying her perspective in this terrifying scenario. Triggered alarms and heavy footsteps have their sound effects increased to convey how loud they truly are. It makes for a suspenseful experience, but one that evokes auditory and visionary entertainment. A perfectly short runtime to justify the simple plot, however it does encounter inconsistent pacing as it struggles to maintain tension. Scenes often feel over extended, particularly during the second act as both individuals wander around in darkness, and that's mostly due to the lack of environmental change. It's filmed in one location, with just two actors for the vast majority of the film. With that being said, it's quite an achievement to craft a realistic domestic thriller given those intended limitations. Suitably thrilling and frequently graphic (her poor hand...), accompanied by gorgeous cinematography and astute direction. Now shhhh and go watch it.",Hush

Also it came close to the masterpiece Wait Until Dark. Coming back to this film, which has only 15 mins of dialogues, only 4 characters n a run time of only 80 mins but very well made. Good that I didn't see the trailer. Saw this on a pirated DVD. Mike Flanagan exceeds all of his previous work with Hush. His Absentia was weird/surreal n very slow. Occulus was good n Hush a thriller movie that is very entertaining.Kate Siegel was brilliant, she was able to attract sympathy and anxiety to her role while John Gallaghar Jr was fantastic as the psychopathic killer/burglar.

33,jtindahouse,Perfect horror film making,9,11 April 2016,"I remember in 2008 when 'The Strangers' came out, sitting in the theatre and just thinking how great of a concept this was. A killer/s with no apparent motive who are in complete control. It made for a very tense and affective horror movie. A planned sequel is still yet to be released. 'Hush' is a very similar movie, with an even more helpless victim, a deaf woman. Does it still work 8 years later? It does. The shock of a killer with the audacity to walk straight into the victim's house and stand watching her without her realising remains a very powerful thing to watch. Too many horror/thriller movies these days are trying to speed up the action (take the 'Friday the 13th' remake in 2009 for example where 'Jason' even runs) and are consequently losing the thing that makes horror great - tension. Look at the original 'Halloween' by John Carpenter, a studio would never let you make a horror film that slowly paced in this day and age, and yet 'Halloween' is considered one of the greatest horror films of all time.That's not to say 'Hush' is a slow film, it isn't. In fact I'd suggest the pacing was nearly perfect for what it was trying to achieve. Kate Siegel gives a great performance in the lead role. I genuinely liked her and cared for her character, another thing frequently found lacking in modern horror - likable characters. The thing I liked the most about the entire film though was the thought in the back of my mind that no character was safe, and there was nothing that couldn't happen. I had no idea whether I was in for a ""happy"" ending or not. I love that in a horror movie and if it isn't there, at least to some extent, I won't be having a good time.

35,MissSimonetta,"While not the modern slasher classic critics would have you believe, HUSH is still a well-paced home invasion thriller with some fun setpieces",8,18 May 2019,"If you want something scary but don't care for the torture porn and jump scare overload that gets passed as ""true horror"" these days, HUSH will serve you well. The scares are built upon desolate atmosphere, the heroine's isolation, and the close cat and mouse game between her and the killer out to get her.The movie is essentially a two-person show, with Kate Siegel and John Gallagher Jr. engaging in a prolonged battle of resources and wits in a cabin in the woods. Siegel is sympathetic and smart as the deaf-mute heroine, though as a lead in this sort of thing, she isn't terribly distinctive as a personality. Same with Gallagher: he's creepy and sometimes even funny, but only barely above your usual run-of-the-mill slasher movie villain. They're credible though, which is more than can be said for the acting in most low-budget films of this sort.I'm not gonna lie: I wish this movie had been silent as the filmmakers originally intended. That kind of stylistic choice would have been radical true, but it would have bonded the audience to the main character to a greater degree and would have made the movie stand out a bit more from its subgenre.Regardless, this is a nice one to watch come the Halloween season.

36,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Very effective horror chiller,8,12 May 2016,"Well it's arrived, folks. The first truly effective horror film of the year (that I've had a chance to see anyway). I was drowsily browsing Netflix and came upon Hush, sporting a snazzy poster and a premise ripped straight from the vintage horror flicks I grew up with. Compelled to give it a shot, I was rewarded with a slick, atmospheric and sturdily made exercise in suspense. It's not often I feel true giddy tension while watching a thriller (even though most brashly guarantee it on the DVD cover), but this baby delivers in spades. It's funny because the storyline is identical to many movies of the past, and similar to countless more. The secret to success, obviously, is in the execution, and Hush is made with a caring love for a genre deeply ingrained in cinematic culture. Director Mike Flanagan clearly loves horror films, and seems to want to rise above the primordial crust, calcifying his effort with a steady hand and fresh direction that gives even the most knowing plot turns a dose of torque using simple tools: a killer soundtrack, whiplash inducing editing and...and.. What's the most important thing in any horror film? I've said it before and I'll keep saying it: atmosphere. The setting finds us in a dusky, desolate area, where a deaf novelist (Katy Siegel) toils in isolation, churning out the trimmings of her next book on a laptop, content in her loneliness yet on the verge of unease stirred by cabin fever, restlessness or something else. It's not long before the film lands the first punch of many: a masked, crossbow wielding serial killer (John Gallagher spits on his previous good guy image, both terrifying, unrecognizable and superb) begins to stalk her with methodical menace, watching from the inky shadows of her home's exterior while she cowers in terror. He catches on quick about her deafness and uses it against her, terrorizing her at every turn. Now, the film does use genre tropes to churn out its story, and anyone expecting something truly unique to pop out of the ether may be disappointed. But to those who yearn for solid, extremely well made horror entries to wade out of the muck and foretell the return to form of a genre that gets maybe two, three winners every year, can rejoice. This one comes up aces. Siegel is instantly likable and gorgeous to boot, giving her protagonist a resilience that is actually believable, which can't be said about every girl being pursued by a killer on screen. Gallagher is icky as the psycho, branded with certain idiosyncratic symbols of society which suggest that he's a jaded outcast driven to sickening extremes by the hand he's been dealt, given in to his dark impulses completely. For genre fans: this begs a watch and will likely be a highlight of the year. For casual viewers: fun, fun times and a vibe to get sucked in by. For non horror fans: just watch it anyway.",Hush
37,drownnnsoda,Potent home invasion thriller,7,4 January 2017,"""Hush"" focuses on Maddie, a deaf-mute writer living alone in a remote house, where she is accosted one evening by a psychopath hellbent on terrorizing and murdering her.Co-written and directed by Mike Flanagan, who many have cited as a contemporary horror maestro, ""Hush"" is a straightforward thriller that cuts to the chase. There's not a lot of plot; most of the film plays on the gimmick of the protagonist being unable to hear anything around her (including the noise she makes), which is a clever setup for a horror-thriller film (I'm actually surprised it wasn't done earlier).Comparisons to ""The Strangers"" are abundant and probably well-deserved, as that film pioneered the post-millennial home invasion film as we know it. ""Hush"" reduces the equation a bit, stripping it down to a one-on-one cat-and-mouse game, so in some regard it's a much more intense film; on the other hand, it's also remarkably less scary—but that's not really what Flanagan seems to be going for here anyway. It's not a film that intends to scare or get under the skin so much as it is a sparring match between two very different people.The film is nicely shot and there are some fantastic scenes that play on a collective home invasion paranoia that I think we all have. The gore is kept to a minimum, but what is there is extremely visceral. The performances are solid, which is vital for a film that virtually revolves around two characters; Kate Siegel (who co-wrote the film with Flanagan) stars as the deaf Maddie, and is extremely believable, while John Gallagher Jr. plays the anonymous nutjob who is more despicable than he is scary. Where the film does falter a bit is in its last act, where the gimmick begins to wear off a bit as Maddie's situation grows more and more helpless. There is an amicable payoff in the end, albeit a drawn-out one.Overall, I found ""Hush"" to be a relatively well-made film, and an enjoyable riff on the home invasion setup. That said, the film does grow dull in areas, and it also offers little in the way of new ideas, but what it does do, it does with class. All in all an entertaining and fairly intense thriller for what it's worth. 7/10.",Hush
38,andrewchristianjr,SOLID.,8,14 November 2020,"Solid home invasion flick. Flanagan is kind of an expert at building tension and making interesting stories with rich characters. It was a strange choice to unmask the killer soo early in, but it was a welcome twist.",Hush

Not until it's time. When you wish you're dead... that's when I'll come inside.""There's one thing you shouldn't expect to happen in ""Hush"". And that's the moment Maddie (Kate Siegel) starts to screech while running around, because she's being attacked by an unknown person (John ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" Gallagher Jr.) who wanders around her home in a remote forest. And that's because Maddie is deaf-mute after suffering from a meningococcal infection when she was young. This with a mask equipped deranged sadist tells Maddie he'll take his time and when the time is ripe, he will break into her home and stick his knife in her with visible pleasure. The motive for this maniacal act remains unknown. But there's no doubt that this maniac finds a morbid joy in this sadistic game. Of course, the fact that he isn't really blessed with a significant number of brain cells, does play to the advantage of Maddie. This dweeb makes some ridiculous decisions. On the other hand some of Maggie's decisions aren't thought out either. But her handicap could well have had an impact on her decision powers. So I forgive her that.""Hush"" is a typical slasher in the home invasion genre. Well, there were already a large amount of such movies that passed the review. The question is whether this film uses something original. They definitely used to a large extent the fact that Maddie is deaf and dumb. There are moments when the sound is completely muted, in such a way that we get an idea in what kind of world Maddie is continuously living. A bubble of silence where she feels comfortable without any threats. Until a crazy person pierces this bubble at a given time. But that's it, in terms of originality. The rest of the movie just follows the same guidelines as all other home-invasion movies. Again, a vulnerable victim in a difficult situation and visibly disadvantaged compared to the killer. Initially it seemed a piece of cake to send the frail, deaf-mute Maddie to the happy hunting grounds. But then she proves that she has a tremendous survival instinct and refuses to give up. Eventually the denouement can be predicted far in advance. Despite the inventive concept and qualitatively the film is part of the better slasher movies, there were still some things that got on my nerves. First, the stupidity and the foolish decisions both Maddie and the attacker made. Plain ridiculous sometimes. It also seemed like Maddie's physical ailments weren't enough as a punishment, because most of the film is shrouded in darkness as well (making her partly blind). I know, it all takes place at night in a dark house. So it's quite evident that everything is covered in darkness. Usually this isn't a problem for the film enthusiast. Unless you can't see a freaking thing anymore and as a result it's really difficult to grasp what is happening. Fortunately ""Hush"" only takes roughly 90 minutes to finish. Because, after yet another walk around the house by the man with the mask, I started to become irritated enormously. For budding serial killers I have this advice. Want to scare future victims? Walk around their house several times. Apparently this helps. And revealing the identity of the murderer early in the movie, spoils the intended tension. The moment he drops his mask, the tension decreases rapidly.The most successful scene is the one with Maddie working on her laptop (still not aware what danger she's in) and the masked man entering her home and observing her up close. After that, it's just a typical cat-and-mouse game. ""Hush"" is exclusively being broadcasted on Netflix and is a perfect movie to watch just before bedtime. I'm sure this horror / thriller won't disturb your sleep, like ""Lights Out"" perhaps did. Chances are that while viewing this movie, you'll be exhibiting some fatigue symptoms already.

41,aidanratesmovies,Kate Siegel carries this film,6,19 August 2021,"A unique character in a rather familiar storyline- Hush doesn't always work as well as it thinks it does, but it does manage to be a solid thriller nevertheless. I am a huge fan of Mike Flanagan's work- especially with The Haunting of Hill House but unfortunately it feels like this was a bit of a misstep for him as a director. The tone feels kinda off, gruelling and so overly-serious at times it's just rather bland to watch- far from achieving the thrilling effect it wants to. I also feel John Gallagher Jr.'s character is kinda ridiculous at times, and thinly written, serving no purpose other than to be the cunning villain and giving him no soul or originality in the process. The pacing can also be a bit tedious at times as the film goes on, but thankfully not so much that I would call it boring, it's just definitely more of a slow burn. Kate Siegel is fantastic in the lead role as Maddie- and is as likable as a lead can get on screen. Her character is both unique and incredibly fascinating, truly putting the attention and focus on her as the film goes on without ever making her seem like just another final girl like most horror movies. The cinematography is well done, and the score is tense as well. I enjoyed the cat and mouse dynamc the film had going, but with it could have done a bit more with the potential it had rather than make it almost like a remake of Panic Room. In the end, Hush is disappointing at times, but it has its strong moments, and thanks to Kate Siegel- is quite watchable and even enjoyable.My Rating: 6.6/10.",Hush
42,I_Ailurophile,Marvelously tense and thrilling,10,26 September 2021,"The very concept had me frankly concerned - a thriller about a woman being hounded by a killer sounds a lot like a dubious exploitation flick, not even taking into account the protagonist's deafness. On the other hand, writer-director Mike Flanagan has certainly proven himself as a great storyteller, and that star Kate Siegel shares writing credit is also in the film's favor. Just how much a viewer will enjoy 'Hush' will depend in no small part on their ability to reconcile or willingness to look past these aspects, to say nothing of the expected stylings of the horror genre.This much is certain, though: following brief exposition, the film excels within a flash in intensely ramping up tension, after which it most assuredly keeps us on the edge of our seat. 'Hush' is electrifying, superbly amplifying and maintaining suspense, and jolting us at psychological moments - while dispensing with the emotional heft of Flanagan's other much-celebrated works ('The haunting of Hill House,' 'The haunting of Bly Manor') that would provide respite by way of counterbalance, or supernatural elements that would elicit a small sense of fun. This is pulse-pounding, harrowing, and genuinely frightening, with little relief.The cast is fantastic, including even those few actors in supporting roles. But this is above all a showcase for Siegel, and she is - as expected - outstanding. Her performance as Maddie is both physically and emotionally demanding, while relying on adept silent expression - and she absolutely possesses the range, nuance, and otherwise capability to pull it off, with flying colors. Much credit as well to John Gallagher, Jr., who again illustrates that he can take any part and inhabit the character with impressive dexterity. His performance as the unnamed killer demands a cruelty and fierceness well exceeding other movies I've seen him in, and he's just swell.The score composed by The Newton Brothers lends much to the suspense and complements every shifting mood, and the sound design is impeccable. Makeup and blood effects look great, and Flanagan's fine camerawork ensures we get to see every detail before his lens. I had my concerns going in, but well before the movie has ended those were assuaged: this is viscerally exciting and suspenseful, with no especial fault that particularly leaps out. The stars' performances are excellent, and as both writer and director Mike Flanagan again illustrates his mastery of the medium. 'Hush' is, to my delight, a wonderfully riveting horror thriller, well worth watching.",Hush

Hill House was a horror film that featured genuine depth of character and solid storytelling, as well as some of the scariest horror moments I'd seen in years (and not cheap jump scares, but genuine chills). ""Hush"" does not have the same depth as Hill House, but it does present a solid home invasion story about a deaf mute writer who is stalked by a masked killer in her remote cabin in the woods. That's pretty much the extent of the story, but ""Hush"" is endlessly clever, scary, and smart. Smart is a key factor missing from most horror films, which feature character doing the exact opposite of what thinking people would do. The characters here actually do what you would try to do in this type of a situation, both protagonists and antagonists, which makes the film far more effective. Home invasion films are a pretty played out horror film scenario, but they can work when given a new twist, such as the dystopian setting for ""The Purge"" or the hero/villain flip flop in ""Don't Breath"" where the home invaders become the victims.

47,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A thriller that has more to it than one would expect,7,26 January 2018,"Throughout history, there have been all kinds of stories dealing with mysterious killers. Some of which still have not been named or captured and have lived in infamy for their obscene crimes. For horror films, the horror genre has made use of these stories to give viewers a better understanding how things went down. Whether certain liberties were taken with the material varies, but it's how the film makes the viewers feel after coming out is what matters. Several horror films rely more on gore and violence when really a movie with the exact opposite in traits can be just as terrifying. This is exactly what happens in this movie, which at first felt like it was going to be a by the numbers killing type horror film, when really, it wasn't at all. Prepare to feel the most restrained you've ever felt in some time.The story to this killer thriller is about Maddie (Kate Siegel), an author of a popular book. Hoping to strike gold and create another great novel, she continues to write in her home on her own. What may not be evident is the fact that she is mute and deaf. The only way she communicates is through sign language and mouthing words. She has a few friends but none that live with her on a constant basis. Unfortunately for her, a stalker (John Gallagher Jr.) discovers her house and realizes she has these disabilities. With that said he decides it would be great to slowly mentally torture her. Written and directed Mike Flanagan, this movie is one of the more taught ones shown in a while. Since much of the story revolves around these two, the development only happens here. Much of it is placed on Maddie, who goes through several strategies on how to escape the evil that has fallen on her.The weakest link is actually the killer because nothing is really explained about him. The character name is just called ""the man"", and that's fine. Not every psycho has to have a name, it makes it all the more creepy. However, having no reason for the motivation of killing is something else. This is exactly the problem with Gallagher's role. He has no rationale as to why he's doing what he's doing. That doesn't mean he has to have a connection to Siegel's character either. But there must be something that is making this guy do what he's doing. Yet this part is overshadowed as to just how creative the heroine lead becomes when she realizes she's starting to run out of options. That's where things become so white-knuckled, it becomes too difficult to just sit and watch. Some viewers may feel the need to retroactively try and yell recommendations to the screen. As if the individuals on screen could hear.Kate Siegel as Maddie does a great job. She truly makes a viewer believe everything she goes through. And as cliché as it is to have a female lead in a horror film, she deserves this one. Siegel has been in other productions prior but this would be her breakout role. It's truly impressive to watch this film unfold because of how well it was directed. Normally writer directors have tough times producing adequate films because the task of doing both isn't easy. However being that this was a small production, this might've lessened the burden. Flanagan was also the director to movies like Oculus (2013), Before I Wake (2016), Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016) and Gerald's Game (2017). Being that these movies have all had mainly positive praise, this shows Flanagan has a knack for the genre. This goes hand in hand with the tension delivered. Much of the execution remains silent to make the viewer feel like Maddie, which helps a lot. In some ways it reminisces to that of James Wan's Dead Silence (2007).Camerawork was well put together too. James Kniest was the director of photography to this feature. Even though the overall setting changes very little, Kniest manages to find ways of showing every inch and crack of the house Maddie lives in. Kniest worked on other movies like Annabelle (2014), Within (2016) and The Bye Bye Man (2017). Adding to that is the violence that occurs throughout the running time. There's not a lot of gore, but what is shown still can get pretty gnarly. Some of it can really make a viewer cringe. Sadly this could also be said for film score. Composed by a duo who go by the Newton Brothers, the music to this movie isn't that impressive. It is understandable as to why it isn't heard much, but when it is used, it's not ultimately that complex. Thankfully it has no jump stings, but the organics of it does not blend with the visuals and comes off rather forgettable. Even if they worked with director Flanagan before.While the music and antagonist motives are not that well rounded, the rest of this thriller is tense in its structure. The two main actors work their parts well, the cinematography is engaging and the whole situation presented to the audience reminds us just how vulnerable we all can be alone at home.",Hush
48,Matt_Layden,A Decent Twist On A Formulaic Genre.,7,14 April 2016,"Mike Flanagan is one for two in my books. His first big film was Absentia, which was a slow boring mess of a film. Interesting ideas, but nothing much else was going on in the film. His second output was a vast improvement, Oculus. Flanagan showed promise and improvement, which made me interested in seeing what else he had for future projects. Well, he has two films coming out in 2016 and I want to talk about Hush, his take on the home invasion sub-genre. Home invasion films have been done to death. Some are great (You're Next), some are tolerable (The Strangers) and some are downright terrible (When A Stranger Calls, 2006). So how does one make their home invasion film stand out from the rest? There has to be some twist on the story to make it memorable. You're Next was a great deconstruction of the genre itself and had the heroine be a survival specialist. The twist Hush brings us lies in the fact that our protagonist if completely deaf. The key element that makes or breaks this film is the sound design. I felt like the crew pulled it off and we have a solid thriller on our hands here. Maddie is a deaf author and she has secluded herself in a house in the woods to write her next book. Problems arise when someone outside her house decides to play a deadly game with Maddie and know she has to keep him out and escape alive. Again, this is a simple premise that is only made interesting by the fact that she is deaf and how the filmmakers decide to handle that aspect of the story. While the film does inevitably go down routine routes with the story, Flanagan does so with skill and finesse. Multiple times throughout the film we are in Maddie's shoes as Flanagan completely mutes the audio. We see the terror happening behind her, but we cannot hear it. He can be entering the house at any point and we will not know. Flanagan manages to seep the viewer in suspense throughout the whole film and while there are some gory and squeamish scenes, he doesn't rely on them. They feel real and earned. Looking back at the film there are multiple sequences where I was taken back or had a huge grin on my face with the ingenuity of it all. People will ultimately try to find inconsistencies with how the film handles the deaf aspect. I had maybe one issue myself, but can look past it for the benefit of the enjoyment I ultimately had because of the film. With a small cast of only four people and hardly any dialogue (maybe 15 minutes total?) Hush is a well crafted film that earns a viewing from anyone who likes this genre.",Hush
49,vengeance20,"Alright, But Plot Holed",5,11 July 2021,"Heard of this film years ago & was waiting for a DVD Release which sadly didn't happen. Now 5 Years on, I have finally watched this film which was on Netflix by the way.The film follows a deaf mute woman named Maddie who is terroised by an unknown man hellbent on taunting her til she cracks & he attacks basically.I found the film to be alright, not amazing, but alright. It's an interesting concept which it gets points for alone. It is surprisingly gory for a film I thought was going to be a slow burner type. The man, the masked killer you see on the posters & cover art for about 5-10 minutes looked sinister... until he took off his mask & spoke to which any mystery or Hitchcock esque style of sinisterness was completely lost.A good chunk of the film mainly focuses on the killer taunting the deaf woman while she tries to escape with futile results. So, while the suspence and action parts were good, I couldn't help but feel like the film wasn't going anywhere, it did keep me guessing as to what would happen, but there wasn't much to go on. I also couldn't help but feel like the killers motives were little to non existent. Why was he trying to kill her? How did he know there was a cabin out there? Why go all the way out to a cabin in the woods? Why waste time taunting someone who you only guessed was deaf after tapping the window slightly when you could've just killed her right there & then?Also, did the killer know Maddie? It sounded like he did, but we don't know if that's cause he looked through her phone & knew, which by the way he would've had to of been quick about between the time he stole her phone & then revealed himself. Like how he knew her nick name ""Squish"". Also how did he unlock her phone if there was a finger print lock?The film feels long in places but isn't a total drag. It's short at 78 minutes (1hr 18mins) & I suppose gets to the point even though the whole ""I'm going to taunt til you want to be dead til I come in"" is an obvious ploy to drag the film so it's at feature length & of course in itself, a plot device.The film could've been better had the killers motive been more in depth, like a back story or something, not to mention if he kept his mask on, taunted her & then when he did get around to trying to kill, would he then remove his mask & state his intention & motive. I also got the impression that Maddie wouldn't be aware of the killer throughout the whole film for some reason.Overall, it's a unique little horror thriller, but has many holes in its thin plot which sadly let it down.5/10.",Hush
50,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Hush""- A thrilling and very fun old-fashioned home-invasion flick! Exceedingly well-written and executed.",10,14 March 2017,"One of the great tragedies in modern horror is that many of the best contemporary releases in the genre often go tragically underrated and under recognized by the bulk of audiences, while attaining general apathy and dismissal from those who do give them a chance. High quality and cerebral releases like ""It Follows"" and ""The Witch"" are condemned as ""boring"" and ""pointless"" by people who refuse to analyze their themes and deeper meanings. Subversive and satirical films like ""Krampus"" and ""The Cabin in the Woods"" are blasted for being ""not scary"" or ""stupid"" by those who misunderstand their intentions. And excellent foreign films like ""The Babadook"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"" are given barely a token limited domestic release before being dumped onto home video with little fanfare and are ignored by the masses.Being a legitimate fan of all things horror can be hard. You really have to look out for the good films. And even moreso, you have to be willing to give just about every film you find a chance because so many so-called ""horror audiences"" are, well... way too quick to judge and all to happy to denounce solid films for any number of silly reasons. Case in point? Director Mike Flanagan's highly entertaining and very fun home-invasion thriller ""Hush""- a film with a simple but brutally effective high-concept set-up that pays off wonderfully. And yet, despite wide critical acclaim and the film's rampant strengths, it's being dismissed and nit-picked apart by general audiences, like most good recent releases of its genre.We follow lead character Maddie (co-writer Kate Siegel), an author who lives alone out in the woods and is struggling to come up with an ending for her latest novel. However, tonight she is not alone- for a twisted and disturbed masked man (John Gallagher Jr.) appears and begins to stalk her and taunt her, threatening to kill her as he has several others. And Maddie has an incredibly disadvantage... she is a deaf-mute, and cannot necessarily hear him coming. And so, she must rely on her cunning and her creative mind to overcome this devilish threat and try to escape with her life...The film's success lay in its brutally simple but extremely elegant story-line and the top-notch execution that director Flanagan and the cast excel at. The film struck me as quite charming and quaint... almost old-fashioned in a way. It reminded me of other, similar movies from yester-year in a really fun way. Flanagan and Siegel know just how to perfectly structure the film in such a way that it hits just the right beats and never overstays its welcome. It's a very efficient film with just the right sense of urgency and pacing. All the main players are introduced and immediately defined. The action starts quickly and only lets up in a few appropriate key moments to give the audience some breathing room. And every single facet of the story is established and paid off in a really clever way. As far as screen writing goes... the script for this film is pretty much perfect. I could see it being used as a studying tool for aspiring writers and in creative-writing classroom settings. I've seen some people bemoan the fact that some aspects of the story are not explained... but this is just mind- boggling. We learn everything we need to know for the story that's being told. We don't need excessive and unnecessary detail. That would just clutter the narrative and make for a weaker film.The film is quite slick in terms of direction, and I've been finding that Flanagan is quickly becoming one of the go-to's for effective mainstream horror. This is the third film of his I've seen, and he seems to grow more and more with each release. He's confident with his visual storytelling without letting it become a distraction, and he injects just enough style and flourish to augment the story and really drive it home. He never relies on cheap tricks like incessant camera-shake or false jumps... he knows the situation is frightening enough in and of itself. Very excellent work that is complimented by the top-notch lighting and cinematography of DP James Kniest and the dreary tones of composers The Newton Brothers. And to top it off, the performances are excellent. Siegel is endlessly likable as our lead, and she's never too strong or too vulnerable. She feels like a real person stuck in a truly terrifying situation. Gallagher Jr. is devilish fun as our adversary and is a truly slimy, threatening presence. And supporting roles by the likes of Samantha Sloyan and Michael Trucco are ideally cast and expertly performed.It's quite a disservice to such an excellent film that it was never given a proper theatrical release and was instead released predominately as a Netflix film. This is the sort-of movie I'd kill to see on the big screen with the right audience, as we gasp, scream and applaud together. It's a wonderfully made, highly efficient and wickedly well-written film and is easily going to become a go-to for Halloween night viewings and late-night horror-movie marathons for my friends and I. I freaking loved every second of it.There's no other way to say it... I gotta give it a 10. There's basically no faults to be found here. It gives you everything you could possibly want from a high-concept home-invasion thriller, and then some.",Hush
51,quincytheodore,A fine night for home invasion without missing a beat,7,20 April 2016,"""Hush"" is a stellar example of how to create intense thriller with simple premise. It starts with a small cast and modest runtime, but it capitalizes on every chance to instill any available tension. The deaf main protagonist presents exactly this kind of opportunity to exploit the already volatile situation into uniquely compelling sequences.Kate Siegel as the hearing impaired heroine is trapped on her own house by a stalker. This is not the typical slasher with random scrabbling or plate tossing. It's a meticulously drawn condition with grave danger on every step. This might give the movie slightly slow pace, but Kate Siegel performs admirably as the lead.She works by gestures nearly the entire time, the movie sets this up pretty well with opening intro of her interacting with her neighbor. There are clear signs of panic as she goes through the night and her survival odd dwindles. It's also a clever way to present the perimeter around the house without the protagonist being too conveniently saved or stupid for the sake of plot.With a shorter than average runtime, ""Hush"" gives out the very essence of thriller movie, it's enjoyably riveting with carefully crafted condition.",Hush

54,arungeorge13,Review – Hush (2016),7,5 June 2017,"'Hush' is a fast-paced modern slasher flick with a twisted take on the genre. Well, the twist here is that the lead protagonist is deaf and mute from her teens and the director-writer combo of Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel (who also happen to be husband-wife in real life), places this character in a stuck-up situation where a killer is on the prowl and all odds are stacked against her. Questions start piling up but a good thirty minutes into the film, the viewer is given enough leads to estimate where the film is headed.A film such as this, where the entire scenario revolves around a minimalist location, one feels inclined to applaud director Flanagan's knack for not making the film look like yet another typical home-invasion flick. The protagonist Maddie's inability to speak or hear is put to good effect in the screenplay. I won't spoil those brilliantly written and choreographed scenes in this review, because that is exactly what puts this flick a few notches above the rest in the genre. Equally inventive and enthralling are those scenes where Maddie's imaginative capability is put to test.The cast (that comprises of just four characters, out of which the film revolves majorly around two!) is adequate as well, and lends ample support to the overall mainstay of the flick. Flanagan's directorial skills, which looked rather unimpressive in Absentia (2011), after which he made a notable Oculus (2013), has considerably improved over the years, all the while sticking to modest production expenditure. Aided in writing by his wife Kate Siegel, the couple seem poised to astonish us yet again this year in the sequel to the strictly sub- par Ouija (2014).Hush is a pleasant surprise amongst the shitload of low-budget slasher garbage that is handed out to us every now and then. It is by all means worth a watch for thriller buffs.",Hush

59,areatw,"Starts strongly, gets worse and worse as it goes on",4,17 November 2019,"'Hush' is a home-invasion film with a difference in that the main character is both deaf and mute. At first this sounded like an interesting idea and appealed to me as someone who can't stand constant over-the-top screaming in films like this. But after a promising start in which the initial, somewhat plausible, scenario is set-up, things start to deteriorate.I was willing to overlook a few minor flaws until something happened that just couldn't be ignored. The attacker slashes the tyres on the woman's car, supposedly preventing her from escaping in it. Since when does this render a car unusable? The engine would still work and the car would still be able to move, even with four punctures. She could have quite easily escaped in it.The most far-fetched, frankly ridiculous part of the film, however, is when a character turns up at the house looking for his missing girlfriend and is greeted by the killer, who poses as a police officer. He's wearing normal clothes, looks nothing like a police officer and is acting extremely suspicious, yet the boyfriend never questions him or asks for ID. I mean please, nobody is that dumb.",Hush

Especially for person with disability, together with other weaknesses such as being cut off from society and not have taken safety measures in advance. Very real.

The rest of the small ensemble was very good as well.I'd give this one a 6.3. Rating.",Hush
63,ivo-cobra8,Another solid rated-R horror film from 2016 that could have been better,5,12 May 2017,"I just recently watched Don't Breathe (2016) horror film from Fede Álvarez and I heard from an angry fan of this movie for Don't Breath that Hush and The Conjuring 2 are MIles way better movies than Don't Breath. I disagree Hush is not even near close better than Don't Breath. I don't know about The Conjuring 2, I never watch it and I never will. I watch the first one and I remember don't liking it, I would rather watch Poltergeist than that movie which is way better movie than The Conjuring.Hush (2016) is a solid horror, but I could have been much better if the movie would make more money and it wouldn't be so poor. The problems with the film in my opinion is, it is not scary enough, it is not a scary horror film, it is more a thriller. It start's well but than makes a mistake and goes down hill.The Man takes off the mask and trough in tier movie we see his face, he shouldn't do that. It was not scary, i wasn't scared at all. Have you heard about horror film from 2008 The Strangers? That movie was scary and a horror film, it scared me so hard that my heart was pumping. When a Stranger Calls (2006) the remake was even more scarier than this movie and get's only 5 on IMDb while this movie get's 6 I think it is little too overrated. Actress Kate Siegel as Maddie the heroine was good in her role, but she wasn't convincing enough as the deaf girl she still could hear people.Michael Trucco was in this movie too from One Tree Hill he was killed. I liked that Maddie stood against her attacker she was very brave and fearless. I like the last scenes and fighting scenes that Maddie try's to get away but she find's out there is no escape and when her neighbor try's to help her, he get's killed. I like the crossbow in these movie in which Maddie put's an effort to put the arrow in the bow but the trigger mechanism was too hard to put an arrow. I like the blood squibs in here it was pretty good, in which the assailant shots Maddie in the leg and she can't shout that was really good.The movie goes very fast around, it is fast paced, it is not slowly not boring and it is solid thriller movie. The assailant try's to kill Maddie's cat and she shoots an arrow with crossbow at him hitting him in the shoulder that was really awesome. I love in which Maddie stand's up and provokes the assailant to come in the house and she type's on her computer a goodbye note to her parents and she wrote I died fighting. On the end she stabs the silent in the neck when he was about to strangle her. She calls 911 with the cell and she sit on the porch waiting on the cops. Pretty good movie, but it really cold have been more scarier with the man not taking the mask off. The movie is very good thriller, it could have been a good horror movie.

65,witster18,I can't keep quiet.,8,21 April 2016,"This is solid. For the genre, the sub-genre,.. Solid!For me, it's not about what it got right, it's what it didn't get wrong. The film didn't try to pack in a non-sensical twist. It didn't feel the need to treat the audience like 1-yr-olds, and spoon feed us back-stories, flashbacks, or too many characters. It's just a simple horror movie done well. Is it great? Maybe not. Perfect? Of course not. There's a couple of late scenes that don't work as well as the first hour, but they're not glaringly bad by any means. The only scene that I think could have been redone is when he enters the house.BUT, for the most part, this is simplistic yet shockingly effective horror. The right amount of gore.. Solid last hour scare factor.. Not trying to do too much.. Only 1 or 2 arguably unrealistic moments with literally hundreds of opportunities to do so. Solid performances from all involved. This could stay on the 2016 top-25 for quite a while, while I catch- up on '16. It MAY even hold a spot come next spring when I polish up the watchlist of near 100films like I do every year. Watched ""We Are Still Here"", a slightly above average, albeit scary horror film late last night. This was clearly better, and perhaps the best horror film I've watched since the Babadook. Kudo's to all involved - Especially the two leads. They really up'd the believability and scare factor with their strong performances, and the direction wasn't incompetent either. This might be worth owning. 72/100 You might like this if you liked:Eden Lake(a tad better or near even), or You're Next(not as good as this).I've read about everything negative on the home page board and the reviews and there's a common theme -nitpicking! From 'they should have made the whole film silent(yeah that woulda worked) to he shouldn't have removed his mask so early.. Get over it.. Nobody is offering up any better, also lesser known(or heck, mainstream as it gets)options either. Solid, horror, flick. . . Don't let the nitpickers scare you away from watching this scary movie. The film really uses the disability thing to its' advantage, and the slasher's back-story is just vague enough to leave some doors open for our own interpretation.Another reviewer calling the positive reviews fake - HUH!?!? I've been here 8 years bud. It's my 341rst review. This film is the polar opposite of ""the Cabin in the Woods"". It's not original, it's not funny, and it didn't do crap at the box office. BUT, it'll settle- out around the same IMDb score(7.0ish), and I actually much prefer this. There goes the useful %, so be it.Let me use the ""Frantic"" argument here - just because it doesn't feel the need to spoon-feed you information - Does Not make them plot-holes... Geesh. These detractors also missed some of the intricacies of the film. His statement that hinted at his motive, the moments of silence in the set-up, etc, etc.",Hush
66,SoumikBanerjee25,A Respectable Thriller!,6,25 November 2020,"""Hush"" is a textbook thriller abide by very basic stuffs but in convenient ways. Even with all the occasional sparks it ended up being just an above average. Perhaps an inexperienced writing endeavor is to be blamed.The story follows a Deaf & Mute writer, Maddie; who's on her own in a secluded place far away from the hustle bustle of a city. Living all by herself with frequent visits from her neighbours cum friends. One day, a cold-blooded killer decides to show up at her front door; starting off a hostile tussle between the Hunter & the Hunted. As a thriller, it's quite efficient in bringing up usual tropes. Although the narration being repetitive by nature, there's definitely ample amount of tension consistently riling up time to time.The strongest aspect here without any doubt are the performances. Kate Siegel the better half of Mr. Flanagan; is phenomenal in her role as Maddie. Such an indurated task to express a character's emotions without uttering a single word. Gallagher's portrayal as the antagonist was intimidating too.Talking about the technical parts, it's indeed well shot with majority of the scenes taking place at night-time. Which in itself a tough challenge to overcome. Soundscore is decent enough. Worked well with its overall ambience and the creepy undertones.Finally moving onto the negatives, They are not enough in numbers to have a discussion for. There's an obvious deficit of character backstories and salient pacing issues within the screenplay. Above all It's just the above average execution that personally bothered me. It doesn't showcase anything brilliant in particular. Just a respectable thriller that needed imperative sharpening around its edges!",Hush

The film was not able to create any real tension since most of the situations are too familiar from a lot of films and the bad guy was just a stupid character. The film is not boring but there's no point in it just trying to recreate what has been done so many times. Kate Seigel was amazing as the deaf-mute writer and she deserves more prominent roles.,Hush

70,SquigglyCrunch,"Good Tension and Horror, but Repetitive at Times",7,30 April 2016,"Hush follows a deaf and mute woman whose home is invaded by a mysterious murderer who decides to hold off killing her just to mess with her head. The plot is pretty interesting. It's a simple idea, and it tends to work. It's one of those movie that takes place completely in one place, specifically the woman's house. The horror aspect of it is really good at the beginning and end, but the middle is just okay. At first it was really creepy, especially because we had no idea who the murderer was due to his creepy mask. Unfortunately, he only wears it for the first fifteen-ish minutes, so throughout the rest of the movie he just wasn't nearly as creepy. The events that were used to build tension at first were good, but they got repetitive. There was one particular thing that was used about three times in the movie, and by the second or third time it was already wearing out it's welcome. It did switch it up at the end, so naturally it picked up, especially with the climax. The characters are pretty good. I didn't think that they were horribly stupid people either, especially the main female. In fact, I'd say that she was actually pretty smart. She thought of solutions that not even I had thought of. The murderer, on the other hand, could be a little inconsistent. He knew to do some things, yet time and time again he ran right into somewhat distractions the main character created for him. Otherwise, with the small cast it had I think that they were well-developed enough. Overall Hush is a solid horror movie. It's pretty suspenseful with some good characters, but it fails to provide new ways of scaring the audience around the halfway point, but it doesn't stay that way. In the end I would recommend this movie.",Hush

74,estreet-eva,Not enough there there,4,8 December 2017,"The plot of ""Hush"" could be thoroughly summarized on an old Acopolco postcard (from back when people still went there). The dialog would require two postcards. This leaves us with acting. John Gallagher, Jr. plays the backstory-impaired home invader who is only slightly more effective than Harry Lime and Marv Merchants. John attempts to play the killer as menacing while still kinda inept. The limitation here is Gallagher seems like a guy in real life who asks you are and actually wants a response. Director Mike Flanigan needed someone more naturally menacing like an Alabama congressman or Andy Dick. In short, a bit off topic but if the main character wasn't deaf, would it have changed the proceedings in any meaningful way? The Westchestarian thinks not.",Hush
75,nitzanhavoc,"Hear no evil, unfortunately... Very recommended!",8,28 June 2016,"Everything that falls under the Horror label has a reason for being frightening. Usually, it's derived from basic human fears which in most cases relate directly to survival instincts. Hush's main story line deals, obviously, with Home Invasion (following other titles like Panic Room and Strangers), but aside from that it deals with the loss of senses. Usually, as we've all seen and read in Horror films and stories, the sense of sight is the one focused on. This time - a film has set out to show us just how scary the loss of hearing could be, and has done a wonderful job!The story is quite simple. Maddie (Kate Siegel) is a deaf writer living on her own, with very little human interactions, mostly her friend and neighbour Sarah (Samantha Sloyan) and her sister Max (Emilia Graves, with whom she chats online). There are also references to an ex boyfriend by name of Craig. One night, out of nowhere, a killer (John Gallagher Jr.) arrives at her doorstep with the sole intention of toying with her, and finally killing her.The acting is very impressive, especially Gallagher as a profoundly creepy and unnerving killer, and Siegel as a deaf woman fighting for her life. However, the greatest feature is by far the direction (Mike Flanagan). The focus on certain sounds to emphasize Maddie's deafness, the cutting of all audio in certain scenes to show things from her point of view (or more appropriately hearing), the wonderful use of a single location in the project - all have added value making this good film great.Hush is not a masterpiece, especially because of the over-simplified plot and lack of any twists or actual turning points. A smarter story, with half the thought shown to given by Maddie to her books' endings, would have really made the film exquisite. However, even with the story as it is, Hush is suspenseful, authentic, relatable and on in all manners fun and rewarding. Very recommended.",Hush
76,stevenrotherforth,It's like the opening of Scream but without the screams!,7,21 September 2018,"Hush Like all good slasher movies Hush shares many a cliche but what sets this film apart is the very strong central performance by Kate Siegel.
No this movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table but it is crafted with a level of care and pride that elevates it above most of its peers.Hush tells the story of Maddie a deaf and mute novelist who has retreated to the woods.
Here she resides in a rather lovely abode but before long her peace and tranquillity is destroyed by a murderous intruder.
It is here where Siegel's performance shines.
She carries the movie without dialogue and conveys peril merely with facial expression and body language.
Think of Hush as the opening scene of the movie Scream but without the screams!
There's only a small cast as it is Siegel and her murderous nemesis 'The man' played by John Gallagher Jr that drive story.
The evil intruder proceeds to play cat and mouse with Maddie, in the belief he can kill her anytime he wants.
Sure Hush is riddled with our victim/heroine making bad choices. It wouldn't be a slasher style movie without them.
Turning right when she should have gone left.
Hitting the man in the forearm with a claw hammer when it was more than achievable to hit his head.
That said director Mike Flanagan does ramp up tension and the gore is dialled way passed eleven.
Certain elements could have been explored further.
Maddie's deafness could have been used to good effect on the audience. This allowing us to be in her shoes. Instead this was never utilised properly.
Shame as the opening of the movie is in silence before oversaturated sounds of cooking, chopping etc bursts through the speakers.
It would have been nice to amp up the shock factor by using the absence of sound to disorient the audience.With that gripe aside Hush is still a decent throw away popcorn flick. One that does offer a little more due to the fine performance by Kate Siegel.",Hush

The temptation might have been to take Maddie's disability and, like with Audrey Hepburn's blindness in Wait Until Dark, use it to her advantage somehow; but that does not transpire. It's actually her skills as a writer (she is completing her latest crime novel when the would be assassin strikes) that gives her some traction in what should be a one-sided battle.This is an intelligent, well paced and well shot, low budget slasher movie, but on a higher plane.",Hush

But our protagonist of the story is deaf, and this makes the movie more interesting, gives an extra plus, but even so is not enough, with a villain completely meaningless and with logical failures, and a simple technique, ""Hush"" is Everything that we have seen thousands of times, but the film, even if it is a cliché, it does nothing to make us disappoint completely, the deafness factor of the character could be better used, and the killer in question loses the fear very early, The short duration of the film and without forcing it leaves the pace delicious, and the character is very well developed, and the actress Kate Siengel is well in the film, and we even have some nice suspense, but that is lost completely in the course of the plot.",Hush

A deaf and mute writer is targeted by a killer in her isolated house in the woods. The simple fact that she is deaf and mute is what offers something unique but that is where it ends. It doesn't take long for ""Hush"" to play up all the cliches involving phones, lone neighbours stumbling over and getting themselves killed, and a stupid ending with the done-to-death finish, where the killer has the lead pinned to the ground, strangling the life out of them, before they conveniently reach out and just grab some random weapon before driving it through the villains throat.

85,WalkdenEntertainment,Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....,8,10 January 2019,"Silence can be a killer! This new Thriller/Horror film snuck out recently to Netflix only. It came highly recommended to me by a fellow movie reviewer and thought: I need to check this out for myself.The plot is simple but very clever. We have our main female character Maddie, (Katie Siegel) who currently lives all alone in the woods writing her latest novel and getting over an ex boyfriend (sure it sounds like something we've heard before ), however, the catch in the plot here is the fact our main character, Maddie, is also Deaf.Maddie while working from home one night is approached by a masked psychotic crazy man and her crazy long night begins.What I really enjoy about this film is with a lead actor not being able to speak, the film really needed to rely on great acting and visual sounds effects, with which, to the film's credit, they have achieved amazing results.To give you thriller movie buffs a new appreciation for this film, according to IMDB this film ""HUSH"" Contains less than 15 minutes of dialogue... meaning that more than 70 minutes occur without a single spoken word... Respect!And I was amazed. Even with the lack of dialogue I still found myself entertained, tense and so curious to see the film to the end. While some things you might be able to pick what happens next, the film's still has a few surprises that I just didn't see coming, making the film a fun thrill ride.My only annoyance with Hush is as the audience there are scenes that we get to watch only discover to after what we saw didn't actually occur. It may be minor, but when a film tries to play with you I can't help but feel my time was wasted and struggling to trust the next scene. Please also be warned also for those who do not like harsh swearing you will be treated with foul language, which I felt was a little out of place.I respect the different direction and the risks this film takes & for those who love creepy thrillers this one for you.Most of this film is set at night so I also suggest you turn the lights off and turn the volume ... up umhahah !7.7/10

She's trying to finish her latest novel while avoiding distractions, such as calls from her ex-boyfriend. But there's someone outside: a masked intruder (John Gallagher Jr.)with an arsenal of weapons, and Maddie has to figure out how to keep him out and then how to escape.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: Character development is the major pro in this film.We instantly get connected to Madidie's character and her deafness.Mike Flanagan used this point and crafted a brilliant nail biting thriller without any dull moments.He's a rare modern horror director who still prioritizes suspense, and he frames the tense altercations between the pair to maximum effect.All the trials made by Maddie created a tension in audience and whenever the psycho finds out about it,we feel more tense than Maddie.2)Performances: Kate Siegel is brilliant in the role of Maddie.Be it her expressions with sign language with her friend or her first confrontation with psycho clearly shows us that she has a bright future ahead.John Gallenger looked more terrifying especially in mask.3)Duration: A duration of just 1hr 21 min is a perfect duration for this home invasion thriller.Flanagan perfectly edited this movie without any drag.So,Hush is a perfect home invasion thriller after a long time with an engaging screenplay,lot of nail biting moments.My rating 7.5/10 Image may contain: one or more people, text and close-up",Hush

However Hush offers an exciting yet thrilling experience that keeps you on the edge. A lot of that comes from the fact that it played in a rather realistic way it doesn't come of really as cheesy with a lot of the horror tropes of making poor decisions. With with such a small cast a lot of the movie entirely rides on them, Kate Siegel does a great job, she comes off as this that you feel is already down on her luck giving wants happen to her.

She's not as dumb as you would think for a film like this, it done well and believable there are some misleading moments in this. The Man I felt that he really added alot to the tension. It's nice he not some motive driven tool. He's not an Ex or somebody she's wrong really he's just just some lunatic with a crossbow. In a way that makes him more terrifying. When he's near and you see him, but Maddie doesn't know, just make you think of how unknowingly that can reflex on real life people. The overall fact he could have easily done away with her, cement that this just a sick game and he's gonna enjoy this. Like her he is also not as dumb as you would expect.

90,zac-04879,An Effective But Slow Horror Film,6,11 October 2021,"Hush's most original idea wrapped between its completely stereotypical plot is the absence of hearing through the protagonist. The rest of this horror film is just the fairly boring but unpredictably gripping focus on her protecting herself from a sadistic stalker/killer.To be more specific about why the story just seems so poorly designed, the entire film is mainly focused on a very slow sense of tension. Each minute is simply only the lead character walking, crawling, and just avoiding the masked man. The masked man himself is also revealed to quickly though, and we don't get as much of a fright when we see the creepy mask. However, he gets pretty smart when it comes to building up the bodycount.To be fair, this cat-and-mouse sort of thriller is one you'll either find really entertaining or super boring. It doesn't dig into an unrealistic hole and is very good at portraying certain things. All we hear is unsettling silence when we're seeing the deaf character's point of view and there's detailed sound everywhere else.If Hush could've included more dialogue between certain characters and super clever twists, it probably could've been great! It's an appealing idea for a stalker-vs-victim horror movie.

91,SyoKennex,"Turn the lights off, shut your curtains and stay Hush",10,30 March 2017,"I've seen a lot of talk about this film about how it handled the deaf aspect of the character of Maddie. As a partially deaf horror movie fan, I decided that I had to watch this and make a decision for myself and hopefully, perhaps shine some light on the aspect itself. This film delicately handles Maddie's deafness and has done an excellent portrayal of a deaf person. I found this to be extremely gripping and I've found myself in a mildly similar situation; it's almost completely dead on. The way she has been portrayed is not offensive in anyway, and is one of the closest portrayals I have seen to being deaf by a non deaf actress. Our main character is deaf, and can't hear a thing. When she was 13, she contracted a disease that took away her hearing and also her speech. Alone one night at her secluded house buried in the woods, she's clearing up the burned dishes of her failure of cooking, when a sociopath arrives outside her house.What follows is a tense hour and twenty minutes of a twisted, sociopathic game of cat and mouse. We see Maddie adapt as a character and see her develop into a survivor, someone who must stay alive for as long as humanely possible until help arrives. I have never seen such a strong female character in a horror film before. Maddie was absolutely amazing and someone I aspire to be if I ever find myself in such a horrifying situation. She is the epitome of disability does not equal weakness. Kate Siegel did an amazing portrayal of Maddie, and I am personally honoured to have her represent the deaf community in a film such as this. I didn't expect for this to be as good as it was. I was expecting a cheap thriller (this only had a budget of around $1 million) that did nothing for the viewers. I was not expecting to get goosebumps, and to get paranoid about going near the windows of my house, expecting a sociopath to be stood outside, wearing a mask. The gore in this was actually believable in a horror film. It was scientifically accurate, and it wasn't grossly over exaggerated for the shock horror gore aspect, which is always the sign of a good horror film. So much thought went into this beautiful film and it shows, it really does show. This is an amazing movie and deserves so much more hype and views. This was absolutely stunning.

93,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Pretty good.,7,4 April 2019,"A pretty decent horror movie. The main protagonist being deaf certainly adds an interesting element as she is at an disadvantage and has to work harder to survive. And she certainly was capable but I feel that the ""cat and mouse"" element of the film could have been better if the killer was actively trying to kill her and not purposely letting it be a game. The only reason why she lived so long is because the killer wanted to taunt her and let her sweat it out. Realistically, the movie would have been over a lot sooner. But overall, it was still entertaining and tension filled. However, by the last 10-15 min it does go into a super cliched horror movie end.I also genuinely liked the power move of the killer by removing his mask so early as to say ""I dont care if you see my face, cause Im gonna kill you"". Acting was pretty good too.Its not an incredibly inventive horror movie, but it's got a decent premise and it executes it pretty well too.",Hush
94,TuesdayThe17th,A thought provoking and very scary horror movie,9,15 April 2016,"This movie is directed by ""Oculus"", ""Absentia"", and ""Hush"" director, Mike Flanagan. It was released right around the same time as his other upcoming film, ""Before I Wake"", so going into it i was hoping it wouldn't feel rushed or forced. It didn't. It turned out to be one of the most involving and personal horror films I've seen in awhile. This movie is a horror/thriller about the sort of home invasion of a late 20s, early 30s deaf and mute female living alone in a secluded house in a woodsy area. With only one neighbor somewhat close by, it was the perfect, yet typical setup for this type of movie. The movie began to follow all the typical tropes of the horror genre, like the protagonist doing all the wrong things and ultimately setting herself for a lonesome event, and taking care of the cell phone problem. about 20 minutes in, though, this movie began to really draw me in, slowly dropping my jaw as the tension and situations started to build to an ultimately terrifying climax. The actor chosen for the invader was perfect. John Gallagher Jr. Is a good actor who has recently taken on the horror genre, and i think it fits him well. He resembles so many of the kids i grew up with so it adds an even more realistic feel. What was really cool about this movie was how the main character, Maddie, fought so hard for survival. The movie flowed at a very appealing pace and though it was a shorter movie, it was packed with thrills. The violence was very realistic and it was ade to resemble what it would REALLY be like if this were to happen to someone. Maddie's attitude is sincere and shes the type of girl to make sure her attacker is dead and not just hit him over the head once and walk away. I really liked how the attacker was toying with her the whole movie, and i also really liked how the kills and violence seemed so personal, upsetting, and raw. Mike Flanagan is clearly a multiskilled director and clearly has a knack for the horror genre. This movie is dark, very creepy, intense, involving, intriguing, very scary, and yet, it has an ending that'll leave you happy and satisfied. This is a rare gem and clewrky one of the better home invasion movies to come along since ""Youre Next"".",Hush
95,tr91,Hush,8,31 August 2016,Hush was one of them random picks on Netflix. I'd never heard of it but I wanted a film with a shorter run time to watch one night so decided to give it a try. Hush is a basic story. The film follows Maddie (portrayed excellently by Kate Siegel) who is deaf and non verbal. She's a writer who lives alone in a very remote place. The film is only 1 hour & 20 minutes so it gets pretty much straight to the point that she is going to be terrorized by an intruder. There is a few small jump scares along the way but the film's horror comes more from the tension and atmosphere it creates. At times the film plays out like a silent movie & the atmosphere had me on the edge of my seat. It bubbles away nicely and I really started to like the main character and cared/hoped that she would survive. There isn't much else to say but if you like atmospheric thrillers then you will probably enjoy this. There's a few minutes build up at the beginning and then the rest of the film is basically all in one location leading up to a bloody finale.Well worth checking out. 8/10.,Hush
96,keelhaul-80856,"Watchable, but it ain't all that...",6,3 October 2017,"This movie was enjoyable for a date night with my girl. The beginning is a nice setup for the story, although I do find it a bit ridiculous as well.OK, so really? A 90 lb. cute deaf girl is going to move to a remote little house in the middle of nowhere, out in the woods, with only one neighboring couple, which are also gone a lot?????????I would be absolutely terrified if this was my daughter or wife. Not to mention, she isn't some veteran survivalist or gun owner-- just a pretty author who cooks and hangs out with her cat. At least get a damn dog!! Or a gun or two. I'm a grown man with my hearing, who spent most of my life in secluded areas in the country, and I wouldn't even live out in seclusion without a dog, a gun, etc. She must have grown up in a bubble where rapes, home invasions, murders, thefts, animal contact, and natural disasters or emergencies NEVER happen, and so she's quite comfy in the middle of the twilight zone, being a tiny, weak deaf girl with no man or family. It is like hanging a sign around your neck that says, ""Hey, come assault me.""Anyway, the boyfriend from next door believes this guy might be a cop--who looks like a rival gangster on Sons of Anarchy, or the guy in the holding cell when you get arrested. Nothing about him even looks remotely trustworthy, much less a cop. I would not even approach this guy unarmed and stand around talking to him if I suspected anything was wrong at a home invasion. Then, of course, you had to have that stupid moment where the bf realizes he is fake, and is about to bash his head, and then the deaf girl unwittingly startles them and gets the good guy killed.Other times existed when the girl could have ran into the dark woods and hidden. It would have been very hard for him to find her. Trust me, the woods are very hard to navigate at night in a sprawling outdoor area.The dude was weak and stupid(I know he was toying with her, but come on). He also had very little character development as to what or who he was and how he ended up in this area. Her killing him at the end was about as likely as me becoming president.This movie was OK for a modern horror flick on Netflix, but nothing extra. I was hoping for a little more. It started out well, built up nicely, but didn't pull out much of anything you haven't seen 100 times before. Again....women living in the woods alone with no protection, dog, gun, family, etc. while being handicapped---- the worst idea ever. It made me feel like she was more stupid and doomed for trouble than sympathy--from the start. Anyway, the film is watchable and entertaining, but nothing to get excited about.",Hush
97,FKDZ,"When it hits, it hits hard.",7,2 December 2020,"I was pretty excited going into this movie after having seen Haunting of Hill house so I had some high hopes. Luckily that didn't disappoint, even though this is quite a simple movie it is very enjoyable.Now starting off this movie is about the mute+deaf person being attacked by a serial killer. So the premise is interesting for sure and I'd love to see another movie on this but with a bit more character depth. For me, there was too little character development for the lead actress. You get to know some basic things, but it just didn't quite make it to really caring for that character. The movie could've used maybe just a few more minutes to shown maybe some more family interaction or history of the main characters so we really get a grip on that character and become engaged. This is probably my only major shortfall of the movie and it hits hard. There are some minor issues as well but most of the movie is good fun.So about the killer, I felt myself swinging between thinking he's an idiot or a smart guy. He mostly is smart, but mainly the way he has his mouth hanging open in the first half hour of the movie kinda set me off. I did like the fact he was smart, but not strong and solved those issues well. Later on he looked a lot better. Also he took off his mask pretty fast, imo it was a good design and could've been used for longer.The kills though, wow, they hit. There are only 3 kills in this movie (killer included) but they are lengthy, sickening and allround so much more interesting that another slasher kill. The movie also really needed this because it obviously barely has any. Both innocent kills both have an impact story wise and aren't senseless. The girlfriend being killed was the worst to stomach (pun intended) and whilst the boyfriend kill was great, the setup and ending struggle, to us the boyfriend was completely new to the story so I didn't care as much for his death. The gore is top notch, if there was cgi, I didn't notice it. So it's very good.There are a few parts that have had me a little bored, that was the section where the Maddie decides to first disinfect the wound instead of stopping the bleeding asap. To me this whole scene felt a bit unnecessarily drawn out. And a few drawn out scenes of the killer walking around the house. There were also a few creative decisions that I felt were missed opportunities with the whole mute+deaf concept. For instance the killer isn't messing around with Maddie all too much. I expected a little more of the moments where he stands behind directly her whilst she can't hear him. Like it lacked that kind of thrilling suspense.Another minor gripe or intended red herring was the Craig guy, which looked so setup, not for being the killer, but being the guy that saved her in the end. But after a few mentions it's never mentioned again nor does he show up.The soundtrack.. well there's barely any except for far till the finale, wasn't as good as I hoped. I did very much like the sound design, but the score they used didn't really play into that.7/10",Hush
98,lnvicta,Silent chiller with great acting and an excellent premise.,7,14 April 2016,"'Hush' is a lot like 'The Strangers', except instead of strangers plural it's only one man, and instead of a husband and wife being terrorized it's a deaf and mute recluse. It's very tense and cleverly written bar a few cliché tropes that come with this kind of movie. It also has a minimal synth score, something I notice more and more horror movies are utilizing - 'You're Next', 'It Follows' - to give it an '80s classic slasher atmosphere. It's hard to even call it horror though as it offers far more thrills than actual scares. I was thoroughly satisfied watching this movie. It's constantly engaging, and that has a lot to do with the terrific performances of both the man and Maggie, and there are a few scenes that are genuinely depraved and chilling. It doesn't break any new ground, but following 'The Babadook' and 'It Follows', 'Hush' continues to reinspire the subtle, quiet corner of the genre and bodes well for the future of psychological thrillers. Highly recommended.",Hush
99,spencergrande6,"Simple Genre Exercise, Nothing More Nothing Less",6,11 December 2016,"This is a simple genre exercise, nothing more. Its premise is sound and uncomplicated -- a blind woman attached in her cabin in the woods all alone at night -- and the storytelling and characters basically non- existent in service of thrills and chills.The problem is, it's competently made, but it offers nothing new outside its set-up. It's neither an interesting story/character study, nor some crazy new take on the genre, so tight and intense as to become profound in and of itself. It's pleasing enough and then forgettable.My biggest gripe is that although the deaf angle provides a few unique scenes (including a ridiculous opening wherein her neighbor gets stabbed by a window right next to her which she doesn't hear, neglecting her peripheral vision which should be heightened) it doesn't matter nearly enough. It's forgotten for stretches and only serves as an easy way to let the killer sneak up on her. There's no tension from how much sound she's making as she's sneaking around, something she would have no way of gauging, or scenes where the audience is blanked into her silence (there's an occasional glitchy static sound meant to represent her hearing but it's not used for much) nor anything else completely unique like that.",Hush

103,destinylives52,Good despite some flaws,7,24 August 2016,"A deaf/mute woman (played by Kate Siegel) is alone in a cabin in the woods, writing her novel. Then one night, a masked man with a crossbow appears, telling her (Siegel can read lips) he will kill her; but before he does, he will torture her, physically and mentally. Cutting off her power supply, Siegel has no way to call the police. Her nearest neighbors are nowhere to be found, and she cannot outrun the killer. She knows that eventually the killer will tire of this ""game"" and break into her house and finish her. With limited options available, Siegel creates a daring plan that will give her a chance — albeit slim — to survive.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Hush"" is the scene **SPOILER ALERT** when the killer stabs a neighbor in the neck, and toys with him as he bleeds out. The victim puts up a hell of a fight, but with the rapid loss of blood, the outcome is certain.""Hush"" is a good suspense/thriller movie that would have been so much better had it not been for the two shenanigans I am about to mention. Shenanigan #1) **SPOILER ALERT** when her female neighbor is banging on Siegel's door as she is being killed, Siegel doesn't feel the vibrations, even though she's only a few feet away. Shenanigan #2) the male neighbor I mentioned of in the previous paragraph was a complete idiot in his first interactions with the killer. Only after a million clues was dropped on his caveman head did he get what was happening, and even then he kept making one mistake after another. Perhaps it was best that he was killed so that the world wouldn't be infected by his genetic code that carries the stupid gene.Despite those shenanigans, I very much enjoyed ""Hush""; rooting for Siegel to somehow find a way to survive, and wishing for the killer's death from the moment he appeared. Any movie that gets you involved like that is a good movie to watch.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Hush
104,nashw82,Simple but Thrilling Slasher,7,20 September 2020,"The premise is simple; a slasher stalks a deaf mute author at her cabin in the woods. But strong writing, direction, and acting elevate this to a worthwhile watch. Its a tight little horror film that packs enough action and thrills into its location and runtime. Kate Siegel does an amazing job of endearing us to her and expressing her fear, panic and thought processes despite the vocal limits of her role. The killer also does a solid job of taunting her in this entertaining game of cat and mouse. One of the more worthwhile slashers of recent years and worth checking out.",Hush
105,danielharden,A Deafening Silence,7,16 April 2016,"Are you tired of watching Horror movies where you have to sit through 90 minutes of ear bleeding screams from the mouths of the innocent? Then Hush is the home invasion horror for you. The film follows Maddie, a woman who became both deaf and mute at age 13 due to meningitis and crappy surgery for it, and that's all found out from the back cover of her own book she has written. She then fights for her life against a psychopathic killer who may or may not be a fan of AMC's The Walking Dead.The use of foreshadowing is great, from the smoke alarm to the alternative endings of Maddie's novels. Although obvious due to the majority of the films 15 minutes of dialogue being spent talking about the two, they are linked into the plot really well, especially the multiple endings. From the moment the multiple novel endings were mentioned I kept asking myself; ""how many endings will this film have and which one will they go with?"" The film had me hooked from the start to see the film through to the end.The films unique quality of Maddie's Disabilities made way for some greatly intense opportunities throughout the film. This quality gave the film a new avenue to take in order to frighten the audience and it took it. The tension of many scenes of the film are built around dramatic irony. The film is a horrific pantomime as you play a game of musical chairs with the edge of your seat through this noiseless nightmare.The two leads where great. Kate Siegel brought the emotion and brilliant physical acting in her non speaking role, while John Gallaghar Jr finally gets his moment to shine which he didn't quite get in 10 Clover field Lane. John Gallaghar Jr was fantastic as the psychopathic killer whose motive is never explained pulling off deranged and psychotic superbly well. These performances are important in keeping you interested and involved and are very much a well kept cog helping this machine work like clockwork.Mike Flanagan's Direction was grand and the films script is so simple but is also much more than a simple home invasion horror movie. The two coupled (pun intended) create a truly unique take on a done before sub genre. The high concept story is extremely easy to follow and the direction is perfect in creating tension and fear in those who behold this vision.I didn't really have many issues with this film. There is the matter of the obvious product placement. The start of this film feels more like a 20 minute Apple IPhone and IMac commercial due to the constant use of said products until John Gallaghar Jr has enough and starts nabbing them for himself. Also there really was no point in Maddie's ex which is literally forgotten about in the course of the film, but to be honest it was probably for the best. Also there is probably an explanation for this as there has been discussion about it, but I have no idea what the significance of the crossbows tallies are and the way in which it was done still baffles me but I am sure that in the magical world of the internet there is a perfectly good and well analysed explanation for this visual enigma code.Overall Hush the Netflix horror film is a good scare. The film is simple but effective, creating a gimmick and successfully utilising it to full effect. The film will have you on the edge of your seat warning the films protagonist as you talk or scream at the TV ""HE'S BEHIND YOU!!!""",Hush

108,Genti23,Intensity at its finest,9,7 June 2016,"Director Mike Flanagan has already proved himself on the horror genre many times before. Now however, he exceeds all of his previous work with Hush. A psychological horror thriller movie that is very entertaining. This movie is perfectly directed and amazingly written. The premise is nothing new but the execution is what makes it, special and as good as it is. Even though it is produced on a small budget and has a rather short running time, it still manages to keep us intrigued and at the edge of out seats. The ending is also very satisfying too. All the actors do a wonderful job here. The dark tone and the R rating is what helps this movie qualify as genuinely scary at times. It takes the familiar premise and the clichés that come with it, and makes something new out of it. And that's a very hard thing to do, but proved possible by M. Flanagan. I really enjoyed Hush, and while it isn't groundbreaking or anything (which it isn't even trying to be), it is still a fast paced, thrilling, scary and tense movie completed by very good performances and amazing directing.",Hush

110,WatchedAllMovies,another dumb slasher,4,18 August 2016,"When I see this Maddie, I'm thinking she's begging to be killed living in an isolated house all by herself, and with no hearing. A normal person would live with other people, or get a dog, or get a gun, or hang some mirrors around (to reduce blind spots).When she tried to cock a crossbow but didn't have the strength to do so, her solution is to keep trying. A normal person would look for other solutions instead of repeating what didn't work.And when she was shot with a crossbow bolt, the first thing she does is pull out the bolt and bleed.

In fact I tend to actively avoid them, but the premise of this one (A strange and sadistic man terrorizes a deaf and mute recluse) intrigued me. The added thrill of the would-be-victim's complete helplessness because she can't hear him coming was just too original to ignore.The film switches between sound and silence; allowing you, for small periods of time, to experience the horror the way our poor protagonist does. This adds a unique spook factor that even the most jaded horror movie buff will appreciate.The style with which the script and director chose to tell the story gives a few twist that are fun to have thrust upon you unsuspectingly. Overall I think that this thriller is one to watch as its subtleties will help to revive a genre that is increasingly filled with cheap thrills and prosaic antics that fail to scare anyone.

Something similar has been done in a 70's thriller and as far as I remember it was utilized better into that movie than with this one.This was an indie thriller suffering from a bad script or poor execution of it,it had some good elements in the beginning but as a whole fell flat.Normally would give it a 3 or 4 but because of the overrating going with 1.You can check it out,but...I don't recommend it.

Very old school thriller genre. There's very little gore.It's pretty simple premise, the deaf mute aspect of it isn't used in any cliché way it merely adds to the perspective. In a weird way it sort of forces you into her shoes since there's almost no dialog everything is told through sound and cinematography. From a vocal perspective the tables are turned in that the killer does most of the talking, because he's fascinated by this woman who becomes his prey by mere happenstance but in fact she proves herself far more capable than you'd expect. If I could think of a movie that this most reminds me of it would be some combination of ""The Collector"" and ""Panic room"". I really can't think of anything to complain about.

This review will also be a short one.""Hush"" is about a deaf authoress, who is left alone at her house. Someone takes advantage of this, a masked man, and starts to stalk her...This movie is directed by the same person who directed the movie ""Oculus"" starring Karen Gillan. This director is called Mike Flanagan. He did a really good job at directing the movie. Flanagan managed to create a tense full, good movie, with almost no dialogue. This is the thing that I found very interesting. Which is also a good part. He could keep me intrigued into the story. He also used some cool camera movements at times. The cinematography was also very good. The editing was good too. I didn't really pay attention to this part of the movie -I know, what a shame-, because I was more focused on the story. I will probably focus more on this in my second viewing. The make-up, though, was very good. This was a noticeable thing. The broken fingers of Maddie, when they got squished between the door. This scene was by the way also very gruesome to watch. This brings me to the next subject. The sound. This was a good thing, the editing of it, and the sound design. The soundtrack was sort of cliché. Something that I also like is the feel that they create, but I'll go on deeper on this in the last paragraph. A thing I might need to mention, is that I think that this was a very low-budget movie. I mention this, because this only makes the make-up, and sound more impressive.The acting was fine. Nothing superb, but fine. I was surprised of the cast. There were nearly any cast members, this is probably too because of the low budget. The actress of the main character, Kate Siegel, was good. The only issue I have with her, is that I felt like she wasn't always deaf, that there were moments that she actually heard something. This is of course something that's really hard to do, so I won't see it as something really bad. The good thing, though, was that you were routing for her. You didn't really get to know her character, but you were still invested in her. This is, ofcours, a good thing. The antagonist of the movie is played by John Gallagher Jr. He was good too. And again, without really knowing him, you ""hated"" his character. This was of course because you routed for the main character. The supporting cast was also fine. Nothing really special. The screenplay was also written by the director, but also by Kate Siegel, the actress of Maddie. Again prove that there wasn't a big budget. This was also a very well handled thing of the movie. The impressive thing is, is that the movie only contains a small amount of dialogue. But for the dialogue there was, it was good. The characters were also well created. The character of Maddie was one of a kind, because she couldn't speak, nor talk. This was,I think, one of the reasons why you rooted for her the most. The issue that I have with the antagonist is that he doesn't have a motive for wanting to scare Maddie. Well, more then scare her. A thing that they got right, is the feeling of the movie. You felt isolated, due to the Forest. There are of course the cliché jump scares, just not always at the moments you will expect. The main character is pretty smart too, this is a good thing. In most movies this is a very dumb thing. They also prove this by having these hallucinations, which were creative, and good. This gave a little twist, while I was thinking: 'Well that's stupid don't do that...oh'. Maddie does make some doubtable dissisions, but not very annoying things. A thing that was very good with Maddies character was that they made her a badass. They made her a independent woman, which also is a non-cliché thing.Overall this was a fun movie. This isn't a masterpiece, and it doesn't want to be it either. You'll just have to accept what the movie is and you'll enjoy it.7.6/10",Hush

128,Oberrated,Surprisingly strong thriller,8,1 May 2016,"I was utterly shocked by how much I enjoyed 'Hush'. At first, I was merely watching this due to the recommendation of a few friends (Shout out to Jalen, Shawn, and Grant), but then as I kept watching, the acting all on its own and the intensity of the scenes pulled me farther and farther in until I was unable to pull away from my screen. To reiterate; Maddie is a deaf and mute author. The film has moments of natural viewing where you see and hear everything as usual but it also goes into moments where you are forced to hear the environment exactly the way Maddie does. This immensely increased the intensity in some scenes as a loud environment was turned into a silence, causing the audience to hold their breath, or at least I did. To piggyback on this, with Maddie being deaf and her being the main character, the focus is then turned to the body language and overall the acting rather than the common babble of wordplay that is so often clichéd in horror/thriller films. With this being said, Kate Siegel knocks this performance out of the park without saying one word. Lastly, John Gallagher Jr. is phenomenal. Playing the villain in this role, he presents us with a diabolical cold-blooded killer who seems his sole purpose is to kill for sport. His antics and mannerisms are bone-chilling and with this role and '10 Cloverfield Lane' he has easily placed himself up there on a notable actor scale.Again, 'Hush' can be found on Netflix. I highly recommend this flick for the fans of cold, bone-chilling thriller/horror. The small ensemble cast takes this film and runs it home.",Hush
129,rowanmaillot,One of the Best of the Decade!,9,3 May 2020,"This film is intense, to warn you there are spoilers, because this isn't your normal trashy B grade horror flick with a nonsense, crappy, cheesy and predictable plot, this film is seriously INTELLIGENT compared to the crap people are putting out today. Let me just start off by saying Mike Flanagan is a true talent, he is definitely the greatest horror director working today, and I say that with true meaning.Doctor Sleep was truly one of the best films of 2019, so I went into this film just thinking that like with most horror directors, that this guy would just be a one hit wonder, but I was proven wrong. This movie has possibly one of the most unique and scariest villains ever put on screen, this film definitely screws with your head while you're watching it, we see a dream of what would happen to her if she took one route and what would happen if she took another. It has almost everything you could want from a horror movie if you're a true horror movie fan. That's the thing, this will divide audiences, some may love it, some may like it, some may hate it, some may dislike it, but you must appreciate itIt's so amazing how Flanagan can literally direct, produce, edit and write his movies, the first movie I ever saw by him was Before I Wake, it was definitely a great and unique horror film. Just to get this out in the open, I could never compare Flanagan to any other directors working today, but he would definitely be in my Top 5 Directors Working Today.Hush is basically about a deaf-mute lady, she is working on a novel and shows it to her friend, we see them communicate using sign language. Which leads on to the next scene where the friend is running to the door screaming for help, followed by her ex-boyfriend, he is armed with a bow and arrow, which is our first character dead. Then the neighbour's boyfriend comes by to check if his girlfriend is inside, then he encounters our villain, who plays as a detective to get his trust. But then he ends up dropping an item of his girlfriend's, so he grabs a rock and tries to knock him out with it, but he grabs out a knife just in time and gets his second victim.I feel like I don't need to explain more, as this is my longest review I've made and with good reason. 10/10",Hush

He promises to terrify the main hero and torment her until she wants to die, but then does one creepy thing and proceeds to spend the rest of the movie walking around the house.One scene, which particularly pissed me off was when the killer was fighting her friends boyfriend and boyfriend took the guy down and almost choked him out and she just watched and did nothing, she could have ran out there and stabbed the guy or helped her friend in some other way, but she just ran back into the house - what an unlikable characters.I actually was happy, when she was fake killed, thinking that movie might stand a chance, but alas - it was just a bait and switch.Would not recommend to anyone.",Hush
132,RileyOnFilm,Flanagan breaks ahead of the pack,9,16 December 2016,"Hush was made for under $75,000 usd but leaves us with the Hush product which is as scary as any high budget horror film. It's a ""thinking person's scary"" which some may prefer to the pure slice and dice variety, though there is certainly some of that here. hush movie poster This film was directed by Mike Flannigan (Oculus). He co-write the film with Kate Siegel (plays the main character Maddie) who in real life shares a house with Flannigan. In fact, several sources indicate they wrote the screenplay with their home layout as a blueprint. She starred in Oculus.""Hush"" is a thriller and horror movie that features a deaf writer at her laptop being broken in on and attacked by a masked man. There are few casualties, few actors, and definitely a few gallons of blood spilled on scene. One original component that builds suspense is that the main character/victim is deaf. This is an ingenious idea as it allows for a few really spine tingling scenes requiring no cgi or music for that matter. The killer's mask looks different from the standard ones we've seen in break-and-enter thrillers, for example presidents and Star Trek masks. In this case, it's very carefully crafted. In some scenes it appears to be part of the attacker's own face. This serves for another original, simple, scary element that probably didn't cost much to create.Another film that comes to mind that created massive scares on a low budget is Insidious. It's being proved again and again we don't need million dollar movies to be scared and thereby entertained. Through a series of slashings and ""intruder"" scenes, the deaf Maddie learns she doesn't have to be a victim. She fights back. Everything is filmed in a dark setting outside and inside the house. This accentuates the revenge element that weaves throughout and leads us to an ending that is pleasing horror critics all over the internet.The film screened at SXSW for a panel of industry ""buyers."" It did very well there but somehow ended up on Netflix where I was fortunate enough to see it. Netflix needs more quality horror and suspense films like Hush. Frankly the category is small on the service and appears to be shrinking. I had a lot of fun watching this film and highly recommend it if you can catch it on Netflix or elsewhere. Imagine you have earplugs in and can't hear a thing and you can't hear anyone sneaking in the window either. This film makes the most of the simple scares. I think it would be great to see it on the big screen.",Hush
133,NDbportmanfan,Bland and Not Very Believable,4,14 April 2016,"There were two main glaring issues I had with this movie. The first and more important was the killer's motive. This should have been very easy, but instead he took his time for no reason at all. He had no problem killing her friends, so what was he thinking? Oooohhh a deaf chick don't see these too often better savor the moment... I mean really? The second and this could just be me but why on Earth would someone with that disability want to live all by her self in the secluded woods, it is like you are asking for something bad to happen to you.Besides those two issues what I found troubling was that there was little suspense throughout the movie. She was relatively ""safe"" inside her house for the time being to come up with a plan, while he just circled the house for I don't know how long. She just made it her mission to leave the house and get attacked.The one and only bright spot I give this movie is the acting as I feel both main actors did a very good job at bringing their characters to life.Out of a score of ten, I would rate it a 4 given that it does some things well but is nowhere near a great horror film.",Hush
134,azeemnavarro,"Not original, still mildly refreshing",4,1 November 2019,"The problems with Hush is that it lacks originallity (this premise has been seen before) and an intelligent antagonist (even I could do a better job) . What goes for it is a decent performance by Kate Siegel, some great use of sound and a short-lenght.
Instead of being a full-lenght project, it should've been a short movie because the script doesn't give much of itself.

135,samgiannn,Hush (2016),7,16 April 2016,"Mike Flanagan is a director to keep his eye on, especially with the long-delayed Before I Wake. His knack for taking familiar horror tropes and adding a little twist to them has allowed him to make some of the best psychological horror films of the past few years in Oculus, Absentia and now Hush. Hush takes the ever-popular home invasion trope and adds an interesting surprise to the plot: the main character is deaf. This makes for some incredibly intense sequences where someone who can hear could easily get out of the situation, and she has to rely only her sight and touch to survive the night. Even if the home invasion plot doesn't offer much new, there are some incredibly original sequences that arise due to her disability. Also, the intruder cut the lights to the house, so she can hardly use her eyesight to help her anyway. The deaf woman, Maddie, is an author, so she has to come up with several different endings to her books and decide on the right one. She does this several times in the movie when trying to figure out how to get out alive including one part that provides one of the best shocks in the movie. Mike Flanagan creates a home invasion thriller that distinguishes itself from the pack by being both original and brutally effective.",Hush

The slasher movie has been done to 'death' so I thought here we go again.This slasher movie is different not just because the main star is deaf and mute but also there are some changes to the normal 'Man in mask' routine but I won't spoil anything. Also the fact she is deaf really adds some scary moments to some scenes and allows the writers to really play with some great ideas (Breath on neck etc). The movie starts fairly slowly but once it gets going it does with a bang and never lets up with some great twists along the way and the acing is top notch from all the cast.Really enjoyed this movie and it was a breath of fresh air in a tired tired subject matter,Hush

143,Diablo1616,Such a wonderful wonderful movie!,7,21 March 2020,"With only five characters, one location and a pretty simple plot, you'd expect this film to be decent popcorn entertainment at best.Hush is possibly one of the best horror movies of 2016. With an almost instantly likable protagonist, scares that don't rely on jumping out at you, and a killer that, while no Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers, will have you on the edge of your seat the second he makes his first move.Director Mike Flanagan brings this beautifully simple world to life in a way that feels truly realistic somehow, and with an unknown air that, in my opinion, makes Hush an instant overlooked classic.His wife, Kate Siegel, does her part in bringing our heroine Maddie to life perfectly. She's unbelievably likable and one of my favorite horror movie protagonists, in a way that, despite her uniqueness, makes her truly relatable as a writer who just can't think of a good ending to a story (Something I can fully understand).
Despite Maddie's natural disadvantages, being deaf and mute, she makes use of her other heightened senses and is incredibly intelligent for what may seem like a rather cliché horror movie girl. Her use of her heightened senses also leads to my all-time favorite horror movie scene when the killer sneaks up behind her.Speaking of the killer, John Gallagher Jr. brings his A-game to the role of a psychopath who's crazy for the sake of being a psychopath. While you'll probably be screaming ""Just die already and leave Maddie alone!"" at your screen throughout most of the film, he's strangely enjoyable in a very twisted way, his likableness as a villain (For the sake of being a villain) is just one of the many reasons I love this film. I wouldn't be surprised if I went to some horror convention one day dressed as ""Man"" from Hush (And yes, I'd be including the crossbow, mask, and knife).Michael Trucco, Samantha Sloyan and Emilia Graves do great as side-characters who serve mostly as cannon-fodder, or to give enjoyable banter with Maddie in what's mostly a decently silent film. The killer probably has the most lines in the film, with rather typical but likable villain-like lines, and sometimes we take a dive into Maddie's head to see what she's thinking.All-in-all, Hush is a tragically overlooked instant classic in my books, with a loveable protagonist, a detestable but at the same time likable antagonist, fun side-characters and a simple plot that somehow works its way to being one of 2016's best horror films. This film is glaring proof that you don't need a ridiculously loaded plot, or a high body count to make one instant classic horror film.I couldn't suggest this film more, and if you don't like it, you have that right, but I cannot possibly understand why, because a strange simplicity is what makes this movie work so well.I hope you enjoy, and if not, I hope one day you'll find a horror film that is to you, what Hush is to me, simplistic perfection wrapped in a neat little bow with everything a horror movie could ever need.Oh, and on one last note, this movie does actually give way to a lot, and I mean a lot, of theories that I'll let you discover for yourself, because a lot of them are damn good, much like the film.",Hush

The location, camera work, background music, sound effects..everything was just top notch!

Please...2) The guy taking off his mask. This made it like less spooky and mysterious and it took out the ""creep"" connotation out of the equation. Since he is just a random psychopathic dude who has no real personal vendetta or connection with her doing this made the character much weaker and the whole idea of being a crazy killer softer.3) The general fight scenes. Terrible right? the idiot girl had a chance to kill him on SO MANY OCCASIONS and didn't do it because of weakness. Like that time she got the crossbow and DIDN'T shoot him when he was standing in front of her outside the window with a clear shot...wtf so stupid. But then the bathtub scene she is so much pain and at the moment he tries stabbing her she dodges the knife and stabs him... OK sure. There were so many of these idiotic scenes.4) The predictable moment when the guy came around and was ABOUT to kill the guy and that moment the girl comes to knock on the door and lead to his death...Overall, they tried and overall it was mediocre but it wasn't the worst horror movie I've ever seen.

Then when he has the killer and strangling him why not go out and help him kill the man with a hammer, stone knife or anything.

152,thomasshahbaz,Finally someone with a good idea for the genre,9,18 November 2016,"I really can't fault anything about this film. It's as if somebody with actual intelligence decided to make an antidote to the likes of Last House On The Left, or all of the many, many other stalky slasher-cum-revenge films out there, all of which end up making their hero into something equally as disgusting as the original villain. This film doesn't do that, it simply sets out what would happen when a real person gets stalked and preyed upon by a very realistic madman, and it plays it so you root for her, not so you're forced to endure cruelty for cruelty's sake. Indeed, she gets a blow in EVERY single time he comes near her, not to mention her striking the first thereof. The deaf angle is very interesting, and allows the most part of the film to be very quiet and tense, almost strangely calm, which makes a welcome change from almost every other film I have ever seen of this type, these tending to be laden with clichés, poor dialogue, terrible characterisation, blah blah blah.The psychopathic antagonist is portrayed exactly as those types are in real life; cowardly, ridiculous, pathetic, but also devious and manipulative. I guess this makes him less scary than some might like, but in my opinion this is the film's strength. It's not, ""oh look, a big nasty man is being all horrible to a poor defenceless woman, waaaaaaagh"", it's more, ""what a horrendous c*nt this guy is, I might as well have some self respect and try to get the better of him"".Bravo!

155,anandrajeev979,"Intense , Terrifying , Smart , Effective and Nightmarish",8,30 January 2017,"After watching highly acclaimed and box office superhit Don't Breathe I didn't expect much from but here it is another nice little twist to home invasion horror/thriller genre. This time it's a woman who went mute and deaf during teenage and lives alone and quickly becomes the prey of a masked killer. The start of the film reminded me of scream and I knew I was in for a ride.Being mute and deaf she has her own advantages but mostly disadvantages. The first ten minutes are simple but quickly begins the cat mouse chase. Some of the murder scenes are really brutal and somehow they feel realistic which is really scary. Performances are again even without minimum dialogues are top notch. No wonder it's hidden gem of Netflix.As the film progress , the chase goes further which is as usually clichéd but the elements of horror and the resourceful and smart nature of our protagonist that somehow stands toe to toe with the villain makes it different. As it goesfor the rest of the film , the disability of the main character makes it harder for her and at the same time bringing a more intriguing character development. There's a lot of blood and some heart wrenching scenes involving a lot of blood. For the ending I think we saw it coming but it was nearly the same as I expected. Still , as a proper movie it has all the elements in the right place. It's a nice thriller/horror which great emphasis on performances (most horror movies have dumbest performances) and scary factor. It's good but doesn't break any new ground. I can easily place it within the likes of Don't Breathe and Last House On The Left .....",Hush
156,LiamCullen6,Pleasantly surprised,8,29 April 2016,"Selecting this movie on Netflix this evening the only thing I knew about it was the genre, which wasn't a very promising start. But in the first few moments - as Maddie is cooking herself dinner, overloading our senses with profound audio and visuals - I knew this was going to be something special.I'd go as far as saying that this is a genre re-defining movie.You'd think a trait as simple as deafness would have a relatively minor impact on the movie, but you'd be wrong: totally wrong. Maddie's deafness is what makes this movie totally unique in its genre as it adds an element which many of us likely have never considered having to worry about.The perspective changes throughout the movie to heighten tension and add to the already ominous atmosphere. Just when Maddie turns her back or closes the door, all of a sudden you go deaf too. You're drawn into the house and trapped alongside Maddie in sheer terror as you both struggle to ascertain where the assailant is; it's honestly petrifying.Of course, there are the regular genre clichés present: an unsuspecting friend shows up, several attempts at escaping are tried and failed, and there are many close-calls where the man almost gets in yet she just manages to close the door/window in time. But those clichés are often turned on their heads, such as when her escape attempt fails and her head is brutally smashed in, and then it's revealed to have only been a premonition.In the end, Maddie is able to use her weakness to her advantage as she disables the man by using her unbelievably powerful fire alarm to deafen him. I was glad to see her get the better of him, but I can't help but feel as though the ending would've been more fitting if she died on the floor with him then and there. I'm not sure where she found the energy to stand up, walk outside, and sit on the front porch for help to arrive - but that's one of very few gripes in an otherwise excellent movie.In short, if you enjoy horrors, yet - like me - you're tired of the same old crap: watch Hush. Frankly, it's great, and shows that there is still hope for the horror/thriller genre.",Hush
157,ksgillihan,Decent thriller ruined by terrible character decisions,5,8 May 2020,"The premise of this movie is actually pretty original. A deaf woman all alone is terrorized by a psychopath and attempts to stay alive despite her severe handicap. Unfortunately that's about where the movie starts showcasing some of the dumbest decisions by the main character and her attacker. The crazy guy just strolls up to the window and basically introduced himself. She sees that he has already killed her friend from next door but instead of preparing herself, she spends half the movie going from window to window just watching the guy. The killer doesn't seem all that bright either because he's just armed with a crossbow and a knife. He has no idea if she has a gun or anything to defend herself. He continues to march around the house and she continues to watch him.She makes a few stupid decisions to try and get out of the house and that just helps her to become severely injured. Instead of gearing up to defend herself she flounders around not doing much at all. The killer is also stupid as he basically hands her his crossbow. She goes through different scenarios in her mind about what to do and one of them is that she has to be very close to get a good shot with the crossbow. She then does the opposite and shoots at him from about 40 feet away. She hits him but it seems not to do much accept make him angry. Eventually he gets in the house and is right behind her but her super-senses warn her and she stabs him in the leg. She ends up in the kitchen and sprays him with bug spray and conveniently remembers to turn back on the extremely loud house alarm (which shouldn't work without power) and as he's choking her she stabs him and kills him.

Honestly, over the course of the film it was self-evident that there will be certain incoherences regarding the representation of the main antagonist (POV: I didn't understand his motivation to kill the girl and her close friends, nor the fact that he decided to break into her house at the end of the movie) and also, why she typed on her laptop about her apparent gruesome demise, when, in fact, it didn't come about.Notwithstanding these subtle things, the tension what the movie was pervaded with was spectacularly externalised!

162,MoviesRT,Thriller with serious flaws,5,28 April 2016,"I liked this one pretty good, but it made you angry at how idiotic most of the characters were throughout.Basically some guy hates this woman enough to kill two other people and injure himself just to torment her to death. The only thing that made it different was that she was deaf and unable to talk.Spoiler? - he doesn't succeed in the end, but I knew that from the beginning.What bothered me was how unobservant this woman was. The guy was slamming her neighbor's head against the glass door repeatedly and none of the vibrations alerted her at all. She didn't even see him out of the corner of her eye when he was right outside the door. And the killer acted like he didn't realize she was deaf at first, but we learned very early in the story that he knew her and wanted her dead for some unknown reason.Then he took off his hideous mask and all the suspense went out of the story. Besides, we never did find out why he hated her so much. Or maybe I missed something, but none of it made sense.I won't go into all the stupid things everyone did because most movies like this depend on stupidity to work, but I will say one thing: If she had had a gun this movie would have been over in about 5 minutes.I guess we can't arm innocent victims or the bad guys would have too much trouble pushing them around. I just couldn't resist imagining her holding up a shotgun and watching the look on his face.Oh well... you know Hollywood.

164,DavidLindahl,Fails to engage due to lack of story,4,16 May 2016,"Why not make a horror film about a deaf girl that gets harassed by a complete stranger, only out to mess with her. There's the story in Hush. It actually is quite an interesting idea with a rethinking perspective but unfortunately it quickly destroys that and becomes boring. So, a deaf female author has moved out into the woods to live her life secluded from the rest of the world. She doesn't seem interested in dating and prefers to be alone. Suddenly a psychotic man armed with a crossbow arrives and starts to harass her. The director Mike Flanagan has a certain love for horror films and has directed a couple of them before.This type of film is actually usually pretty monotone and not very developing. But what other films do better than this one, is to at least tell us why things happen. A total stranger with a crossbow shows up, looking to kill and harass and we have absolutely no idea why. The deaf girl is established in an OK way. We get that she lives there. She Skypes with her friends and then rejects them to spend the night alone. But we barely know anymore than that.The thing that Hush does well is to use the fact that she is deaf. Computers, phones and alarms comes in handy because she can't hear a sound. That of course also results in a lot of scenes where he easily can surprise her and sneak up behind her. PRetty exciting. But if you remove all that then there's not much left to take with you besides a poor deaf girl in the forest. Couldn't they have tied the perpetrator in some way to the girl? Perhaps director Flanagan wants to show some sort of horror scenario for people living in the woods. You are never safe. Unfortunately I don't think that is the case here.

168,AnAverageNerd,Pleasantly surprised!,8,24 September 2021,"My expectations were neither high or low prior to watching Hush due to my lack of knowledge about it. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film and felt as suspense/slasher horrors go it definitely stands out. I think the most impressive thing this film does is that it doesn't rely on big jump-scares or screams but if anything maintains a constant tension throughout with us as watchers expecting these. I feel the story does take some cliche turns which let it down slightly however these don't overshadow the good choices. As someone who rarely feels the horror genre gets it right, this is definitely one to watch!",Hush
169,Bryan_Roderick,Great Slasher/Suspense,8,3 May 2016,"HushHush is a film about a mute/deaf who gets terrorized by a psychopath. I love how simplistic the story-line is, but at the same time I wish I understood why the villain was doing the things he was doing. I get the who ""he just wants to watch the world burn."" but why this girl, why now. Serious serial killers, like dance choreographers generally have a theme in mind.That being said John Gallagher Jr., who I know as the lovable Jim Harper from The Newsroom, plays the psychopath to point. He's crazy for sure but he hasn't lost all of his marbles which makes him a more believable character, I just wish there was some sort of reason to his madness. His character doesn't even have a name. I adore that in the writing.Speaking of writing, the film is not only stared by Kate Siegel but is also written by her as well. The director Mike Flanagan also helped write, but I'm glad to see the two together again. They worked on Oculus if you're wondering the connection. Back to Kate, she was wonderful. She didn't have many lines since her character is a mute. Sure the first few scenes are boring, but the movie jumps straight into terror early on and she has to act to entertain rather than leave it for the writing.Michael Trucco is also in the film. He'll always been Samuel Anders to me though from BSG. He plays a side character that is an important scene to develop John Gallagher Jr.'s character. Even though this cast is only 5 people I still think he did a good job as his character.Verdict: Watch at least once, don't buy. There is a persistent and fast paced feeling of dread throughout most of the movie with a few breather moments. Not many jump scares, but if you've seen any slasher film you know when they're going to happen.",Hush
170,lev-nemkin,A good cat and mouse thriller...,7,18 October 2016,"I didn't really know what to expect when I went into Hush some people had told me it was decent and some had said it was great some just OK so I just didn't know what it would be like but I gotta say this was a good cat and mouse thriller I mean to me that's exactly what it was it didn't feel like a horror film it was very well thought out though,the story was good,acting was really good and at one point in the film Dane Cook made an appearance he does end up getting killed by the killer after he tried to pass himself off as a police officer throughout the entire thing that's the only actor I recognized but the main actress who played Maddie was just great and so was the guy who was screwing with her he was kind of just playing games with her until he was ready to come in the house to kill her but she really fought for her life she did anything she could to make sure he didn't end up coming into that house she defended herself really well at one point she actually wrote a message to try get him to go away saying that she didn't see his face and that her boyfriend will be coming home soon so he takes off his mask then as soon as he knows she can read his lips because Maddie in this is a deaf mute he tells her she's seen his face now,makes a point that he knows she's alone in the house and has no boyfriend and that he will toy with her until he is ready to come inside and kill her. I didn't expect her to defend herself the way she did I mean Maddie really handled herself well in this film plus it was really intense it kept me interested I liked how they built up to the climax they really should make these types of thrillers more often.

There are so many films out there from big studios and small as well that try hard to push these indie horror films but they never deliver, so it was such a surprise when this short little film shocked me. The element of suspense was perfectly captured in the battle of a mute/deaf woman and her psychotic tormentor. The final girl moments are played out really well given this final girl does not have many advantages going for her, so the scene where she plays out the scenarios of her death over and over is pretty much what every other final has done to survive in all horror films. Filled with suspense and some actually bone chilling moments this makes for an excellent horror film, with a good actress and a clever take on an old tale.Wish there were more films like this out there.

178,gimili3979,What a great thriller,7,3 May 2020,"Hush is a movie about a deaf writer who has to fight for her life against a masked intruder. At only 81 minutes the movie gets straight to the point. What defines this movie is what makes it different from thrillers similar to it. Whenever you have a character who is either blind or deaf, it presents inherent problems with the plot. The director could have chose not to deal with those problems and simply make a horror thriller film. It was refreshing that the director chose to confront these problems head-on.The main criticism of this film is the premise. But in order for the story to work and not be heavily criticized for being unrealistic, it has to take that route. Maybe there was another way, but I could not think of it. And sometimes it seems like the characters have too many lives for their injuries, but I digress.Overall, I highly recommend seeing Hush.",Hush

The movie is full of clichés and after a certain point it becomes really boring despite the fact that the movie is not very long. I am not going to say exactly what happens because I don't want to give away anything but what you read in the description of the movie is basically what you will get, there is nothing more: the characters are hardly developed and there is very little plot comparing to what is already known from the synopsis and the trailers. I don't recommend it for two main reasons: First of all it is not scary at all at least to those that have some experience with the genre and secondly there are way better movies like this one that are way better from every prospective. If you ask me leave this one and try watching 'Don't breath'.",Hush

Having the main character be deaf is interesting, but unfortunately it doesn't pay off very well. There's not much buildup to the game of cat and mouse that makes up the bulk of the story and so the viewer is thrust into the action in a way that seriously lessens its impact. There are flashes of promise in the first ten or so minutes but after that it's a fairly clichéd survival horror that doesn't offer anything spectacular. Some fleeting moments of tension and shock make it worth a one time watch if you're curious, but don't go into it with high expectations.",Hush

186,ralo229,Tense and Atmospheric,8,1 November 2016,"Now on the surface, the story sounds pretty standard and even kind of bland, since home invasion stories are anything but new, but it's executed fairly solidly. The main character is very easy to root for. She's not the stereotypical dumb female that we see in a lot of crappy horror films, but she's also not an axe wielding overpowered bad ass that is suddenly invincible and unstoppable. She's just a person trying to find her way out of a bad situation by any means she can. She's not stupid. She's actually really smart. In fact, there's a pretty clever scene at one point during the film, where she's imagining a bunch of different scenarios to escape from the cottage and what the final outcome will be, which is actually based off a technique she uses to find a preferable ending to her novels. Most horror movies give a character a backstory and not have it tie into anything, but this flick cleverly ties it in and it works very well. So yeah, I like the main character.The killer, I assure you, you will despise. And I mean that in a good way. This guy is creepy, mysterious, vulgar, sadistic, and just a straight-up douche. You're just waiting for him to drop dead at any minute. But at the same time, he's smart as well. So him and the main character are evenly matched making it harder to predict what the outcome of each scene will be. It's true, we don't know much about his past or his motive behind why he's even trying to kill this girl to begin with, but in this case, I think it's just the mysteriousness behind his character that makes him all the more intimidating and unpredictable. You just never know what this guy is going to do next.The film is also not nearly as violent as you'd expect. Sure there's blood and stabbing and some of the basic crap you'd expect from a movie about a killer, but it mostly relies on its atmosphere and suspense to move the story forward. It doesn't feel like it needs to pander to the lowest common denominator just for the hell of it. It just wants to tell its story the way it intends and feels that it doesn't need excessive gore. The film doesn't have as much dialogue as you'd expect either. Yeah, there's actually huge portions of this film with little to no dialogue. But it's still just as suspenseful, I might even argue more suspenseful, than the scenes with dialogue. It relies on its atmosphere and its intimidating antagonist in order to build tension. So the film does show an understanding of how to build suspense.I would recommend checking out this film. It's an entertaining suspenseful thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and might even leave you a bit disturbed. Check it out on Netflix. It's definitely worth the watch.",Hush

189,klheintz,Another average scary movie from Flanagan,4,10 November 2016,"I was excited to see this film as I really enjoy the home invasion genre and I have known Flanagan's movies to be average but not really bad. I was let down. I thought this could be the best film he has to offer but unfortunately for all of us, it is not the case. In fact it's hard to even say which one of his movies is his best. He's nailed the ""average horror film.""I like the spin they give the movie by having our heroine be deaf but other than that there's not really anything special. There's nothing in the film that keeps it interesting past that one little detail. Siegel does a good job displaying emotions without her voice and her performance is only visual but it's good.I think that the idea of the movie is really cool but it falls prey to what most home invasion movies fall prey to... It fails to keep you interested and doesn't throw any crazy stuff into the movie to spice it up. One of the cool things they did was have one scene where she runs through the various routes available to her as she plans out her ""escape."" I just wish there was more of that.Overall it's a decent movie but fails to stay interesting past the beginning.",Hush
190,sukanya-samy,"Stephen King praised this movie, what more would one want!",8,28 October 2016,"I tell you – Mike Flanagan is doing some really good work in the horror/thriller genre. I have watched his recent movies Oculus and Before I Wake (which I reviewed a few days back), and I liked what I saw. I didn't like Before I Wake as much as Oculus but Hush is probably at par with Oculus. I think people interested in this genre, should definitely watch all three.It has been a few months since this released and it is on Netflix – so this review has some spoilers. First reviewed on broth of blogs.Plot and Script (P&S)What happens when a psychotic killer meets a deaf and mute person? That't the premise of Hush. Kate Siegel is the deaf and mute writer who has retreated to a cabin in the woods to write her a second book. She has a friendly couple who lives close but other than that she doesn't have much contact with people except maybe her sis who she chats with online.Enter psychotic serial killer who kills her friend first and after getting to know Kate can neither speak or hear, launches a cat and mouse game of torture and agony. He obvious undermines Kate who is extremely smart and compensates for her lack of two of the most important senses with brains and instinct.I loved the plot. It is an overused 'psycho comes home and kills all' theme but it has been twisted enough to make it seem fresh. I read that Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel, who are a married couple of real life, came up with the story while dating. And played out almost every scene in their own house before starting the movie. No wonder there are no dumb moves and the story proceeds in a coherent fashion.I mean obviously the killer could have broken in anytime, all the doors and windows were made of glass but his feeling of superiority becomes the death of him and it is believable.Characterization and Acting (C&A)Kate is great as the writer – she pulls off the role really well. The killer is good too, he looks like a normal enough person (I guess most serial offenders do) and can be seen as sinister only through his actions and brutality. The supporting cast of the friendly couple is good enough which is the other thing I love about the movie. It has only 4 living adults in the whole movie – the sister is online and the cat doesn't count. But Mr. Flanagan made a pretty decent movie with just 4 people in a whole movie.Sound and Effects (S&E)Out of the 85 odd minutes, there is dialogue only for about 15. Majority of the movie relies on sounds and other effects and it is great to see what background sound can do to make the experience of watching a movie better. The fact that the main lead can neither hear or speak makes it a tad more interesting – how do the sounds play out for such a person? Like the end where her vision is blurring and her heartbeat is slowing down and how she is talking to herself in her head.Nicely done.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)Almost the whole movie plays out in the dark and the visuals look good. They have made good used of the smoke alarm and the pace of the movie is kept at all times. The only little problem I had was that sometimes it was a little too dark to see what was actually happening.Direction and Overall (D&O)Like I said, this movie is good – Mike Flanagan has taken a known concept and given it a twist. Like Oculus and Before I Wake.I am also glad that they didn't go in to the background of the killer which would have killed the movie for sure. I am definitely going to watch out for his other movies.So here are my scores according to my new system:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1.5Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 1.5Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 1.5Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 1.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 2.0Overall Score – 8 out of 10Good one – highly recommended. It seems Stephen King also praised the movie. First reviewed on broth of blogs.You might also like:Before I WakeDescent 1Descent 2",Hush
191,alexanderstephencraig,Raw Acting Adrenaline Fueled,9,7 May 2016,"I feel like most horror films are a hit and miss nowadays. Rarely do I see a horror film and think meh; usually it's love or hate. This film is on the love side. There are a lot of films I enjoy personally that are stripped of complication and layers. (Although I enjoy those as well. See: Inception) This film is a basic story of a writer who lives almost in complete isolation of any nearby help. A man who for an undisclosed reason, decides he would like to torment her and eventually kill her. The interesting twist for this film is that the lead actress, (Also the writer) Kate Siegel, is deaf. So entertainingly enough she has to keep an eye on the deranged man, John Gallagher Jr., while trying to escape him. Being the fact that the main character Maddie is a deaf mute, makes her acting all the more entertaining being that she mostly acts through complete physical emotion and very little verbal. Also noting that she and every other actor in this film do terrific jobs. There is slight more complexity to this film that adds a little more entertaining touch, but you'll just have to watch to find out. I very much enjoyed this film.

I'm so confused and wanted more questions answered. I get that sometimes things can be random but the way that the killer goes around and tries everything within his power to go and murder this random girl it just comes off that there's more to it why he's there. Maybe I missed something, but I really don't think so. I don't think it's a horrible movie but it would've been told better. The main character was a great pick and her acting was wonderful. Her story was told pretty well except that they don't really explain much with craig except that they just abruptly ended their relationship and he's calling her multiple times right before this guy comes and murders them. Makes you wonder if he sent him? Like I said so many unanswered questions.

193,Raxing,Decent Idea Executed In The Worst Possible Way.,2,28 October 2020,"Every character is undeveloped, every scene is ridiculous, every character is stupid as hell, and the ending is predictable. The idea of her being deaf and mute may sound like an idea to create a unique horror film, but the way it was executed suggests it was just an excuse to use the same horror cliches that are used over and over again, but to make them seem more ""realistic"" although they still fail at that. It fails because the writers could not put themselves into the shoes of any of the characters in the film. A deaf and mute character leaves the food she is cooking unattended to go talk to her neighbor outside even though her neighbor could of easily talked with her inside. If she is deaf and mute and has been for years, she knows that she will never hear a timer going off to inform her that the food is done cooking, so that is deaf and mute would NEVER do that. That is how the whole movie is written. Don't bother watching this trash. A 2/10 is generous.",Hush

195,mrvanin,"Tedious, frustrating and annoying.",2,6 January 2018,"No spoilers, because this movie may appeal to mouth-breathers who identify with the similarly-afflicted villain in this mess. (I can't call him the antagonist, with a clear conscience).Briefly, this is a story of an evident imbecile who decides to murder an apparent moron. Since the unfortunate leading actors play similarly unintentionally slow-witted roles, there is absolutely no incentive for the viewer to become invested in the outcome. Some reviewers hoped that the damsel in distress would just get snuffed out already and gotten over with - but I can't pretend to be that concerned for the success of either party.But that's not all. It gets worse.The majority of the activity is filmed in the dark. Not just ""Hollywood dark"", as in a filter placed over the camera lens to indicate that it's dark, but actual darkness. So, congratulations to anyone with the ability to absorb photons more efficiently than the ordinary humans among us. Since many psycho-thrillers are completely dependent on the protagonists making stupid decisions, it may be some sort of a mixed blessing that this one makes no departure from that trusty, rusty, old plot device - and stupid decisions pop up with tedious regularity. Accordingly, the vague movements that are dimly noticeable on the dark screen eventually become unimportant enough for us to give up caring about whatever the heck is supposed to be happening. I watched this dreck virtually for free on Netflix. In my experience, one has to watch a lot of terrible movies in order to appreciate the better ones, so the time lost on this poorly-written and badly-directed pap is just another lesson. Also, I could easily afford the risk of paying less than one hundred percent of my attention to the frequent, boring interludes, to read up about the movie so that I could put the visible fragments together. Without IMDB and Wikipedia to literally spell it out for me, I would still be in the dark. 'Hush' gets two stars because I watched the entire thing.

The face reveal of the bad guy is sloppily done and doesn't deliver the 'sadistic and murderous' aura that it's going for and the main protagonist is downright moronic at times with things like being unable to kill the baddie with a crossbow from 15 yards but being able to perfectly spray him in the eyes with bug spray......The murderous villain is hollow and at times dull, playing too far into the 'mysterious killer' troupe and not being scary just mildly irritating.All in all, Hush delivers a good opening 25-30 minutes but drops like a lead balloon after that, and with its shot runtime of sub 90 minutes, it feels like an effort to drag yourself over the line for a character you never bonded with and agains a villain that you're ambivalent towards",Hush

204,stencilman,Heralds the arrival of the next (potential) master of horror,8,21 May 2016,"I will begin by mentioning that I am a big fan of Oculus. It is one of those horror movies which is very evenly paced and takes a potentially silly premise and turns it into some wonderful psychological horror. What I liked about Mike Flanagan's work was that he created characters we root for and want to make it out alive. He is not interested in making cookie cutter slashers where we want the killer to get creative. That is a good trait in a horror filmmaker and Flanagan is definitely very good.Hush touches upon a premise which is a personal favorite. The home invasion story, if done properly (The Strangers, Black Christmas, When a Stranger Calls, Halloween), can be very compelling. Add Hush to the list. It takes an overdone premise and adds twists in it which you do not see coming. The character of Maddie might seem like a cheap story device but Kate Siegel does a wonderful job of getting us on her side. At the same time, the dangerous but smug antagonist is essayed very well. We want to see Maddie live and the killer die a horrible, painful death. The amount of stupid decisions made by the protagonists is kept to a minimum and ultimately, it makes for really satisfying viewing.To conclude, Hush is a must watch if you like intelligent and visceral horror movies. You cannot help but think that you might just be watching the work of the next big thing in Horror.",Hush

Fire alarms ringing on and on, phones ringing more times than possible. As if I wanted to sit down and watch a movie only to hear annoying tones from reality I've drowned out to watch the film.

A deaf woman, ups the ante in filming and sound or lack there of. I found the cinematography great in this movie as well. It had a dark, eerie essence about it and it was a multi climactic movie. This movie did its job and was creeping me out for a couple of days. It has been a while since a thriller/horror flick has had that effect. Watch the movie for yourself. Don't even look at the ratings or even my review!",Hush
211,PatoRonald,"Wtf man, why so many negative reviews?",8,9 February 2021,"After watching the movie (which I found very interesting btw)
I went to read some reviews of the film here on IMDB, and what I saw was a flood of negative criticisms defaming the film, most talking about the stupid decisions made by the characters, something I completely disagree with, I think the decisions made by the characters are very smart ( given the circumstances).
I like the fact that the protagonist is deaf (I just think the direction should use it more in favor of the antagonist ), I also liked the serial killer to be just a serial killer, who kills because yes, and that's it.
Not everything needs to have a reason and the serial killers are proof of that, the film does not need to justify its actions, even because it is a SERIAL KILLER isn't it self-explanatory enough?The film is tension from beginning to end !!
Getting the viewer very involved with the plot and the characters, even with the serial killer, oddly enough.I like how the director show the house and its rooms in an organic way, subtly showing the places where the killer can enter, and the places where the victim can hide.I think the only thing I disliked about the film was the direction, even though Director Mike Flanagan is competent most of the time, I think he left something to be desired in TERROR. Even though the atmosphere at the beginning of the film is quite TERROR, in the course of the film, terror becomes much more secondary than anything else, with the direction focusing much more on the cat and mouse chase of the murderer and the victim (something interested enough).
Even though I missed that requirement a little, I ended up liking it anyway, with the facts unfolding, I was very fixed in the film. I just think that the direction missed an opportunity to make an excellent horror / chase movie, to focus more on an action and drama Thriller.
I think there was a lack of boldness in the direction in some aspects, but overall it is a great film.

Fortunately for you guys, it doesn't.But this movie offers more than just a reasonably happy ending. It showcases the talent that is John Gallagher Jr - a rising star who needs to take on more bad guy roles as he absolutely smashed it out of the park in this movie. He gets every characteristic of his part across in the first few minutes on screen and once we are comfortable with that, he just goes on to emphasise each trait to reveal just how truly sick and twisted he is. We know this type of character, sure, we've seen it before, but John Gallagher Jr does something impressive here and stands out, even alongside husband and wife/director and star duo Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel.",Hush

217,xxmisssvxx,Good movie but lacked a few things.,7,15 May 2016,"I gave this a solid 7/10 rating because overall it's a good movie but it still lacked a few things to allow its full potential to be a great movie. First off, 2/3 actors (whom I've come to known over time) had very short roles: Samantha Sloyan (Grey's Anatomy), Michael Trucco (One Tree Hill - TV show), and John Gallagher Jr.(10 Cloverfied Lane). For Michael Trucco, his role was the shortest and seemed a bit pointless to me, and you'd think that considering the situation he faced in the film, he'd be better prepared and more smarter. The entire encounter between him and the masked man felt flat. For Kate Siegel's character - she played her role well, and in some scenes she reminds me a younger Angelina Jolie. Now getting into the actual movie review...Realistically, the movie doesn't explain why Maddie was targeted, not to mention targeted by someone who walks around carrying a bow & arrow? If someone is truly trying to target and/or attack you, they'd have a gun or knife - some more common type of weapon. This was a typical guy who seemed to have nothing better to do, and chose to bother a deaf woman in the woods. And for what? Boredom? He had a bad day? This story line needed an explanation. To add to this, he (masked man) seemed to have procrastinated on truly killing Maddie (or trying to kill her hypothetically speaking). I wouldn't say this film is bad because it's not but it does miss key points that could've made this film much better (and maybe even a theatrical release instead of straight-to-DVD). I would recommend anyone to watching this if you're looking for something decent to watch. Enjoy!",Hush
218,Stenian,"Great concept laid out badly, on top of the gratuitous violence and unscary killer",3,3 November 2021,"This film started out pretty good. I liked the idea of a deaf protagonist. The suspense was already looming. The lead actress Kate Siegel echoed a 2000s, Lara Craft-style Angelina Jolie for me. A very beautiful actress with talent that should be popular already.As I said, the beginning was engaging. I liked the idea of a masked killer stalking the main character. Except, all hell broke loose for me when they unmasked the guy around like 30 minutes into the film. The guy (John Gallagher Jr.) looked so unfit for the part. By unfit, I mean he looked innocent, warm and cute kind of guy-next-door type. There was nothing frightening about him. I thought John (Michael Trucco) was more fitting with those piercing blue eyes and ""jock"" build. He should've been masked right until the end of the film. A surprise twist would've been nice.After we saw the killer behind the mask, the what was a horror film pretty much became a home invasion, run-of-the-mill thriller with clichés after clichés. It also became gratuitously and unnecessarily violent. For the last time, ye moviemakers, violence and blood doesn't make a movie scary. When will they learn this? Besides, gory horror movies are so 2000s and unhip. Now was this even a horror film? It didn't scare me one bit. The only true shocking scene was when the killer held up Maddie's friend gored body towards the window and made her ""knock"" it to scare Maddie. That part was good horror material.The ""what if"" sequence with Maddie going through possible outcomes, including one that involves her being bludgeoned to death, was clearly done just for the shock value (and not in a tasteful way). Perhaps for the producers to use these clips of Maddie getting slaughtered in trailers to deceive viewers. Not impressed. Not to mention, a lot of horror/survival movies nowadays have such premonition scenes where the main character ""imagines"" themselves being killed or rescued, only that it's just their corny vision or dream.What happened to orchestral music in horror movies? Now I'm not asking for a full blown, traditional, loud, incessant orchestra. But some orchestra is needed to make the film seem more authentic and classically cinematic, if you will. A good mix of synth and orchestra would have been nice. But then again, this film is a lost cause. It was way too flawed and terrible for anything to ""save"" it really.If you want good home invasion thrillers that don't need gore to excite you, watch Panic Room (2002), Funny Games (2007), The Strangers (2007) and, hell, even Trapped (2002). I'd recommend The Strangers for a true horror film experience (the others are more thrillers).",Hush

222,natekowalskitattoo,"Awful, that's all I have to say.",2,21 April 2016,"This movie is about a home invasion. The main character is deaf and has to deal with an idiot intruder who has zero motive. She runs around aimlessly while he tries to get in. Although he has no problem randomly murdering people and trashing the main characters car, for some reason he refuses to break any windows, doors, or force entry at the household. He paces around outside for most of the movie.I have no idea why a deaf woman who is single would live in an isolated area alone, and not even lock her doors at night. Also if you are living in isolation in a forest you would have at least some weapon or alarm system with police notification and emergency power system. ESPECIALLY if you were deaf!!Upon realizing he has violent intentions she...instead of arming herself, grabs her lipstick and writes him notes on the window about her non existent boyfriend to try and scare the intruder.To sum it up this movie was filled with plot holes and lacked substance. There were tons of useless scenes that did not contribute to the plot at all. If you manage to sit through the whole thing you will come to realize that no plot ever does develop and no aspect of the movie was explained beyond the basic premise.2 out of ten, I bumped the rating from one since the movie had a short runtime.

Samantha Sloyan, fresh from Grey's Anatomy, gave as well a credible, if not short-lived performance. The plot quickly moved from a benign beginning to a scary and terrifying situation. No motive was ever established for the ongoing acts of terror perpetrated by the ""Man"" played by John Gallagher Jr. The film also never explained the ongoing actions of the ""Man"" relative to gaining access to Maddie's house nor addressed the burning question: are windows in a house not made for breaking when someone outside really wants to get in.",Hush

226,shadowtree,Decent tension builder,7,8 June 2019,"Found this on Netflix and decided to give it a shot. I had tried to make it through The Blackcoat's Daughter earlier in the evening, but I bailed on that and went over to Hush; by comparison, this one is much better.The movie starts well enough by establishing Maddie's background and new situation. There is the element of Craig, her ex, who we feel may become prominent to the storyline but never does.Once the murderer arrives, it is clear he does not want to simply murder her, he wants to toy with her for a while. He's already murdered her friend and gained access to the house, but he opts to scare her first. This is the basis of the movie and where it starts to grow.The murderer is okay, not particularly smart, but sufficient. His assault on Sarah, followed by using her as a prop, was rather brutal. Other than that, I did not find his character notable.Maddie is a likable character. Despite her faults, we want her to win and take that guy out. She has at least two solid opportunities to end it, and they are both in the same scene. John, Sarah's boyfriend, is moments away from knocking the murderer out with a rock when Maddie inadvertently alerts the murderer by banging on the window. As a result, John gets stabbed and his plan is foiled. All is not lost, however, as he is able to recover enough to pin the murderer and choke him out. This is all happening about 20 ft. away from Maddie outside the house. Maddie has an ideal opportunity to walk up and deliver the final blow while John has the murderer pinned, but she blows it by staying in the house. This is somewhat confusing as we later see Maddie calculating all the possible outcomes depending on what she decides to do next. She is clearly logical enough to have known to make a move when John had the murderer down, yet that forethought was not put to her advantage. That, to me, is the weakest point of the movie.That aside, Maddie makes a good heroine. She keeps fighting and figures out how to use her lack of hearing to help her (fire alarm). Despite being put on the verge of death, she is able to hang on and turn the tide. I was cheering for her in those closing moments.",Hush

The protagonist and antagonist are quite deliciously - whatever they need to be - evil, tough, stupid, etc..There were some obvious plot points that might irritate you if you try to make everything too realistic, but hey! this is a movie, so go ahead and enjoy it. That being said, there are some very very real moments too...! the movie does fall for some familiar tropes in the genre, but i was able to forgive them that. You will find yourself yelling at the main actor to do this or that; what more do you want! :) It is a film that will involve and engage you, but you have to let it.

229,checabear-252-222274,home alone 5,3,3 May 2016,"Just finished watching this movie on Netflix. Quarter of the way through i started browsing what deals where available on wagjag,check my inbox and made my lunch. Came back to the movie and she was still running around inside the house then outside the house then inside the house....etc. The movie is about a lady who lost her hearing and speech, locked in mortal combat with a mime. Of course this person decided to live in the wilderness armed with kitchen knifes and smoke detectors without any self defense training. People in LA and NY are probably better suited for this type of home alone incident. Say she had herself a shotgun and disabled the mime then the movie would be over in say the first 20 minutes. Or maybe the mime broke the glass in the windows or door, the show would be over about the same time. Or if the boyfriend wonders why a undercover officer is walking around in the middle of nowhere, otherwise he would be in uniform. i skipped over the conversation between dumb and dumber. Whatever they discussed never made the movie more interesting, exciting or advanced the plot. It only used more film,time and patience. I read the back of the wasp repellent once, it says to wash out your eyes immediately and seek medical attention immediately and do not rub if spray in the eyes.Can't always believe what you read. Apparently this mime had superhuman eyes with a wasp's brain. There is another home alone movie with Jodie Foster.

230,lizaio1,An extra star because I heart Mike Flanagan,8,30 January 2018,"Hush might not be the best movie ever, but it has that Mike Flanagan pace and tone, which made me like it before I even knew who Mike Flanagan was. I said that Hush might not be the best movie ever, but it certainly isn't the worst. It was concise, paced very well and well-acted by both Kate Siegel and John Gallagher Jr. I've seen people say that The Man's motives were unclear, that things didn't make sense. To me, that is what pushes this movie a little higher in the originality department. It's fascinating that we don't know The Man's motives, but we see his brutality and madness in full bloom. Yes, he was sloppy and he and Maddie could have killed each other a few times before the end, but that worked for me BECAUSE he was totally unhinged. This is worth a watch if you like suspenseful movies that contain some violence. The real thing to watch is Mike Flanagan.",Hush

The characters were very well realized, for the most part, and the plot moved along well without seeming too contrived. I didn't find it scary or even particularly suspenseful, but it intrigued me from the get go.Apparently the story was written by a married couple who team up for movie making, and it was neat to discover that. Indeed, similar to Oculus (an earlier Flanagan/Siegel project), dull predictability took a vacation and was replaced with something truly unique. I can only guess that as the team continue improving, their films will grow into something special.While I would not call it a masterpiece by any means, I do consider it a cut above similar titles I've seen.",Hush

235,samwillpearce,A Masterclass in Tension that Defies Horror Expectations,8,14 August 2019,"""Hush"" is a refreshing take on the Horror/Thriller genre because of its simplicity and ability to remain scary and engaging despite its lack of reliance on classic horror tropes.Appearing on basically every list of ""Hidden Netflix Gems You HAVE to See"", it's easy to understand why this film was such a sleeper hit: it's an indie horror film with a lower budget, a small cast, and a small scale. Yet all of these elements work to ""Hush""'s advantage; it's one of the most realistic-feeling horror movies in years because of it's confined setting and straight-forward plot. A deaf woman who lives alone in the woods is stalked by a masked killer. Simple and sweet. Taking a leaf from the books of both survival movies and slasher films, the tension in the film is incredibly tangible, as the viewer feels like he or she is in the midst of the movie alongside the protagonist, Maddie, scrambling to find a solution to the terrifying predicament.Like ""A Quiet Place"", one of the triumphs of the movie is the controlled use of both silence and sound. Since the protagonist is deaf, some of the most compelling and terrifying moments come when the viewer is put in Maddie's perspective, as she struggles her way through the fight with her attacker in dead silence. Despite a score that continues through much of the movie, there are many moments where the events play out without any sound at all; perhaps most notably the scene in the bathroom, where the killer breaks through Maddie's window just behind her without a noise to be heard. More so than many other survival-genre films, the viewer is really put in the protagonist's shoes, because of how well the usage of sound and lighting captures her experience.Possibly the highlight of the movie, however, is its constant aversion to the horror movie tropes that a moviegoer might expect from this film. Although there are a few jump scares, they are not overused in the slightest; in fact there are a number of moments where the director could have opted for a cheap jump scare and very intentionally didn't, which only adds to the fright. Another pleasant surprise was the unmasking of the killer very early on into the movie: as it turns out, it's not somebody she knows, it's not her ex-husband coming for revenge or whatever, it's just a random psychotic killer intent on tormenting her, with motives unknown. This not only contrasts the classic slasher formula of unmasking the killer near the end of the film, but it makes it that much scarier too, as the villain's true identity and motives are never revealed. And, possibly most importantly, the protagonist is not a COMPLETE IDIOT; although she makes a few (excusable) mistakes throughout the movie, Maddie is actually a pretty formidable opponent for her attacker, and doesn't fall for every trick in the horror movie book.Though not revolutionary by any means, ""Hush"" is still a super solid slasher flick, that is unpredictable, tense, and all-around enjoyable. A 100% worthwhile watch for anyone in the mood for a short and nail-biting thriller.",Hush

I was surprised to see that the motivation wasn't a crime of passion, considering how many times he stabbed Sarah.However, I thought that the killer and Maddie were pretty evenly matched. The vast majority of my complaints were yelling about how a crossbow is a shitty weapon and what I would have done better (like definitely not leaving my knife and hammer behind and get him while he was reloading).

Watch it with a big group of people.It takes a very simple plot and makes it into a very well-thought out horror movie. The opening scenes effectively establish Maddie's story to allow the audience to get to know and care for the character.Once the masked killer arrives, it begins as your typical cat-and-mouse game seen in every home invasion movie. The main character being deaf does allow a fresh spin on this game though. And without giving much away, the movie slowly begins to evolve into a very tense, fun ride. Not to mention the superb acting from Kate Siegel, given the fact that she was only able to use sign language and other resources as a form of communication.

This movie had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.The wonderful acting from main actress Kate Siegel and the well-done cinematography, among other things, make for a suspenseful, nerve-wracking thriller. It's exactly what I was looking for.Don't expect world's most complicated, well-thought-out plot - that's not the point of this movie. Random, senseless murder happens. Things don't always need a reason. Don't try to look for a meaning behind these events. There is none, and it doesn't matter.All the negative reviews are referring to plot holes, but I was never bothered by any. Don't think about the plot too much, and this movie becomes very thrilling. It's a (terrifying) treat from start to finish.

It's just a suspenseful movie that does everything very well.For this movie to hit a higher tier for me, I would've needed to see more of a motive behind the antagonist of the film. Throughout the movie, the bad guy is seen as just a guy that wants to kill apparently. On the other hand, I can repeat that the point of this film was to just get two solid hours of entertainment.

This movie deserves at least a 7 average to be fair. It was truly a scary movie, however it was more suspense throughout than horror. The suspense was maintained constantly until the end of the movie, and the ending was really fantastic, job well done. It didn't become too silly or ridiculous like some people are saying, it was actually very reasonable and believable, not the type where you yell at the TV throughout; ""you stupid person!"" The only downside was that the movie was too dark at times to see anything, so at some points it was difficult to discern what was going on, but other than that it was wonderful!

255,noorutin,An OK thriller with some interesting aspects.,7,21 July 2016,"Let us start with the fact that this is not a horror movie. It's a thriller, with some interesting unusual aspects, as well as a few cringe-worthy flaws (in character logic, as the case always seems to be).So what makes this movie stand out and feel almost fresh? The obvious first is that our protagonist is deaf-mute. Not being an expert on deaf people, I still believe this was played quite consistently to the movie's credit. It is interesting to occupy the head space of someone missing such an important sense in a frightful situation.Another thing I noticed is the total lack of jump scares. There isn't a single jump-scare in the movie, which only further distances Hush from being a horror movie. In fact the usual creep factor as a whole is kept to a minimum. It quickly becomes a cat-and-mouse kind of battle of wits more than anything else, which I found a pleasant surprise, despite being more of a horror fanatic.The third curious thing is that from the get go it's made clear that the killer is very much human. We don't know what his motivations are, he's just out to kill and doesn't give much of a s*** about anything else but his upper hand. He doesn't have much of a plan and has to improvise, as does our protagonist to survive.I found the thrill in this movie to be more intellectual than primal. The gore is neither profuse nor lacking, it's there when it's needed. It's well shot, acted, directed and edited, considering the modest budget, and doesn't overstay its welcome. I'd recommend it for a rainy evening if you want to see the thriller genre try something new.",Hush

This is a case of a movie with no pace, no real characters (there's absolutely no motivation for the villain's actions and he does look/act somewhat ridiculous) and, most importantly, no real story. The story is immensely boring and predictable, and successfully manages to not scare you at all, or even surprise you. I'm appalled at some reviews that dare to compare this mediocrity to superb arthouse films like It Follows.

263,valimorg,Not sure how this is getting good reviews,3,27 February 2017,"I won't say the movie is awful as it did keep my attention here and there, but in the end, nothing in this movie makes sense. AS noted this review contains spoilers so don't read past this.In the beginning you see two friends hanging out. One obviously def, as they are talking in sign language. After awhile the one friend leaves, leaving the def friend by herself. The girl cleans up her kitchen, and while this happens you see her cellphone ringing obviously she can't hear it, and then you see the other friend run up to the door screaming for help, as the assailant (a masked man) runs up behind her stabbing her multiple times until he knows for sure she is dead. The def girl not noticing starts working on her laptop.Flash forward a few moments and the guy is in her house, taking pictures of her with her friends phone and sending it to her laptop for her to see. Then goes back outside the house. Where she is then able to lock him out. Where he then reveals his face after a few attempts of trying to break back in. He cuts the power and then the games begin.The movie goes on for like another hour of them playing cat and mouse, and it gets old quick.Throughout, you see her make multiple attempts to escape but each time he stops her. The first attempt or two she just has to run back in before he gets her.Then eventually she decides to try and escape through a 2nd story window, she gets almost all the way down before she realizes he is running at her, so she climbs back up, but on the way he shoots her in the thigh with his crossbow.The next scene plays out like she has to worry about bleeding out so she dresses the wound and ties her shirt around her leg to stop the bleeding and sits there trying to think of what to do. Makes sense, except for the fact, you jump a few scenes ahead, and the guy trying to kill her, has had his wrist gouged with a hammer and taken a shot from his crossbow to his chest and was cut with a knife (i can't remember exactly where). So you'd think he'd be bleeding out just as fast if not faster.Eventually, a neighbor comes buy, and the killer tries to act like a cop. Not sure how the neighbor thinks this in the first place as the guy is not wearing a uniform, but eventually he catches on, but the girl ruins his shot at taking him out, because apparently her writing on the window wasn't enough to convince him in the first place.Finally in the end she decides to fight back, and is able to kill him, but not just before she almost dies, calls 911 and it's over.The movie seems like a good idea on paper, but it felt like they were doing everything they could to make it last longer.",Hush

Everything was absolutely terrible starting from the cast, dynamics of the movie, the plot...just awful. The main character lakes any kind of judgment, logics, elementary reasoning. The villain on the other hand seems to have some sort of supernatural powers as he seems to be unaffected by any of the serious wounds that strike him during the movie. It was cliched, with elements of Halloween and Scream, but much more poorly done.

It starts off with potential and actually there were a few cool, new ideas thrown in here or there which I thought were gonna take the movie to another level. But they were quick and never capitalized upon. The villain in the movie just wasnt really scary enough for me to actually be nervous or worried. One good thing about the movie however, was that it was pretty believable.I guess I've been spoiled by Halloween and Jason. It could be the fact that I prefer more supernatural elements to these kinds of horror flicks. If you are more interested in movies more based on reality, then this might be for you.",Hush

No rhyme or reason, not a deranged killer. WTF is the point. Gave special FX people something to do for a few weeks of shooting, I guess.

Now the director and his gorgeous wife collab on a great setting and story. However the antagonist is quite the pooper the moment he reveals himself, not great with his demeanor lacking menace. He could be a good actor now but this film could have used a wrecked looking fella.
Love the struggle bits of Katie trying to outsmart him although some parts seemed to aid her momentary escapes. The cool moments are there but the crucial ones could be excecuted or shot at different angles to enhance the trick up either sleeves of the two. It seemed okay, but big moments should have been created better. Good flick not bad at all.",Hush
272,SagentFives,Fives short review,5,18 September 2019,"Maddie Young is an author who lives alone in the woods writing her book. Far away from society, everything is peaceful until suddenly a masked psychotic killer appears. Maddie has to fight for her survival, the only problem here, she is deaf and mute!
The scenario of the movie is clever and interesting, because a deaf person has to be double as careful in this situation. In the first third the movie creates a scary atmosphere and the viewer recognizes the problem of her not beeing able to hear anything. But after the first 25 minutes, this scary atmosphere is gone and that's the big problem of the movie! At the beginning, the killer plays with her mind and the problem that she is deaf, but then he simply stops and acts so that it just is not scary anymore. This also creates problems for Maddie as a character, because in many moments the fact that she is deaf doesn't really matter. But it should because that is the movies main point! Although the film later makes a few good approaches, it doesn't help that much. So there is only one scene in the second half that was surprising for me. The cast, the location and the sound design is ok. Unfortunately, despite the good start, this film is only average. It's not good but not bad either, I only expected much more.
I CAN'T RECOMMEND you to watch it if you expect to see a great horror movie, because you will be disappointed. On the other hand it's not a time waste! You can definitely watch it, because the movie is okay especially more as a thriller than a horror movie. Just don't expect so much!Have a nice day!",Hush

""okay, let's give this one a try, it's short, and I will probably end up liking it"". I was right, but I couldn't believe how good this was! First, the movie starts as the average home invasion film, but with all the twists and turns gives this genre a new fresh view, with the main character being deaf and mute. The question that was going through my mind through the whole movie is how her disability made her situation 10 times harder. If you can't speak or hear, and if you're at a life or death situation in a place where you can't even be heard or seen, you're probably a goner, but Hush dares the viewers to root and see how a seemingly harmless lead quickly evolves to an amazing heroine. Kudos to Kate Siegel for playing such a strong lead without saying a single word, I even believed she was deaf-mute in real life. John Gallager Jr. does a great job as the killer, he accomplishes to be, well... hated by the viewer. The movie doesn't let you breathe (literally!), kicking off strong and staying like that until the very end. It might not be super believable or realistic, but the truth is that ""Hush"" is a roller-coaster that will stop your heart and make you scream at your TV, that you won't even mind.

276,jcpierre96,Not enough horror movies talk about physical handicap in a serious way.,7,13 September 2017,"Unfortunately, many horror movies show physical handicap as a ""light"" subject. It is sometimes just used for cheap one-liners. But ""Hush"" takes a different approach, for the better. Here, physical handicap (i.e., the loss of hearing) is tackled with maturity, in a humane way. ""Late Phases"" did that also, but not as seriously as ""Hush"".Even though the main character suffers from a handicap, she manages to show great survival skills, and an incredible will to survive against an unnamed assailant. Consequently, the movie builds an amazing suspense throughout.This kind of movie is above-average in the horror/thriller genre. This a powerful, dark and creative work of art, that will keep you on your toes right until the end. It's not perfect -especially with regards to the choice of music, or the fact that the mask of the killer may not be shown enough-, but in the end, it's still thoroughly enjoyable.",Hush
277,romessanadeem,"Interesting Plot, Questionable Execution",3,19 May 2016,"The reason I really wanted to watch this film was the plot of it. Deaf mute woman is threatened, pursued and attacked by a crazy guy in an isolated cabin (my personal favorite in the house-invasion genre.) I had high hopes for the film and Flanagan's execution of it. I didn't much like Oculus but I was sure the plot alone would suffice and compensate for any shortcomings this movie may possess. I was wrong.Hush begins with an introduction to the protagonist, Maddie, a deaf mute writer. We are immediately assaulted with a barrage of evidence that Maddie is in a ""complicated relationship"" with some dude named Craig. We then come to know that her friend worries about her due to her isolated existence (the reasons for which are never truly explained.) While Maddie writes her novel, a man breaks into her house, steals her phone and stands around for long enough to hear half the conversation she has with said concerned friend on Facetime. He then walks out as if he owns the damn place. The panic begins soon after in the form of initial menacing images of Maddie in her lounge sent to her laptop by her stolen phone. Terror ensues. My main problem with this movie is just that; the man waltzes into her house, walks around, steals her phone and listens to her conversation with her friend? Like, damn, I know she's deaf but IS HE ALSO INVISIBLE? There are several scenes like that where the world is falling apart around our protagonist without her taking even the slightest bit of notice. One could argue that since she lost her ability to hear at the age of 13 instead of it being a birth defect, the fact that she doesn't notice a man standing literally 10 feet behind her is justifiable. But even so, for the sake of the movie, there is an immense number of cool things they could have done with her sensory defect. They could have used it to her advantage, shown how she gets the upper hand on the killer because of this problem or is just generally more aware with her other senses (vision, touch, olfactory even) and uses this to her advantage, the one thing the killer never sees coming. Instead the hearing loss is used to make her seem downright stupid in some scenes. Take a page from Al Pacino from Scent of a Woman, why don't you?The characters and the things they did made me yell. ""Pick up that knife!"" ""Don't go outside!"" ""Turn the power back on somehow!"" ""Pick up that DAMN KNIFE!"" There were a good many situations in which Maddie could have stabbed her killer. I counted at least 2. Furthermore, in the beginning of the movie, she tells the intruder that her boyfriend is coming. But that's never really the case in home invasion films, is it? (Jennifer Hills, anyone?) How interesting would it be if instead of relying on things the audience has seen a billion times before, the boyfriend actually did show up and affected the plot somehow? Despite this, it kept me watching and even though I was annoyed, I was eager to see how it would all turn out in the end. The finale is intense and gory. For a second, the audience really doesn't know which direction the ending might go. The issue I have with Hush is that it relies heavily on slasher film clichés. Single female, masked madman, best friend's murder, no phone/power, general stupidity of its characters, a lot of hiding and running. The one original thing the filmmakers had to offer, they forgot to utilize it to it's fullest extent. Hell, I even forgot she's deaf in some scenes! It seems more like a random fact than anything which may affect the plot of the film. Much like Oculus, the film had an interesting premise but the filmmakers had no idea what to do with it. It could have went so many ways but instead it chose to become a poorly executed mess of a slasher film lacking depth, substance or originality.",Hush

Everyone mentioned how brilliant and different and Hitchcockian it was.

There is no story, no characters, and the suspense is useless because you know exactly what is going to happen next.

I decided to watch this film after a night of my friends hyping it up, but this was probably more disappointing than my dad telling me he doesn't love me for the first time.This movie had so much potential, but feel flat in all aspects. While the main character(who I have named ""Mute"" at this point) is in fact a mute, she still manages to outsmart this killer at every point possible. At first, when the killer shows his face and begins taunting his victim, there was some level of shock. However, this factor is quickly drained come to release that he has no way of actually getting into the house. So what does he do? He decides to circle it about 7 times, meanwhile Mute is constantly peering through windows as if he is going to change where he goes somehow. This is the most putrid killer I've ever seen, at one point even handing Mute his crossbow and losing it. Other things aside, the movie towards the end shows one of the biggest challenges Mute has to overcome- pulling back the crossbow to load another shot. And this was the BEST scene in the whole thing, in terms of comedy. The over- dramatized music with fact that victory is so closed to being achieved should be a good set up for an intense scene, but I was laughing the whole time.

With a premise like this movies, I couldn't help but expect better, especially considering he directed Oculus and Oujia origins of evil. But in the end, multiple problems I had with this movie brought it to a 5.First off, from a movie making perspective it was good. The movie looked good from cinematography, color palette, and effects standpoint. Also, the movie sounded good. The use of sound (or lack thereof) made the movie better, along with the good score.Also, the acting is great. The main character is a fine protagonist, and the villain has enough mystery around him to keep me interested. Also, most of the first act was great, with the dialogue, scenes, tension building and more.However, the second and third act heavily fall apart. For one, the characters are extremely stupid. Throughout the film I was close to yelling at the screen just because I was so annoyed by the idiotic characters making what seemed to be the stupidest decisions out there. This ruined a lot of the tension for me, as I stopped caring about the main character, just because I was so annoyed by she was acting and started to stop caring for her as a character and whether she lived or died. Also, the main. Antagonist also could have easily killed the protagonist many times but didn't. Also, some of the scenes felt unnecessary; not good considering how short the movie was
.there was a scene on the bathroom that was very much obviously filler. It felt cheap and made me wish to be watching a more interesting movie. Also, the ending isn't great. Some of the spacial logic got completely thrown out the window in the end This all, and the fact that movie got so stupid to where we started seeing a copy of the main character tell the main. Character what to do really bogged the movie down for me. Overall, the 2nd and third act are not good and could have been so much better.If I had to say whether you should watch the movie, sure.

285,aarminaj,Just One Word... AMAZING,7,4 May 2016,"First off let me start by saying I am in no way associated with this movie in any regards, so you can trust my review on this one. I recently saw this and i just have one word for it amazing. Loved it till the end credits came up , which by the way are pretty good the score i believe coming from Newton Brothers. But lets talk about the movie; Simply put its a home invasion movie but it has twist in the way of the main protagonist who is deaf and cant speak ( brilliantly acted by Kate Siegel, who also happens to be one of the co writers of this little gem along with Mike Flanagan the director) A mention also for John Gallagher Jr. who I thought portrayed the bad guy really well. The movie holds you till the very end, as its a continuous fight for survival, a fight for life and a will to live in-spite of the odds our main character suffers during her teen days, which as viewer we come to know once the movie is in its early part. Full credit to the writers and the editing team, as not even a single minute goes by without a strong screenplay.There are hardly any other characters in this movie, but they do their little bit too. Overall I would say if you are into the Home invasion kind of thriller/horrors like 'You Are Next' you will love this one. Highly Recommended, Enjoy...",Hush
286,vhoundfvr,"Tense, unpredictable, and satisfying",9,7 July 2016,"'Hush' provides the viewer with a consistent stream of tension and suspense, as well as a surprising number of ideas and plot twists given the movie's relatively simple premise. What you'll also get out of this movie is a likable and resourceful protagonist and a sadistic and calculating villain. I will say that there are moments where the plot drags a bit, and that the ending requires a little suspension of disbelief, but it's still a satisfying movie that will have you holding your breath, and wondering what will happen next. I will defiantly check out Mr. Flanagan's other works in the future. My verdict is four out of five.",Hush
287,komradekontroll,Had Potential...Had,3,22 October 2016,"Maybe it says something about me, that I was able to figure out that she was deaf before the movie told me (over and over again). While that might seem insignificant at first, it sets the stage for an overly predictable movie to come.Not even coming in at 90 minutes long, Hush (2016) still manages to move at a crawl, while offering little to chew on.I guess I'll start with the good things. The acting is actually decent from our lead, Kate Siegel. Everyone else falls flat. This is less their fault, and more the fault of poor direction, and bad writing. The sound design is also good, but it doesn't make a movie good...The acting from everyone else is a flat line. Our killer in question, John Gallagher Jr., could have been given more to work with, but instead he's just a killer. At times it seems he wants to be more ""psychotic"" but isn't given the chance.The other actors, what few there are, are a flat line as well, with our other two actresses serving as exposition dumps (albeit, very little exposition).The gimmick, and yes that's what it is, could have been done well in the hands of a good director. The movie wants us to believe that she can feel vibrations to sense things around her (one of the many things the movie sets up in the ""first act"" before our killer shows up), but we're supposed to believe that it only works some of the time? I guess she has selective feeling.Additionally, it seems that her sense of sight is useless as well, since her peripheral vision never catches anything. Same goes for the killer at times. It's like everyone can only see directly in front of them.As for the logic of the movie, I'm willing to give the killer a pass for not just breaking in before. He's clearly crazy to some degree, though the way he acts never truly translates just how crazy he is... Where the logic in the movie fails is how our characters deal with the situation. Maddie (Kate Siegel) makes SEVERAL errors throughout the entire movie, yet we're suppose to believe she can fight off an insane man. The killer also makes several mistakes as well. After being attacked the first time by Maddie, he should have just finished the job. After all, he's just some killer, with no connection to her whatsoever. He's killed plenty before, so why take the punches with this one? He actually acts as if he's trying to get inside at times. His motivation is simply random.Maddie on the other hand could be written off as her being in a ""panicked state"". However, much like the killer being a crazy person, this is a cop out used by bad writers. Especially when you consider that she had plenty of time to think and assess the situation. Instead she keeps putting herself in situations where there is suppose to be suspense, but since you already know what's coming, there is none.The best part of the movie is how both characters had plenty of opportunity to kill each other, but just don't do it whatsoever. The part that stuck out the most is when John (Michael Trucco), is using what life he has left, to strangle and hold down the killer. This offers plenty of opportunity for Maddie to finish the killer, but she doesn't do so.In the end, Maddie leaves us with a smile, either because her cat decided to be dependent for once, or because she didn't care for her neighbors that much. Hmm, maybe that's the twist ending I was waiting for...Maddie planned it all along as a way to rid herself of her neighbors, legally!Actually that might be more interesting than this movie. Anyways, avoid if you're looking for a home invasion movie with any kind of originality.",Hush

There is a basic structure to build a great thriller - a deaf single woman lives in the woods and a killer just arrives uninvited. Fantastic! However, there are just too many holes and unexplained sequences in the plot. You will either shout in frustration or to say ""awesome"" because you ain't got a clue.A plus point first - there are sequences that make you sit on edge because something bad is about to happen and it is not going to be nice. Whilst this is not unique, you certainly can't rely on a few scary sequences to make a good film.The bad points are many - you don't know why the assault should to take place, why the assailant takes so long to 'finish' the job. ... and there are more whys.

There are lots of bad ones but they're has been some good ones in recent years (You're Next was a great home-invasion film with a twist). Now this film is INCREDIBLE. It has superb acting (especially from Kate Siegel, she really blew me away, it shows you don't need dialogue to be a great actor), it has interesting sound design, it's greatly filmed and it was so suspenseful. I can't remember a last time where a horror film has kept me on the edge of my seat. Now many people are comparing this film to You're Next and The Strangers. Now while The Strangers and this film are technically more 'scary' than You're Next, I would say this movie is as great as them. A thing that really surprised me was how I was NEVER bored. It kept my attention all the way through, I really cared about the character and I was surprised on how they didn't hold back on the violence which is always a plus. There was a scene (which I won't spoil) that was so hard-to- watch that I covered my mouth. This movie could've defiantly be released in theaters and it's one you should watch with an audience or a group of friends. Make sure you turn up the volume and watch it on a dark scary night.

Was just long enough so you get to know the characters and what relation they have, and was not too long to where you are becoming eager for it to end. The violence was quite strong throughout, but not in an overwhelming or out of place kind of way..

If she had grabbed a knife and hidden under the stairs and waited for him to walk by, she could have at least cut his achilles tendon and run.And if you're handicapped and live alone in the woods, you'd better have some way of contacting police, or protecting yourself. Then, she gets her friend's husband killed. Urgh. That was really maddening. What is the whole moral of the story? Call your ex back when you get that urge and invite him over? If she had done that, none of this would have happened? What was the story with him anyway? There wasn't enough background to the plot. What was the motive of the killer?

A lot of things in the script didn't make sense at all and overall there wasn't a real story actually.A deaf woman lives in a house in the woods. A random guy passes by and stabs her friend. Then he's just walking around until the neighbour comes. He stabs him too and continues walking around. Then he finally enters the house, she stabs him, the end.The woman is acting completely dumb but good for her: The Killer is equally dumb.
Same goes to the writers of this movie. As there are close to zero dialogues they should fill these 90 minutes otherwise but I think they kind of forgot. So, fór 90 minutes we're watching this dude walking around and her climbing out of the window and back into the house, like five times.I was forcing myself to watch this movie until the end to see what all this is about. Why is he there? Is there a connection between them? Obviously one is expecting some twist in the end but there just isn't.

307,punkharpy,A spectacular example for modern horror,8,7 May 2020,"So, to keep it brief, bush does suffer from regular horror movie problems, with a few moments being a little over the top, and some scenes bordering on silly. It's completely dark for a lot of the movie, and sometimes I feel like it's distracting from the scene, but otherwise the cinematography was fine. Other than that, the antagonist has some questionable acting, but it's not to big of a deal. Lastly, the competence of the characters is questionable from time to time, but it's like that with a lot of horror movies.Mike Flanagan is an extremely competent director and I think it reflects in the quality of each scene. Kate Siegel did great, and I felt extremely immersed in this movie. They managed to keep what should've been a repetitive confrontation extremely fresh throughout the whole movie. Story was good. Having the lead act deaf and mute made for an incredible story. Etc.All in all, it has its flaws, but for a modern horror movie (2010+) its crafted pretty well, and it's extremely engaging.

However, this doesn't save it from the typical Genre clichés and bad writing. Needless to say some of the most obvious movie flaws ever made. Here is one example:We see Maddie trying to load a crossbow several times during the movie, but she is just too weak and we see her fail multiple times. But then - all of a sudden - the crossbow is loaded and she is able to shoot it. And of course she hits the killer from a fair distant. And no, she is no crossbow expert and from what the movie is telling us, Maddie has never shot a weapon in her whole life before. Come on, this is just lazy writing!All in all, this movie is just your typical, hide-and-seek, cabin- in-the-woods, serial-killer movie with the exception that our heroine is deaf and can't speak.It is not worth it.

Also, we never know anything about the characters or their motivations. They're just on screen doing things that lead to gore and violence... And then the movie is over.... It's a lazy form of story telling to invent characters that have no reason behind their clear motives... I mean, the killer is NEVER explained in any way...

So you got the comely lady in distress, somewhere in the forest, a red riding hood in her own right, terrorized by the big bad wolf, in this case, a far from intimidating baldie with a penchant for medieval weapons. Other than that our villain has zero depth, no background, no motives, just a dude who enjoys killing. 
Of course in this genre, you expect the seemingly fragile heroine to somehow prevail against all odds, depending solely on her own resources. It would have been an average film, had it not been for our cute protagonist been such an unlikable character. Even her disability does not make you feel any compassion for her, as she allows her neighbor and apparently good friend to get murdered at the very beginning of the film, and becomes the reason the former's boyfriend gets murdered as well, seconds before delivering the decisive blow that would mean her salvation. She watches the poor struggle while wounded to save both of them, without intervening even while odds are on their side. However, when the life of her equally unlikable pet is in danger, she will knowingly sacrifice her only chance at getting a good shot at the villain. Maddie is not only stupid but also a heartless cat lady, which disregards human life and has a disturbing fixation to the fluffy feline. Maddie, we hate you. Towards the end of the film, I disliked Maddie so much that I was actually wishing for a deviation from the formulaic version of the story and see her tortured and maimed by the villain.

The whole fight between the victim and the intruder contains absolutely every stupid predictable cliche you would expect from Hollywood: the victim trying to run multiple times in the dumbest, most dangerous way possible, only to get hurt/caught, she taking multiple shots at the enemy but (of course) always failing short to actually hurt/kill him... Then the good Samaritan neighbor who ALMOST manages to save her but - of course- she distracts him in the worst possible moment causing him only to get killed so she is again on her own.... and then the final fight dragged out where each one of them gets hurt like 100 times yet no one dies until she almost - with her last heartbeat - manages somehow to knock him dead?!

There are some truly terrifying parts where even as a grown man I wanted to just close my eyes and not even look, because at some point, I needed to go to bed and didn't think I'd be able to after watching this movie.My recommendation would be one of two things, either watch it all by yourself in the dark or with a group of people who won't talk during the movie. I really feel like it would take you out of the experience to have side chatter during a thrilling game of cat and mouse as this is. Very well done.

It hides its flaws well, and aims for a certain elegance with somewhat minimalist approach that worked so well in It Follows and many others.Where it fails is in presenting something new, anything really. It has some predictable scenes, a start, a middle and an end and that's it. If you've seen a few movies like that, there is absolutely no reason to watch this. Once or twice you get the feeling they'll play a bit more with the main character being deaf or her ability to imagine different scenarios, but they never go anywhere with that.The killer is not scary in any way so any fun one might have depends on the clever ways they try to outsmart each other and any unexpected twists the movie throws your way, of which there are none.",Hush
334,brian-mcintire,OK Thriller if you have low expectations,4,2 January 2019,"This movie is not horrible, but it is very predictable and the victim does one stupid thing after another after another.She turns her back on the villain multiple times including secluding herself in a bathroom with her back to a window.When she finally makes choices it's always too late. I can see how extraordinary fear can paralyze a person. In the hands of a great actress, her slow decision making and even some of her bad decision making could be passed off as a byproduct of being completely terrified. I really do think Kate is a good actress but the writing and direction was average at best, and as much as I like Kate she is not capable of rescuing a subpar movie purely with acting chops.Kate and her husband wrote this part for her. I know she thought she could deliver but I walked away feeling like I had just seen another movie portraying women as stupid. She could have written a much smarter character for herself or simply paid a more talented actress to elevate the script. Some changes in direction could have also made Kate look less stupid and led to the whole film being more believable.Frankly, the villain was meant to be believed to be completely unhinged but other than his psychopatic tendencies there was no real vibe from him that could help you understand why any of this is happening. I know. I know. Sometimes it's better when we have to wonder ourselves. Easier to accept if the actor is believable.Also annoying, is there are multiple scenes where we are expected to believe she has no peripheral vision at all. I've always thought the absence of 1 sense heightens others. Not in her case.As short as this movie is it seems to drag out far more than it should. I'm not saying don't watch it, but go into it with the understanding that it is an average movie, at best.",Hush

The acting is also good, with believable characters. The main character is strong and no shrinking violet, which is good to see. I didn't find it predictable. It makes you wonder what you would do in the same situation. I liked that the main character is a writer with a big imagination, and you're not sure where the story will go.

It would have been great to have an ending where a police officer shows up to the house and finds four bodies with two of them lying next to each other and trying to figure out what the hell happened.

337,razdcj,Did the director/writer even try to do a TWO SECOND GOOGLE SEARCH before sinking millions of dollars into this movie?,1,30 September 2017,"Alright, words can not describe my disappointment that this movie is well-received. It really goes to show that people don't bother to do even 2 seconds of googling on topics like deafness, not even if they're writing and directing an entire freaking movie sinking millions of dollars in the budget! First of all, lip-reading is not magic. I had to turn off the movie after the scene where the crazed killer speaks at a normal pace to the woman 15 feet away, through a glass door in the dark!I was already aggravated when the bloody woman ran up to the sliding door 5 feet away from the oblivious deaf woman at the counter. Deaf people learn how to sense their surroundings without the ability to hear -- They are able to sense vibrations through touch because sound is not only perceivable through hearing. They make tactile vibrations that you, yourself would be able to feel if you were deaf. Therefore, not only would this woman have noticed the flash of movement in her peripheral vision, she would have most likely felt the vibrations from the sliding door. When you bang on a sliding door it makes a resonating, almost sonic boom. This writer could have easily done a 2 second google search to learn that deaf people do regularly attend concerts and are able to enjoy either listening to the beats with the little hearing they have left, or sense it tactically if they are stone deaf (which is exceedingly rare). However, I would have been able to look past the sliding door scene because it is difficult to figure that one out, but the lip-reading scene was so blatantly ignorant that I just couldn't give them any more slack. If you're going to write an entire fricking script, direct and sink millions of dollars into a movie then why not at least take the time to educate yourself so that you can make your movie PLAUSIBLE therefore immerse even the most knowledgeable person?I write stories myself, and I always make sure to research every single topic extensively so it really disappoints me immensely when people don't care enough about their own careers to do the same.

338,jambofuzz,Home Alone for adults,6,23 September 2018,"Hush has a great concept but the filmmakers did not take advantage of it. We did not have enough time in the perspective of the protagonist which unfortunately made her deafness seem more like a gimmick when, if used effectively, it could have been used to make us feel her vulnerability. The delivery of information to the audience is done quite creatively which managed to keep my attention for the whole 80 minute runtime.
There are a few eye-roll moments and a couple of times when she forgets to be deaf but it is matched by the quantity of tense scenes, some of which are repetitive; others that are genuinely scary. 
The movie lacks in tension for a significant portion, however, because although the antagonist is supposed to have the upper hand over our hero, he seems to be on the back foot when faced with her Kevin McCallister-esque fighting style.Overall, Hush is entertaining, slightly flawed, and in some points, quite scary.

At a critical point in the film she manages to get to her laptop and write a goodbye note to her Mom and using the phrase ""I died fighting"". Later on there is a scene where the killer is on on top of her and choking her on the floor. Everything goes silent EXCEPT for the sound of her pounding heartbeat getting slower and slower until...there is no sound at all and she closes her eyes. This is the point at which she DIES in the film. Everything after that is just a fantasy of her overtaking and killing the killer.

Luckily I was pleasantly surprised as you never can judge by ratings on Netflix I find. This was an unexpected gem. Expect a quintessential horror film basically! The only thing I could possibly pick at the film about was why would a deaf woman live in the middle of a woods and leave all her blinds up for any possible predator to look in at her? Other than that it was perfectly practical. I love watching a horror film where when you put yourself in the characters shoes you would make the same decisions as they do in the film it becomes much more engaging. Best kind of 'cabin in the woods' style film since 'Beyond the Woods' which I saw at a film festival not all that long ago. If you love this film you'll love 'Beyond the Woods!'

351,truebugman11,almost perfect,8,27 May 2016,"oh, this movie came so--SO--close to being something really, really special. as it was, hush (2016) was pretty darn good, and were it not for a poorly conceived fifteen minute stretch preceding the finale, it might have been a classic.this spare and intelligently put together slasher movie pits maddie, a deaf writer struggling to end her current novel, against a killer with no motive and an eternally built in element of surprise. maddie is a great character, plucky and resourceful, who never gives up despite what must be paralyzing fear, being so vulnerable. kate siegal plays her wonderfully; she also co-wrote the script! extra cool. the killer is way more menacing behind his mask, which he sheds much too quickly. and then he talks way too much. nonetheless, he and maddie engage in a very entertaining game of cat-and-mouse.everything is humming, just moving along with entertaining crackle, great dialogue, lovely camera (filmed in good ole alabama), and a great synth score from the newton brothers, until the movie runs off the road for a piece. suddenly, all the characters make a series of rash decisions that defy credulity, and which snapped me out of hush's stark hold for a stretch. to their credit, director mike flanagan and scripter siegal wrestle the car out of its' ditch and deliver an exciting--and satisfying--conclusion.one of my hopes was that the filmmakers would be clever about how they used sound, and they did not let me down. at times, we are drowned in suffocating silence, which reminds us how desperate maddie's situation is: literally, he could crash through a window or even a wall, and she would be none the wiser. she's mute which smartly removes a classic horror movie trope--screaming female victim. it restores some of her power lost by not hearing anything, depriving him of the pleasure of hearing her suffer. and then the volume gets turned up here and there, reinforcing to us how much maddie is missing: if only she could hear that, this would be all over! hush is a smart and feisty movie that presents us with a uniquely powerful final girl. the movie is filmed gorgeously, and definitely shows us what flanagan might do with a new halloween flick (which obviously had some influence on this one). i hope siegal remains with him as writing partner. there are far too few women in horror, and a writer who is also a talented actor would be a valuable talent in our genre. a siege movie, home invasion, cabin in the woods, slasher, hush is a great little flick, gently affecting, and perfect at 80 some-odd-minutes.",Hush
352,bpkazar-366-30661,Horror Genre Fan's First Review,3,5 June 2017,"Okay, so first off, I'm not only surprised at all the positive feedback this movie has gotten (including from Stephen King), but I'm also being rather generous with my rating. This is mainly because the beginning of the killer's terrorizing had parts that were pretty scary. However, after that, it all goes downhill. Personally, I am a fan of slasher movies. I think the concept of isolation and self-defense are interesting and entertaining, if not educational (lol). Having said this, I realize that there is a lot of work within this sub-genre that is also rather sub-par, but can still manage to entertain me personally. ""Hush"" doesn't even fall into that category for me. It did have potential based on the killer's initial behavior, but after that, it just turned into a combination of a movie that just kept dragging on, a Lifetime movie (trust me, I used to watch them a lot), and a movie where I no longer rooted for the protagonist because of her ability to repeatedly make very stupid decisions. At one point, the movie got so ridiculous (and predictable) that I was actually embarrassed that I picked this movie to watch with my boyfriend who is less of a fan of horror and who I thought might enjoy the movie. As users have said, there are better home invasion movies out there. I have yet to check a lot of them out, but this movie is hardly comparable to ""The Strangers"" or ""Don't Breathe"" (which is actually about a blind man whose home is invaded). I recommend those movies or a further exploration into the genre instead of this Lifetime-esque, overly drawn out and predictable movie.",Hush

Yes, the protagonist (Kate Siegel) was deaf and was not portrayed as a feeble horror movie girl. And to be honest, the fact that the lead character was brave and fought back the intruder kind of saved the movie from being a disappointment.Still, The film keeps you entertained until the end. You will enjoy watching Kate outsmarting her opponent. John Gallagher Jr. is definitely a detestable psycho killer. And the overall concept of 'being brave in the face of danger' is appealing.For me, the film was a blend of mediocre direction combined with the inability of the creators to fully integrate protagonist's deafness with her courage.

I wasn't expecting much at first, but what I saw blew me away.I'm a huge horror movie fan, but this film surpasses the genre. It contains one of those rare, psychological feels that gets under your skin, leaves you at the edge of your seat, and keeps you tense. There was never a dull moment in this movie. Every scene had something unnerving to offer.The film opens to a seemingly peaceful, comforting environment in the countryside. Deaf writer Maddie Young lives by herself in a small house with her cat, her Macbook, and a voice in her mind. All goes well until a stalker in a creepy white mask invades not only her home, but her life. The premise of this film I found to be very unique; a vulnerable deaf woman having to survive a psychopath who's armed with plenty of weaponry. It's almost as if you're Maddie herself, trying to find a solution with limited sources. What I really liked about this film is that it goes back and forth to her ""deaf"" point of view, which is how the audience can relate to her situation. Hush (2016) is overall one of the most TERRIFYING and SUSPENSEFUL movies I've seen in a long, long time. It's innovative and clever as well. In other words, it doesn't resort to cheap scares and too much gore. It tells a story with very limited dialogue. Great acting, setting, and a pulse-quickening tension.",Hush
361,sktergirl939,My favorite horror/thriller movie!,10,15 December 2017,"I didn't expect to love Hush as much as I do, but this movie is phenomenal. 
Firstly, the main character is disabled, deaf/mute combo which makes it impossible for her to call for help or hear the killer coming. She is a realistic human being with debilitating weaknesses but an inner strength that you don't often see in movies- she's a writer, so she can think things through. She looks at every possible ending for her story and picks her best options, thinks every move through and manages to be incredibly smart and resourceful throughout. 
The editing and direction is astonishingly good as well- the sound editing is like no other film, and each cut and shot was composed perfectly, which is a SERIOUSLY lacking part of the horror genre.
You feel for this character and believe her struggle in every second of this movie, and there wasn't a single scare that wasn't earned.
I've seen this movie eight times, and I could watch it so many more. It's a wonderful film with heart-pounding action, believable characters and a grounded situation. You're right there with the protagonist, reflecting on what her best move is going forward. Absolutely incredible.",Hush

Really?!,2,24 September 2016,"The film is so bad that I cannot believe the good reviews.Not sure if someone already pointed it out but if you lose your hearing at 13 years there is no way you cannot speak. Your language acquisition finished more or less at seven years old. That's why if you learn a new language after that you cannot get the accent or the fluency as with your mother tongue.So, she has had 6 years of full language (English, I presume) before the meningitis made her deaf. She is a writer as an adult, so she supposedly might have a pretty good command of English.Even if you cannot hear because of the meningitis, your brain wouldn't have been affected, neither would your mouth,tongue, larynx, etc.Being deaf should be enough, not sure why they did have to make her (unbelievably) mute.

By the time I was 15 minutes into the movie I was pleasantly ""creeped"" out and was engaged to the end. Yes there were the odd moments when I had to ""suspend belief"" a bit but this is, after all, a thriller. And in response to the reviewer who gave this movie 1 out of 10, I question if this person even watched it. If you don't know how to load a crossbow (or do not even know it has to be cocked first) I would think it could indeed be difficult. In the movie it showed the guy that was after her using the ground three times to cock it before loading the dart.

I was initially attracted to the terrifying realism of the trailer. The way the stalker sends the photo through to her Mac so she knows she's being watched - that is the behaviour of a psycho-stalker in 2016. That modern element was enough for me to know this film is going to be good. If you're looking for a genuinely good horror film with good acting and suspense I strongly suggest you watch this. Think about how many utterly awful horror films are out there - rest assured this isn't one of them.I can't really fault the film to be honest.

If you love home invasion thrillers, you'll probably enjoy it but I felt like there were no surprises or twists to make it stand out from the many other films in this sub-genre. I was actually unpleasantly surprised because synopsis made me think that the main character would have a dark secret that would be revealed when she took sadistic revenge on the intruder. This was not the case. Despite a couple of moments of doubt, you never really doubt that the main character is going to fight her way to freedom and it doesn't really add to or change anything about that basic formula of an ordinary woman having to learn to fight back against her attacker so she can survive, covered in blood but triumphant.

If that is indeed what happened, then that whole scene was just plain dumb. This film actually reminds me a little of Straw Dogs. Same general plot. I liked how she used her other senses to her advantage, which I imagined were heightened as a direct result of her being deaf. One more thing that has me confused (SPOILER) is that her friend at the beginning mentioned to her that she was 13 when she got sick. I can only assume that this ailment is what led to her becoming deaf. If that's the case, couldn't she speak if she wanted too? Oh well. Maybe I'm being too analytical; or just plain anal. Lol.

You will hate the stupid deaf woman more than the brain dead stalker. My family was all rooting for him in the end. This woman should be blind because she is already deaf and dumb.We thought it must be a good twist on a usually brain dead movie genre. But this was ten times worse than any I have ever seen. It is almost the worse movie I have ever seen.Forget the teenage reviewers on here. Watch this movie to see how truly bad it really is.,Hush

Instead of taking action, the killer just walk around the house, round and round,.......The killer stabbed the deaf women's friend so many times, with lots of action and vibration, but none of the acts bring to her attention?Her boyfriend showed up without even a car headlight shining on her window? Then he believed in the killer's lie of himself being a police office, despite no squad car outside.The killer was stabbed by her despite the fact that he is facing the girl and the girl can not see him.In summary, some of the scenes are very nicely shot, but the overall movie is a catastrophe because it does not flow naturally.",Hush

Sorry for being too late, but I come here just to say this. I watched this movie because of its praise (6.6 on IMDB is a good score), but after the movie ended I was like What?. It's one of the worst slasher films I've ever watched. The characters make dumb choices, I mean really really dumb. I kinda hated the way the protagonist acts. She chooses the perfect time to bang on the door just to get the big guy killed. Then she stands there watching the neighbor struggling to strangle the killer. She can feel her phone vibrating from far away, but can't feel someone knocking on the door out loud just right behind her. Very stupid movie. I'd rate it on the same scale of stupidity of A Quiet Place. Speaking of A Quiet Place, that movie also involves making use of the hearing/sound concept.

376,El_Ninooo,Stupid movie full of plotholes,1,18 November 2020,"**Spoilers**
I can't imagine why anyone would think this movie was any good. It's ridiculous with a story full of plot holes, in fact it has so many that you'll be left wondering where do you even begin.
The protagonist, Maddie, is deaf and mute and lives in the middle of nowhere. It's very unrealistic given anyone in that situation would know how dangerous it would be to be on their own in that kind of environment. Despite this she doesn't lock her doors, giving the killer a chance to sneak in and steal her phone. She also doesn't keep a gun, again highly unrealistic and absurd when you consider people buy guns in America like they're buying toys.
She doesn't keep a back up phone and her house is full of glass doors and windows making it ridiculously easy for anyone to break in.
The killer seems to be some sort of superhuman, his hand is impaled with a hammer, he gets shot with a crossbow bolt but none of that seems to have any effect on him. When John, Maddie's neighbour, shows up to her house searching for his girlfriend and see's the writing on the glass door he proceeds to act normally despite the fact his girlfriend is missing and there's something very suspicious about the writing on the door. When the psychopath confronts John pretending to be a cop, he easily believes him even when it's obvious that the guy pretending to be the cop looked very sketchy.
Then there's the scene towards the end where Maddie locks herself in a room ready to stab the killer and he sneaks in behind her through the window, again the scenes absolutely moronic. She has her back towards him and then like a scene straight out of a B grade Matrix movie she turns and stabs him just before he could stab her.
This movie is utterly stupid, save yourself the trouble and watch something better.",Hush

The girl -a writer fyi- starts off as a resourceful and clever survivor that outsmarts the intruder in more than one occassion, but then she wastes many good opportunities to do in the killer once and for all. The killer's a random dude that shows up at the girl's house determined to kill her just for the kick of it. If he's so clearly a psycho, why waste time on learning how to use a crossbow when you're at your own house? Grab a knife and stab the guy. They're face to face many times. The chase is part of the movie, I get it. But she'a a writer. She's supposedly creative. And she's deaf and mute and lives out in the woods.

If you're looking for something to watch on a date or with a significant other that will get you talking, this fits well. It's not overly scary. And home invasion movies are probably my most dreaded sub genre as The Strangers had me checking my doors for weeks. The premise is pretty silly as I just don't believe any woman would move to the woods and not think about the security aspect of living alone. I don't know any single woman who lives alone (including myself) that doesn't keep at least a baseball bat next to her bed. Let alone an apparently well off writer who could definitely afford an actual security system. The bad guy wasn't particularly scary save for the fact he's trying to kill her. His motivation isn't exactly apparent except he seems to be a hunter of some kind suffering from little man syndrome. That big neighbor guy would have 100% been able to take him out easily, but that would not have made for an interesting ending. All in all, it wasn't terrible.

Normally, I LOATHE scary movies. But when this movie started showing up on my news feed on Facebook. It piped my curiosity because this movie have created a lot of heated discussion and frustration among the Deaf Community. They did not like how you guys hired the Hearing person as a Deaf character and there were misarticulation with several signs and so on. So I watched the Hush to see it for myself.I am impressed with how the story flows and there were defining moment in movie. I enjoyed it very much. I really liked how it was set up and how it ends. But why a man killed Sarah then decided to play game with a Deaf woman? Was he simply bored? Was he a serial killer? There has to be more to story about him because what was he doing in wood in first place. I know he has killed others but WHY he was there? I would really like to see more of his story.Now on to a Deaf lady. She became Deaf at age of 12 or something so that is understandable. But that doesn't matter to Deaf community because they will always bash on you guys until you find a Deaf actor to their fitting. You will have to understand from their perspective. But me? I think its because you have not be exposed to our culture. Everybody learns. And plus, it was only a small budget film that isn't showed in theaters. How could you be able to hire somebody that is Deaf when you don't even know where to start or find one? There were quite bit of exaggeration on being Deaf. Like reading the lips through window? Hell no, I will be too scared to even understand the killer no matter how good I am at lip reading. Feeling the air that killer spoke at end? HAHA, I think that it is going too far because we aren't superhuman. Like feeling vibration of man's footsteps is pretty good but okay... We all have to come up a way with what makes story good no matter how exaggerated it is because that's a movie. You did that. Good work on bringing movie to Netflix. Just keep in mind, you will not be able to please everybody but be open-minded to other people's opinion especially us, the Deaf Community.",Hush

397,Underwood2016,Hush,9,23 April 2016,"Hush surprised me in that nearly every horror movie cliché was absent. While viewing this movie you will find that there were very few, if any, jump scares. However, that does not stop you from being on the edge of your seat for the entire runtime.Hush puts a great twist on the home invasion thriller. As you are in the IMDb review section you may already know the plot, but here is a brief review anyway: the film centers around a deaf writer (Kate Siegel) who lives in seclusion in order to focus on writing her new mystery novel. When a serial killer (John Gallagher Jr.) shows up at her house and traps her inside, she must find a way to thwart this mysterious masked individual. The decision of the writers to make the protagonist deaf was a very good one. It makes for some good scenes where you want to shake her and say ""LOOK BEHIND YOU!!!"" One thing that stood out to me in this film was the direction. The attention to detail regarding little sounds made in the background was very prevalent. If you know horror movies, than you know that creates a more jumpy environment. I wasn't the biggest fan of Mike Flanagan's earlier work, Oculus. I found the ending to be dark just for the sake of being dark, as opposed to an ending that fit the rest of the movie. However, that's not to say the direction wasn't great. Hush not only puts that direction to good use, it has a satisfying ending.Another thing that stood out to me was the acting of the two main players. Kate Siegel is definitely someone to look out for in the future. She is great at playing a deaf person, and also great at showing emotion without speaking. Her acting gets you to cheer for the character, which makes you rejoice every time she gets ahead of the villain in any way. However, the real standout in this movie is John Gallagher Jr. as the serial killer. He was great in 10 Cloverfield Lane, but he is even better in this, and that is saying something. From the beginning to the end, he really messes with your head and at times he even tricks you so badly that you start yelling in anger. But believe me, that is a great thing.The only complaint I have with this movie is that there is a dream sequence near the end that kind of ticked me off. Dream sequences have been proved not to work, (I'm looking at you Batman v Superman) and they do not in this one either. But besides that minor flaw, Hush transcends most other movies in ts genre, and leaves you looking out the window in fear. I give this movie a 9/10PS Watch this movie in the dark if you want the full experience.",Hush

The film loses its ability to scare you as the killer reveals himself too early, and when he does his face lessens what was already a non threatening mask.

411,youza1,"Amazing premise, terrible execution:",1,2 June 2016,"After watching the trailers for this film I was excited to see it with my sister, who is new to the horror genre, expecting to give her and perhaps myself a fright, however, I was in for a different kind of shock. The premise here is incredible, a deaf writer alone in her house in the woods and a masked serial killer, unfortunately, the director hasn't taken advantage of this at all. The first ten minutes of the film and perhaps even the scene in which the protagonist's friend is stabbed to death are fine, but afterwards the film pretty much falls apart. In a horror film where a mysterious masked serial killer is the antagonist, you do NOT unmask the killer 5 minutes after he has been revealed ... I'm not sure what possessed the director to make this decision, but said serial killer also has a completely unimposing and unintimidating look and feel about him, to such an extent that I honestly believe the protagonist could have defeated him in a fist fight. The killer should have kept his mask on throughout the film, I thought this was obvious, but apparently not ... As well as this, I do highly question the mental capacity of both the protagonist and her friend's boyfriend who appears later in the film, realises who the killer is, and doesn't act. Although horror films do require some unrealistic decisions to be made, the extent to which the protagonist fails to do anything to aid herself in this film is appalling. Aside from that, I do have a list of improvements, some quite radical, which I believe would have made this a much better film: All camera shots are filmed from inside the house to create a claustrophobic atmosphere. The film is fully silent apart from a few sounds such as the protagonist's heartbeat in tense moments, the sound of the antagonist's crossbow firing and hitting targets, and the voices in the protagonist's head, but only at one point. Near the end when the writer is sat down thinking through all possibilities, she imagines another version of herself in her mind talking her through everything, I think this scene should have been done differently, no visual representation but just a voice, a whispering voice. As the protagonist panics more and more, additional voices join in to her thinking and overlap to create a typhoon of inaudible hysteria. The antagonist shouldn't be formally introduced until much later in the film, say ... 30 minutes in. Before this point the protagonist should continue going about her normal routines, but the killer should appear in the background, discreetly in the corner of the camera shot so that the audience notices him but the protagonist does not. A tragic ending, in which the writer is brutally murdered, this is perhaps the most radical reform I've proposed, but to me, a happy ending is not befitting of a horror movie, at the end the killer should find the writer and kill her slowly, perhaps in a similar way to the way her friend was killed, but only one stabbing motion which penetrates deep into her abdomen. That would really crush our souls, and as a horror movie ... it would fulfill its purpose.",Hush

At no point did it feel like it dragged on and it kept me guessing although the ending is as one would predict, it was fun and unpredictable getting there. Both victim and assailant were more competent than most films have shown and I really liked the character development.

418,hawj,CREEPY...very well made film,8,10 April 2016,"The only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is that I HATE horror movies especially when it involves brutal killing, but I ""watched"" it with my husband (who's a sucker for them). I only watched the first maybe 15 minutes (when it was less tense), then I couldn't watch it anymore. Instead, I just listened. What I noticed was that there was less sound than most horror/thriller movies. Usually, music/sound takes over tense scenes and the music kinda tells you what's going to happen next, but not this one, which made it even more tense because you really have no idea what's gonna happen. Most of the time, I only remember hearing heavy breathing, footsteps, organic sounds produced by objects...etc...not much music/post sound effects (that I could remember). That played to the fact that the main character is deaf, which helped you care for her. It felt like YOU were in her shoes and you literally were terrified. My husband (who's a big fan of these movies) really enjoyed it. It was well made and the cast couldn't have been better. I'm still paranoid by it!",Hush

420,brennan-27448,you can still avoid making this mistake,1,27 July 2018,"I hope you haven't watched this movie yet. I was like you once ""hey this looks pretty good, ive been looking for another good thriller to watch on Netflix, and woah the IMDb ratings not bad either, why not?""... I'll tell you why not.
 I saw this movie a week ago, and for a week this movie has haunted my dreams. How are there so many good reviews for this film? I feel like I'm loosing my grip on reality. It just makes no sense. 
Pretty early on in the movie I found myself rooting for the antagonist (who had absolutely no back story nor motivation whatsoever) simply because if you are not even going to arm yourself or get some semblance of a plan together then apparently you didn't care to be alive that much in the first place. Early on she had the knife hammer combo going on and it worked for her, then she ditches weaponry all together. some how she manages to get the crossbow from this friggin murderous boy scout and wastes her time trying to load it for like 20 minutes where she just stops caring about keeping an eye on the guy. All this could have been overlooked because I was pretty baked, but why in God's name would you not finish the dude off when he was being held in the dying chokehold of maybe the most gullible man in the world? He used his last dying breaths to try and strangle this man, has him completely immobilized and she just sits inside watching like a helpless dumb dumb. I mean stab that dude, help out just a little. I'm not mad I'm just disappointed get it together guys.",Hush

422,starkrayz,Definitely overrated,3,4 May 2017,"I only watched this due to the almost-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score and expected something utterly great. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Nothing new was offered in this movie that hasn't been already done a multitude of times before, aside from the main gimmick of the protagonist being deaf. But that's all it is, a gimmick. This element hardly factored into the story at all. Had this been a true POV story with no sound at all, it could've been intriguing. But this might as well have been a hearing-abled person. The writers ultimately couldn't find any interesting ways to incorporate this disability into the storyline. But there were many other problems with the film as well: no real motive for the killer (yes even serial killers have an agenda); clichés like cutting the power just as she is trying to call for help; and most maddening of all, no explanation as to why the killer didn't just break into the house sooner. This movie could've ended 30 minutes earlier! Sure it was shot/edited/scored/art directed just fine, but story-wise, there are far better and more original options out there.",Hush

He is one who lets his victim dictate the pace throughout the proceedings including how she decides to leave and re-enter her home.Speaking of the house, it's apparently impenetrable unless the victim unlocks a door or window. Okay.Others have noted how stupid the neighbor is to believe the weird guy hanging outside this cabin is a police officer since he has no car, no gun, and no means of communication with the outside world. Okay.I'll finish with some of the clichés this movie has:There is the customary nice, best friend who must die to let you know this is a terrible guy.In the end confrontation, there is a weapon just at fingertips that will be reached just in time to stab the bad guy.There is a visual review of all the people who died in the making of this movie.The cavalry arrives in the distance just as the music swells.",Hush

All the creepy jumpscares that are shown in the trailer never actually happened. I have to admit, the camerawork is pretty damn good. The acting seems realistic but it just gets boring after half an hour. The murderer already takes his mask of after one minute of stalking Madie. After that it's just one hour of screams, cries for help and stupid attempts of escaping the killer... Only watch if you want to be disappointed.",Hush
426,janisdoc,"Texas Chainsaw 4 was better, and that's saying something",2,18 October 2018,"I usually don't write reviews, but after viewing this I felt I had to, and gosh.. what an awful film. Okay, there are much worse films that butcher it's own continuity, this one does an okay job at that as this is the original. Hush follows a deaf writer, Maddie, who went deaf with special illnesses that cause her to be deaf and also be unable to speak when she was 13. The film starts with her trying to cook from a recipe she found online when she gets a message from her friend wanting to come over, and so she does. 
They talk for a bit...with sign language when a special fire alarm goes off in Maddie's kitchen, they go inside to clean up and turn it off. 
Not long after this Maddie's friend goes home, but not long after to return, running, screaming, and pounding on Maddie's door, hoping she'll see and let her in. That's when an arrow shoots into her back and I figure comes walking up, grabbing hold of her and stabbing her over and over again in the stomach and carrying her off. 
Maddies gets a message from ""Craig"" who I only assume to be an ex boyfriend because why else would a girl be ignoring someone like a twat. After many attempts she actually considers talking to him but the second she calls she retreats. Shortly after this she gets a call from one of her friends, she sets her phone on the table while the killer just lets himself in and swipes her phone. 
Soon Maddie ends the call and goes to look for the cat that lives near her house, shaking the food bowl as she walks to signal the cat, when she gets back however she finds messages sent from her phone, of pictures the killer has taken of her. Instantly and surprisingly she tries to contact the police using her computer, but not before the killer walks outside and cuts off her power. Maddie locks out the killer and writes on the glass door using lipstick that her boyfriend is coming home..and what does the killer do? ...He takes off his mask. That's what he does, he takes off his mask. He reveals his FACE to his victim who if somehow gets out of this alive can now report what he looks like to the police. 
During the rest of the duration of the movie they shuffle around, the killer kills one more guy, Maddie steals one of his weapons, and kills him at the end of the film while he is choking her to death, literally at the last second of life. The good: The killer gets a few good shots in, shooting Maddie once with an arrow and crushing her fingers with the door. The bad: The killer falls for just about every trick in the book. At one point Maddie while she's outside throws like this flashy ball across the woods, and he goes to see what it is while she climbs to another part of the house. Also, the killer could have gotten inside the house at any point in this movie. There's one scene where Maddie stabs his arm with the claw side of the hammer which he could have used to smash the window, and if not for that he could have thrown a rock through the glass door or even use one of his weapons, only at the very end of the movie does he actually do this and during the entire movie I was cringing for him to do this. Finally, he keeps his mask off for the entirety of this film. That isn't too bad of a sin, but masked killers should stay masked killers. We only see him masked for a small fraction of the film.",Hush
427,Luca-Villasenor,Theory,8,4 February 2019,"The main thing I enjoyed about this movie was it wasn't as predictable as other horror movies. Movies today are very predictable which does not ruin the movie but it makes it less enjoyable. The movie it self was unlike other horror movies i have watched in the past. This movie was confusing in a way because you had no idea what his motives were and who he was to her. I took it into my own hands to make a theory of who he was. At sorta the beginning of the movie Maddie was talking to Max and she brought up that she started online dating for the deaf Which made me wonder if she was trying online dating when she was out in the city and it dint go good. I was thinking that maybe ""The Man"" was a relationship that ended badly. I know it was not craig because it clearly showed his profile picture. and showed the difference of the two men. (I thought there were various clues throughout the movie) Also another reason i thought of this was because when John shows up and ""The Man"" acts like a Sheriff, he clearly does not know everything about her, Which would indicate that he did not know her long.I noticed some things while watching it that i thought were a little unpolished1. How she did not feel the vibrations when Sarah pounded on the door2. (Same scene) Peripheral vision is a thing, right?3. Near the end of the movie she is in the bathroom sitting waiting for ""The Man"" and he comes down from somewhere. I'm just not understanding what. At first i thought it was a chimney but i don't know.
I rated this 8 out of 10 because i really liked how it didn't focus to much on who he was and more on the suspense of how it will be played out. I also really enjoyed that it was not as predictable as other movies. And lastly i felt the need to rewatch it to see if there was anything i didn't see last time to figure out who he was, Even if he was just supposed to be a random person (Maybe) ;)",Hush

I thought it was quite a cool premise and I was intrigued to see what it brought to the table.The main character, Maddie is a compelling character and does not conform to deaf person stereotypes in movies she feels like a fully fleshed out character who is smart and is very resourceful. John Gallagher Jr. plays the perfect killer even though his mask is plastered all over the advertisements he takes it off in the first 10 minutes he is introduced and for the rest of the movie plays a psychopathic killer to a tee.The flaws are not to obvious the only thing that is unrealistic is some of Maddie's decisions, they either pay off or don't.Hush was a tense, fun horror movie and I would gladly watch again and I look forward to Mike Flanagans Doctor Sleep.",Hush

436,clarkstarla,modern take on the home invasion thriller,7,23 May 2020,"The film ""Hush"" focuses on 'Maddie' a deaf-mute writer who has retreated from city life and now lives secluded in the woods where she is being stalked by a psychotic killer who stumbles upon her home.There are aspects of this film that can be compared to ""The Strangers"" franchise, which is to be expected because that film is also a modern invasion film. ""Hush"" also shares similarities to ""Wait Until Dark"" which is about a blind woman who has intruders in her home. This film takes a more interesting route on the classic cat-and-mouse game making this film an intense watch and there are really no cliches in this film that are expected in other home invasion films. The film is more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie since it is not necessarily scary in my personal opinion. There are a few jumpscares throughout the film, but you can tell when they are coming. The entire plot is also affected entirely by strategy more than anything which makes you wonder what is going to happen as the film goes on. It really tries to make you think just like the character is forced to to get out of the situation that she is in.I really like that they did not use big name actors for this film because when well known actors are in a scary movie, it immediately takes away any sense of realness that comes from the film. One thing that I did not enjoy about this casting was Kate Siegel (Maddie) because she is not an actual deaf actor. Deaf actors would like jobs too. I feel like this is the equivalent to when we white wash characters that are traditionally played by a person of color. I also feel like if they had used an actual deaf actress then there would've been less misrepresentations of the deaf community in the film because they most likely would've been corrected.The female lead in this film is an excellent character because she is not like other women that have been in movies like this in the past. All of her actions are smart and extremely well thought out and I did not find myself being angry with anything that she does. All of the characters seem to be like this in the film because they are not completely oblivious to what is happening around them. I am not the biggest fan of the villain in this film because he seems to really be more cowardly for hunting a woman who has disabilities. It makes him less scary in that aspect because of that.The film has great cinematography and sound design. The shots in this film and some of the blocking in scenes are done extremely well and really triggers that paranoia that we all have when we are home alone. The film only has about 15 minutes of dialogue total, but the way that the energy is in the film you can really feel how 'Maddie"" is feeling without dialogue.There are some holes in the plot that create several questions throughout the film and will leave you wondering and wanting more and I wish that we would have gotten some of the answers to those questions, but I feel like the film is better leaving those questions unanswered. There are also things brought up along the way that are unneeded because they never go any further than that one moment that they are brought up.Overall, this film is great for people who would like to watch a scary film but do not like the traditional horror movie. This is not a film that I would personally sit down and watch on my own on repeat, but it is one of the better home invasion films that I have seen. The only way to watch this film is at home in the dark cuddled up with a blanket alone if you can handle it.",Hush
437,dab-99374,Terrible idiotic mess of movie,10,13 September 2020,"This is without doubt one of the dumbest films I have ever seen. Why did I give it a ten star rating? Because the default is to read the highest reviews first. The character, far from being an intelligent, independent woman is a complete moron and the usual themes of Flanagan's whipped feminism are on display. Like in Gerald's Game the woman must rescue herself. Another man around is only more of the same problem, toxic I know what's best for you masculinity yada yada. Thus, we see the possible hero die as he is punished for the sins of the ubiquitous misogyny in all the world. Man, all men, in short, are slain by Flanagan's neurotic ideology. Outside, while the main character babbles to herself she lets the killer finish off her sure shot of survival. SO DUMB. There are a million times in this movie where you jump not from fright but from watching the atrociously stupid decisions of the main character, one that rational women find to be an insult to them all. Just ask my wife who asked repeatedly that we turn of the movie out of her disgust. We resisted the urge to turn it off time and time again culminating with the roof and wound cleaning idiocy. Only the moronic masses of low-wattage bulbs who think of themselves as bright can say this movie is good, that, or they are paid off in some way. DO NOT watch this film. Want a strong, smart woman? Watch Alien. Watch Dr. Arroway in Contact. There are good feminist type films but this is not one of them.",Hush

The ""Home-Invasion"" genre is very rarely done right and although Hush plays with some unique concepts and ways to build suspense, it overall doesn't keep the viewer on edge for the full hour and a half runtime.This however doesn't discredit the actors as there was solid performances from all of them.

The villain and the victims had so many missed opportunities in their aims of kill or be killed that their actions just became unbelievable. This took away any suspense that other reviews have mentioned and left me waiting for the credits to roll. If you are looking for a decent house invasion horror then avoid this one.

There is very little dialogue seeing as how the protagonist (Kate Siegel) is deaf. But what she lacks in words she makes up for in action as you stay in suspense the entire time you watch this movie. Not to mention the sadistic mindset of the antagonist (Jihn Gallagher Jr.) causing you to feel unbelievable angst. Unlike other ""cat and mouse"" movies, this one is intensely realistic and has all bases covered as far as keeping you in suspense and not letting you have any ""oh give me a break"" kind of thoughts.

Luckily the movie is short and has a treat to reward you for your time in the moments before the final confrontation between the protagonist and killer.Even with the short run time this movie suffered from it's length, stumbling around to find the next thing to throw into the conflict to connect the beginning and ending. It would have been much better with only 40-50 minutes cutting down on some of the boring cat and mouse scenes which would allow them to write the characters as clever or at least not stupid. Removing the unnecessary additions to the story that play no role except to extend the play time would greatly enhance it as well.If you have an hour and a half to kill and want to be entertained for at least half of that time, then this movie is a good choice if you're a fan of thrillers.",Hush

I really liked the concept of our protagonist being deaf and having that as a character ark really elevated the movie. I also liked that the horror movie clinches such as jump scares where few to non existent. However. I thought the movie got quite repetitive after the 40 minute mark. I think it would have been loads better if the killer waited a bit longer to expose himself. The sequences when he walked around the house and she having no idea he was there was chilling! And they could have built on that longer. Like the scene where he guts our heroines' best friend loudly up against the glass door and she not hearing it. I found myself screaming at the TV trying to help! It was really well executed. If they would have focused more on that and let the killer toy with her some more instead of the last hour being confrontation and her trying to escape just to find herself crawling back into the house again i think that would have made for a more entertaining and intense film.

This could have been great, if done properly. There is a scene at the outset with Maddie cooking, and it removes all the sound at point, putting us in her shoes as a deaf person. Pretty cool. Unfortunately, that is the best moment in the entire movie.Normally, when someone describes a movie as ""dark"", I assume they're referring to controversial subject matter. In this movie, being ""dark"" is quite literal, with large swaths of footage impossible to see.Some people get stabbed, beaten, etc., but it's hard to figure out who died because the movie was apparently shot in the photo development lab of a Walgreens.Acting is pretty sub par here, and the killer has all the dangerous charisma of a head of iceberg lettuce.

This makes me believe that the deaf/dumb victim is just plain ""dumb"". Some fun scenes here and there, but no real scares.

Her boyfriend believed some guy with no badge and no uniform with a neck tattoo was a cop? Give me a break!

However, it is presented with a refreshing twist that enables new situations of heart-pounding intensity to be demonstrated. The high level of suspense found in this movie is primarily achieved through to Flanagan's clever direction, and use of silence as a crucial horror element. Kate Siegel's fantastic performance also helps set the tense atmosphere, as her character's hearing disability pushes her to think outside the box and find clever ways to fend off the psychotic killer in her home. The good aspects in this movie greatly overshadow the negative, which there are only a few of. John Gallagher Jr.'s performance as the antagonist is only passable, as a more compelling villain could have brought an interesting layer to the movie's rather simplistic story. However, the movie is well aware that it's a simple, tense slasher film, and doesn't go out of its way to become anything more. This allows for more time to be spent on developing the intensity of the situations presented in the film. Overall, Hush is a solid film that any suspense/horror fan must see. Though it does have its few and minor flaws, the films direction and premise quickly overshadow them, as the viewer is drawn in for a familiar experience, that at the same time feels new and refreshing.",Hush

It's 'Censored'.Not because of the premise. The premise is decent. Missing one of our five senses is something we rarely think about and certainly would prefer not to. So the main chick is deaf. She's also a little 'censored'. Both of those are handicaps in their own right (though 'censored' is only a handicap if you're not hot enough to pull it off.... and she isn't, so... whatever). Typical trope: psycho, knife/crossbow (it doesn't matter so long as it's something that kills brutally) and an isolated maiden. More so because she can't hear. Blah, blah, blah – who gives a 'censored'? The bad guy is marginally intimidating for all of three minutes, then shows his face and runs his mouth and loses all intimation factor. ""Can you read my lips?""; maybe, if they weren't hanging open like a 'censored' flytrap and glistening with drool because you're a functional 'censored' who looks like he worships Eminem and sagged his pants at his uppity private school. Seriously, the clerk at my local 7-11 would beat this 'censored' 'censored' to death with his own femur. To the actor; you have a 'censored' face. You look like a 'censored'. I'm a 'censored' and upon seeing your face, instantly knew I would be able to 'censored' you up.Frankly, it kills the movie. And I know he's a 'censored' because no director in their right mind, even the 'censored' dumbest, would cast him as a bad guy. Which someone did, therein indicating he 'censored the meanest 'censored' this side of the Atlantic. Kid must do full 'cradle' – 'censored' and 'censored'. There's no other way someone thought he would make a 'bad guy'... the 'censored' at Costco who you saw kicking a puppy, then darting off in his mom's Jetta blaring 'censored' rap... maybe, just maybe.I didn't even finish the movie from this point. Like, my shirt rode up a little high for my comfort while I was sitting there watching it and in the time it took me to tug it back down, I'd already arrived at ''censored'itville' for this flick.In summary; decent (the same way Trump is a 'decent' candidate for president) premise and horrible casting. Checking my balance at an ATM is more suspenseful than this 'censored' venture. To the director or writer, whatever: should have kept the mask on your boy. Bet he brushes with a Maxi-pad... 'censored' 'censored' face.Excuse the 'censored'; apparently IMDb believes in censorship, not honesty.",Hush
477,elmore_jasmine,It sucks.,1,2 May 2016,"This is gonna be a long one, so hang tight. Right off the bat this movie sucks. It's so awful. It's literally the concept of The Strangers with a deaf person plastered onto it to make it seem unique, and best part yet? They went out of their way to avoid actually hiring a deaf actress/adviser or research anything about what it's like to be in the deaf community (outside of sign language or ""vibrations""). I can write a freaking novel on all the issues that I have with this film, but I'll keep it short. And, let me point out, I've never gone out of my way to write a bad review for anything. 1) It lacks plot and depth, and the depth that is provided the writers couldn't even stick to. The whole ""unique"" idea to this girl is that she is deaf, yet capable of living on her own. It's pointed out in the beginning of the film that she can respond to vibrations, yet upon being right next to her friend screaming and banging on a door she doesn't react to those vibrations. HOWEVER, she does respond to vibrations created from tapping on a window. And, don't even get me started on the countless scenes wasted talking about her ex Craig, as if he was going to play a pivotal role in this film at all. 2) The countless upon countless times this broad could have been murdered. The killer's intent was to toy with her....yet all he did was one thing. The rest of it was him pacing for 80 minutes and then getting hurt. If this was in any way realistic she would have died at least twenty times, especially given the numerous idiotic ways she tried to escaped or especially the end. If she had AT LEAST died in the end I probably wouldn't even care. Oh, yeah you're already on the verge of bleeding out to death (the director clearly chose to point this out by her vision blurring and her appearing drowsy) but you got enough energy to stab a dude ONCE and then hobble off and then fight him again and then get choked out....but still survive? What, we gonna chop this up to adrenaline? Nah, and I'm only naming one real scene that had blatant evidence that this movie sucks, you'll encounter a lot more before you even get remotely close to this part.

This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, though it certainly isn't the best either. It is true, there is no grand deeper plot than what is directly laid in front of you- a man messing with the woman in the house with plans to murder her. However, I don't see a need for any more info than that. I find it more chilling that the two main characters have no connection to each other whatsoever. It is a basic film, and the acting leaves a little to be desired, however, it's not a totally un-watchable film. The plot was enough to understand the situation, there just wasn't much more too it than that. It is definitely worth it if you're just looking for a short thriller that you don't have to give too much attention to, but will probably be disappointing if you're looking for something that you can totally and completely submerge yourself into.",Hush

The actors and actresses were great. Bravo! I genuinely appreciated the fact that us watchers were able to experience life in her point of view. She did an amazing job of expressing her true emotions and feelings even though being what I would certainly call ""challenged"". Those challenges that she was faced with gave the story more meaning. You don't see movies, TV shows, or even books, that have such problematic details. This movie showed emotions in a less obvious way, a way that made me truly appreciate such a film. However there is a line to be drawn. The message was able to be found however it was simply too hard to be found. So for the dozens of people who don't tend to see the complex things that matter in life, or the moral, it made the film harder to understand or relate. As I watched the movie the other people tended to see not the moral, just what was there. So the greatest part of the movie was also its weakest link.

483,alyssastich,Such to pack a punch,8,4 October 2016,"In the movie ""Hush"" Maddie, (Kate Siegel) a deaf and mute writer finds herself fighting for her life when a man, (John Gallagher Jr.) stalks and threatens her from outside her house. The Man continuously taunts Maddie with the idea of coming inside to kill her. Though seemingly like your typical ""serial killer in the woods"" thriller, the movie ""Hush"" provides the viewer with powerful characters, phenomenal sounds, and twists that are such to pack a punch.Both the main actors, Kate Siegel and John Gallagher Jr. do a profound job of gaining the viewers attention through their strong emotional connection and quality of acting in general. Most commendably though,Kate Siegel did a phenomenal job of playing the role of the mute and deaf Maddie. Due to Maddie's life situation,Siegel has to rely solely on physical appearances to show emotions, rather than typical sound cues. Even though it seems far-fetched without the normal loud, gut wrenching, cries of complete and utter despair, when Siegel expresses pain, the viewer can't help but feel the pain as well. When expressing pain, the audience is drawn in through Seigel's wrenched shut eyes, trembling body, her position on the floor, and her mouth extensively open as if it was filled with loud screams. Siegel's fantastic quality of acting really does an amazing job of not only catching the viewer's attention, but also keeping it throughout the whole movie.The minimalist approach sound-wise that ""Hush"" takes really does a fantastic job of not only adding to the overall ""spookiness"" of the movie, but it also helps the viewer relate to the main character. There are many points throughout the movie when the sound cuts out, during these times the viewer is forcibly placed into Maddie's position, this temporary situation creates a bond between the viewer and the main character, which adds to the overall enjoyability of the movie. When the sound does come back on, it is mainly focused on small subtle things, the sound of the knife on a chopping board, crunching leaves, breathing, and creaky steps, these small sounds help add to the eeriness of the movie. During the final fight scene the quality of the sound effects seems to decline, *cue super dramatic fight song here*. Despite the overall minor hiccup at the end, the movie's sound effects were of high quality and really increased the viewers attention and emotional connection.""Hush"" is a thriller guaranteed to keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. ""Hush"" not only has extreme character-to-audience connections, but it also makes use of some not very common sound effects, engaging the viewer. So grab your friends, popcorn, and some blankets.""Hush"" will not disappoint.",Hush

It is impressive for the low budget, which almost earned it an extra star, and great acting, but otherwise everything else about it is trash.The use of silence is nonexistent and in a movie about a deaf person that seems like a horrible misstep. There was so much potential here to do something that hadn't been done before in the horror genera, but instead it followed the home terrorizing tropes at every step. The protagonist is constantly acting like a complete moron and misses every opportunity to defend herself until the best part of the movie, the final scene. I spent most of this movie face palming and admiring the fantastic acting, but as a horror movie it is a huge waste of time. With this movie getting rave reviews I had much higher expectations, but all it has done is make me loose faith in the sites I have always trusted to have reliable reviews.

I have watched countless movies but this one made me so mad that I had to write this review. First of all, the scenario is very unrealistic. Secondly, the girl in this movie is the dumbest, most useless piece of meat I've ever seen or known about. 1st: Yes she is deaf and she fails to notice her friend dying for 1-2 minutes banging on the door BUT she somehow managed to look at her for ringing for 2 seconds. AMAZING2nd: She somehow has X-RAY vision in turn that where ever she looks, he shows up automatically. 3rd: The dead girlfriend's boyfriend first tries to communicate with the girl by BANGING ON THE DOOR AND calling her name while knowing that she is dead. Yeah sure, this makes complete sense. 4th: The dead girlfriend's boyfriend shows up and manages to talk to a guy IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Who does the boyfriend think he is? A POLICE. He doesn't notice that he has a TATTOO on his neck *uncommon for police* and isn't even wearing a police uniform. The killer says he is the police and says that he is missing his gun and everything. So you expect me to believe that someone also made him naked and managed to find another uniform and dress him up? Yeah sure...5th: The girl manages to distract the dead girlfriend's boyfriend EXACTLY when the killer had a knife to his throat. Does she not have a brain? 6th: The girl has the chance to kill the killer (WITH THE PLETHORA OF KNIVES IN HER KITCHEN) when the dead girlfriend's boyfriend is choking him but nope, she wants to dream about her fairy tales and talk to her imaginary friends. 7th: THE GIRL IS LIVING ALONE IN America IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WITHOUT A GUN. Did I mention this was America and in the middle of nowhere? Does she want to die?8th: Is the killer immortal? He is stabbed in the hand AND gets a damn arrow in his chest yet he managed to run like Bolt, climb vines and kill a jock, the boyfriend. 9th: After the killer decides that he should go ahead and kill her, he traps her hand at the door. He can perfectly squash her finger up with his feet while she is attempting to close the door with her hand. He has the chance to open the door but no, he wants to have a staring contest with her. 10th: The ending: She turns avatar, she notices that he is right behind her and does some matrix-level moves. She puts a knife in his leg and he just turns from an immortal to a weak 5 year old girl. I guess third one's the charm.

With that aside I have to admit this film left me literally seething with rage. The protagonist is so incredibly inept as she has multiple chances where she could objectively escape or defeat the antagonist, yet she never does. Throughout the film she becomes more and more worn down but interspersed through random points she just gets massive adrenaline boosts for little to no reason and performs dexterous feats that normal non-injured human beings would never be able to accomplish. For a point in the movie she spends what feels like hours fumbling trying to load a crossbow, even though in this time she is supposed to be getting weaker all of a sudden, BOOM! The crossbow is loaded off-screen, no explanation, no point, just... BECAUSE. She consistently fails to use any of the tools she has at her disposal until the very end of the film, not because she gained access to them, not because she gained insight into the weaknesses of her enemy, but just because otherwise she would have gotten rid of him five minutes in. If you have a critical eye this movie is extremely frustrating to watch, it may be entertaining for some, but for me it was more upsetting than anything else.",Hush
498,southerner-38098,Possible story,7,25 March 2018,"My husband and I just finished watching this movie. While he would like that hour and a half of his life back, I thought it was a good thriller. The scene of him texting her with photos of her sitting in her own house was genius. I was wondering if anyone else thought that the plot of the movie might actually be Maddie envisioning this story as she sat at her computer with writer's block? That's how I concluded it; with it not actually occurring but was dreamt up by the writer, herself. Anyone else?",Hush
499,anniejones1,Silent horror with some flaws,7,18 July 2018,"I hesitated before watching this one because I don't like horror movies that are too scary, and that mask made me feel sick. Well, luckily the mask didn't stick around for long which I found a bit strange because it did make the man 100% scarier.This movie would have been so ordinary and basic if the main character had not been deaf. That added a new level of horror because she never knew where the man was unless she saw him. I found my heart beating so fast at times because somehow I could feel her panic through the screen. Maybe that was due to the fact that the actors were great or maybe the director just did a good job. Then to the flaws. At times the movie was very predictable and Maddie made some very strange decisions that annoyed the heck out of me. It's a horror movie so obviously it has to take place at night, which made every scene very dark. My screen was at full brightness and I still had trouble seeing what was going on. I also found it very weird that the viewer never gets to find out who 'The man' is and most importantly, why would he want to kill Maddie? I could maybe watch this one again. Not too scary but enough to leave you biting your nails at times. Probably too dull for someone who loves terrifying horror films. The actors were great and fit their roles perfectly. Not too much of those boring filler scenes. The best part of the movie was however the fact that the cat did not die, I could hug the writers for that.",Hush

And some actors that in the film suddenly showed without the introduction. I think the story it self kinda not creative, mostly only showing mrlurder things. I think that my review, thanks.",Hush

503,stellareagan,Does not have a good plot but has great cinematography components,4,15 October 2018,"Stella Reagan Mr. Taff Period 3 October 10th, 2018 The movie Hush was an unimpressive film, for it was a mediocre horror film and easily predictable. The movie, which was mostly uneventful, had the basic story line of a horror movie about an attacker and victim. Although the plot, characters and the theme were plain, all the cinematography elements in the movie were surprisingly exceptional. The production, by Jason Blum, was carefully crafted and well thought out. Jason had the right idea, but the movie, directed by Mike Flanagan, ended up turning out disappointing for the picture envisioned by him. Mike Flanagan and Kate Spiegel collaborated to write the script, which was mundane and lacking in structure. Maddie (Kate Spiegel) used sign language, as she was deaf, but her lines were short and simple. The aspects of production design and cinematography were the greatest part of the movie. James Kniest, the director of photography, chose the right angles for the cameras and recorded each scene in an excellent way. Differing camera angles helped move along the theme and develop the fear in the watchers. To add a different aspect of fear, Elizabeth Boller, production designer, controlled which special effects would be added. She made the right choices throughout the movie, whether it be set placement, special effects, or clothes, they fit into the film seamlessly. Joshua Adeniji, sound director, made the overall sound so realistic it was completely immersive and could make someone feel as if they were in the actual movie. If they listen carefully enough, every little sound is included in the audio. Editing work done by Mike Flanagan was acceptable. The sequencing of the different camera angles was not put together well, and there was not a feasible thought process in the style of editing Mike used. Setting, plot and theme of Hush was typical for most horror movies. Horror movies usually have a type of horror, like suspense, mystery, thrill, or cliché and Hush had all those themes, but cliché stood out the most. The Man (John Gallagher Jr.) showed up at Maddie's (Kate Spiegel) house and held a one-person vigil, where he stalks and terrorizes Maddie to a point of thinking about her death. The movie takes place at night at Maddie's house which is isolated it the woods with one neighbor nearby. The actions of the characters revert to older horror movies with obvious wrong decisions of the victim and the same anticipated actions of the attacker. And the film jostled around the idea of helpless damsel against a strong intruder, but in the end, the tables turn, Maddie overthrows The Man and makes out alive. Yet again, cliché, the main character gets out alive. The movie Hush was a cliché horror movie that can be describes as mediocre, predictable, and unimpressive. The main character escapes the threat and lives to tell the story, just like any other horror movie with those types of endings. Aside from the ordinary story line setting and themes, the cinematography of Hush was outstanding. Hush was not a desirable movie, for it was not original, but was a model movie based on cinematography and production skills.",Hush

505,united_forever,Terrifying,10,31 October 2018,"I found I was sat on the edge of my seat through the whole film. It is well written and well acted. I cannot imagine how terrifying it would be to be in that situation and also deaf.
Well worth a watch",Hush

507,mitpen,Interesting way to build suspense,8,1 February 2020,"This movie isn't full of jump scares. It's a very simple story told straight.
There's not much character building and absolutely no character building for the attacker but it doesn't really need that to tell the story it wants to tell.I applaud what this movie is doing; telling a stalker story from the perspective of a deaf/mute individual. And it does an excellent job at putting you in her mind frame.And that last 15 minutes is the very best part; the movie builds suspense and fulfills it.It's well worth streaming on Netflix or Hulu or amazon prime; etc.",Hush
