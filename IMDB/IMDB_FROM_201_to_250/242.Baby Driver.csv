0,MartinHafer,I respect this one and it is worth seeing...though I didn't exactly enjoy it.,7,17 August 2018,"""Baby Driver"" is an ultra-violent and nihilistic film...one where there really is no one to root for and which is NOT a film for the average viewer. I am warning you....think twice about this one before you decide to see it. The story is about a very strange young man--one unlike any other in the history of film. Based on his behaviors, he seems to be somewhere on the autism spectrum. While he appears pretty normal in some ways, he is ultra-bizarre. When he's out driving getaway cars, he is VERY odd in that he MUST have head phones on and music blaring and unless he has a rhythm, he cannot drive...or so he's come to believe. How he got involved in this sort of life, the film never really explains...though it's odd seeing a boy who looks like an ad for milk hanging with a group of psychotics who commit the most brazen and horrific robberies.And this brings me to the violence....as these folks are psychotics who don't mind killing folks. One in particular seems to LOVE killing people and with absolutely no regard for the consequences. And, the last 1/4 of the movie is pretty much nothing but fast-paced action and horrific violence. Despite the violence (which really turned me off), the film is pretty incredible in many ways. The way the music and action and dialog all work together was amazing....and how the writer/director Edgar Wright did all this is incredible and difficult. Also, the driving stunts are among the greatest you can find on the screen. Finally, I loved that they actually used an honest to goodness deaf person to play a deaf person...and had his friend/caretaker learn very proficient sign language that is much better than you normally see in a movie (I know because my daughter is deaf and we sign in our home). It was obvious Wright really wanted to get all the details right...perhaps obsessively so. Perhaps the obsessions of Baby were inspired by Wright's own obsessiveness?I think this is a film I'd say folks should see it once. You might not like it or you might be horrified by it....but try it unless you know that the violence will be too much...in which case, skip this one.",Baby Driver
1,bkoganbing,Lots of flash,4,18 December 2017,"Watching Baby Driver I can't help but wonder as Kevin Spacey's career is in crisis
mode is Baby Driver a film he might want to have as a swan song? He chews a 
bit of scenery, but it's in keeping with his character and so is everyone else in the
film.If you like car chases this is your film. If you like teen idols with a bit of pout this
is also your film. Ansel Elgort plays an early 20 something with two distinctions,
he's hard of hearing and he drives with the speed and skill of someone in the
Earnhardt clan.Elgort is in the title role and his nickname is Baby and relative to the rest of the
crews he works on robberies as a getaway driver he is a baby.. Spacey also 
considers him a good luck charm and there most definitely is something going
on with the two of them that he can't do without him. He says himself this 
Reifenschneider planner character that he always gets a different crew for each
job other than Elgort who is a constant.Back when I was at the Crime Victims Board I had a case of someone being 
wounded in a robbery attempt of a post office looking for benefits as an innocent victim. I remember asking the assigned detective why would anyone
rob a post office because that's federal jurisdiction bringing in the FBI and the
post office's own police (they have their own police, note the Alan Ladd classic
Appointment With Danger). He replied he couldn't figure it out unless you
delve into insanity.Kevin, that's the reason that post offices don't often get robbed not because
they're neglected. The big brain of a caper would know that.Hearing the allegations of sexual abuse coming out now about Spacey you also
have to wonder about him and Elgort. Sad, but true and the producers certainly couldn't anticipate the great sexual harassment epidemic springing
up when Baby Driver was cast and made. Now as we watch the movie on TV
and on DVD and live streamed the viewer will wonder also.But apart from that Baby Driver has a lot of flash and very little substance to it.",Baby Driver
2,Leofwine_draca,Superficial,5,8 June 2019,"Another overrated film from Edgar Wright, a classic case of style-over-substance and an attempt at 'coolness' that falls flat. The story follows a getaway driver through a series of heists, shoehorning in a needlessly soppy romantic sub-plot to pad out the running time. The reliance on the film's soundtrack to evoke mood and character smacks of laziness for me, and it's true that this is an underwritten movie throughout.The main character is a real blank and the audience feels nothing for him whatsoever, which is never good. At least we get some interesting performers like Jon Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey in support. On the plus side, the cinematography is nice and the chase scenes well handled; the last half an hour in particular really kicks off. In the end, this is a nice-looking but superficial movie.",Baby Driver
3,SnoopyStyle,fine action made cool,7,22 September 2017,"Baby (Ansel Elgort) is the skilled getaway driver for robberies organized by Doc (Kevin Spacey). Baby has hearing problems after the crash that killed his parents. He is constantly listening to music to alleviate the symptoms. He owes money to Doc and is working it off. Doc recruits a rotating cast of characters in the robbery crew. Baby falls for waitress Debora (Lily James).Edgar Wright is the real star of the movie. The idea is pretty simple. The story is straight forward. The execution is superb. The car chases are fun with an exciting music soundtrack. There is his trademark close-ups but he doesn't do his usual long sequences. The acting is solid but Baby can be a distancing character. He says little and that is a wall from him at times. The rotating cast of characters also prevent great relationships from building up. Some of them have great scenes with him but they don't all have the needed time. Jon Bernthal has a great time poking at Baby but he's cut short. These are stylistic choices that probably pull back some of the bigger payoffs. While this is a fun execution, Baby is not a character who is bigger than the story. He's not quite at the same level as Ryan Gosling in Drive. It's partly Elgort. He's more a puppy version of the big dog. There are some fun moments. The comedy is sporadic but good. Overall, this is a fun ride.",Baby Driver
4,boblipton,The Movie You Remember,9,9 July 2021,"Remember that movie you saw when you were a kid, and loved it? Loved it! Best movie ever! You told all your friends about it, the great music, the cool characters, the gear cars? You talked about it for years, for decades, and then it turned up again, so you dragged your family to see a cool movie that was done right. And as you sat through it for the second time, you wondered ""What happened to the movie I saw when I was a kid? This is nothing at all like it! The lines are stupid, the music is lame and the actors are gargoyles! What happened to it?""This is that movie. It's not the movie you saw, it's the movie you remembered. It's got great music and great cars that dance, and actors who behave like Steve MacQueen, and Kevin Spacey shoots the really bad guys -- not the bank robbers, those are the heroes, but the really bad guys, and says ""I was in love once."" Edgar Wright -- whom I know from the movies he directed Simon Pegg in -- has directed a gangster-car-chase-teen-love movie that does what Justin Lin, Guy Ritchie and those other hot directors tried to do, but could not. Yeah. This is the movie you remembered.",Baby Driver
5,Horst_In_Translation,"No greatness, but a fun watch with cult potential",6,2 August 2017,"""Baby Driver"" is a British/American co-production from this year that made pretty big waves recently. Only part of it is justified I guess. But first things first: The writer and director of this 110-minute movie is Edgar Wright and he is mostly known so far for his collaborations with Simon Pegg. But for this new movie, he is the man in charge alone. Oh yeah and Scott Pilgrim he made too and you can maybe see a parallel here and there in terms of the style, even if the subject and genres are entirely different here for sure. You get a mix of music and crime in this new one with an ounce of romance, lots of action and thriller elements. Don't be fooled by the title here, this was a pretty tense and entertaining work from start to finish. I think it has all the ingredients to become as much of a success as Scott Pilgrim, probably even a better lead actor. I won't go into detail a lot about the story, lets just give a really basic summary. This is the story of a young man who is a highly gifted driver, a prodigy really and we find out what happens when he tries to make his criminal endeavors a thing of the past.His boss is played by 2-time Oscar winner winner Kevin Spacey, one of his partners in crime is played by Oscar winner Jamie Foxx (nice Oscar quote by him too) and the third big name is Jon Hamm, the star from Mad Men, one of the finest shows in television history and with his turn here he absolutely made the successful transition from small screen star to big screen star if he hadn't before already. No doubt we will see him in many more theatrical releases in the next years/decades. If lead actor Elgort is not bringing it for you, or the stunning Lily James who plays his love interest and light at the end of the tunnel, then one of the aforementioned trio should for sure I hope. I personally found it an interesting idea to have Hamm be the main antagonist eventually and the earlier statement by Eiza González' character was a good indicator of the ending. You sure would expect Spacey's character to be the main antagonist, or Foxx' as Hamm even lets the Driver get away before Foxx shows up before the escalation at the end. Anyway, Hamm did an amazing job and was maybe the best thing about the entire film (besides James' looks). But here we also get to one of the film's weaknesses. Spacey's character's transformation into loyal helper really went against everything we learned about him earlier. Another issue was the protagonist turning into a real survivalist with everything that happens to him as the film's core is that he is really just the driver, not the fighter who even gets his hands dirty. It did not feel too realistic that apparently he has more very refined skills in other fields.But I still believe that the positive and entertaining here was way more frequent than the negative. For example a scene at the very beginning stayed in my mind when we don't see the action in the bank, but the action in the car as it is all about Baby, the entire film. And the songs used in here were good choices for sure. I liked listening to them, even if I did not know them, as they fit the particular situation nicely. I kept wondering if there will be a sequel, but with everything that happened in the last half hour and also the major flash forward at the very end, it seems almost impossible, especially given the fact Wright is not known at all for sequels to his big successes. This one here is quickly turning into one of these. It is certainly not as great as IMDb voters, who include it in the best 250 films ever made, or critics want us to believe at this point, but it felt like a pretty nicely handled slightly under 2 hours that will probably never be considered mediocre or weak filmmaking. And rightfully so. I enjoyed this movie for a whole bunch of reasons and I am sure that for example the F&F franchise can learn a whole lot from this one on how to combine car action and convincing story-telling. ""Baby Driver"" gets a thumbs-up from me and it is among the best fun films of 2017 so far, most likely gonna stay there until the end of the year.",Baby Driver
6,Prismark10,The driver,5,4 March 2018,"Edgar Wright has made a hipper, funkier version of Ryan Gosling's Drive from 2011.Young getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) suffers from tinnitus. He uses a pounding beat to drive and he is an ace driver who is working off a debt to crime boss, Doc (Kevin Spacey.) However the audience knows that Doc will never let him go, he is too good and valuable.However you just know things are not going to go well for the cool, laconic baby especially once he falls in love with a waitress in a diner. Doc is using some unstable people in his crew, such as Bats (Jamie Foxx) and hoodlums like him are suspicious of Baby who is just too nice and weird.The film is energetic but it goes off the road in its final act as the story gets more ludicrous.",Baby Driver
7,claudio_carvalho,Messy Genre with Moralist Conclusion,6,24 September 2017,"""Baby Driver"" is a sort of ""Drive"" wannabe with the story of an intriguing runaway driver However the messy genre of action, romance, crime, music, drama and comedy associated to an awfully moralist conclusion spoil what could have been a cult-movie. The music score is sensational; Ansel Elgort and Lily James show great chemistry and perform charismatic characters. But the unfortunately story is not good and the characters are confused and not well developed, especially Doc. In the hands of Quentin Quarentino, this storyline could have been great with better screenplay and direction. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Em Ritmo de Fuga"" (""In The Rhythm of the Runaway"")",Baby Driver

Baby cares for a deaf-mute foster father and is crushing on the local waitress who reminds him of his mother.It doesn't sound like much, but what makes the film is the over-the-top driving scenes done to music. I can't believe they didn't play ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" or ""Hot Rod Lincoln"" but that is just me. Simple film, Good characters. And of course, a love story.Guide: F-word.

9,kosmasp,Adult Driver,8,4 September 2017,"If you like classic caper movies and generally movies with a lot of car chases, this is something you will cherish. There is a lot of cool character moments - some may feel things being uneven, especially concerning characters or some of the violence, but I'd argue it's consistent most of the way.The only thing I thought brought the movie almost to a stop, was the romance side story going on. Of course this is a very important part to the story and the motives of our Driver. But at times it felt like a completely different movie and not in a good way either. But this all is not really in the way of a really cool movie. A movie that is light in tone and yet still violent when it needs to be. For some it even will reach Cult Status ...",Baby Driver
10,classicsoncall,"""He's a good kid and a devil behind the wheel.""",7,12 February 2018,"With all the hype that attended the original release of this film, I guess I expected something better. The film's not terrible by any means but there's not a whole lot of story to it and the actor portraying Baby Driver (Ansel Elgort) seemed out of his element in the picture. Come to think of it, I'd be rather resentful if people wanted to call me 'Baby' as a nickname, it has a pejorative feel to it as opposed to someone casually saying 'Hey, Baby'. Which is probably why all the thugs hired by Doc (Kevin Spacey) took an immediate dislike to the kid; he looked too young to be the kind of experienced getaway driver that the film called for. But the action driving sequences were well staged, even though there probably should have been more of them given the fast car genre this picture falls into. Also, if I had my way, I wouldn't have led off the picture with the best stunts. There was one maneuver that looked outrageous that I'd find hard trying to describe, but if you've seen the picture you can probably narrow it down. I think I would also have opted for a single, intricately plotted heist at the center of the story, but since it wasn't my call, you have to take what you get.",Baby Driver
11,lee_eisenberg,keep driving to soul music,8,11 February 2018,"Edgar Wright takes a turn away from the Cornetto Trilogy with the perceptive ""Baby Driver"", focusing on the getaway driver for a group of criminals. Part of the movie's charm lies in the soundtrack. Baby (Ansel Elgort) has to continually listen to music due to a ringing in his ears. The scenes where they plan out the heists are enjoyable enough, but it's the music that you gotta love. Almost the entire soundtrack consists of soul music.We're probably going to take a different look at the movie now that Kevin Spacey has fallen from grace, but for the most part it's one exhilarating piece of work. No surprise that the editing and sound received Academy Award nominations.Not a masterpiece, but still a good movie. I recommend it. Also starring Eiza González, Lily James (Cinderella), Jon Hamm (Don Draper on ""Mad Men""), Jamie Foxx (Django) and Paul Williams (Swan in ""Phantom of the Paradise"").",Baby Driver
12,jboothmillard,Baby Driver,5,8 July 2017,"Following all the promotion, this movie was receiving so much buzz from social media, having seen trailers I was certainly getting excited to see, so I hoped all the hype would be worthwhile, directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End). Basically in Atlanta, Georgia, Miles ""Baby"" (Golden Globe nominated Ansel Elgort) is a young and talented getaway driver, as a child he suffered a car accident that killed his parents, and left him with severe severe tinnitus, a permanent ringing in the ear, he blocks this out with music., he also produces his own music using conversations he records and remixes them. Baby works for mastermind heist planner Doc (Kevin Spacey), he stole one of Doc's cars in the past, so he is repaying a debt, Baby lives and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph (CJ Jones), and between jobs he spends time at a diner and strikes a friendship with waitress Debora (Downton Abbey's Lily James). After pulling off a robbery, Baby is told his debt will be paid off after the next job, with a different crew the planned heist is an armoured car robbery, an armed veteran in the parking lot attempts to stop them, but after a brief chase on the interstate they escape. Doc tells Baby his debt is paid, he instructs him to get rid of the car carrying the body of crew member JD (Lanny Joon), killed for carelessness and leaving a weapon behind, Baby next takes Joseph's advice and finds work delivering pizzas, and takes Debora to a fancy restaurant. Baby runs into Doc at the restaurant, he tells him to be ready for another job, he agrees in order to keep Debora and Joseph safe, the job is a post office robbery, to steal several boxes of money orders, the crew consists of members from previous heists, including former stock broker Jason ""Buddy"" Van Horn (Jon Hamm), Buddy's wife Monica ""Darling"" Costello (Eiza González), and unhinged and ruthless criminal Leon ""Bats"" Jefferson III (Jamie Foxx). The crew acquire weapons from a dealer nicknamed The Butcher (Paul Williams), but they realise he and some of his cohorts are police, Bats starts a gunfight, most of the Butcher's group are killed, and Darling is injured, they next stop at the diner where Debora works, Baby keeps quiet so the others do not suspect he knows her. Back to Doc's place, the group are chastised for what happened, Doc calls off the heist, but changes his mind when Buddy reveals he knows another way to get in, Baby tries to leave and run away with Debora, but he is caught with a tape of a conversation recording, Baby proves he is mixing them to music, they conclude he is not ratting on them, but they play a tape titled ""Debora"", and realise she is the waitress at the diner. During the heist, Buddy, Darling, and Bats successfully steal the money orders, Baby is angered when Bats shoots and murders a security guard, enraged he drives the car straight into the back of a truck, Bats is impaled and killed with rebar, the remaining three flee. Baby steals a car, but runs into Darling and Buddy, the police catch up to them and Darling is shot dead, Baby flees and Buddy vows revenge for the death of Darling. Baby steals another car and returns to his apartment, he leaves Joseph in an assisted living home with all his money, then returns to the diner to get Debora, only to find Buddy waiting for him, Baby shoots Buddy as police close in, he and Debora flee. Baby goes to Doc to retrieve on his cassette tapes, Doc softens when he sees him with Debora, and gives them a bag of money, they are ambushed in the parking lot below by the Butcher's men, Doc kills them, but then Buddy appears, runs over Doc and kills him. Baby decides to stop running, and takes a truck to push Buddy's car off the ledge, Buddy escapes before the car falls, he fires his gun next to Baby's ears, temporarily deafening him, Debora knocks away Buddy's gun, Baby uses it to shoot Buddy in the knee, causing him to fall off the parking lot to his death. Debora drives Baby away, but are stopped on a bridge by the police, Baby surrenders, he is sentenced to twenty-five years in prison for his crimes, with a parole hearing in five years, during his time inside Baby receives postcards from Debora, who promises to wait for him. Also starring Jon Bernthal as Griff, Flea as Eddie, Sky Ferreira as Baby's Mom and Lance Palmer as Baby's Dad. Elgort is a terrific choice to play the whizz kid with a talent for driving and a love for music, Spacey is constantly scowling and an unpredictable villain, and there is terrific support from Foxx, Hamm and James. What makes this film really clever is the soundtrack editing, the rock, hip hop and R&B songs have been choreographed and matched with the gun fire and chase sequences, every bang and crash goes to the beat of each song, I will admit some of the plot is bit disjointed, but it is definitely a cool alternative heist movie, a fast-paced and enjoyable action. It won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Sound, and it was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. Worth watching!",Baby Driver
13,Tweekums,"Part heist movie, part music video, all action",8,28 August 2018,"After stealing the wrong car from the wrong man our protagonist, Baby, finds himself working as a getaway driver for that wrong man, Doc. Baby stands out from the other criminals; he doesn't say much and lives with music in his ears to drown out the tinnitus he suffers thanks to a childhood accident. Everything he does is done to music and he must have the right track for the job. The first job we see goes well but the second gets a bit messy... luckily Baby has been told this is the job that will clear his debt to Doc... unluckily it isn't long before he is told that doesn't mean he can stop driving for Doc. If he refuses it won't just be bad for him but also for those he cares for. The next job is to be a raid on a large post office... things will soon get bloody.If found this film to be a lot of fun; early on it almost felt like a musical as we see Baby dancing through the streets as he goes to get coffee for the thieves after the first stylish car chase. We then spend some time getting to know key characters; as well as Baby and Doc these include waitress Debora, who Baby meets in a diner and crooks, Bats, Buddy and Darling. With each job the tensions increase and the body count rises. Ansel Elgort does an impressive job as Baby and Lily James is likeable as Debora. The rest of the cast features many well-known players, notably Kevin Spacey, as Doc; James Foxx, as Bats; and Jon Hamm, as Buddy. There are several really good chase scenes as well as a few impressive shootouts. There are inevitably some genre clichés as Baby falls in love, issues of trust arise and things ultimately go fairly wrong; that wasn't really a problem though. While this is primarily a stylish heist movie there are some genuinely funny moments... the scene with the wrong masks was priceless. Overall I really enjoyed this but can see that some might think it is too much style over substance.",Baby Driver
14,BA_Harrison,Worse than Scott Pilgrim.,2,20 April 2018,"I heard in an interview that Edgar Wright compiled the music for Baby Driver before writing the script. The music (not my cup of tea, but others seem to like it) has clearly been given a lot of consideration; the script, not so much.A hackneyed tale of a young heist driver (Ansel Elgort) indebted to a crime boss (Kevin Spacey), Baby Driver is pure vacuous tripe, a severe case of style over substance, Wright once again proving that, if his film ain't got Pegg and Frost in it, it ain't worth watching.As the viewer, we are intended to empathise with kind-hearted Baby, who would rather provide for his deaf foster father and drive into the sunset with pretty waitress Debora (Lily James) than spend his life outrunning cops, but after a few minutes in his company, I wanted the irritating git out of the picture, his dancing, miming lyrics and playing air instruments quickly getting my goat. I could fully appreciate why the other criminals found him so annoying.Wright handles the car chase scenes well enough, but when the tyres aren't screeching, the film is absolutely horrible, the characters talking like rejects from a bad Tarantino movie, the rapid romance between Baby and Debora utterly unbelievable, and the endless calculated cool scenes merely grating on the nerves.My advice to Edgar Wright: give Pegg and Frost a call and break out the Cornettos.",Baby Driver
15,blanche-2,Love this! Great fun and great music!,9,6 October 2018,"Baby is a young man (Ansel Elgort) who is tantamount to a stunt car driver, though he's not a pro. He works for a criminal (Kevin Spacey) as a wheelman after robberies as a way to pay him back for stealing from him some years earlier. He hides the money he makes in the floorboards of the apartment he shares with his foster father (C.J. Jones), who is deaf and in a wheelchair. The two sign to one another. That's good, because Baby doesn't talk much. He spends all tie listening to music via his earbuds - he has tinnitus from a childhood accident that killed his parents.Baby meets a waitress, Debora (Lily James) and falls for her - she doesn't know what he does. And the latest robbery involves some violent and very nasty characters (John Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Elza Gonzalez). And that puts Baby, Joseph, and Debora in danger.Really excellent film with unbelievable car chases. Elgort has great moves as he dances around listening to his tunes.

Music is by Steven Price and cinematography by Bill Pope.In debt to a crime boss, a young getaway driver with tinnitus finds himself taking part in a heist that could spell doom for all involved.Lets get it out the way, I'm a big fan of Edgar Wright, I find him refreshing for still shooting on film. That he has beautiful camera actions and for the fact his cutting is smooth and not a incomprehensible video game mess like so many other action movie directors these days. So obviously I love Baby Driver for sure.The choreography is high quality, the stunt work equally so, while the varied soundtrack (given to us via Baby's personal player) is one of the best in many a year. Cast are bang on form, where naturally they are given a zinger of script to work from (it pays to watch more than once to catch some lines again). While the thrill of the extended action scenes are joyous.It was a film long in gestation for Wright, and you can see he has given it his undivided attention. He may be divisive as per his output, but the monster success of Baby Driver (both critically and commercially) speaks volumes about the quality of the work on show.

The soundtrack is fantastic; the action is violent and incredible (this MUST be seen on a big screen); the plot complex; Spacey, Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx are terrifying but terrific in supporting roles; James is beautiful and sympathetic and the film has a satisfying ending.However I have issues with it too. It's too long (over two hours); slow-moving; full of unpleasant characters; tons of swearing and an ending which goes on too long. One character keeps coming back from almost certain death so many times it got comical. Most critically though I found Elgort terrible. I didn't know how to react to his character and got thoroughly annoyed with his blank line readings. With a better actor I might have liked this better.

20,zardoz-13,"Baby, Does This Movie Rock'N Roll!!!",8,22 July 2017,"The trailer that first advertised British writer & director Edgar Wright's ""Baby Driver"" made it look like a Young Adult knock-off of French producer Luc Beeson's ""Transporter"" franchise with rugged, austere Jason Statham. Fortunately, nothing could be farther from the truth. Indeed, the films both deal with elusive getaway car drivers. Despite their apparent resemblance, these movies share little in common except for their automotive audacity. Comparatively, ""Baby Driver"" is nothing like Wright's earlier comic trilogy ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2994), ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007), and ""The World's End"" (2013). Two of those movies dealt with supernatural creatures, while ""Hot Fuzz"" constituted a police parody. Furthermore, ""Baby Driver"" is nothing like Wright's other unconventional outing ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" (2010). Indeed, Wright performs a 180 with ""Baby Driver,"" a straightforward, white-knuckled, R-rated, crime thriller about blood, death, and consequences. Meantime, unlike the usual bombastic summer release, ""Baby Driver"" isn't an outlandish escapade. Instead, it is a superbly staged, adrenalin-laced actioneer which rarely pulls its punches. The first three-fourths of this Atlanta-lensed saga is top-notch, while the final fourth marks time with the hero's atonement for his crimes. Another thing that differentiates ""Baby Driver"" from most summer movies is it is neither a blockbuster prequel nor a sequel. Nobody gives a bad performance. Indeed, Wright surrounds his handsome, earnest, young leading man, Ansel Elgort of ""Divergent,"" with a robust cast, featuring Jamie Fox, Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Kevin Spacey. Jamie Fox and Jon Hamm are unforgettable as a pair of unhinged hoodlums who abhor each other, while Kevin Spacey towers above both as the wily mastermind of all the film's crimes. Clearly, something about Edgar Wright's tale of mayhem and murder appealed to these Hollywood veterans, and they indulge in being both evil and obnoxious. Honorable mention goes to behind-the-scenes veteran stunt coordinator Darrin Prescott of ""John Wick"" fame as well as the hundred or more precision drivers, riggers, camera bike riders, and stunt doubles who helped him orchestrate several harrowing but realistic driving sequences that never turn into the bizarre tomfooleries of the ""Transporter"" movies. Hey, I loved the ""Transporter"" movies, but ""Baby Driver"" strives to keep things realistic.Baby (Ansel Elgort of ""The Fault in Our Stars"") is a fearless, young hellion with a taste of tunes and reckless driving that converge once he takes the wheel of any vehicle. He survived a traumatic childhood after his contentious mother and father slammed their car into the rear of a tractor-trailer and died. Baby escaped grievous bodily harm. Nevertheless, he carries a couple of token scars on above an eyebrow and across his cheek. Wright sketches in Baby's background when he doesn't replay the scene of the accident that killed his parents. Meantime, he spent his teen years stealing cars and keeping the Atlanta Police in his rearview mirror. At the same time, he became a wizard with recording music in any format and grooves to his iPod whenever he careens around town to drown out ""the hum in his drum"" caused by tinnitus. Writer & director Edgar Wright provides us with a protagonist both sympathetic and charming. Baby doesn't brag, he just drives, and when he holds onto the wheel, he can go anywhere--if there is anywhere to go. Literally, he can thread the eye of a needle in his stick-shift cars, and he can escape from predicaments that seem well-nigh impossible. Initially, we see Baby drive the getaway car after a bank robbery, and he leads the Atlanta Police on a spectacular chase. Afterward, while the well-tailored criminal mastermind, Doc (Kevin Spacey of ""The Usual Suspects""), is dividing up the loot, one of the robbers, Griff (Jon Bernthal of ""The Accountant""), minimizes Baby's role in the hold-up. Griff warns Baby that one way or another Baby will wind up with blood on his hands. We learn from Wright's fast-paced, expository dialogue that Doc discovered Baby because he stole Doc's Mercedes. Since that incident, Doc has used Baby as his wheel-man. Moreover, Doc keeps him on his payroll so the energetic rapscallion can pay off his debt to him. Basically, ""Baby Driver"" boils down to a morality yarn about a young thief who doesn't want to see anybody die during the commission of a crime. Unlike the rest of the characters in ""Baby Driver,"" Baby is the only one with a shred of decency. The sobering but exasperating thing about Baby is that he doesn't elude the long arm of the law every time and that makes him more believable and vulnerable. Fortunately, few of Baby's asphalt antics are so impractical that they could be considered preposterous. After an exhilarating opening sequence where our hero delivers Doc's accomplices without a scratch, Baby embarks on an odyssey that alters his life. Primarily, Baby falls in love with a cute, young waitress at a 24-hour diner where he likes to drink java. Debora (Lily James of ""Cinderella"") walks into Baby's life and she turns him every which way but loose. Once he has repaid Doc for everything that he took from him when he stole his car, Baby plans to quit crime. In fact, he is on the straight and narrow and delivering orders for Goodfellas Pizza when Doc crosses his path again and convinces him to come back and drive for him. ""Baby Driver"" boasts some of the best, high-speed driving sequences since the crime thriller ""Drive"" (2011) with Ryan Gosling. The thieves conspiring with Doc are a cynical, ruthless bunch who would prefer to exit in a blaze of gunfire than submit meekly to the rehabilitative options of the criminal justice system. Wright ramps up all this anarchy with a dynamic but diverse variety of tunes that Baby listens to according to the occasion. The hit songs in ""Baby Driver"" are reminiscent of those in the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" sci-fi space operas. Consequently, Ansel Elgort should be on the road to superstardom, because nothing about ""Baby Driver"" is infantile.",Baby Driver
21,grantss,Gritty and action-packed,7,1 October 2017,"Baby is a young getaway driver, contracted to a master-criminal, Doc. Doc's specialty is armed robberies - he puts together teams for each heist, with Baby being the only constant. Baby completes his last job for Doc and is now free. He sets about leading a normal life, getting a legitimate job and starting a relationship (with Debora). However, Doc views Baby as a sort of good luck charm, and, using threats of violence, pulls him back into the criminal world. With a particular job in mind, Doc assembles his team. However, the other individuals are incompatible with each other, if not psychotic, and soon not only is Baby's life at risk but also Deborah's.A gritty, action-packed and entertaining drama from director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs the World). Good script, with some characters that Tarantino would be proud of. Good action scenes, largely involving cars. The car-action does get possibly too much screen time though, starting to resemble Fast & Furious after a while (that's never a compliment...). Another negative is that it does feel too schmaltzy, especially the ending, which is quite weak in comparison with the remainder of the movie. Ansel Elgort is also a bit irritating as Baby (though not as irritating as he was in The Fault In Our Stars). Comes across as a nerd trying to be cool.Can't fault the supporting performances though. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx and Lily James are great. Jamie Foxx is particularly impressive as the intense, paranoid, impulsive, psychotic Bats.",Baby Driver
22,view_and_review,Baby Scriptwriter,2,23 July 2018,"With a name like Baby Driver I couldn't expect any intelligence from the movie. I didn't. I guess this was supposed to be a care free fun movie; just sit back and be entertained. This movie was trash. It was one long play list with some driving, shooting, killing, stealing, and falling in love. I wanted to like it but I found the plot so utterly ridiculous and the characters utterly repulsive.I'm not here to insult anyone who likes the movie because I don't like doing that. Different strokes for different folks and far be from me to insult a persons tastes. As for me, I found no entertainment value in the movie. There wasn't a single character I liked except maybe Bats (Jamie Foxx) but they made it very clear what his final destination would be. On top of that the script was silly as were the behaviorisms of just about everyone. I never had an inclination to watch this movie. Now you're asking, ""Why did you even watch it?"" Well, someone recommended it. Told me I'd be pleasantly surprised. Wasn't. This movie was awful. Oh to be rich and crank out a movie written while on a drug trip.",Baby Driver
23,neil-476,Stylish,9,9 May 2018,"""Baby"" is a getaway driver for teams put together by crime boss Doc. He plays music on his iPod constantly in order to drown out the tinnitus which resulted from the car accident in which his parents died. He lives with his elderly, infirm, deaf foster father, and is only doing the driving until he has paid off a debt to Doc. Certain members of the crime crews have extremely negative reactions to his constant wearing headphones. When Baby falls for waitress Debora and vice versa, he decides he wants to get out of the game and run away with her. But Doc has other ideas, and hostile Bats is a complete wild card.In some respects, Baby Driver is a completely routine crime thriller, but Edgar Wright as writer and director brings a sense of style to it which we don't see very often. Given Wright's involvement with the Simon Pegg Cornetto trilogy movies, one might expect comedy here. Well, it's not nihilistically dark, but neither is it packed with laughs. But it is always involving.Baby speaks little and is ostensibly rather bland, and Ansel Elgort portrays this well. Towards the start there is an extended moving camera shot as Baby takes coffee to a planning meeting, and the movement and sound editing tell you as much about Baby's character as you need to know thus far. There is a LOT of music in this movie, and all of it well chosen. Lily James as Debora is gorgeous - I wanted to run away with her too. Kevin Spacey plays Doc as an odd mixture of mincing and paternal: it works, but it's odd. And Jamie Foxx as Bats is vile. I was very please when what happened to him happened to him.The developments towards the end aren't always what you expect, and the ending certainly isn't. But It's fair, and I liked it, and all the loose ends are nicely tied up.I enjoyed this, and it promises great things in the future from Edgar Wright.",Baby Driver
24,evanston_dad,Style Will Only Get a Movie So Far,4,25 July 2017,"One of the more disappointing films I've seen recently, because it starts out so promisingly and so its eventual down-hill trajectory seems all the more steep in comparison.""Baby Driver"" has one of the best opening credits sequences I've ever seen, some kinetic and whiplash car chases, and an awesome soundtrack. In its main protagonist, played pretty winningly by Ansel Elgort, it also has an engaging and sympathetic character -- or at least, he starts out that way, until he becomes an empty cipher for director Edgar Wright's fetishistic preoccupations, a problem that plagues the entire movie.The early scenes of Baby finishing his life of crime and meeting a cute girl are the film's best. But the energetic pop and fizz of the movie quickly curdles after that into a tedious and juvenile barrage of non- stop violence and implausibility. If Wright had established a satiric tone like he did in movies like ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Shaun of the Dead,"" I might have been able to tolerate the film's descent into stupidity. But he doesn't, instead playing things straight, so that characters like the ones played by Jamie Foxx and John Hamm (who's badly miscast by the way) become so obnoxious and irritating that I groaned every time they reentered the film. We're supposed to believe that Baby has a heart of gold and is a victim of circumstance, but by the end of the film he's as ruthless as anyone else and can kill with the same casual ease as the bad guys, so we kind of stop caring about him. And the movie can never be forgiven for what it does with his love interest, a completely disposable character who blindly follows Baby even after she's seen him kill a man and who exists for the sole purpose of being rescued. I haven't seen such a worthless female character in a film in a long time.The only other bright spot aside from the ones I've already mentioned is Kevin Spacey, who knows how to play a bad guy as someone who you know is only going to bring grief to the characters you care about but who you want in the movie anyway because he knows how to be sinister and likable at the same time.Style will only get you so far.Grade: C-",Baby Driver
25,Uriah43,A Car Thief Struggling to Pay Off a Debt,6,4 January 2020,"""Doc"" (Kevin Spacey) is an unscrupulous criminal with an appetite for large sums of money which he satisfies by crafting elaborate robberies and then assembling a team to carry out his schemes. So when a skilled car thief by the name of ""Baby"" (Ansel Elgort) steals his car containing a bag full of stolen loot, Doc is not one to simply let it slide. To that extent, Doc demands that Baby reimburse him by becoming his getaway driver on a set number of future bank heists to make up for his lost revenue. Left with few other satisfactory options, Baby agrees and anxiously awaits the day his debt will finally be paid in full. Unfortunately, in his greed Doc has become too reliant upon Baby and doesn't want to let him go so easily. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent action film which consisted of solid acting and a pretty good cast. It does, however, lose some momentum toward the end but even so I enjoyed this movie for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Baby Driver
26,ferguson-6,You make wrong things right,8,25 June 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. If his movies are any indication, writer/director Edgar Wright would be fun to hang out with. He thrives on action and humor, and seems committed to making movies that are entertaining, rather than philosophical life statements. Many know his work from Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End), while others are fans of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. High concept, high energy and a creative use of music are identifiable traits within Mr. Wright's films, all of which are crucial to the success of his latest.Ansel Elgort (excellent in The Fault in Our Stars) stars as Baby, a freakishly talented getaway driver paying off a debt to a no-nonsense crime boss Doc played by Kevin Spacey. Baby has an unusual movie affliction – a childhood accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus. He compensates for the constant ringing in his ear by listening to music through ear buds attached to one of his many iPods (depending on his mood). In fact, his insistence on finding just the right song for the moment adds a colorful element to each escape route.The film opens with what may be its best car chase scene and the hyper-kinetic approach sets the stage for something a bit different than what we usually see. There are no car drops from airplanes or train-jumping (I'm looking at you Fast and Furious franchise). Instead these are old school chases in the mode of Bullitt, or more precisely, Walter Hill's 1978 The Driver (Mr. Hill appears briefly here as a courtroom reporter). A heist-romance-chase film with a diverse and truly remarkable selection of songs, high energy, more than a few comedic moments (the Mike Myers mask sequence is brilliant) and a recurring Monsters, Inc quote requires a strong lead, and young Mr. Elgort aces the test. Baby is the DJ to his own life, and possesses a moral compass that others on his jobs can't comprehend. It's a heart of gold in a bad spot.Spacey plays Doc with his chilling dead-eyed stare, and even has his own moment of action sporting an automatic weapon during a violent shootout. Spacey's various crime teams (he varies the pairings) include psycho-lovebirds Buddy (Jon Hamm in his continuing effort to distance from Don Draper) and Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), Jon Bernthal, Flea, and an aptly named Bats (Jamie Foxx), who is not the clearest thinker of the bunch. Other supporting work comes courtesy of the rarely seen songwriter/actor Paul Williams, musician Sky Ferreira (as Baby's beloved mother), young Brogan Hall as Doc's talented nephew, and CJ Jones as Baby's foster father. Mr. Jones is one of the few deaf movie actors and he adds much to Baby's life outside of crime.The crucial role of Baby's love interest goes to the very talented and likable Lily James (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) as singing waitress Debora, who introduces him to Carla Thomas' ""B-A-B-Y"" song, while he plays ""Debora"" from T.Rex for her. She and Baby share the not overly ambitious life plan: ""to head west in a car I can't afford and a plan I don't have"". They are good together and that helps make up for the always cringe-inducing red flag of ""one last job"" prior to the lovers running away together.Buried in the Miscellaneous Crew is Choreographer Ryan Heffington, who deserves at least some of the credit for the most unique and creative aspect of the presentation. This appears to be a movie fit to the music, rather than music fit to the movie. There are some astounding sequences where the drum/bass beats are right on cue with the action – gunfire, driving, and character movements. ""Harlem Shuffle"" plays as Baby playfully dances past graffiti and sidewalk obstacles that perfectly match the beat and lyrics. We see what is likely the best ever movie use of ""Bellbottoms"", and without question, the most creatively brilliant use of ""Hocus Pocus"" by Focus. At times exhilarating to the senses, the infusion of comedy shots and new love help offset the tension of crime jobs and the thrill of the chase.",Baby Driver
27,bombersflyup,Like a colourful balloon.,4,14 March 2019,"Baby Driver is a popcorn flick, absent of substance and depth. With pretty ladies and lots of car chases.The main character Baby's pompous and annoying and the actor not worthy, while the other characters are quite likable.

After meeting Debora, the woman of his dreams, he sees a chance to ditch his shady lifestyle and make a clean break. Forced into working for crime boss Doc, Baby must face the music as a doomed heist threatens his life, love and freedom......As well as being the single most original film to be made for a mainstream audience in years. As well as being slotted firmly in the action genre, this could also be classed as a non-diegetic musical, because almost every frame of film consists of a song that is suitable for the events that are taking place in the film.Wright doesn't follow an atypical approach to the narrative, and at times, the film can appear to be hyperactive, almost like an anthology piece, but this only adds to the uniqueness of it all.Wright uses gunfire, footsteps, gun loading and finger tapping to accompany the music, and whilst in someone else's hands, this could potentially ruin the momentum of the film, Wright effortlessly melds Diegesis and non Diegesis into something that is borderline genius.Strangely, the film does remind me somewhat of La La Land, with the opening almost dance like, with the smogs lyrics strewn about the set, and the colour coded choreography when the couple are in the Launderette, is almost dreamlike in its presentation.Foxx is a wonderful presence in this film, and after the awful 'Sleepless' just goes to show that he is award worthy, and injects some menace into his role. Hamm too is pretty menacing, but becomes a little too 'end of level bad guy' in the final act.Spacey is as Spacey does, he simply oozes cool with his lines, and he adds something to the film that others possibly couldn't.In fact, apart the main couple, this film features one of the most menacing cast of characters in a film I've seen in a long time. Because they are not predictable, they are spontaneous, and I don't think its coincidence that you feel like Baby is in grave danger throughout the film.It's so refreshing for a studio to show trust in something so left field, and hopefully the success of this will open the gates for more original films to be mainstream.",Baby Driver

Once it hit the theaters over here it was soon gone and it never became what it was promised and did remind me of last years summer failure, also called the blockbuster, Suicide Squad (2016). I agree, Suicide Squad did fail as a flick but Baby Driver didn't for me.But I can understand all the writings about it because it isn't a 'normal' flick. It do has all elements of a suspenseful flick. But it's the excellent or even exquisite editing combined with the score that do annoy a lot of people but if you can dig that then you are into a really fine flick. The score used never bothered me, there are even a few surprises in it for me like The Damned (Neat Neat Neat). The shootings throughout the flick edited on the music made it for me a delight to see. Must have taken a lot of patience to do that. Nevertheless, the opening scene with the car chase is a must see and it one of the best seen in years. Another surprise are the brands of cars that they are using. There's something for everybody from German cars to old US cars to Japanese cars to even the newest muscle cars. I found it a stunning flick with superb cinematography and editing. Naturally the use of all those songs did remind me of Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014) were the score was also a main thing. And for the older viewers, yes it's cassette galore, those good old Maxells from the eighties. One of the better flicks of 2017.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Baby Driver
31,deloudelouvain,Overrated,5,17 October 2017,The only thing I can say for sure about Baby Driver is that this movie is highly overrated. It certainly doesn't deserve such a high rating as it does now on here. It's an easy to watch action movie but not the best one in this genre. The plot isn't difficult to understand and it isn't that bad either but the characters are what brings this movie down. Too much have-you-see-me characters just don't do any good to the movie. I really doubt criminals and bank robbers would act like they do before a heist. It would be for sure a disaster every time. Kevin Spacey is the big name in Baby Driver but don't watch this movie to see him in action. He did much better movies than this one. The rest of the cast can clearly act but it's just their ridiculous characters that makes this just an average action movie.,Baby Driver
32,Mr-Fusion,Joyride on cloud nine,9,11 July 2017,"Surprises this pleasing just don't come along often.""Baby Driver"" is a heist movie, and as such, it feels indebted to other luminaries (The Driver, Bullitt, Drive, Heat, etc). The only difference here is that the wheelman is someone more akin to Starlord than the usual loner. And just like those movies, jobs go wrong and loyalties swap quickly. But Baby (Ansel Elgort) doesn't belong in this underworld. He's not Gosling or McQueen, and that's where the movie reinvigorates the subgenre. Once the love interest (Lily James) gets dragged in, this reaches a whole different level.But here's where the movie's real magic comes in. It's not just for lovers of fast cars and stunt driving (i.e. me); it's more about the universal appeal of music and how it soundtracks everything we do. It's why there's such bubbly pleasure to be had from both the chase scenes and something mundane, like going out for coffee. This is one big fanciful mixtape, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie make such novel use of it before. The songs really get into your pores. It's just an added bonus that there are brilliantly choreographed car chases to go with it.I can almost guarantee that one cannot walk out of this movie without wearing a huge smile.

All the acting is beautiful and, if you are into movies, you should definitely watch this.However, if you care about the story, it is as plain as it could be. It is the story of a getaway driver, stuck against his will in a mobster's contract. Everything that happens is pretty much obvious. If you are not one for details, but care about the story, it will probably not excite you at all, even if there is nothing wrong with it per se.Bottom line: watch some actors have fun in a movie where the writer/director had some fun.

34,lasttimeisaw,one must congratulate Mr. Wright for finally getting his mojo back,7,14 August 2017,"Officially becoming cinematic scenester Edgar Wright's highest grossing film to date and breaks into the 9-digit club in its North American territory, BABY DRIVER, his sixth feature, ebulliently welds his music-savvy retro-flair into an uber-stylized heist drama, and its riveting opening gambit of an adrenaline-rushing car-chasing sequence trenchantly assuages our dread concerning the wind-up of our baby-faced protagonist, as long as he is behind the wheel, he is invincible, and the situation only becomes parlous when he isn't. Baby (Elgort) is a music-loving getaway driver in Atlanta, Georgia, tinnitus-inflicted by a childhood car accident (which rendered him parent-less), he is reticent and steeped in the music to fend off his ailment, especially in the heat of his dangerous metier, music is essential in adjusting his judgment and performing those incredible car stunts. He never fails and becomes the mascot of the criminal mastermind Doc (a stern but wise-cracking Spacey), who promises that Baby can go straight when their debt is squared up, and for one blithe moment, that actually happens, where Baby finds a less risky pizza-delivery job and strikes up a heartfelt romance with waitress Debora (Lily James, personable as ever), until Doc railroads him into taking another job, teaming up with three other criminals, the seemingly congenial but relentlessly lethal Buddy (Hamm, devilishly handsome and irrationally elicits one's trepidation of his denouement), his bombshell wife Darling (González) and a trigger-happy motor mouth Bats (a marginally irksome Jamie Foxx), and their plan to rob a post office goes askew even before it starts. The rest of the story slumps into cliché: conscience mounting, body-count soaring, danger menacing, and also a lesson to those evil bosses who relent in the last minute, don't! Baby must save himself from the resultant mêlée and also secure the safety of Debora and his deaf foster father (CJ Jones), with a single-minded villain on his tail who, albeit his unswerving resolution of vengeance, more often than not, opts for talking over pulling the trigger when he gains the upper hand in the cat-and-mouse game, to further aggravate the time-honored chagrin of most filmic villains. Apart from Wright's bountiful aural potpourri (the film's soundtrack is the bee's knees), crafty action pieces, sleek camera antics and outlandish humor (the mix-tape placement is a gas with the great pull of Baby's emotional state). What makes viewers tick is Ansel Elgort's amiable leading performance, Baby is a wizard in the driving seat, but exceptionally denuded of conceit (a staple streak in Wright's characters, although Spacey, Foxx and Hamm are all competing for that grail), conversely, Elgort is radiant of his youthful nonchalance, visceral tenderness and a personal panache transcending the common teen heartthrob crush, which fits him as a Hollywood's rising star and a future mainstay. So, the jury is in, might not be as lenient as those in the film, but BABY DRIVER is a bonafide asset to dissipate the summer blockbuster lethargy and one must congratulate Mr. Wright for finally getting his mojo back!",Baby Driver
35,Hellmant,One of Wright's best films (and the year's)!,10,29 June 2017,"'BABY DRIVER': Five Stars (Out of Five) The new action-comedy from writer/director Edgar Wright. It stars Ansel Elgort as a young and extremely talented getaway driver, that's blackmailed into working for a team of professional bank robbers. The movie also stars Lily James, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Eiza Gonzalez, Jon Bernthal and Flea. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics so far (it's currently 98% positive on Rottentomatoes), and it's also received nearly unanimous positive reviews from viewers as well. I agree with everyone else, it's one of the year's very best films! Baby (Elgort) was in a horrible car accident as a child, which killed both his parents and gave him tinnitus for the rest of his life. He blocks the illness out by constantly listening to music now, which also makes him extremely skilled at things like driving. When a bank robber kingpin, named Doc (Spacey), caught Baby stealing from him (when he was younger), he blackmailed him into being his most skilled getaway driver (on every heist). After Baby pays Doc back though, everything he owed him, he wants out of his life of crime now. He's also met a young woman (James) he really likes, who also likes him a lot as well. Doc won't let his best, and most reliable, driver leave him that easily though.The movie is extremely well written; it's full of great character development and witty dialogue. It's actually reminiscent of a Tarantino movie in that way, but with Wright's uniquely talented touch too obviously. The characters are all well cast as well, and the action scenes are breathless. There's multiple fully exhilarating car chases in it, and there's also an awesome foot chase scene too (that's inspired by one of Wright's favorite films, 'POINT BREAK'). The soundtrack is also equally cool, and it's always fittingly placed (in a stunningly beautiful way). The movie is a classic waiting to happen, in every way, and it's also one of Wright's best films (and the year's)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/mxz-nUpMk6Y",Baby Driver

37,Lejink,Spinning the wheel,7,14 December 2019,"I'm not into the whole ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" / ""The Fast And The Furious"" franchises where the cars (or more particularly the driving and destruction of them) are the stars, but I took a chance on Edgar Wright's take on the brake and am glad I did.Focusing on the appropriately baby-faced title character (Ansel Elgort) from first to last and told from his own cockpit view, I actually wondered if he was going to perpetuate his initial Harpo Marx mute routine for the whole movie and was a little disappointed that he didn't. Where I did connect with him however was in his devotion to his iPod where he has a different one for different moods and can find his favourite track by spinning its wheel as quickly as he can the one in his car.Baby however has a lot on his plate, an orphan who unsurprisingly lost both his parents in a car crash, he now looks after his elderly deaf-mute black stepfather in a run-down apartment, appears to be under the control of criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey in his last major film role before his scandalous fall from grace) and then falls for a pretty waitress named Debora (Lily James) who shares his love for usually classic R 'n' B music.Into the mix are thrown Doc's flaky negative-Mission Impossible assembled crime gang members Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Elza Gonzales who all get to jive talk and play shoot-em-up with any number of rival gangsters and errant cops who cross their paths, but who ultimately come to their own sticky ends.With the action set-pieces neatly syncopated to a diverse soundtrack taking in obscure T Rex, early 70's Dutch Rock from Focus and Golden Earring as well as great soul-sides by Sam and Dave, Bob and Earl and Carla Thomas, ending of course on Simon and Garfunkel's title tune, the film is a breathless ride through a series of staged bank heists and of course car stunts where it's fair to say that many cars were damaged in the making of this movie. There was also a relieving dollop of comedy as you'd expect from director Wright in the crisp music-themed dialogue between Baby and Debora, the gang squabbling over which Mike Myers character mask to use when carrying out a robbery and Baby's gentleman-driver politeness which helps him ultimately to reduce his jail term and so reunite with Debs at the end.All the performances are good, with Hamm in particular surprisingly so as the deranged stockbroker-gunslinger and Elgort and James as the young Bonnie and Clyde-types.I actually watched this movie as an in-flight movie which probably isn't a bad way to see it. As well as helping my return home go quicker I also appreciate it saving me from ever dipping into any of the four-wheel stunt-fests like those mentioned at the start of this review.",Baby Driver
38,MOscarbradley,A genre classic,9,2 July 2017,"I have to admit I've never been a massive fan of Edgar Wright, (with the exception of the highly imaginative ""Scott Pilgrim Versus the Wold""). His genre comedies never seemed as ground-breaking as he, and lots of others, seemed to think; entertaining to be sure, but hardly classics and now ""Baby Driver"" arrives, swathed in hype and glowing reviews and would you believe it, for the first thirty minutes or so I thought, here we go again, nowhere at very high speed. Then something happened; I'm not sure what or at what point. Was it a line, (and there are a lot of good lines), or just a bit of action that didn't feel too derivative? Anyway, suddenly I started to get drawn in and finally I was hooked.What hooked me? Well, not Baby for sure. Ansel Elgort is a good-looking kid, like the guys you see a lot nowadays in advertisements; the kind of guys who are meant to sell you the products but who are actually the kind of guys I, for one, would like to slap...hard. And he never really changes. He meets a girl who is also cute and she has a very wide smile and very white teeth. She's played by ""Downton Abbey's"" Lily James and I wanted to slap her too though by the end I had kind of warmed to her a little. She's put into danger and I'm a sucker for a damsel in distress. No, it wasn't Ansel and it wasn't Lily that hooked me or even drew me in, so who? That's easy. ""Baby Driver"" has three of the best bad guys I've seen in a movie in years, not to mention some of the best stunt driving as well as a cracking script from Wright. Easy to get hooked, then. The bad guys are Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm and there's a pretty tough cookie of a bad girl played by Eliza Gonzalez. Spacey is Mr Big. He's a villain but his Achilles Heel is a a soft spot for Baby and Spacey carries off the tough/tender side of his character brilliantly but it's his henchmen, Foxx and Hamm, who are the real villains, (Foxx, in particular, is the kind of guy who would blow away a baby sooner than look at him), and they would lift a movie half as good and send it off into the stratosphere and they do. They make being this bad feel like fun; as does Wright. He was, of course, up against it, through ""The Driver"" to ""Drive"", ""Baby Driver"" had a lot to live up to and it does. There's a moment near the end when it evokes ""Thelma and Louise"" and any mention of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is bound to be dangerous. We're not in that class, I admit, but Elgot and James notwithstanding, ""Baby Driver"" is still a genre classic.",Baby Driver
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"A different beast from the director's other work, this is an entertaining flick with a V6-engine for a brain and an MP3 player for a heart.",8,30 April 2018,"To say this is perhaps Edgar Wright's weakest film is like comparing a ruby to three diamonds and one slightly shinier ruby - at the end of the day it's still a gem, just a slightly less precious one. It's hard to know exactly how I feel about 'Baby Driver (2017)' in relation the the director's other work, as it's a different beast altogether, and I feel comparisons are unfair, though inevitable, so all I'll say is this: the feature is fantastic fun from beginning to end, feeling like it comes from the mind of a man who's totally in control. For me, it doesn't reach the heights of the 'Cornetto trilogy', if a side-by-side is important here, but it sits comfortably alongside 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (2010)' as an example of Wright's creativity coming across in a genre, and studio system, aching for some new perspective. Even though some of the meticulous musical timings (the biggest marketing draw of the piece) do seem to subside somewhat in the second act, this is a consistently enjoyable ride that uses appropriately eclectic music and fantastically sly performances to keep you smiling all the way through. Its sonic syncing is more noticeable on a second watch and isn't as brash as the marketing would lead you to believe, though nor is it as important. The piece isn't a comedy, either, which may have thrown some people off. It is still a generally light thriller with plenty of witty writing and some funny moments, though. The action really is fantastic, in a generally less violent and more free-flowing kind of way, with its focus placed far more on the balletic elements of such sequences than the aggressive ones. There are still proper stakes, though, thanks to the piece's well-written script that constantly keeps you caring. 8/10",Baby Driver
40,bowmanblue,Nearly disappointed,7,19 June 2019,"One of the problems of not watching a film soon after it was released (and hearing a lot of positive praise about it in the meantime!) is that you expect it to be absolutely amazing. I like (writer/director) Edgar Wright's other work (i.e. 'the Cornetto trilogy' - Google it if you don't get the reference!), plus I'm a fan of slick heist films and the actors on display here, so I figured that this would be the film for me. And it was. But only just.'Baby' is a young (18-21 year old, I'm guessing - I don't think his age was ever officially disclosed) man who has a natural gift at stealing cars and then driving them away at high speed. He's currently working for a criminal mastermind, but only to 'work off a debt' - after that he's gone. However, the criminal life is never that straight forward.I was about 20-30 minutes in and I was really contemplating turning it off! Yes, Wright's style and direction is uber-slick and a joy to watch. The cast was shaping up nicely to be as good as advertised and the dialogue wasn't that bad either. The problem was 'Baby' himself (Ansel Elgort). We soon learn that he doesn't talk too much, mainly because he deliberately excludes himself from conversations by plugging himself into his personal musical device. However, later we learn there is a deeper meaning behind this. I've never seen the actor before, so I can't comment on how good he normally is, but here (with pretty much the entire film resting on his young shoulders) he just doesn't seem that charismatic to really carry the film (especially when he's hampered by being practically mute for long periods of time). Worse still, he started coming across as rather smug with these weird little 'song and dance' numbers that were particularly noticable in the first half of the film.Luckily, when the tension starts to mount, Baby seems to glide into being the 'leading man' a little more. There is - the obligatory - romance element, which does seem a little forced and, believe it or not, the film would probably have been just as good without it. But, what really makes it is the cast. If you have seen Jon Bernthal's name attached, don't get your hopes up - his scenes are almost just an extended cameo. The 'real' stars are the ever excellent Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. They're long-standing appeal and screen presence saves the film and picks up and slack left by Elgort's inexperience with shouldering the burden of an entire film's weight.I have read a couple of reviews which stated that the film is a 'film of two halves.' I can agree with that completely, although many of the other reviews seem to like the first half and say that it then fell apart in the second. I was the other way around - I was bored with the first half and then found that when the action picked up around the midway mark, everything got a lot better. The chases and car stunts are excellent and worth watching on their own, plus there's a little kid that totally steals the show - pity he's in it even less than Jon Bernthal! Overall, I'm glad I watched the film and stuck with it. If there is a major fault it's that it feels about 10-15 minutes too long. I reckon you could have cut down the romance element and made it a tighter film.",Baby Driver
41,ThomasDrufke,B-a-b-y,7,2 July 2017,"Let me start this off by saying that Hollywood needs more films like Baby Driver. Not just because the originality is off the charts, but because I wish more films boasted this much irreverent fun. It's Edgar Wright, so you know it's going to be stylish, but there really hasn't been another film this year that has matched the amount of chaotic entertainment in Baby Driver. I guess you could say it's this year's Deadpool.With all that out of the way, I should now say that I didn't find there to be anything significantly impressive about any one character in the film. Ansel Elgort and Lily James have great chemistry, as you'd expect. Kevin Spacey is an intimidating but somehow charming antagonist, as you'd expect. Jaime Foxx plays a foul-mouthed henchman, as you'd expect. Jon Hamm, Eliza Gonzalez, and Jon Bernthal aren't given much depth either. I guess my point is, Baby Driver gathered a bunch of extremely talented actors for a film, and failed to put together an impressive story with interesting characters. Elgort's 'Baby' is given a semi-interesting but prototypical backstory, but the rest are given absolutely nothing.However, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't enjoy the soundtrack and overall flow of the film. The action sequences are nicely spaced out and the music is perfectly timed up. It's not uncustomary to have a great soundtrack in an Edgar Wright film, but it's unprecedented for a film to have this much success using music to drive the story and action. Wasn't it difficult to not join Elgort while he's dancing to the beat through the streets of Atlanta?The soundtrack is addicting, the action is thrilling, and the performances are more than serviceable. If only Wright gave a little more attention to developing each character so that their motivations weren't so shallow, we may have one of the best films of the year on our hands. Without much to grapple onto, Baby Driver is just a little bit above a decent action-crime-thriller.+Soundtrack is killer+Action is well-shot and paced-Characters lack depth-Motivations should be fleshed out7.0/10",Baby Driver
42,MLDinTN,loved the humor in this robbery gone wrong adventure,7,16 July 2018,"The best part about this movie was the dark humor and one liners. It just worked. And I loved the character of Baby, it just works you have this quiet guy listening to music and he can do all these cool tricks with a car. Spacy was good as the ringleader in all this. Not only were the car chase scenes excellent, but the on the foot scenes well shot too. Some parts I still don't get. Like why did Baby slam on the gas and run into the back of the truck on the last heist. It's like he wanted to give up but then he ran. And I don't think he should have gone back the waitress while on the run. He knew what would happen. Just look over some of the plot holes.FINAL VERDICT: Super fun robbery film with some humor. Definitely worth checking out.",Baby Driver

45,lesleyharris30,"Action Packed, Hilarious, Original,",10,9 July 2017,"Baby Driver is an outstanding movie with an unbelievably well developed plot and pitch perfect cast. It is an action fueled ride from start to finish, it has a formula that could have been adapted in a very cliché way, but thanks to writer and director Edgar Wright, it is probably the most groundbreaking, original movie you will see all year. It boasts a stellar soundtrack that fits each scene perfectly, particularly the car chases, and we can see that the cast and crew spent an insane amount of time making sure the music suited the action itself perfectly. The balance of drama and comedy is terrific, you will find moments where you are in stitches with Wright's witty sense of humour, and other parts were you are entirely invested in to the characters and their situation. I went to see this movie a second time before reviewing it, and I genuinely only liked it more on another viewing, there is so much I got to see that I missed last time, the amount of Easter eggs and small details are unbelievable. The cast is absolutely perfect, I have no gripes with the casting of each character. Ansel Elgort shines in the lead role, being a very mute lead character with a minimal amount of lines, a lot of his performance relies on his eyes and facial expressions, and he does so in a way that makes it seem like it is in no way challenging. Lily James is charming and layered as Debora, Kevin Spacey brings so much subtlety, nuisance acting as Doc, whose dialogue with Baby is one of the movie's highlights. Jamie Foxx is likable in the worse possible ways as Bats, Elza González is sweet and cool as Darling and CJ Jones steals every scene he is in as Joseph, a character we can do nothing but care for. The breakout performance, for me, was Jon Hamm as Buddy, he has so much built in rage and it is clear that there is so much more to this character beyond what we see in the movie. Hamm's characterisation is perfect, and he strides through this characters complicated arch, delivering my favourite performance of any Wright film to date. A thrill ride from start to finish, with flawless character development and a toe tapping soundtrack, I am sure future movies will try to mimic it, but there is really nothing else like it. Funny, well acted and beautifully directed, I am genuinely excited about seeing this movie again, it has reinvigorated my passion for film that can sometimes be taken away from me with all the mediocrity that comes out these days, but Baby Driver reminds me why I love movies so much, when they take you on a journey and when its over, you just sit there in awe of what you have just experienced, and would not change any of it for the world, highly recommend to all moviegoers, not one to be missed.

47,inkblot11,"Pedal to the metal ! Fantastic ride, great cast, superior soundtrack",8,15 July 2017,"Baby (Ansel Elgort) has a tragic history, His mother and father were killed in a traffic accident when he was about ten and, as a teen, he once stole with Doc's (Kevin Spacey) fancy auto with a big pile of cash inside. This made him in deep debt to the older man, who is a criminal gang leader. Thus, Baby now drives the getaway car on the gang's many heists in and around Atlanta. The young driver is enormously gifted behind the wheel, earning the grudging admiration of fellow gangsters Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eisa Gonzalez), and Bats (Jamie Foxx) among others. Doc says its ""one more ride"" and the debt will be paid. Baby is elated, especially when meets beautiful waitress Debora (Lily James) in a rundown diner. Also happy is Baby's aging foster father (CJ Jones), a deaf man who has longed for Baby to get away from crime. Yet, once Baby has been freed, gets a job for Goodfellas pizza and makes plans to take Lily away, Doc comes blackmailing Baby into one more job. Its a theft of a post office and things go wrong almost from the start. Needing fresh guns, Bats, Buddy and Darling go to a junkyard to pick them up from Butcher (Paul Williams, what fun), where things go terribly awry. Now, Baby may have to battle foes and pseudo-friends alike to stay alive. Can Baby and Debora drive into the bright sunset? This fantastic film is a bit rough, yes, for some folks. There's no sexual situations but there is some fairly bloody violence. It is rated R, after all. But, the tale is so enormously entertaining that its hard NOT to hitch a thrill ride. The cast is likewise wonderful, with Elgort a darling as Baby and Hamm, Gonzalez, Foxx, Spacey, James, Jones, and everyone doing great work. What a treat, too, to see Altanta in the rearview, with the camera turned to beautiful and seedy spaces. As mentioned, the script is glorious and the direction, both by Edgar Wright, is light-speed action. Most importantly, the eclectic soundtrack is one of the best ever.

49,Bored_Dragon,"""Easter Eggs"" feast",7,20 January 2018,"I usually avoid trailers, spoilers, reviews and any stories about movies I have not seen, and when I finally sit down to watch a movie, I do not know almost anything about them. But there was so much hype about this one that even I, who live under the stone, did not manage to avoid being dragged into it. Whether the movie is overrated or the hype has raised my expectations to an unrealistically high level, I'm not sure, but it didn't leave any particular impression on me. So far I saw ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" which I liked, but saw it so long ago that I shouldn't rate it from this perspective, and ""Shaun of the Dead"" whom I gave seven a few days ago. As ""Shaun of the Dead"" is fresh in my memory, I immediately recognized the same director in ""Baby Driver"" (until that moment I did not know the director for either of these two films).Wright is great screenwriter and director, but in ""Baby Driver"" he really made a step forward. I can't remember when I watched such a masterfully directed action. Gunshots and movements of characters in the film are in line with the rhythm of the music that is heard at the moment. And when you take into account that all the driving in the movie was shot without CGI even ten out of ten is not enough. I am also amazed by Wright's sense for details and quantity of ""Easter eggs"" hidden in this film. When Baby is flipping through the channels on TV, several lines of dialogue from different movies can be heard. Each one of these lines appears later in the film as a line of dialogue. In the first scene, when Baby goes for a coffee and listens to ""Harlem Shuffle"", he passes by the graffiti, signs, and posters that show the text of this song. In this scene, you can also see the reflection of Wright in the shop window. It's shot by accident but left in the movie on purpose. It instantly reminded me of Hitchcock. There are several references to ""Back to the Future"" too. One of the cars in the movie has a license plate that represents the date when Wright's previous film came out. Singer whose song is played during the first robbery plays guard. While listening to ""Radar Love"" song, Baby drives a car painted in ""Radar Purple"". There are countless details like these and even if you watch the movie a dozen times you won't even catch a half.Still, no matter how directing, soundtrack and sense of detail are perfect, in other aspects, this film is nothing special. Acting is good but, in my opinion, wasted on unoriginal characters. The story is mediocre and the atmosphere of the movie didn't move me. It was fun to watch but I forgot most of it very next day. I may watch it again, but only because I'm curious to try and find some more eggs that I missed the first time. Overall impression7/10",Baby Driver
50,851222,Fresh and original take on the heist movie,9,1 October 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Baby Driver"" (2017) does not have an original nor very fresh plot, but its the execution that makes this movie really work. While writing by Edgar Wright here and there wasn't very involving (but nevertheless very good overall), its directing were he truly shined with this movie. This film is heavily stylized, with superb music soundtrack. Music was very important to ""Baby Driver"" and they superbly implemented good songs into it. Acting here by everyone was solid, although no awards for acting will shine in here. And then there are few chase sequences - done so good! The first chase sequence simply puts to shame every Fast and Furious movie in this decade. Overall, ""Baby Driver"" is a really good and fresh take on heist movies. While the plot isn't original, this sometimes very bold movie created situations like I've not seen in some time. Good movie overall.",Baby Driver
51,atlasmb,Nobody Catches Baby In A Corner,8,27 July 2017,"This film, which feels like it relies on the Tarantino playbook, is a fun romp with plenty of style.Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a baby-faced driver who can make any car turn on a dime or cut any corner. But there is much more to his story. As ""Baby Driver"" unfolds, we discover the source of his basic unhappiness and the dreams and memories that plague and inspire him.This heist film, written and directed by Edgar Williams, has many enjoyable scenes. In all of them, Williams has fun with the camera, fun with the stunts and fun with the dialogue. It might bother some viewers that every scene feels choreographed to such a degree, including the shootouts, but Hitchcock and Tarantino also worked with such painstaking attention to detail. Choreography requires music, and ""Baby Driver"" has an extensive soundtrack that magnifies the fun. Crank the volume up for maximum effect.Co-stars Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Lily James, Jon Hamm, and Eiza Gonzalez provide color and contrast to Baby's character, who is understated and subdued despite his vehicular antics.This is a fun ride.

52,ironhorse_iv,"It's time to face the music! Was Baby Driver, any good? It was alright for the most part. Worth the trip, seeing.",8,5 August 2017,"Although, sadly, this movie about a young, getaway driver, Baby (Ansel Elgort) trying to escape a life of crime, was not as well-written and put together, as director Edgar Wright's other films, were, like the comedic, 'Three Flavors Cornetto film' trilogy of 2004's 'Shaun of the Dead', 2007's 'Hot Fuzz', & 2013's 'At the World's End'. Without spoiling the movie, here's some reasons, why this film doesn't live up to those standards. First off, the poor-written script, had too many jarring dead end, plot-holes & an off-tinted timeline. Action scenes like the unexplained action with the vet, and the shoot-out, while purchasing illegal arms, seem a little forced. It kinda hurts, the pacing. Other scenes like the odd way, they introduce a 2001 model of IPOD in a 1980s setting & the short use of 1950s black & white footage for the climatic fantasy dream-like setting comes off as bizarre and surreal. Yes, it could be, said that Baby sees, his world as a series of snippets similar to channel surfing on the televisions, like how he parrots, dialogue lifted from what he sees on the boob tube, but I felt that, the movie doesn't explained it, well, through the use of other characters, to justified that. As much as I love the acting for everybody, especially, Jon Hamm & Jamie Fox & Kevin Spacey as part of Baby's crew. Exposition is just awkwardly introduction, throughout the movie. With sentences being spill out, that doesn't seem natural in human language. A good example of that, is most of the diner scenes. Also, it seems to me, the some of the actors, like Jon Bernthal & Flea were a bit wasted, in roles that were so limited. Wright really could had, add much more for them in the script, because, they come and go, without much explanation. Another thing, I notice, is that part of the script was written when Wright first conceived the story in 1994, such as the mention of Baby's backstory with 'Spirit of 1985' dialogue, the flashbacks with his parents & Baby love of tape recorder. Yet, other parts, seem to be, rewritten much later, including the use of IPODS, & certain cars. Because of this, the movie makes Baby seems way older than he supposed to be. Not only that, but it come off as confusing and somewhat dated, at times, despite having a modern day settling. It just doesn't mixed well. Don't get me wrong, I still do like, the carefully crafted fun in sync diegetic cinemograph style of filmmaking & the eclectic taste in music, such in the long pan shots with songs like 'the Harlem Shuffle' by Bob & Earl or the quick editing shoot-out sequence with 'Tequila' by the Button-Down Bass. However, there were parts of the movie that could had been taking more seriously, with the music choice, like 'Easy' by the Commodores and Queen's 'Compton Rock' to make, more of a connection with some of the supporting characters with Baby. Instead, it comes off, as soft spoken & kinda gimmicky. It didn't help fleshed out the characters, as much as it should had. A good example is the love sequences with Debora (Lily James), the waitress. Does she really have, no life, besides, becoming an accomplice to a criminal, she only met, a few days earlier!? Don't get me wrong, Lily James is a fine actress, and she did the best, she was given, but her character seems to be, only there to serve as a one-dimensional, manic pixie girl, and nothing more. Are we really supposed to believe, that awkward quiet guy with barely any charisma, somehow won her heart, just by, secretly, recording her voice!? Honestly, in the real-world, actions like that, would creep, sane women, the f-out! Also, films like 2011's 'Drive' told similar love story, better and a more realistic tone. Plus, I would, rather have the bittersweet ending to 'Drive', than the cop-out, cheesy & impracticable happy ending to this film. The two of them, barely had any chemistry at all. Also, I hate the idea, that finding a love-one, is the only reason to get, out of crime is a lame excuse. You would think, that the moral grounds, would be, strong enough to quit, but I guess, not. Things like that, are just overplayed. Plus, 2010's 'The Town' told that subplot, a lot better, than this film. Despite that, I thought, Ansel Elgort was alright in what he was given, even if some the coolness factor is lost because how much the titular character is essentially lifted from 1978's 'The Driver'. Baby is not as original as critics, make the character, out to be. I guess, if you're going to steal. Steal from the best. However, the worst thing about Baby, is how much, a Marty Stu, he was. OK, I get that, he would be, great in, editing music & using sign language, but parkouring? Where, did he learn that, while, driving, most of his life!? Don't get me wrong, those action scenes where he was running, were amazing, but it did, take me, out of the movie. Honestly, in general, I felt like, the action scene were, a little too outlandish. It basically mirrors, the Fast & the Furious franchise, in how silly, parts of it, were. Still, I love the fact that, little to no CGI or green screen used to film the car chase sequences. The driving is all practically done. Nevertheless, the car scenes in this movie, were not as tight and grounded, as I wanted it to be. Still, I did dig the little comedy, those action scenes in 'Baby Driver', had. Made me, want to witness Wright's 2003 Mint Royale's ""Blue Song' music video, to see, what the differences were and where the cameos from Nick Frost & Walter Hill were. Overall: Even with its flaws, this movie was truly, mostly a super-charged & Adrenaline-Fueled fun flick. It's worth checking out. Highly recommended.",Baby Driver
53,nairtejas,Capsule Review: Baby Driver,2,22 January 2018,"If there's one thing that Baby Driver gets right then it is the soundtrack, but this is no Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 where the soundtrack was relevant and enhanced the film's appeal. Here, the tracks are played randomly with the hope that just because they are catchy, upbeat, or generally hummable, they will have the audience hooked. Director and writer Edgar Wright carves a story that has no character background or development and depends on second-hand car chase sequences and cringe-worthy dialogues to keep his characters occupied. Chocolate boy Ansel Elgort plays the young and stylish version of the Transporter where he drives armed gangs to and from heist locations. With few stupid idiosyncratic reservations of his own just so to make himself look smart, he further annoys his audience with unmotivated actions and gets absorbed into a gummy romance written without an iota of imagination. You are to believe that his constant exposure to random music helps him maneuver cars better for there is no explanation as to how this taciturn kid with parental issues learned driving like a knife of butter. There's a hint somewhere, but of course Wright didn't think it was enough for an informed audience. He's a good kid, some of his characters say of him sometime in the film, but they miss the part about how irritating he is. Almost every other character has shades of absurdity that doesn't gel well with whatever the story is all about. Throwing Easter eggs about other popular heist movies does not and will not make a movie better. It at least has to have remarkable car chase sequences, witty dialogues, and a strong and substantial plot, none of which this film excels in. And the final 10 minutes are the worst I have seen all year. Baby Driver is a fast-paced drivel that can make even lovable actors like Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx look poor in retrospect. I watched this after the news story about Kevin Spacey came out, and yes, it did negatively impact my experience. But Baby Driver has bigger issues. TN.",Baby Driver
54,The-Sarkologist,A Different Direction for Wright,6,15 July 2017,"There seems to be a lot of praise for this film, but in my mind while it was fun, it wasn't anything all that out of the ordinary. I guess it has more to do with Edgar Wright than anything else, though I should mention that it is nothing like the Cornetto Trilogy, nor do the main actors from those films make an appearance. In fact, it seems that the only actor that is well known is Kevin Spacey, who plays what is in effect a pretty hardened crime boss, though I'm somewhat surprised that he lasted as long as he did when the heist that takes the centrepiece of this film goes completely pearshaped.The film is about a getaway driver named baby, namely because he has a baby face (though a couple of scars suggest that he has gotten into his fair share of fights). As a driver he is second to none, and much of the film has him attempting to not only get away from the cops, but also getting away from some rather nasty enemies. However, it is also a romance of sorts, where he meets a lovely lady at a diner and they fall in love, though of course there is always the problem of his career.The thing is that Baby made the mistake of stealing the wrong thing from the wrong person. However, instead of getting even, he was given a job, even if it was to simply pay back what is owed. The problem with crime is that once you are in, it is very hard to get out, especially if you happen to be really good at what you do (and in Baby's case it is driving cars). The other thing about heists is that it is always just one last heist, but the problem is that the last heist never ends up being the last heist because there is always another one just around the corner.So, I guess this is a film about a young man, a baby even, who while he has been caught up in the criminal underworld, it still at that stage where he can make the right choice. The thing is that there are limits to what he is willing to do, and it is clear that we wants out. He is a good kid with a kind heart, it is just that he has been caught up with the wrong crowd. Actually, growing up an orphan does create that problem, though it is also clear that he has a loving step dad as well. It is an interesting contrast to those around him, who are all scarred, and rough, and beaten. Baby only has a couple of scars, which suggests that there is still time for him, but in the end it all comes down to the choices that he must make.",Baby Driver
55,UniqueParticle,Absolutely love this whole movie!,10,23 December 2019,"I originally saw in the theater which was so great ever since I've loved Baby Driver! The soundtrack throughout is so exciting and the driving is exhilaratingly well done; I'm so glad I own in 4K plus it's available on showtime at the moment.

56,Reno-Rangan,Don't mess with this Baby!,8,4 January 2018,"One of the stylish film of the year. There's nothing special about the story, but the way it was made looks intriguing. The individual characters, music, stunts, obviously car chases. Not the best role Ansel Elgort has ever played, but in his short, beginning of the career, it quite possibly defines he's ready for the tough roles. Then the British filmmaker known for some wonderful action-comedies, one more addition to his hit kit.A youngster who is a getaway car driver for heists, working under a criminal mastermind, is often teamed with a different crew. One of his latest job takes an unexpected twist, leaving his yet to bloom romance with a waitress in peril. His attempt to come out of that, the risk he takes, changes his life forever. The tale ends with an action packed finale.This is the first Kevin Spacey film I'm seeing after all the allegation against him. I blame everyone equally who had let him do it all these years. But that's nothing to do with this film. He was fine as an actor as always. It's just fine to be as one-off film, but the way everything had happened looked like it could have been a great franchise. As of latest news, it is on. The sad part is, all the good characters won't return. Anyway, it is one of the must see from the year T17.8/10",Baby Driver
57,paulclaassen,"Good, but nothing special.",5,20 June 2018,"The chemistry between Ansel Elgort and Lily James is really great. Ansel is perfectly cast as Baby, and Kevin Spacey was excellent as per usual. A premise that's been done a zillion times before is taken to another level thanks to the movie being shot with incredible flair, and great dialogue. The action scenes were nothing to write home about compared to today's action films, but they were simple and effective and above all very realistic. As with most gangs, their plans go haywire towards the end as they all fall apart, and this was wonderfully done. There were no silly, slapstick humor which normally accompanies films of this genre and that was refreshing.",Baby Driver
58,sol-,Driven,7,5 November 2017,"Hoping to settle a debt with a crime boss, an orphaned young man works as a getaway driver, but severing ties with the crime boss when his debt is paid off proves challenging in this violent comedy thriller from Edgar Wright. The basic plot of 'Baby Driver' is hardly new or original and the romantic subplot that develops could have done with more work, but the film is still frequently engaging due to Wright's brisk pacing of the material and constant incorporation of iconic songs. The protagonist suffers from tinnitus (and listens to music as often as possible to drown out the noises in his ears) and Wright uses this plot point as a launching pad to make his film about the connection that we as individuals tend to feel between music and action. In one of the most interesting scenes, the protagonist delays a quick getaway in a stolen car while finding music with the right beat for his mood. This could perhaps be chalked up to obsessive compulsiveness, but with side scenes in which he records and mixes voices, creating his own music, the film makes it very clear how much he adores music. Add in some impressively choreographed on-foot chases (as well as car chases) and this is a riveting little movie. It may not have anything particularly enlightening to say about crime and the difficulties of turning over a new leaf, but there is at least nary a dull moment to be had.",Baby Driver
59,tomgillespie2002,A true craftsman at work,10,22 September 2017,"It feels like decades have passed since British writer/director Edgar Wright pulled away from Marvel's Ant-Man, apparently in fear of the studio's insistence on having the action take place within their Cinematic Universe and jeopardising his singular vision in the process. And it feels even longer since the underwhelming closure to the 'Cornetto Trilogy', 2013's The World's End, graced the big screen. But Wright has clearly been making the most of his spare time, finally completing the script for a movie that has been clattering around his head for over 20 years (he had the idea back in 1994). Drawing inspiration from a line in Simon & Garfunkel's song Baby Driver (""They call me baby driver, and once upon a pair of wheels,"" and a collection of his favourite petrol-head movies, he has delivered what is by far his most accomplished work to date.Shortly before the release of Baby Driver, Wright hosted a film festival entitled 'Car Car Land' - a collection of his favourite car chase movies, featuring everything from William Friedkin's The French Connection to Walter Hill's The Driver. It has been quite rightly said that great cinematic action feels like a dance - elegant, brutal, and pieced together with delicate invention and skill. It is fitting that Wright named his festival after one of the finest musicals of recent times, La La Land. He has also taken this theory quite literally with Baby Driver, a movie as much at home with dazzling musical numbers as it is with high-speed pursuits and gun-fire, combining them beautifully without a hint of smugness. Our hero the getaway driver times his entire life to the beat ever- blasting into his ears from his loaded collection of iPods. A menial task such as making a sandwich becomes a toe-tapping dance number.His name is Baby (""B-A-B-Y, Baby,"" as he confirms to practically everybody he meets), and his hipster blend of skinny jeans and sunglasses may have been grating without Ansel Elgort. Like Channing Tatum, his physicality and grace prevents you from taking your eyes off him once he starts to move, and cinematographer Bill Pope make sure to capture these moments in all their glory (including one terrific tracking shot at the start). Baby needs his music to block out the tinnitus constantly ringing in his ears, but also to remind him of the music-loving mother he lost in the very accident that caused his affliction. His short life has been spent in the debt of gangster Doc (Kevin Spacey), who employs the youngster's superhuman skills behind the wheel as a getaway driver for his ever-changing roster of low-life bank robbers. Each of them eye Baby with both curiosity and suspicion, when all he wants to do is pay off what he owes and leave town with adorable waitress Debora (Lily James). But one last job is never one last job.Opening with a bank job that will leave you stunned at both the editing and choreography (no CGI is used), there's an early sense that Wight may have blown his load too early. But this only kicks off two hours in the hands of a craftsman who truly understand the mechanics of cinema. Not just action cinema, but musical and dramatic, and the film offers its fair share of belly laughs too. It's as much of an exaggerated world as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, but contains itself in its own little world. The characters are larger-than-life but tangible, incredibly brought to life by the likes of Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonzalez and Jon Bernthal. There's an almost ever-present soundtrack, with the characters speaking and moving in sync with the rhythm, which lend the film a unique energy. When the music stops and the soundtrack screeches to reflect Baby's tinnitus, we long to be thrown straight back into Wright's fantasy world. The car chases, the love story, the testosterone-fuelled exchanges - there's nothing new here, but Edgar Wright knows this. Baby Driver is so swaggeringly confident and stylishly hypnotic that it becomes a genre film like no other, causing most other action movies to hang their heads in shame.",Baby Driver
60,Thanos_Alfie,Crazy driver...,6,5 October 2018,"""Baby Driver"" is an Action Crime movie in which we watch a very good driver, Baby, working for a group of people who are robbers. This driver has one of the most important roles of this team because he is simply unstoppable while he is driving and he can get away from anyone he wants to. Following the plan of his boss, Doc, he seems to enjoy it but he wants to leave from all of this. But Doc has a different plan for him due to the fact that Baby is very good at his job and when he tries to get away from this kind of life finds himself and everything he cares for in terrible danger.I liked this movie because it had a good and a very different plot from the other action movies with robbers and drivers. I also have to admit that it combined very well and with a very clever way comedy and drama scenes in order not to make this movie clearly a drama movie but to relieve any tension that might be grown on that scenes. Ansel Elgort who played as Baby was simply outstanding on the role of the driver, I also liked the interpretation of Lily James who played as Debora and Kevin Spacey who played as Doc. The interpretation of Kevin Spacey reminded me his interpretation of the movie ""21"" of 2008 with Jim Sturgess which I also enjoyed it. The direction of Edgar Wright was an average one but I think that a few more flashbacks or some extended memories of Baby or even some plot twists were needed. In addition to this I have to say that another thing that I did not like, it was some scenes which were not so realistic such us one of the final scenes with Kevin Spacey.To sum up I believe that ""Baby Driver"" is a good movie to watch and I am sure that you are going to have a good time. It has an interesting plot with some very good interpretations. I recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it.",Baby Driver
61,cruise01,"Baby Baby Driver is fun, action packed, and all style with its music choices.",10,29 June 2017,"Baby Driver is pure fun and awesome. Car chases, bank robberies, and a driver that uses music cues to help him focus. The movie works as a musical with a variety of classic artists and it all worked perfectly in their own way. Edgar Wright direction is stylized and fast paced. There is plenty to love about the movie. If you love action, it has it. If you love car chases, you have it. If you love music, it has some great choices. If you also love a bit of romance, it has a bit of a love story. The plot follows Baby (Ansel Elgort) a getaway driver that relies on music that he makes with his own personal playlists, even he mixes sound from recordings. After an accident he was involved in with his parents that caused him to have tinnitus. He uses the music to block out the ringing in his ears. He is a getaway driver for a mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey). He owes him two bank robbery jobs and he is out from the criminal organization. He meets a lovely waitress Debora (Lily James), who also wants to run away to travel. Baby is forced to do one big last job with a team of a psychopath Bats (Jamie Foxx), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and Jason (Jon Hamm). The plot was fast paced and great. About a young man who knows whats right and wrong. But wants to seek for a better life. He is conflicted with living life in the fast lane and being a professional driver. His character is awkward, he is shy, and he keeps to himself. He does express the music he listens too. Either by lip singing or dancing into a musical as he walks to a café. But when he is behind the wheel, he is unstoppable. The action and car chases are exciting and plenty throughout. Edgar Wright relied on practical realistic stunts than cgi which is always the best. Feel like the car chases were more alive and thrilling than the film Drive. The direction gets serious when Baby is wanting a way out but is forced into this world. While he wants to go far away and live his life and fall in love with Debora. He tries to protect Debora from knowing whom he works for and keeping his team from knowing who she is. This is one of Ansel Elgort better performances and I really hope to see him do more serious roles like this. Lily James is beautiful and stunning, she plays her character well as his love interest. Jon Bernthal as the brute player in the gang. Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzalez as a couple, and psychotic when something makes them unhappy. Jamie Foxx playing the tempered gangster were anything can happen that will set off his mood swings. The soundtrack in the movie was spot on great. It worked with every scene and sequence. Mainly, relying on some of the greatest classic bands. Overall, Baby Driver is an awesome action film. The cast was great. The action and car chases were loud and exciting and plenty throughout. The plot was great about a getaway driver wanting to seek for a better life and falling in love with a girl that is turning his life direction around. The direction and script was fast paced and pure style.",Baby Driver

Also, Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey have similar roles to the ones in Horrible Bosses, but that does not make it any less fun., as they do make the film better.

63,eddie_baggins,Wright goes next level of hip with Baby Driver,8,13 July 2017,"Baby Driver is a cool film, you'll become aware of this from the first minute of screen time and Baby Driver is certainly aware of it too.Edgar Wright's first American film oozes a cocksure arrogance (need proof, go back and re-watch the first 10 minutes), as it goes about telling the story of Ansel Elgort's tinnitus suffering getaway driver Baby, whose like the octane fuelled love child of Colin McRae, Dominic Toretto and Steve McQueen for good measure.It's rare to see a filmmaker so assured of themselves and Wright's humble beginnings that took shape as we now know them with two best mates stuck in a pub as zombies took over their city, have evolved and taken shape too allow the wunderkind to make Baby Driver not only a heist thriller, but one that confidently mixes in the most unlikely musical cues and comedic undercurrents in a fast paced, snappily edited and self-aware tribute too car lead action classics of yesteryear.It's unlikely that we'll see a more whip smart Hollywood event this year of a film that's more proficiently edited together scene to scene or in a sound editing sense and when Baby Driver is rocketing along at full speed, there's barely a chance to take a breather as Baby's dealings with Kevin Spacey's criminal kingpin Doc and crew members like Jamie Foxx's demented Bats and Jon Hamm's Buddy get more dangerous and Baby's feelings for Lilly James's humble diner worker Debora start taking hold.Wright really does create an often thrilling ride, but all the screeching tyres, smartly tuned edits that fall in place to an even hipper soundtrack and wink wink type dialogue, can't help mask the fact that Baby Driver's earnt smugness and quick-fire pacing culminates in a rather so-so finale and that the films frequently masking a fact that Baby himself isn't exactly the most amazing of protagonists and his almost instantaneous courtship with Debora doesn't click as it perhaps should've.It may seem like nit-picking towards a film that achieves its goals of providing a near endlessly on the go narrative and frequently heart pounding car chases but with Wright so assuredly going about his business, he has set the bar high for judgements and made his films flaws or the more glaring for it.It's brave of Wright to centre a film of this nature around such an against the rule book main character, usually reserved for macho tough guys or arrogant handsome devils, and Elgort's Baby is anything but the usual, but it doesn't make him the most likable of guys.Making more than a few questionable character decisions and sometimes being too quiet for his own good, Baby is often too cold of a presence to make us truly care for his plight too escape a world in which he has fallen into and doesn't belong to, no amount of haphazardly done flashbacks will change that fact and it's hard to see why Collin's likable Debora would take such an instantaneous liking to a such a character.With Baby not always winning us over, Wright does find some fun and Hamm-y (sorry Jon) turns from his supports with Kevin Spacey in particular stealing the show as the curiously likable and sometimes detestable Doc. With Spacey on top form his ably supported by Jamie Foxx who is clearly relishing the chance to go all out as loose cannon Bats and Hamm makes his mark early as smooth criminal Buddy, before a final act stanza turns his performance into an over the top Terminator-light caricature, full of big eyes and a lust for blood that just doesn't feel like scenario that was full developed or earnt.Final Say – At the end of the day there's little point denying that Baby Driver is a rip-roaring crowd pleaser and your likely new favourite film, filled with dazzling car chases, fun over the top performances and Wright's trademark dialogue smarts, but with the film already being labelled an instant classic by many, one can't getaway from the feeling that Baby Driver's reputation is already racing ahead of itself.4 homeless James Bond's out of 5",Baby Driver
64,leonblackwood,"Great action, music and plot.",8,14 January 2018,"Review:
I was quite surprised with this film, because of it's unique use of music, great car action and intense storyline but the tempo does drop in the middle, due to the love story. Once the fast action kicks back in, and the ""Tarantino like"" plot gets more intense towards the end, you do end up on the edge of your seat, and the unpredictable plot throws in more surprises. The film is based around a getaway driver, Baby (Ansel Elgort), who does various jobs for a criminal mastermind, Doc (Kevin Spacey), to pay of a debt to him. As doc doesn't use the same work force twice, Baby is forced to work with different criminals to rob various places but his heart really isn't in it. Baby lives with his foster father, Joseph (CJ Jones) who can't hear or speak, and he also has tinnitus, due to a car accident when he was small, which is why he constantly listens to music. After finally paying his debt to Doc, Baby meets Debora (Lily James) in a diner, and he instantly falls in love with her. They go on a few dates and they plan there future together but Doc wants Baby to do one last job, which will pay out loads of money. Baby reluctantly takes on the job but it all goes wrong, due to Babies conscious, and most of the gang are murdered. One of the surviving gang, Buddy (Jon Hamm) seeks revenge for his wife's murder during the heist, so with the cops on his tail, Baby and Debora run for there lives, with nowhere to turn. The director chose the perfect cast for this movie, especially Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx who played ""the baddies"" well, and I also was shocked with Jon Hamm because he usually plays dashing roles. The stunts were great, along with the pumping soundtrack, and the character building throughout the film gave it some depth. One of the things that stood out for me, was the fact that the cast was doing things to the beat, which was cleverly done, so I will definitely say that it's worth a watch because there is something for everyone. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Edgar Wright, 43, who also brought you Shaun of the Dead, Grindhouse, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim and the World's End. With such an amazing filmography, he was the perfect choice for this film, and judging by the box office profits, this is another smash hit that he can add to his list. As a big fan of Scott Pilgrim, which also had a great soundtrack, he certainly is a unique director who doesn't shy away from trying something new, which is why this was a surprise hit in 2017. Ansel Elgort, 23, starred in the Divergent franchise, Carrie and the brilliant the Fault In Our Stars, so he must be happy with the direction his career is going in so far but I still feel that there is a more to come from him.

65,matthewssilverhammer,The Coolest Thing This Side of Tarantino,9,7 July 2017,"Earlier this year, the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel dropped, and along with it another ""Awesome Mix"" soundtrack of 70s classics. Regardless of how you felt about that movie or soundtrack (which I liked), there is little doubt that Baby Driver will effectively side-swipe it. You may be wondering why I'm starting a FILM review by talking about the music. That's because Wright (Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim) has essentially made the greatest narrative music video ever made in this precisely edited and incredibly shot homage to MTV and 70s exploitation. Filled with old iPods, random sing-alongs and musically rhythmic gunfights, it's the coolest thing this side of Tarantino, with Wright's brainy charms seeping from every pore. Elgort plays Baby, a criminal getaway driver with otherworldly abilities behind the wheel. However, Baby has a consistent humming in his ear, and he uses (very specific) songs to drown out the noise and soundtrack his life. Because we spend basically every minute with him, the movie eschews the actual action in favor of patient tension through Baby's seemingly endless playlist of left-of-the-dial bangers. It's brilliant and effective and just-plain-fun. When we do get action, it's some of the most balls-to-the-wall packed goodness since Fury Road, with a climax that is breathtakingly intense. It's a crying shame this won't be seen as widely as other inferior car / action movies from this year (Cars, Furious), as it's as undoubtedly better, while also as widely entertaining. So do yourself a favor: find a big screen with a killer sound system, and enjoy this high-speed, sports-car-cool gem that will prove to be one of the best pure movie-going experiences you'll have all year.",Baby Driver
66,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A creative, totally unique joyride made out of an otherwise ordinary heist flick",8,10 October 2017,"Edgar Wright's concept heist flick ""Baby Driver"" shows that in the right hands, a single idea can be fleshed out into a single good movie. Anyone could have thought to fuse music and action to a choreographed extreme, but Wright's aptitude for gleeful style and good storytelling instincts give ""Baby Driver"" some serious wheels.Although the key to the entire film's entertainment value is the way it brings action and an eclectic decade-spanning track list together into unique harmony, the story of a young man named Baby (Ansel Elgort) caught up in the life of a getaway driver and inching closer to the tipping point of needing to escape proves surprisingly adequate. Wright builds Baby not with so much backstory but with an array of intriguing personality details — including his tinnitus and reliance on music — that distract us from asking too many questions about how a 20-something white kid ended up in his situation.Baby has become an expert wheelman working for Doc (Kevin Spacey), whose debt he he's supposedly about to pay off. Doc assembles new teams of unpredictable, wild criminals (Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, Eiza Gonzalez, Jamie Foxx and others) for each job, but Baby is his ""lucky charm."" Also motivating Baby to close this chapter in his story is the young diner waitress (Lily James) who catches his eyes and ears.A lot of the elements here would usually result in a run-of-the-mill heist movie, but Wright painstakingly stages and edits key scenes of the film to create a one-of-a-kind experience (I have major regrets about not seeing this one in theaters). He sets that tone early, almost too early — one could argue the film never eclipses its brilliant opening credits sequence set to Bob & Earl's ""Harlem Shuffle."" There are some fun action sequences in which the violent mayhem syncs with the soundtrack, but the movie really luxuriates in creativity during that opening in a way that it can't once the story gets going.The story lacks in originality, but Wright keeps the stakes high. We're invested in Baby and seeing him out of his terrible situation. As seen in his Cornetto Trilogy, he knows how to build a plot that picks up steam as it goes and the final 30 minutes are total mayhem. The ending is its own debate, but Wright succeeds in delivering a conventional, modern action flick in a fresh and timeless way — timeless in that its style and aesthetics are not confined to any one era. Wright just knows how a large percentage of moviegoers like to be mindlessly appeased and continues to waste (in the best way possible) his artistic talents on projects that cater to the pleasure center of our movie-going brains.~Steven CThanks for reading!

68,southdavid,You remind me of the Babe.,6,10 April 2021,"The final film of the Edgar Wright retrospective, for now, is ""Baby Driver"", one that I don't think works consistently enough at the best of times, and now, though not really it's fault, is weighed down by having a couple of stars who are ""problematic"".Baby (Ansel Elgort) is the getaway driver for a professional criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey). Whilst working with various combinations of bank robbers, Baby sets his life to music from a series of MP3 devices he keeps in at all times, to drown out the tinnitus that plagues him. With his time working for Doc coming to an end and with the increasing violence of the robberies playing on his mind, Baby looks to leave town with his new girlfriend Debora (Lily James) but Doc isn't willing to let Baby end their partnership.It's not like there aren't things to admire in ""Baby Driver"". There are a couple of scenes when he editing to music works really well - particularly in the early scene when baby goes to get coffee. There are good performances from Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Eliza Gonzalez. If you can remove the performance from the performer, Kevin Spacey is strong too, with a complicated character. Some of the practical driving stunts are really well done to and are a credit to the team that produces them.The main criticism is that I don't think the cutting to music effect works often enough in the movie - maybe it can't - maybe that just wasn't possible to do it, but if all of the film worked like the scenes when it does, I'd feel a lot more positive about it. I'm also never particularly convinced that Ansel Elgort or Lily James are the right people for their respective roles. I don't see much chemistry between them.I don't hate it, but it's not one I can see me revisiting as often as other films in the director's catalogue. (Now I'll wait to see where the documentary about Sparks ends up).",Baby Driver

70,Vartiainen,The least comedic of Edgar Wright films,7,19 August 2017,"Quite often when a director is said to have a style, it is meant as a derogatory comment. Like that style keeps the director from focusing on supposedly worthier aspects of film. This is often the criticism aimed at Quentin Tarantino, for example. But I don't agree with that. Style is what gives films their identity. It's what you remember when you have forgotten the names of the characters, or the exact twists of the plot, or lines of dialogue. You remember the imagery, the mood, the atmosphere. And in that quite few directors can compete with Edgar Wright.Baby Driver is a great film to watch as an audiovisual experience alone, without even going into the story and the characters at all. Wright experiments with the camera and the shots constantly, giving us some real eye candy and some of the best car chases in decades. The story of course going that Baby (Ansel Elgort) is the hottest getaway driver in town, even with his idiosyncrasies, like listening to music all the time or being something of an oddball socially. Music overall is a huge theme in the movie and many of the scenes are set to actual tracks of music, from Queen to Barry White and from Bob & Earl to Simon & Garfunkel.The acting is also topnotch. Elgort is by far the most untested of the illustrious lot, but he performs beautifully, giving us a lovable main character with quirks and twists. Someone who can veer from crime to justice and make it believable. Kevin Spacey as his main employer is also great casting and the rest of his crew is also littered with great actors and performances.But even with all that this is still nowhere near as good as the Cornetto Trilogy, in my opinion. And I think the reason for that is the fact that this is not as comedic. It's not really a comedy at all, unlike all those three films. It has comedic moments in it, but overall it tries to be a straightforward action blast. The problem with that is that the plot is still so convoluted and bizarre that it kind of needs the be a comedy in order for you to accept it. The film blazes onward with full throttle all the time and the fatigue sets in near the start of the third act. At which point you stop caring. For me personally, the first act was amazing. Great scenes, great chases, great music. The second wasn't as good, but it deepened the characters and set the stakes. But then the third act tries to go out all guns blazing, but aside from Baby, you haven't formed enough of a connection to any of the characters to care.But, let's not think that this means the film is not worth a watch. No, by no means no. It's still an amazing film on many levels. It's simply not as good as some of Wright's other films. But that's a high bar indeed to reach. What Baby Driver has is style in abundance, great main character, great music and the best car chases you've seen in years. What it lacks a little bit is a tighter storyline. But that's it.",Baby Driver
71,lisafordeay,A great film with a deceiving title,7,3 July 2017,"Baby Driver is a 2017 Action Crime film starring The Fault In Our Stars Ansel Elgort,Cinderella's Lily James,Superman Returns star Kevin Spacey and The Amazing Spiderman 2 star Jamie Foxx and tells the tale of a young getaway driver named Baby(Elgort)who works for a crime boss(played by Spacey)and uses Baby's talent to steal stuff and get involved with crime. As one criminal gets killed,Baby ends up working for another bunch of criminals led by Jon Hamm and his on screen girlfriend Eliza Gonzalez and the try and steal a bank. Baby has a condition called Tintitis which is an ear disorder and since his parents died in a car crash years ago Baby uses his Ipod and listens to music which helps him with his companions. But when Baby falls for a Southern waitress named Debora(Lily James) can he protect her and his bad companions from danger.Overall from beginning to end this film is packed with car chasing scenes which were very well done. The chemistry between Ansel and Lily was very good(even though it was funny because all I could think of was Hazel with Augustus in The Fault In Our Stars and Ella with Kit in Cinderella). Kevin Spacey was good as the crime boss and Jon Hamn as the villain(you could say)was very good too. Jamie Foxx was hilarious and everything about the film was excellent.I seen this last night in my local cinema and I was surprised that a lot of girls were at it younger than me(yes im a girl and I love action films depending on what they are I suppose)and a few guys were at it too. The title though does look deceiving because you think its about a baby who drives a car and its more of a comedy title than an action title.

72,paul-allaer,When plot becomes irrelevant: style (and music) over matter,8,1 July 2017,"""Baby Driver"" (2017 release; 113 min.) brings the story of Baby, a getaway driver for bank heists. As the movie opens, the First Bank of Atlanta is robbed, and Baby (while listening to the Jon Spencer Blues explosion) is able to escape from the seemingly endless streams of Atlanta Police cars. They all meet up with Doc, the ring leader who distributes the loot. ""One more job and I'm done"" reminds Baby to Doc (we later learn why Baby ""owes"" Doc). The next day, while grabbing a coffee, is served by a young lady for whom he takes an immediate liking. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from British writer-director Edgar Wright, who most recently gave us the brilliant ""The World's End"". Here he goes in a completely different direction, and instead delivers a highly stylish action movie, paired to a non-stop soundtrack of delightful songs from mostly back in the day. The reality is that the plot, as wafer-thin as it is, really is irrelevant and we move from scene to scene and simply enjoy what is plying out on the big screen. Ansel Elgort (from the 'divergent"" trilogy) plays Baby. Kevin Spacey is in good form as the ringleader Doc. Lily James, as the coffee waitress Debora) continues her upward march (I just saw her last weekend in another movie, ""The Exception""). Flea (from the RHCP) seems to have the time of his life playing Eddie ""No Nose"", one of the robbers. But keep an eye out for Sky Ferreira (yes, the indie music singer) in her role as Baby's mom when he was a little boy. The production, including the car chases and stunts, is top-notch all around. If you like an action movie AND love good music, you could do a lot worse than ""Baby Driver"".""Baby Driver"" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was absolutely PACKED. The buzz around ""Baby Driver"" has been building steadily in recent weeks.""Best movie of the year!"" some are saying. I wouldn't go that far. I enjoyed it for what it was, nothing less, nothing more. If you love action movie and good music, then ""Baby Driver"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Baby Driver
73,subxerogravity,Oh yeah! this was cool!,9,28 June 2017,"Ansel Elgort's attempt to break out of his young adult stereotype. I've seen him in a few of them like The Fault in Our Stars where he plays Shailene Woodley's love interest and The Divergent Series in which he plays Shailene Woodley's—brother, but then, Elgort had a cameo in the young adult movie, Papertowns, and it was one of those things you would not get unless you watched a lot of Young Adult movies, and right there, I knew he was like the Jason Statham of these things or something.Now he's trying to be Statham for real. Statham himself was known prior, but he did not become a leading action hero until he did the Transporter, where he played a man who would drive you anywhere no matter what for the right price. In Baby Driver, Elgort plays a gateway diver more specifically. He works (without a choice) for a man named doc, played by Kevin Spacey, as the important part of his four man armed robbery crews. To make the character of baby (or to make Elgort himself) more interesting, the car accident that killed his parents when he was young also left a ringing in his ear that he needs to drown out using the ancient iPod 3 (I think), to play music that allows him to focus and be a masterful driver. Honestly, the whole fact that Baby has this strangeness in personality seems cliché to these types of films, but director Edgar Wright allows it to—drive the whole style of the movie, and I do mean style. One of the more stylish movies I seen in a while, I love how the music is steering the format of the film. They do this cool thing in which they match up the sound effects with the rhythm of the musical score. It's brilliant, not too music video like but just enough to see the influence.Plus, baby's strangeness becomes interesting bather for the all-star ensemble cast, which includes Jon Bernthal and Jamie Fox, who both play very dangerous men who do not trust Baby because of his quirky behavior, and the fact that he seems too much like a good egg to be in this game (Most likely it's also the face that would get him a lot of unwanted attention in prison). Jon Hamm is also in the film as a criminal whose contempt with Baby just getting the job done.Adding to the style and musical connection is Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers who has a small role in the film. I totally love it when he just pops up in on a film. Baby driver is a pretty complete action movie with some great car driving and some cool chases. Very sleek and kinetic thanks to its energetic all-star cast. Definitely an Edger Wright film worth taking a look at (And I thought that would only be the case if Simon Pegg and Nick Frost where in it)http://cinemagardens.com",Baby Driver
74,jtindahouse,"Stylish, charming and fun but not naturally so",7,13 January 2018,"I've always liked Edgar Wright's films without loving them. They're always stylish and fun but also lacking something for my liking. 'Baby Driver' is no different. No one could argue just how stylish this film is. It oozes charisma and charm just from this alone. Then there's the tremendous cast and the spectacular performances Wright gets out of them. Kevin Spacey, in what may turn out to have been one of his final roles, was his usual superb self. Ansel Elgort has even been nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. Jamie Foxx is also one of my favourite actors working today. The charm that man possesses is almost second to none.What held me back from loving this film though (and most of Wright's films I suspect) is that they sometimes feel like they're trying too hard. I often compare them to Quentin Tarantino's films. Both make quite different films but have a similar method at the same time. In Tarantino's films the style and charm he manages to achieve seem so natural and like there was no other way that scene could have gone down. With Wright's films it feels the opposite. It feels like they achieve it, but far from naturally. I also had trouble buying the love story in this film. I think a little more effort could have been put into making sure the audience understood why he loved this woman so much. Definitely a fun watch, make no mistake about that. Even bordering on a must-see film, but it's still far from perfect.",Baby Driver

American film, which, as usual in recent years, abounds in retro American music hits. This time, I appreciated the musical taste of the one who chose the songs, because they are European, both Dutch productions, Radar Love by Golden Earring, and Hocus Pocus by Focus, two of the greatest rock groups ever. About the film: it's a good entertaining action movie, containing also a special kind of love story. Ansel Elgort is OK. Jon Hamm is very efficient. Eiza González is efficient too and beautiful. Kevin Spacey, charming as usual but much fatter than usual. Jamie Foxx is better and better, great personality, in my humble opinion, greater than Denzel Washington and Sidney Poitier and other black actors. Last but not least, I think I'm in love! With Lily James. She's so sweet! And good Actress! So fresh, beautiful eyes, what a smile! I hardly wait to see her in big big roles, in great great movies...

Baby is a getaway driver who suffers from a hearing problem and must constantly listen to music through an IPOD to distract the ringing in his ears. It opens with a bank robbery and police chase as Baby manages to lose the law in a Subaru STI. They picked the right car, as I had the opportunity to drive one a few years ago and was a blast. I only had it up to 115 MPH. Newcomer Ansel Elgort is excellent in the lead role and the supporting cast, including an uncredited Jamie Foxx are very good. The chase scenes are typical Hollywood stuff, but the script has plenty of humor, with Kevin Spacey given the best lines as a ruthless crime boss. So far it has not been a good year, but this film is on my early 10 best list along with Get Out, Wind River and War for the Planet of the Apes. I hope for more to add in the last two months of 2017.",Baby Driver

Will Baby get out the heist business, or is he forever in there hands? Edgar Wright really shines here as a director, lightens up the moments with the music. Ansel Elgort comes into his own has Baby, never gets out shined by the rest of the cast, he plays Baby has clever but not quite sophisticated. Kevin Spacey is good has the crime boss, who really sells the fear with a cold eye stare. Jon Hamm is great as thief who befriends Baby. Jamie Foxx steals some scenes has Bats, a devil may care sociopath thief, who is so good at being hated to the point where the audience would probably cheer when Bats finally gets his. Chase scenes are well filmed. My only problem with this is Lilly James, she starts out with personality, then later reduced too the typical girlfriend, I thought she deserved better then that.

79,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,6 January 2020,"I guess this is one of those movies that you're not supposed to like because meh politics and meh hipster and meh outrage culture and... reasons that really make no sense and are ultimately meaningless.At least that is what a good bulk of the negative reviews say.So let's not talk about meh politics and focus on the movie instead.My wife put it on, and I have never heard of it. I, legit, thought she was talking about Simon and Garfunkel when she started talking about it. ""Do you want to watch Baby Driver?""Honest mistake, she's part Guatemalan, her English isn't all that great... watch, listen to, whatever.Anyway, I was in the kitchen cooking and I missed the first part... but I was digging the music.In fact I was digging the music so much that I started going to and from the living room, just because the soundtrack was that compelling. A great mixture of old and new.And then it was Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx, and you really want to see that. Both of them can turn a theatrical trick or two when they want to, and it always kind of seems that Spacey always wants to... and the soundtrack.And then when I finished cooking and we started eating in front of the television, I really started noticing the ringing when the music wasn't playing. And that was irritating... until my wife filled me in on the back story and then it was an ""ah-ha,"" moment of coolness. It was fairly compelling that they did that, and ran with it like they did.And, I can't be absolutely positive, but it didn't like it had that much CGI, and that is a plus. It looked incredibly real, like the good old days, so even through you are watching a movie filtered through an Ipod... it had an authentic action movie feel to it.Over all, it was incredibly enjoyable fun... and that is why you watch movies like this, right? Because they are fun?So, 10 stars, mission accomplished, it was one heck of a fun film.",Baby Driver
80,stevendbeard,Perfect Blend Of Action & Music,8,28 June 2017,"I saw ""Baby Driver"", starring Ansel Elgort-The Divergent movies, The Fault in Our Stars; Kevin Spacey-House of Cards_tv, The Horrible Bosses movies; Jon Hamm-Keeping Up With the Joneses, Sucker Punch; Lily James- Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Cinderella_2015 and Jamie Foxx-The Horrible Bosses movies, Miami Vice_2006.This is a heist movie that has the perfect blend of action and music. It's directed by Edgar Wright, who also directed Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, just to name a few. Ansel plays a getaway driver with some serious skills-and I must mention that all the car chase sequences are real and do not contain any CGI or green screen effects. Ansel was in a car accident as a child and has Tinnitus-ringing in the ears-so he constantly plays music on his I-Pod. Kevin is a crime boss that uses Ansel's skills to pull off his highly successful heists. And Kevin never uses the same group of people on a job, except for Ansel. Jon and Jamie play some of the accomplices in the robberies. Lily is a waitress that Ansel falls for and he wants to get out of the business and run away with her but Kevin keeps him busy-Ansel owes Kevin money and is trying to pay it off. The music is not just background filler, either. It seems to fit perfectly with what is happening on screen. There was a lot of good music-I remember hearing The Beach Boys, Golden Earring, Focus, T. Rex, Simon & Garfunkel, Barry White, Sam & Dave and Queen. There is also a few cameos, including Flea and Paul Williams. It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Baby Driver

The key to this picture is its music, which thumps and grooves in time with the chaos outside our driver's private little bubble, so it's a good thing the soundtrack is so hip and catchy. Peppered with a broad mix of genres - motown hits, classic rock, old school hip-hop, first-wave punk, britpop - somehow it all fits together swimmingly, an expertly-paired tune for each mood that smoothly eases right into the next track. It's stylish and fun, with subtle winks and clever lyrical Easter eggs snuggled lovingly into the scenery, but the gimmick never feels too cute. The plot is simple and straightforward, no risk of bucking distracted viewers here, and while a little extra depth might have given us more to chew on, it also would've robbed the film of its charm. There's a certain puppy dog innocence to the whole thing, despite the storm of bullets and bloody end to so many primary cast members, that's not unlike director Edgar Wright's earlier films.

83,st-shot,Baby Driver ends up in the ditch.,5,8 July 2017,"With more than it's fair share of suspense and thrills this high intensity but somewhat far fetched heist film roars right out of the box, begins to sputter midway and breaks down in True Romance fashion by the credits. Talk about being taken for a ride.Errand boy get away driver Baby (Ansel Elgort)has a severe hearing problem ameliorated by inspiring music that has him clicking on all cylinders whether picking up coffee or leading the chase; but it must be the right music. He owes big time to mobster Doc(Kevin Spacey) and is paying him back as a quirky wheel man that creeps out his cohorts. He finds a girl and wants out but Doc is not about to let that happen with over an hour to go of road mayhem and murder still on the meter.One has to suspend a lot to get through this pile-up created by writer director Edgar Wright with characters lacking depth or consistency. Doc, the cold merciless brains doesn't show much of them when selecting psycho killers to pull jobs or at least be adorned in intimidating tattoos and making sure the ""team"" mix is at loggerheads in the planning stages. It gets even worse as Doc gets caught up in the cringing mawkishness that infects the film at its conclusion. Wright's free form absurdity extends of course to the Duracell battery villain (Jon Hamm in this case, Javier Bardem and Heath Ledger were actually given Oscars for their resilience in the past) a prerequisite these days for insipid films that move in and out of reality and constantly remind us we are watching a movie bordering on computer game. In one of the film's better chase scenes we have Baby on foot tortuously eluding police only to catch up with Houdini Hamm who has managed to extricate himself from being surrounded by cops over the same period. Gratuitous violence is plentiful but in Wright's hip world glossed over at trial and trumped by the fact he returned a woman's pocket book among other things allowing for our anti-hero to be out of jail in no time riding off in a 59 Chevy convertible with his girl in glorious black and white. The fact he participated in at least three brutal robberies resulting in multiple casualties and death is a non-issue in films of this ilk. Hence, the characters never progress beyond durable outline while the story remains repetitive, predictable and pretentious, its labored breathing depending heavily on pop nostalgia and the occasional rush of adrenaline with Baby at the wheel. Baby Driver is violent fluff.",Baby Driver
84,alindsay-al,A fantastic unique film,9,3 July 2017,"After seeing the trailers for this film and being a big fan of the director Edgar wright I was really excited to see baby driver and I will say that this film really delivered. The premise of the film sees a getaway driver who needs music to concentrate try and get even with his mob boss and move on with his life. Ansel elgort plays baby in this film and he really owns the role, his physical performance makes his character interesting to watch. He doesn't have lots of dialogue but what he has he really sells and I really cared about his character as he develops in this film. Lily James plays his love interest in this film and she was really good in this film. I really enjoyed watching there chemistry together and I found there relationship fun to watch in this film. Kevin spacey plays the mob boss in this film and surprise he is great in this film, he provides a lot of humour to the role but i liked his and baby's relationship in the film and how it developed quite dramatically. Jon hamm is in this film and he does a great job in this film as a more honourable criminal that fills his job well. Jamie foxx is in this film and he definitely provides the most fun crazy performance in this film that will make you laugh. He has the best lines and the best humour in this film and he sells the craziness of his character very well. The story has a decent love story in it that I actually wanted to see succeed, also for the first hour I was really into the criminal element to the film. However, I felt like the third act felt a little short on what I wanted to see, without spoilers I can only say I didn't see as much as I would have liked to. The script is written expertly with really sharp dialogue, the humour is quick witted and the drama does work when it is used. The style has a lot of great action scenes especially as you would expect with its driving scenes which are excellent. There is a great use of music in this film and it really adds to give this film a huge personality. Overall this is a fantastic fun unique film that I think has to be seen and appreciated especially in this busy summer.",Baby Driver
85,CubsandCulture,Utterly unique,10,25 July 2019,"This film is like nothing I have seen before while being utterly classical in its story and form. The film is both a heist film and (something like) a musical. The soundtrack not only drives the plot, but it is key to understanding the film and these characters. Apart from that the way in which the images are cut and structured around the music is memorizing. Wright loves to defy and blend genres; this film his zaniest in that regard.The story-a heist gone wrong due to a young man wanting to escape crime and a love story with Oedipal overtones-is classic. It fits comfortably in with dozens of other films. But the way in which it was told is bold, striking and by a director in complete command of his craft. This is a film which style is the substance.Baby, the character, fits in with ton of lovable rogues. He reminds me of Dean in Rebel without a Cause. The look of the character is just utterly iconic.

86,iquine,An Ill-advised Stir-fry Of Styles,5,31 January 2018,"(Flash Review)This movie is hard to pin-point as I'm still unclear of what tone they were going after. There were some clever and stylish scenes and some really dumb scenes. Some scenes tried to be realistic while some would fit well within a superhero movie. I assume they hoped the audience would root for the protagonist yet they made some of his actions irritating. What is this peculiar movie about with its unusual title? It is about a young man named Baby and how he is forced to be a getaway driver for a powerful man he once tried to rob without knowing he was powerful in order to settle his debt with the man. After he pays off his debt, he thinks he'll be free but will get be granted a clean break for a normal life? This must be aimed at a younger audience aiming for a cult status as there is an assortment of unique music and all the car chases feel like Rally Cross racing. While the music tried to be a character in the movie, it was actually forgettable and not intertwined very well as for example Reservoir Dogs. There are many plot holes, questionable character decisions, under-developed characters, a fakey-forced romance and some over the top gore. Oh and if there is a definition of 'phoning in a performance' Kevin Spacey did just that. All that said, it is fun, dumb, fluff.

89,jimbo-53-186511,Nobody takes Baby out of the driver's seat,5,28 March 2018,"Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a young man who acts as a getaway driver for the mob. He suffers from tinnitus as a result of a car accident when he was a child, but uses music as a coping mechanism. Baby is initially happy acting as a getaway driver, but starts to re-evaluate his life when he falls for diner work Debora (Lily James). However, when Baby tries to break ties with the mob they make it clear that he cannot simply walk away from this life which ultimately puts a strain on his blossoming romance...I've enjoyed a few Edgar Wright films in the past such as Hot Fuzz, Shaun Of The Dead and Scott Pilgrim vs The World, but something didn't quite gel with his latest offering....Perhaps part of the problem with this film is that Wright sets it out as being one thing; it starts with a bank robbery and then shows an extended car chase (which admittedly was fun to watch and was one of the highlights of the film). However, after the impressive car chase Wright pretty much slams the brakes on and the film never really manages to gather the same sort of momentum (apart from in say the last 20 minutes or so which were just insane). There is a lot of time spent explaining the heists and time spent introducing and re-introducing characters only to then find that the heists are over and done with before you know it... All that time spent planning the heists with no real excitement when the heists take place? This aspect of the film for me was anti-climactic and a bit disappointing. It wouldn't have been quite as bad if there would have been more jokes and humour, but this seemed to absent for much of the running time. On the other side of the coin, you have Baby and his blossoming romance with Debora - his romance seems to be the catalyst which gives him the desire to go 'straight' and leave his life of crime behind. I'm normally the sort of person that gags at romances in film, but on odd occasions I am won over and genuinely believe or care in romances and in Baby Driver this is one of those odd occasions. Baby is quirky and interesting and that's possibly why Debora was drawn to him hence making the romance feel believable to me. Going back to Baby I did feel sorry for him and could see that he was a good person who was trapped by the mob and unable to escape - the only weakness with this thread is that we don't get to learn why he is indebted to the mob? That may have pushed the film up a notch for me.It's the odd way that Wright mashes the story up here that left me with rather mixed feelings; on the one hand the heists, the planning and the crew etc are so dull and uninteresting which unfortunately meant that there were large sections of the film which didn't really pique my interest. However, Baby's character, his inner struggles and his romance were a stronger part of the story and did hold my interest more. Another issue I had with this film was the shear lunacy that I witnessed in the last 20 minutes - what the hell was going on there?Still it isn't all bad; some of the performances are pretty good (Foxx is always good to watch and tries to make the film fun). The same can be said for Jon Hamm and Lily James who were good in support. The film also has Kevin Spacey in one of his last performances before the crap hit the fan for him.Baby Driver is an uneven film with some bad and some good, but throughout the film Wright injects the film with just about enough pace to make it watchable. It's worth a look, but in my opinion this is not as good as some of Wright's earlier works.",Baby Driver

There were lots of expectation from Spacey but he stays in his own territory. Foxx and Hamm were a treat to watch with Hamm surely leads between the two. Two Female casts were equally good.Screenplay of the movie is gripping and with the foot-tapping music it's keep you connected with the screenplay.

91,kluseba,Slightly overrated but overall entertaining action blockbuster,7,31 August 2017,"Baby Driver is an above average action movie but definitely not the perfect blend so many critics seem to see in it.On the positive side, the action sequences of the movie are vivid, spectacular and diversified. They also look rather realistic and don't overuse CGI technology. The last third of the movie has a great balance between an overall gloomy atmosphere and few more hopeful scenes between the characters. CJ Jones and Lily James played really likable and profound characters one could easily identify with. Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm played two quirky gangsters with their very own styles. It was also great to see Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers as a side character in this film.On the other side, the backstory isn't very original. The stereotype of a tough guy with a soft core because of a rough childhood is simply overused in Hollywood. The underlying message that he is still a nice guy and didn't have any choice to become a criminal is also very dangerous. Some of the characters' decisions are plain unrealistic, especially the typical Hollywood ending is filled with laughable stereotypes. Another issue is that every second Hollywood movie uses rock music of the seventies these days. While I like this type of music, it's simply wrong to praise this movie for its original style that isn't that original after all. I also thought that the middle section of the film dragged on for too long. The main character was introduced as a cool character that doesn't speak or think much but the middle section suddenly tried to give the character a more intellectual and profound touch which was completely misplaced.In the end, Baby Driver is without a doubt an overall entertaining, fast-paced and stylish action movie that you should enjoy at your local movie theatres. But it simply isn't anything more than that. It's the kind of movie you will enjoy while you're watching it but you probably won't remember much of it after a few months or years.",Baby Driver

93,TdSmth5,A missed opportunity,5,15 October 2017,"""Baby"" is the name of some young phenomenal getawar car driver. We meet him while he sits in the car singing while the rest of the crew perform the heist. Yup, there's a heist in progress and we get so see some kid fool around in his car. Exciting, huh? What follows is some dumb dance routine as he brings coffee back to where the boss (Doc) is distributing the money. We are told everyone gets an equal cut but we learn that Baby only gets a tiny fraction. As it turns out, he's always been a great car driver and when he was even younger he stole Doc's car with merchandise in it. So he's repaying his debt by driving.We also learn that he's got constant ringing in his ears from a car accident that killed his parents so he listens to music non-stop. He doesn't say much so everyone things he's dumb. We meet the foster father with whom he lives, some old guy deaf guy in a wheelchair. That gives us a chance to put up with more choreographed pseudo-dance routines. He knows what Baby is up to and hopes that he will dedicate himself to an honest job. Baby apparently doesn't need any money he just stashes it all under the floor. In his spare time he creates mixes based on stuff people say and that he records.One day he meets the lovely Debora, a diner waitress and they fall for each other. Of course she dreams of nothing else but driving...where else...to the West. What a hell it must be living anywhere else. For the last job--yup, surprise, surprise his last job is coming up that will pay off all he owes and thus he'll gain his freedom--he meets the new crew which includes a violent and crazy guy named Bats. The job doesn't go smoothly. But with his debt paid, Baby now becomes a pizza delivery guy and can go out with the girl.Except, Doc still needs a driver for his jobs. And by threatening Baby's loved ones, Baby has no choice but to accept. Of course now he will get paid in full. Even though Doc claims that he always works with a different crew (except for Baby of course) this time around we meet the same people from the first heist plus Bats. The next job will be to rob a Post Office for money orders but first they need to get weapons. Bats goes crazy during the weapons purchase and kills all the other guys.The crew goes for sodas at the diner where Debora works....that's not good. But now Baby also plans to make Debora's dreams come true of escaping for good. This final final job also becomes bloody not to mention that by now everyone's suspicious of Baby, who will have to overcome his aversion to violence and somehow get the girl at the end.I wasn't going to watch Baby Driver since I detest musicals and romance movies, but the very good trailer convinced me to give this movie a shot. But as always, the best parts were in the trailer and Baby Driver turned out to be a wasted opportunity. It could have been a strong action, romance, and yes, even music-oriented movie. Instead it focuses so much on music it makes you sick and of course the music is crap. No, it's not awful music but there wasn't a single good song in there either, since I guess they were looking for songs that feature the word ""baby,"" hardly a criterion to find good music. The romance is predictable but surprisingly some of the things that happen at the end aren't. The action, limited here to the crew making its escape is nothing special. That they chose to feature mostly really lame cars didn't help.I was convinced that the filmmakers would use the music excuse to give us a near silent film which has been an aspiration of Hollywood for decades now; just will the screen with CGI junk and noise. But there's actually some dialogue here, even though, Baby doesn't say much and his foster dad is deaf, but at least Spacey and Foxx are allowed to say something on occasion that isn't music-related, even though some of it doesn't make sense. Another plus is that the little action there is, is mostly filmed during the day and on location in Atlanta.But aside from that Baby Driver doesn't really work. It's pleasant enough to watch, has some funny lines on occasion, but it want's to be more than it can be. The idea of some action musical isn't bad, but it should have been strong on action and light on music, not the other way around.",Baby Driver
94,aharmas,Floor It!,10,12 July 2017,"Edgar Wright has done it. Just like George Miller's ""Mad Max"" entry a couple of years ago, he has assembled what might be the best movie of the year. It's entertaining, daring, innovative, full of exciting performances and thrills. It doesn't compromise, aligns itself with a contemporary period or a disability; it stays true to its genre, and it's probably as cool as a movie has ever been.At the heart of the film is Baby, an orphan who has associated himself with a crime lord (Spacey). He has to pay a debt and is a reliable driver who can outrun the authorities almost 100% of the time. He is well liked and respected by most of the people he works with. However, some shady characters show up to complicate matters. Luckily, Baby has about fulfilled his part of the deal and can now ""retire"" from this business.When the film opens, the crew includes a couple who seems to be in love and work well together. Later, it becomes apparent that there is a bit of sadist nature to their relationship, and they might be more lethal that their looks reveal. The new crew shows up, and it becomes clear to Baby that he is not suited for this lifestyle. He's glad to be moving on to better things, and he meets this lovely waiter, Debora (James) which gives him hope the future will be o.k.Baby lives with a deaf man who watches him closely and is very fond of the young man. We notice Baby is also very protective of him. This old man advises Baby to live a simple and honest life; for a while, things are going well until circumstances force Baby to return to his previous job. Things become even more dangerous when a thug (Fox) appears and shows very little patience with others' quirks and mistakes. He doesn't hesitate making threats and demonstrating that people have very little chance to make it when he's around.""Baby Driver"" never stops delivering. Each one of its characters is a real person, letting us sympathize or hate their actions. Lily James and Elgorn have palpable chemistry, so watching him try everything he can to keep her safe. Getting this done is going to involve some quick moves, resorting to new tricks, and hoping luck doesn't run out.We have plenty of car chases, with a few of them involving fire power, hot tempers, and some unpredictable turns. Baby's life has never been easy. He carries a load, and as we have noticed actions have consequences, with people he loves, having a good chance of meeting a violent end. The ride is fun, exciting, and pretty dangerous.",Baby Driver
95,Enchorde,An unexpected gem,8,29 September 2018,"Baby is a genius behnd the wheel, and finds himself working as a getaway driver for a local crime boss he is indebted to. Orphaned as a child, when his parents died in a car accident which also left him with a severe case of tinnitus, Baby always have a soundtrack to his life. Finally free from his debt, he meets Debora, and dreams of hitting the highways with her. But he is forced to do one last heist for his old boss, and naturally things unravel...A movie with high speed, both on the roads and in the pace of itself. Quick and elegant with good pieces of car pursuit and action. But it also has another level to it. Baby and Debora, among others, are likeable characters. The humor is good, but above all; the sound and soundtrack is masterfully used. It lines up perfectly with the acting and events in the movie. It kind of becomes a character of it's own, and sound and hearing is a theme throughout the movie. A little more forgotten is the use of colors. There clearly is a thought behind them, as striking colors are often used in the movie. In such, Baby Driver is a treat both visually and audibly. Director Wright and his team have done a really good job here. An unexpected gem.",Baby Driver
96,valleyjohn,Soundtrack is the star,7,26 September 2017,"I was reluctant to watch Baby Driver because a friend of mine described this as a musical and i run a mile from musicals. Thankfully , although it's rammed pack full of music , it's definitely not a musical in my opinion. This is the story of a getaway driver called Baby who because of tinnitus , lives his life with his headphones in and a constant soundtrack playing . He meets a girl in a diner and he sees it as his chance to get out of the crime game. I can see why my friend thought this was a musical because in places it's choreographed like one but thankfully the music comes from a brilliant soundtrack and not spontaneous singing. I actually think that the music is so good it becomes the star of this film and not the actors. The story is OK , it starts really well but is unable maintain the adrenaline filled first twenty minutes and gets baggier the longer the film goes on. It's a brave film to make from Edgar Wright and for the most part it works and i'm all for more films with brilliant soundtracks. Guardians of the Galaxy aside they seem few and far between nowadays.",Baby Driver

98,a_chinn,Breezy crime film is pure cinema!,9,13 August 2017,"Snappy crime film from writer/director Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Hot Fuzz,"" ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World""). Ansel Elgort, an actor who I was previously not familiar with but who is excellent, plays Baby, a young getaway driver paying off a debt to crime boss Kevin Spacey by pulling jobs for him. Baby is near the end of paying off his debt and getting out, but as with most films about criminals trying to leave the life, it pulls them back in. That synopsis does not do this film justice because Wright tells his story in a supremely cinematic of fashion and what I mean by that is that he tells his story in a way that it could not be replicated in a book, a graphic novel, TV show, or other format. ""Baby Driver"" is pure cinema. Baby wears headphones throughout the film to buffer the constant ringing in his ears from a childhood accident that killed his parents, which allows Wright to give this film an amazing playlist of the first order, which includes everything from Dave Brubeck to The Dammed to Queen to Young MC. This is easily my favorite film soundtrack in a very long time! Also, as you would expect from a story about a getaway driver, Wright delivers a series of dizzying and thrilling car chase sequences, each better than the last. Rewatching this film, these chases seem to only get better and I believe will eventually enter the pantheon on greatest cinematic car chases. The film also boasts an incredibly strong supporting cast that besides Spacey includes Jon Hamm & Eiza González as a husband/wife crime duo, Jamie Foxx as a distrustful nutcase, and Lily James as Baby's new girlfriend Debora. Performance are great all around, but this is really Edgar Wright's show and they're just living in it (or at least fleshing it out). With constant references to other genre films, this movie one that is a must see for cinephiles! FUN FACT! Walter Hill's seminal car chase film ""The Driver"" is given a nod in ""Baby Driver"" with that film's release date highlighted with inmate #28071978. Also, Walter Hill provides the voice of the courtroom interpreter.",Baby Driver
99,TheOneThatYouWanted,Don't Believe the Hipster Hype,5,12 August 2017,"Jamie freaking Fox. The man is just too much of a one note actor to be taken seriously. At this point Hollywood should consider him box office poison. Whatever. Luckily he isn't in the movie much. This film su#cks for a totally different reason. It is artificial and pretentious. It is too hipster for its own good. Plus the whole hipster thing is finally starting to get played out, thankfully. Which is another reason why this film tanked at the box office. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has a good soundtrack. The main character was different enough to be interesting but simplistic plot, played out predictable backstory and generic motivations kills whatever interest you have in this unique character and ultimately makes the movie a boring ride with repetitive action and set pieces. Long story short, the story isn't good enough to fill a two hour movie block and fans of the film will realize as much upon second viewing. Such a shame considering how we hardly get original movies anymore.",Baby Driver
100,jadepietro,Baby Love,8,3 July 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A fast and furious heist film with jaw-dropping car stunts that takes the moviegoer on a wild ride, as long as one can accepts its many leaps of logic.SYNOPSIS: After finding true love, a getaway driver wants to leave the world of crime.JIM'S REVIEW: Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a loner who likes high speed action. He loves the fast and furious high octane lifestyle. Give him a car and he can move from zero to 120 like no one else can. Which makes him the perfect getaway driver and gives him a passport into the profitable world of crime. Injured in a car accident as a child that left him parent-less and with a permanent case of tinnitus (a constant ringing in his ears), Baby drowns out the real world with classic rock music as his live soundtrack. This also helps him concentrate better on his unique driving skills. Of course, he eventually meets Debora (Lily James), a cute waitress who steals Baby's heart while he steals other items.Now they say, crime doesn't pay, although Baby is making a killing...that is until Baby wants out of the crime game. Doc, crime czar and all-around bad guy, played with over-the-top menace by Kevin Spacey, won't hear it. Hence, the basic conflict.Edgar Wright wrote and directed this action heist thriller and he takes his simple (very simple) story, fills each frame with exciting stunt work, and creates memorable offbeat characters. Baby's bank robbing cohorts are a colorful motley crew. They include Jamie Foxx (Jamie Foxx), Griff (Jon Bernthal), Eddie No-Nose (Flea), JD (Lanny Joon), and Buddy (Jon Hamm), and his darling, Darling (Eiza Gonzalez). All of the cast know that the story is preposterous but they play their roles with high energy, rapturous glee, and a knowing satirical wink to the audience. (Especially fine are Mr. Hamm and Ms. Gonzalez as a crazed modern day Bonnie and Clyde.) Yes, the plot is silly and devoid of any real depth or logic, especially as it accelerates to its tidy little upbeat ending, but it is lots of fun.Baby Driver is all action too, more like a demolition derby with multiple chase scenes than a serious movie about crime and punishment. It's Reservoir Dogs with the sardonic humor and without the excessive bloodbath or wit. Call it Grand Theft with Auto, set to music. Skillful as it may be, the film still seems like an endless series of music videos looped together to form a movie. All the action moves with a strong syncopated beat, highly choreographed for our enjoyment. It's full throttle escapism. The first movie musical about cars.Baby Driver presents a major case of style over substance and style mostly wins out. Kudos to the excellent taut editing by Paul Machliss and Jonathan Amos and Bill Pope's electric hued photography that gives the film its unique look. Mr. Wright stages and choreographs his action sequences with an edgy disregard for realism. He also keeps his characters from being lost in all the maelstrom of revved engines and motor mayhem by developing individuals with distinct personalities and lasting traits. (Loved the his and hers neck tattoos.) All remains suspenseful and riveting, that is, until the film takes a sharp detour in its third act, veering hopelessly into typical chase and crash mode. Some of its characters start to act out of character, acting more like mere plot devices set in motion to tidy up all the loose ends. In fact, the movie never explains how characters know the whereabouts of others in order to seek revenge and one character's ""change of heart"" makes little sense and actually weakens the story-line. Too many leaps of logic.Still, fasten your safety belts and move over, Quentin! Edgar Wright's well made film is for adrenaline junkies everywhere; serious film-goers may enjoy it too, as long as they slip their minds into neutral. With a plot that defies logic and having enough potholes to do major damage to one's faculties, Baby Driver is a joyride.",Baby Driver

103,rgkarim,Go for A Drive with Baby Driver,9,1 July 2017,"Baby Driver! When I saw this trailer months ago I had no idea what to think about it just from the title alone. Yet seeing a star studded cast that included Jon Hamm, Lily James, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx, I had hopes for a good movie. So, with it rushing into a midweek premiere I managed to finally check it out this weekend. What's the verdict on the action/crime movie to hit the screen. Robbie K here always appreciating your views on his blog. Let's get started!LIKES:The Acting: I don't say this too much, but this cast was aces across the board. Let's start with the lead Ansel Elgort who plays Baby. At first I was only impressed with his ability to be the awkward silent type, but as the movie progresses Elgort is able to bring a little more to the screen to round out Baby. His range broadens as more characters are introduced into the film and he has to balance between the two worlds that he lives in. As kind of his looming shadow, the master villain Kevin Spacey continues to play that cool, calculating, manipulative role that he made famous in House of Cards. Not too much to be annoying, but not too little to be cheated Spacey really brings depth to a cliché role and keeps things heated up. As for Foxx, well his acting continues to improve me in spectrum he can cover. Taking more of the jaded thug approach, Foxx adds the comedic heat to the film with the darker theme taking hold. I could spend the whole review on the chemistry of everyone, but Baby Driver's cast is stellar. The Action: For a crime thriller toting about the stunts and guns, the movie certainly delivers. Baby Driver shifts the gear into R for reality and manages to deliver sequences that are exciting chases through obstacle laden courses with all the bells and whistles. Unlike the Fast and The Furious, this movie keeps things on a believable level, requiring actual stunt driving instead of high tech gadgets. Even the gunplay is exciting, finally adopting the crime motif we had in the mafia movie days instead of the explosion loaded productions famous of modern cinema. The action is well directed, and used as a supporting tool to keep the film exciting and fast paced without being the only aspect of the movie. The Story: Most crime stories bore me these days because they get too caught up in either sex or malicious violence. While Baby Driver is certainly darker in its own accord, it has a story that doesn't dance in one area. A combination of love, action, and crime drama, the storyboard writers get props from me for crafting a decently balanced story. Baby's character is complicated (though the trailers might mislead you), and they managed to gradually peel this character apart and help him transform into someone completely new. To do this all while bringing forth a story that doesn't put me to sleep but keep me on edge is certainly worthy of two thumbs up. The Music: The theme of Baby Driver is music (he is always wearing headphones if you haven't seen the trailers), and that means you need a strong soundtrack. Mission successful on this part too. While I'm not quite familiar with some of these classics (yes boo me), they music directors selected a fantastic spread to entertain us with. Across many genres and decades, your ears will be swallowed by a deluge of classics, each fitting with the tone of the movie and providing great sound support to the impressive visuals. And if you don't know these tunes, well the internet is still a wonderful thing when used appropriately. DISLIKES: No unifying crime plot: In many crime movies, there is a big score, a key target, or some unifying goal. Baby Driver though doesn't have that big, impending doom I often like to see, choosing instead to focus more on Baby himself. While certainly a small dislike, I felt the unifying theme or grand plan could have provided a little more oomph to the story and a way to integrate Spacey's character even more. Romance Aspect: I'm not saying this is bad, and again I'm grasping at most straws, but Baby Driver's romance component needs a little work. Lily James and Elgort have some decent chemistry and work well together in the scenes where they are paired. However, I feel that this component was a little glazed over up until the climax where the crap starts to hit the fan. Expanding this role again would have tied some things together and integrated the cast a little better to complete the story. Part of the Ending: This dislike is again complicated, but I'll do my best to explain. Baby Driver's ending is certainly unique and took many directions I liked in the form of being non- cliché, artistic, and exciting on many levels. Yet about fifteen minutes of the ending was dragged out entirely too long and started hitting that ridiculous level Hollywood often hits. The vicious parts were a little overdramatic and the predictable twists just led to more run time that wasn't really needed. Still it wrapped up nicely and had a self-gratifying finish, it just didn't need to be that complicated. The Verdict:I agree with many that Baby Driver is one awesome film. Despite the weird title (which yes is a song title), it works on many levels primarily in regards to a suspenseful action tale with strong story elements. Baby Driver is an example of what movies can be if done right and I for one recommend hitting this movie in theaters. Of note, use caution when taking younger audience members due to the violence please. My scores:Action/Crime/Music: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",Baby Driver
104,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Baby Driver,5,28 June 2017,"What if 2011's Drive was less dark, a little less cerebral, and contained a more stoic blueprint on what it's like to function as a getaway wheel-man. Well the result would be Baby Driver, my latest review.Co-starring Oscar winners Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey, ""Driver"" involves a pretty boy named Miles (his nickname is ""Baby"" and he's played by Ansel Elgort). Miles for reasons unknown, is a driver for hardened criminals who love taking down many robbery scores. When Miles was a kid, his parents died in a car accident. He survived said accident but was left with a condition called tinnitus (the hearing of sound with no external sound present). Now, he uses music to drown everything out as he barrels past cop cars like NASCAR's Richard Petty on angel dust.Shot mostly on location in Atlanta, GA, ""Driver"" is obviously a car chase flick (duh). Steve McQueen's Bullitt used San Francisco as its go- to locale whereas Baby Driver gives the ATL some real top billing. I suppose Elgort channels his inner McQueen because at times, he hardly has any lines. On the flip side, the late Steve McQueen was always known as ""The King of Cool"". Ansel Elgort is better suited to be the dude you wanna play ping pong with. Not the same thing.Anyway, critics have been salivating over this ""vehicle"" since it premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival (in March of 2017). I wanted to be part of that group but in truth, I found ""Driver"" to be a bit overrated. Three to four automobile chases between moments of tedium. Underdeveloped characters using spit-fire dialogue as a vice. A required love story with cutesy overtones. A musical soundtrack that overwhelms every scene as if director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) is re-shooting Guardians of the Galaxy. Baby Driver has all this and unfortunately, it doesn't feel very groundbreaking or memorable. The ending involving the obligatory one last job, is perfunctory, violent, and reads like a street sign signaling a screenwriter's ""No Outlet"". Heck, no one wants to see the protagonist go to jail for being at the wrong place at the wrong time (spoiler). What a downer. In jest, if you wanna see more visceral car chases, you could probably just watch one of the Fast & Furious movies or even catch the final sequence in 2014's Nightcrawler (that's not even an actual car chase film to begin with). And if you choose to view ""Driver"", you'll realize that Wright is fast-paced in his acumen but he's no William Friedkin (just revert back to To Live and Die in L.A., enough said). Bottom line: Baby Driver might be the Rotten Tomatoes king of the moment (98% and pending). But for me, this whimsical fender bender with its cool hot rods, its queasy moving picture title, and its ""La La"" effervescence, doesn't quite reach ""2nd gear"". Rating: 2 stars.",Baby Driver

This movie blends in classic funky music to car chasing action, some R rated goodness, and an excellent cast to make a film that is the most original movie of the year. It's also Edgar Wright's most popular too. Mr. Elsort, who made his mark in the Divergent movies, shines as Baby, a driver who has a disability from a car accident as a kid who wears an Ipod nano while he drives and takes care of his father in law.

106,Kingslaay,"A great blend of action, humour and music",8,28 July 2017,"Baby Driver gives us a fresh, exciting and fun experience at the cinema. From the very start the film goes off with a bang and we are straight into it. Baby's unique personality and set of skills gives the film its edge. Not to mention the mix of great actors who hit it out of the park. You feel the danger, intensity and thrill of the ride throughout the film.Unlike traditional or previous heist movies this film has a novel approach and pulls it off with great style. A number of scenes are synchronized with the music which really works. The beauty of this film and its music is that the audience joins in on Baby enjoying some great music from Queen to Lionel Richie. The story works well too with showing Baby and his various crew members pulling off some heists that showcased some impressive driving on his characters part. The love story also worked well and it nicely intertwined with the main story. Some criticisms of Baby Driver are we could seen or heard more about how he came to be involved in this life. We got a brief reason from Kevin Spacey but maybe being shown these scenes as a flashback would have worked well. Another thing could have been better locations or situations for the heists as they seemed quite ordinary such as the post office. Overall a very enjoyable film and not one to be missed. 8.5/10",Baby Driver
107,Matt_Layden,"""This one, they say that listens to the music all the time?""",8,29 June 2017,"Baby Driver falls perfectly in line with Wright's previous films in style, but offers a bit more in dramatic tone and a little less in comedy. The film still has plenty of funny moments, but it depicts a slight change in direction for him and one that hopefully opens more doors for original films. Baby, that's B-A-B-Y, is the getaway driver for a wealthy criminal, Doc, who plots out the heists and never uses the same crew twice. Baby insists he is done after one last job, but Doc is willing to threaten the lives of the people Baby loves, including his new waitress girlfriend Debora, if he doesn't pull one more stunt. Going into a Wright film, you have a sense of what to expect. Hot Fuzz was a parody of action films to the point where a simple moment of putting on your jacket was made to look like a chaotic action sequence. With Baby Driver, Wright continues this style, but squarely plants the film itself into that world that Hot Fuzz was parodying. This is done with self awareness though, and never becomes a problem. Instead, it highlights the originality of the film and the world Wright has created. It's a heightened reality and music plays an important role in it. To the point where it feels more like a love letter to music than heist films. This is even more apparent when you realize that we never really get to see the heists. We stay with Baby in the car and subvert those expectations. We are with Baby and his music the whole way. As I said earlier, music is important to this film and ever aspect of it revolves around that. Camera work, action sequences, character movements, dialogue, plot devices, the list goes on. For something that important, the music should be good. Wright manages to explore enough genres to please most people and I found myself really digging the playlists. Music is Baby's world and we live in it for 2 hours almost non-stop. To the point where when there is no music playing, it feels out of place. I fully expect people to go out and buy the soundtrack and at no point did I feel as if any of it was forced, like Suicide Squad. I guess you want to know about the car chase sequences, those are thrilling for people looking for excitement. Wright gives us enough unique moments to make those memorable and it's needed because car chases are a staple in Hollywood movies. You want to see something new and Baby Driver delivers enough of a spin to make it seems fresh. The film balances itself out with plenty of small quiet sequences that focus on character. Baby's dedication to take care of his aging foster father is touching. They communicate through sign language, which adds another layer to the complicated character that is Baby. Then we have some tender moments with Baby and Debora. A love at first sight relationship that blooms due to charm, appreciation of music and the aspirations to just be on the open road. Baby Driver is stylish and charges to you at full speed. With the camera almost constantly moving, it never feels slow, even in those quiet moments. The cast nail their roles with just a hint of self awareness. Spacey can be intimidating in his sleep and Foxx has no problem playing someone with a few screw lose moments. At the very least, when you walk away from this movie you can say that you had a fun time, this movie has plenty of those moments to make it great.",Baby Driver
108,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,""" Retarded means slow. Was he slow? """,8,20 August 2017,"Clever, original comic thriller about a kid, referred to as "" Baby "", who is a tinnitus-plagued getaway driver for a crime boss in Atlanta, who falls for a waitress at a local diner.

The characters have story arcs, making them three dimensional characters, with depth, meat on their bones, and we, the audience, are not sure who's trustworthy, and who might end up turning on each other.The car chase scenes are very well done.

110,bkrauser-81-311064,Brilliant!,8,25 June 2017,"Director Edgar Wright's newest and most outwardly conventional film Baby Driver is nothing short of a new definition in cool. Aided by an eclectic soundtrack, a stylish and engrossing caper story and Wright's meticulously crafted look and feel, the film soars like rarely a movie of this stripe has soared before. At its height Baby Driver feels like the mordant composure of a Jean-Pierre Melville's crime thriller is being spun around on a Looney Tune Acme thingamajig. It sounds like it shouldn't work but after seeing what is most definitely the best crime comedy in years, having this particular mix of awesome is the equivalent of accidentally getting chocolate in your peanut butter.The film sets itself at the center of a criminal underworld dominated by greed and ego. Yet the world of Baby (Elgort) feels unnaturally bright by comparison. And why shouldn't it be; He's only a job or two away from retiring as an infinitely skilled getaway driver. A driver whose handler (Spacey) trusts him enough to shuttle his various criminal enterprises in and around the Atlanta downtown loop. ""I never work with the same crew twice, except for you,"" says Spacey in a rare moment of rare avuncular appreciation. Baby in-turn answers with Monsters, Inc. (2001) quotes. He's one foot out the door and clearly happy to be.As with all movies of this kind, things don't go exactly according to plan. A plot point that looms larger as Baby starts dating a peppy waitress named Debora (James) who shares his love of music. It's a love of necessity as the music is used to drown out his tinnitus, as well as having the duel purpose of being getaway driving focus fuel and a framing device for the audience.And what remarkably obsessive frames we end up going through. To point out that Baby Driver has a handful of incredible car chases verges on the obvious. Yet what the trailer might not tell you about are the various visual and audio cues that create an echo chamber of gags, setups, callbacks, pacing devices and tension builders. They're meant to please the ears and tickle the brain and boy do they ever. In one moment of frazzled suspense, the sound mixing erupts in a cacophony of gunfire, sneaker squeaks, screaming on-lookers and the non-diegetic guitar riffs of ""Hocus Pocus"" blaring on Baby's iPod. In other scenes the body language of supporting cast members sync up perfectly with whatever Baby is listening to, hinting to a heightened reality that only Baby experiences in the recesses of his headphones. Baby Driver is not strictly speaking a musical, but it might as well be.In the hands of any other director, Baby Driver still would have been good, perhaps edging out The Italian Job (2003) in its ability to balance fast fun and elevating stakes. Yet in the hands of Edgar Wright (who also wrote the screenplay), Baby Driver feels alive, tight, tactile and dare I say even original. It's an exercise in style that zips by with such eye-popping aplomb and works on so many levels that I'm honestly surprised the reigns of this beast didn't slip out of Wright's hands. This movie could have easily been another Transformers (2007) i.e. visually resplendent but far too slapdash for its strengths to be appreciated.No - this movie wants to be appreciated. It wants to be oogled at and admired and further distills its energy with a supporting cast that either meets or exceed it. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Eiza Gonzalez, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal, Lanny Joon and Flea all do wonders playing the various psychotics that encircle Baby like a murder of crows. Their characterizations are buoyant as a whole with Hamm and Gonzalez standing out as a criminal couple whose psychosis is just this side of Bonnie and Clyde (1967).Then of course there's Ansel Elgort who often feels like a millennial remix of the cool, detached, petty criminal trope made famous by Alain Delon's trademark smolder. Here his detachment hides a vulnerability - a hidden need to find life outside of crime, a deep desire to not see anyone get hurt and of course his creative outlet. An outlet that refreshingly switches off his defenses and gets him to instantly dance like no one is watching.If there is one sour note in this car chase opera, it's the romance. While the rest of the film owns its stylistic excesses, the budding romance between Baby and Debora is played straight and more than a little syrupy. What's worse is because the character of Debora largely lacks depth or agency, huge swaths of the second act feel like we're setting up the marbles and levers of a rube-goldberg machine with Debora being one of said marbles.Yet when everything is in motion, Baby Driver can't help but be an incredible romp. Nearly everything to this movie fires on all cylinders. And in the drivers seat is arguably one of the most fertile and creative movie minds of the 21st century. Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), Scott Pilgrim (2010), World's End (2013) and now this? Seriously what can't Edgar Wright do?",Baby Driver

112,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Baby Driver""- One of the year's coolest flicks! Sharp, exciting and endlessly charming!",9,13 July 2017,"Edgar Wright is fast becoming one of the most dynamic and electrifying minds in the world of modern filmmaking. After a more humble beginning in the world of shorts, low-budget features and television work, he shot to super-stardom with the delightful 2004 horror-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"", and his ascent has not slowed since. With his famous ""Cornetto"" trilogy and the outstanding ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" under his belt, we were all wondering what would be next for this mastermind of cinema.And he certainly does not disappoint with the phenomenal ""Baby Driver""- a sort-of throwback film that pays tribute to the numerous tropes and clichés of the crime genre and the many famous heist movies of the past... all while being punctuated with Wright's trademark kinetic direction and dynamic comedy. The film is very much a labor of love from a fan (and fanatic) of film and media, and comes across as a wonderful and heartfelt tribute to the movies he loves. The result is one of the most wildly entertaining films of the Summer, and indisputably one of the flat- out coolest movies of the year. Filled to burst with non-stop thrilling action set-pieces, laugh-out-loud gags, endless charm and razor- sharp wit.We follow ""Baby"" (Ansel Elgort), a young man in his early 20's who works as a getaway driver for criminal mastermind ""Doc"" (Kevin Spacey) in order to repay an old debt. Despite his young age and even younger appearance, Baby is the best there is at what he does. However, he's become increasingly disillusioned by his life of crime and seeks to escape it once his debt is repaid, especially after meeting a gorgeous and kind-hearted young woman named Debora (Lily James) who seems to bring out the best in him. However, things take an interesting turn when his latest job places him in a car with an unhinged and violent criminal called ""Bats"" (Jamie Fox) and a troubled Bonnie-and-Clyde-esque couple. (Jon Hamm and Eiza González) And the volatile and dangerous combination of conflicting personalities may very well threaten their ability to complete the task at hand...To start, the cast is just magnificent. Ansel Elgort makes for a fantastic protagonist and plays the role to perfection. He's cool, calm and collected when the story calls for it, but also vulnerable and extremely open and likable when necessary. An amazing role for such a young performer. I also had a lot of fun with Spacey in his role as ""Doc""- a slimy kingpin of crime that suits Spacey well... though also with a touch of humanity these characters sometimes lack. Despite being a bit ruthless, you get the feeling he actually does care about Baby and the others... not necessarily as ""friends"" but just on a human level, which was refreshing. You'll hate him at times... and yet you'll also genuinely love him at other moments. Lily James is absolutely adorable and a wonderful addition, and though she might lack some development, she's a key character and James does a great job. Hamm, Fox and González are all just superb and seem to be having the time of their lives playing such treacherous, evil criminal characters. Particularly Hamm, who gets some really fun moments to sink his teeth into. And I also gotta give a shoutout to CJ Jones, who portrays Baby's deaf foster-father Joseph. It's a small role, but a memorable one and it lent a lot to the movie by giving Baby a great emotional core when we see him at home.But of course the real star here is writer/director Wright, who injects so much ""cool"" into the film, I wouldn't be surprised if the Blu-Ray release came with a mini leather jacket and pair of Oakley sunglasses to wrap around the disc! The most noticeable part of the film- and indeed one of its biggest treats- is the keen use of its soundtrack. In the film, the character of Baby suffers from the condition tinnitus, which he combats by constantly listening to music of all types, and this music is then incorporated into the film as the background music score many scenes. And it's extremely well done, with several key sequences choreographed and edited to match the beats. It may sound like a gimmick, but trust me... when you see a gun-battle set to the song ""Tequila"", your blood will be pumping. Wright's delightful visual flourishes are also on full display throughout the rest of the film, with many sequences being almost psychotically breath-taking. The car-chases here are among the best ever realized, and even the quieter moments (such as an amusing opening credits dance-sequence as Baby strides down the street) are meticulously well-planned.""Baby Driver"" seemingly came out of nowhere for me, and yet I'd now say it's without doubt my favorite film of the Summer. While I am going to dock a single point from my score due to the film needlessly dragging a bit too much at times in the second act, I can't help but completely recommend it to anyone and everyone. The cast is outstanding. The music addicting. The action awe- inspiring. And it's just the most fun I've had at the theaters in a long, long time. Edgar Wright delivers another winner in his near-flawless filmography, and I can't wait to see what he has up his sleeve for his next project. Maybe we'll finally get that long-rumored ""Hot Fuzz 2""? Either way, ""Baby Driver"" gets a near-perfect 9 out of 10 from me. See it... see it now!",Baby Driver

114,intelearts,601st Review: True Romance meets The Blue Brothers,7,21 September 2017,"Baby Driver is an extremely solid bit of filmmaking - Edgar Wright turns on both the pace and the charm as director and this is not just a beautifully crafted film, it's also a very good crime film with real chops.This has everything the moviegoer could want - top performances, a solid story, thrills but much more than those this is a very well put together film, Amos and Machliss deserve to win a ton of awards one day for their editing - the way the music and film work together is exemplary - and Bill Pope's cinematography shines - it's just a great film to watch.Baby Driver shows it's still possible to make real cinema: it blends True Romance's constant surprises with the Blues Brothers' sense of vitality, and does so without tipping into either comedy or Tarantino style violence - it makes for exceptional entertainment that puts its pedal to the metal and zips by.",Baby Driver

117,arungeorge13,"B-A-B-Y, Baby! [+77%]",8,19 September 2017,"The first and foremost reason why I loved 'Baby Driver' is because I could relate to the protagonist Baby's (yes, his name is Baby!) fixation on recording sounds (and conversations) that he hears around him and making mixes out of them - yes, that's something I used to do when I was fifteen. Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a seemingly quiet getaway driver (one of the best that there is, point made clear by a superbly crafted opening chase set-piece that unfurls to 'The BellBottoms' by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion) working for Doc (Kevin Spacey), whose varying crews specialize in undertaking heists. He carries a series of iPods (suited to different moods/occasions) and suffers from tinnitus (a condition when you hear sound when no actual sound is made) which he tries downing out by way of listening to music all the time.Baby takes care of his mute foster-dad (CJ Jones) and falls in love with a diner waitress Debora (Lily James) while bonding over mutual interest in music. What I like about Edgar Wright's films most is the fact that he puts realistically grounded characters in a purely cinematic setting. The film is set in modern day Atlanta but there are plenty of vintage aspects attributed to the proceedings: the picture-tube TV, the phone booths, the age-old method of stacking stolen money under a floor-plank, and the best of all, a portable walk-man (why are movies featuring the inclusion of a walk-man so entertaining by default? hint - Guardians of the Galaxy).The chemistry between baby-faced Baby and adorable Lily is played out surprisingly well. They may have known each other for just a few days, yet when two souls connect over their common love for music, highways and long drives, it is by all means a well-nurtured filmic trope. Wright's narrative ingenuity is evinced throughout the film: the couple's (unlikely) first date takes place at a laundromat that culminates in a transitional shot (the rotation of the washing machine seamlessly fluxing into a gramophone record) with Beck's 'Debra' playing in the backdrop.Baby's equation with his wheelchair-bound foster dad is also wonderfully expounded when they speak to each other in sign- language. Also, we have subtle bits of situational humor sprinkled throughout the film: like how one of the heist-crew members unknowingly buys everyone Austin Powers (who was played by Mike Myers) masks instead of Michael Myers from Halloween (as was planned); like how Doc's 8- year old nephew is a better observer than Baby (he gets a mint, haha!); like how the old lady exclaims WTF! when she is robbed of her vehicle by Baby who comfortingly hands out her purse, pop- culture references..there are plenty of instances!Now, onto the supporting cast: Jon Bernthal's Griff is absent post the opening sequence, so I really wonder they billed him as top cast. In the limited screen-time that he is seen, he pulls off an intimidating yet funny gangster. Spacey sortof repeats his '21' act but still manages to stand-out with his sarcasm-filled quips. Jamie Foxx's character Bats is expected to appear unthinkingly menacing and he does exactly what's required of him. Eiza Gonzalez's Darling is imagined to be wildly seductive and she fits the role to the T. Jon Hamm plays the major antagonist Buddy - a gangster with a wild past, who tries to get back at Baby for reasons that cannot be *spoiled*.Wright (with his cinematography & edit department regulars - Bill Pope and Paul Machliss respectively) has tried to package 'Baby Driver' as one long, exciting music-video with most crowd-pleasing elements inculcated. Kudos to Wright and crew for coming up with something utterly authentic in an era that is punctuated by reboots and remakes. 'Baby Driver' is a fantastically handcrafted concoction of humor, thrills and romance, powered by a kick-ass soundtrack.Verdict: Must-see!",Baby Driver
118,MR_Heraclius,Great,9,23 February 2020,"Edgar Wright proved to be able to create a thrilling direction and more than capable script for our ensemble cast, led by a sympathetic Ansel Elgort. He certainly shines as this teen in a tough position who is a good guy being forced to do bad things. More than your average heist movie, with a killer soundtrack and fast pace driver you'll be on the edge of your seat during the most crazy moments.",Baby Driver
119,Screen_Blitz,"Fast, frenetic, and swarming with wit -- Edgar Wright's Bady Driver is a total joyride",9,30 June 2017,"You can always count on Edgar Wright to load his films with plenty of good humor and wit. When tackling the action genre, Wright proves more than capable of splashing the screen with immense laughter and intelligence without tossing its thrills aside -- a common problem among many entries of the genre. Baby Driver is a movie that gets the blood pumping the minute it open, while staying almost consistently entertaining following the near two-hour proceeding. When it gets down to the action, it is pulse-pounding. When it gets down to the talking, it is funny. And like his previous projects, Wright happens to run with a style-over-substance vibe. Whereas some films it serves as a detriment to the final product, here it is almost profoundly satisfying . Mixing a hodgepodge of adrenaline- fueled action and humor with a killer soundtrack, Wright knows how to give the audiences a blast without sacrificing intellect. This film follows Baby (played by Ansel Egdorf), a twenty-something year old man working as a getaway driver for his team consisting of Griff (played by Jon Bernthal), Buddy (played by Jon Hamm), and Darling (played by Eiza Gonzalez) to rob banks for his mob boss Doc (played by Kevin Spacey). Baby proves to be a highly skilled driver with his ability to escape the cops and pull off outrageous stunts while slaving his ears to music on his iPod. At night, he is at home taking care of his deaf foster father Joseph (played by C.J. Jones). After finishing what is intended to be his last job, Baby falls for a beautiful waitress named Deborah (played by Lily James). When he gets call back for one last job with his new consisting of Griff, Darling, and a tough-as-nails gangster named Bats (played by Jamie Foxx), things get dangerous very quick. Edgar Wright operates this film in a way that boasts plenty of style and smarts from its opening minute. From the frenetic action sequences, to the snappy dialogue, to the smoking hot soundtrack -- this film is brimming with cleverness. In the opening scene showcasing the characters' escape from the cops following a bank robbery, Wright proves to be highly skilled at shooting action scenes and editing them with precision. Rather than chopping the scene up with split-second cuts, Wright captures the full frenetic energy of the scene as the lead character races through the streets while scurrying through semi- heavy traffic. This is when he starts a song from the 70s or 80s on his iPod. To add to the mix, Wright effectively choreographs these scenes in a fashion that matches up with the beat of the music, one scene involving a gunfight in which he performs this flawlessly. The final results are car chases injected with more substance than what we are often accustomed to in the 'Fast and Furious' movies. And like Wright's previous flicks, there is some unexpected moments of gore. When Baby is not dodging the cops or unleashing the bullets, the film takes it time to treat viewers with some funny dialogue, particularly when Jamie Foxx comes on screen. Exhibiting a darkly funny streak, Foxx breaths some comedic gold in his role, delivering one snappy one-liner after another. He is often the power source for laughs. Ansel Egdorf, stepping into his first high-octane role, is suitably appealing as the lead character with an upsetting past that this otherwise light- hearted picture sporadically explores. His romance is with Lily James is charming, but perhaps nothing sizzling. Nonetheless, it is become rarer and rarer for action comedies nowadays to uproot characters we truly care about, particularly one trying to battle his inner demons when caught in a dangerous situation. Then there is Kevin Spacey just being himself like in nearly other role he's endeavored.Baby Driver is a high-octane action comedy that knows how to deliver both the fun and intellectual touch. In the summer with superhero flicks and other highly anticipated pictures arriving on the scene, this is a film that may not see too much sunshine at the box office. Regardless, this movie is a total blast that deserves the attention of many, especially those converted to the Edgar Wright fandom.",Baby Driver
120,leftbanker-1,Murder and Mayhem as Bad Art,1,13 September 2017,"How many chase scenes can you put in a single movie?Baby Driver. Can't believe the 8.2 rating on IMDb. I should give this a 4 Star rating but I'm trying to offset all of the grade inflation here.Stick with music videos if that's your thing.First scene: Is the kid some sort of retard? I LOVE to watch someone play air guitar. He drives away like a maniac so, of course, the cops are going to chase him. Had he driven like an old lady they would have cruised away unnoticed. It morphs into a completely stupid-as-can-be chase scene. He loses one car in some far-fetched manner only to have another car immediately on his bumper.Scene 2: They divvy up the money from the bank and one criminal, who is obviously a tough guy because he is wearing a black leather jacket which is what all tough guys wear, messes with the silent kid while the girl puts on a clinic of really bad acting and Kevin Spacey does his thing being the boss. Scenes after those two: Lip synching? Do criminals plan stuff out on a chalk board? The plan on the board looked like what an eight year old boy would imagine a criminal plan to be but the movie version of the heist of the truck looked like a five year old kid wrote it.A stylish shootout scene topped with what they think is witty banter: murder as art.And then the Post Office job got seriously stupid. What I like to call a Chinese Downhill.",Baby Driver
121,Troy_Campbell,Wright at the top of his game,8,15 July 2017,"Edgar Wright has a bleedingly simple goal for his new movie, as Kevin Spacey's head honcho Doc so eloquently puts it: ""people love great bank robbery stories, so let's give them something bold and brazen as f@!& to talk about over their lattes."" Wright has certainly achieved that, and more, with Baby Driver. His ambition to deliver originality is matched by his genius in concocting a hyper-real world where every action beat, every character tic and every sound bite is calibrated with flair and intrigue. It's easy to pick the films that influenced Wright—Heat, Reservoir Dogs, Bullitt to name only a few—but they aren't simply repurposed for a modern audience, they're used as a base for Wright to subvert expectation and build his own iconic sequences. Most impressive is the means in which music is integrated into the proceedings. The action is not only choreographed and edited in synch with the tunes, but also often dictated by the song chosen by our titular protagonist (the charismatic Ansel Elgort). There's a refreshing focus on practical effects that enhances the excitement too; witnessing high-octane, frenetic car chases knowing they were executed for real is exhilarating, highlighting the fact that CGI is not a necessity in crafting superb action flicks. Having written the script as well, Wright deserves even more praise for creating a collection of quirky, dangerous and exciting characters, then nailing his cast selection with a crop of ridiculously talented actors who make them memorable. Elgort makes quiet cool as Baby, Jamie Foxx brings an electric volatility to criminal Bats, Lily James is charming as girl-next-door Debora, Jon Hamm and Elsa Gonzalez are slick and sexy as Buddy and Darling, and Spacey amps up the sneering menace to record heights. Boasting adrenaline-pumping set pieces, a plethora of unforgettable characters, endlessly quotable dialogue and a soundtrack for the ages, Baby Driver is a fresh, fun and unique cinematic offering by a filmmaker clearly at the top of his game.",Baby Driver
122,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,2017's Best Action Film!,10,25 July 2017,"Baby Driver is a one-of-a-kind movie; Edgar Wright is still one of the 21st Century's best directors and easily among the most creative as well. Baby Driver is like his previous films but unique as well; it's got some genuinely funny moments mixed in with tense drama and action sequences. It starts off with ease, but by the time you get a third into the movie it cranks up the gears and doesn't slow down! This film is pretty damn fun, a bit shocking, and has got some of the best bit-gags in an action movie in recent memory. Imagine the characterization and wit of Hot Fuzz mixed in with the crime-thriller vibe of Heat, with a dash of Nicolas Refn's Drive car-chases, and you have Baby Driver: one of the year's cutting-edge movies. This is a hybrid genre-film that knows when to even out action with character drama and humor; and the result is a seamlessly entertaining film.This movie is an achievement and is sure to be cited as a modern classic down the track. Who knows? All I know is that I loved this film; and it deserves to be seen at the movies.",Baby Driver
123,pyrocitor,"That's not bolognaise, Baby",9,10 July 2017,"Action movies are musicals!It's an idea that's titillated film studies scholars for years - characters expressing themselves through the elaborate, narrative-pausing spectacle of shootouts and car chases in lieu of song and dance breaks. But it takes a director as fastidiously committed and immaculately mad as Edgar Wright to properly literalize the idea. And in his hands, rock-steady but drumming with excitement, we have Baby Driver - a movie as unabashedly nostalgic as it is fresh and innovative, hat-tipping to the era of Steve McQueen cool while pushing the envelope past pastiche and parody into new frontiers for the 'car chase film,' or even action genre. It's also one of the most infectiously kinetic, technically flawless, and uproariously fun times had at the movies in years - a Fast and the Furious for film buffs, conductors, and any adjacent audiences swept along for the ride.You know that feeling of cathartic exhilaration and deep satisfaction you get watching a particularly well-edited music video, that synchronizes action beats to the timing of the song? Wright kicks that out of the park with a pulse-pounding opening heist/chase, already the most thrilling thing seen in years. Already, it's impossible not to marvel at how painstaking each movement (right down to the eyes!), sound effect, and action is matched to the song - if the adrenaline rush left any space for conscious admiration, that is. And then. He just. Keeps. Going. That's right - Every Single Cut in Baby Driver is precisely synchronized with the timing of an almost wall-to-wall soundtrack awesome enough to make Quentin Tarantino and Peter Quill tap their toes in envy, like a retro-Hollywood Stomp. Even the soundtrack-free dialogue sequences are so precisely timed they carry a 4/4 rhythm and keep the beat like scat interludes (listen carefully, and you can practically hear Kevin Spacey conducting his own soliloquies). It's a remarkable, unprecedented feat of mad scientist editing that is an almost deliriously impressive feat to behold in a Hollywood film - a nearly two-hour pop-rock-funk-soul opera bursting at the seams with slick style and exuberant joie-de-vivre. Call it a gimmick if you will, but I dare to to find a gimmick as meticulous, committed, and downright rip-roaring-fun.And as for the story amidst the spectacle? Wright is a careful and ingenious enough writer to ensure he's in the driver's seat in regards to 'one last job' clichés rather than letting them drive him. He pumps in enough twists, turns, a laundry list of pop culture winks, and moments of savagely bonkers humour (come for the Michael Meyers; stay for the Monsters Inc.) into the overly familiar framework to keep it as fresh and interesting as can be. Certainly there are nitpicks - a couple of third act reversals are so earnest and contrived it's almost sweet, while Wright's unfortunate trend in vastly under-writing female leads continues with Lily James' Deborah, who, despite James' radiant charm, is transparently a plot-propelling prop rather than organic character. Still - when we're strapped to the hood of Baby's chariot, slamming around the city with some of the most plentiful, playful, and voraciously fun car chases of the past several decades (amazingly, without a lick of CGI, a-la Mad Max: Fury Road), all the more dizzying through Wright's trademark hyperkinetic, whip-pan editing and concussive sound effects? A more bonkers, spectacle-ridden action climax than the average budget-bloated blockbuster, even more dazzling by being purely done with practical effects? Watching Baby ricochet a barbed wire road block into a pursuing cop car mid-turn, still in time with The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's ""Bellbottoms?"" Three words: F*cking. Cool. As. Hell ('oh sh*t; that's four words'). Wright's cast all excel at embodying their bevy of '90s Tarantino film archetypes' with as much slick charisma and idiosyncratic oddness to ensure their walking through predictable beats is anything but predictable. As the titular vehicular savant, Ansel Elgort proves himself an enigmatic leading man for the ages, hitting the perfect balance between unflappable, impassive cool and goofy charisma. Watching him sashay his way across town in a long take tracking shot - itself a playful riff on the opening to Wright's Shaun of the Dead - to the Harlem Shuffle may be one of the most irreverently joyful sequences to grace screens this year. Kevin Spacey could play his 'steely but paternal' mob boss in his sleep, were his articulate eloquence and exquisite comedic timing not signs of his being very much awake. Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm both steal scenes with tremendous aplomb, each nailing an impeccable balance of being tremendously unpredictable and frightening and deadpan hilarity, while Eiza González provides a steady, smirking foil for their hamming (no pun intended, I swear). Finally, Jon Bernthal aces his 'seething mug' Punisher shtick in an extended cameo both disappointingly and amusingly short, while CJ Jones is charm incarnate as Baby's foster father. Baby Driver may be Edgar Wright's most accessible, albeit least personal work of his astonishingly airtight career (indeed, memories of his having preemptively taken the p*ss out of the genre with Hot Fuzz are inescapable). But, apart from a couple of over-earnest plot contrivances, it only furthers his title as the industry's most inventive, fiendishly playful, and inconceivably immaculate maverick still working. So strap in for the most audaciously exhilarating and stupidly fun romp of the summer so far. Firing your gun in the air during a high speed pursuit while yelling ""AAAAHHHHH"" optional. Vroom vroom.-9/10",Baby Driver
124,seymourblack-1,A Breath of Fresh Air,10,3 April 2018,"Fuelled by music, humour and full-on action, ""Baby Driver"" hits the screen like a breath of fresh air and in the process provides that old Hollywood staple, ""the heist movie"", with one of its most exciting makeovers ever. A terrific collection of songs provides the heartbeat for the action and some outstanding car chases provide the excitement. That's not all, however, because its humour, romantic interludes and the importance of the central character's relationships, together ensure that ""Baby Driver"" also has plenty of heart and soul.Music-loving getaway driver, Baby (Ansel Elgort) has worked for Atlanta crime boss Doc (Kevin Spacey) ever since, at a very young age, he was naïve enough to steal Doc's Mercedes complete with some very valuable ""junk in the trunk"". His exceptional driving skills were so impressive, even at that early stage of his career, that Doc immediately recruited him to work for his outfit. During his employment as a super-skilled wheelman working on a series of heists that Doc masterminds, he's earned regular money (which he stashes away under the floorboards of the apartment he shares with his foster dad) and has also paid off most of the debt that he owes to Doc as a result of his transgression with the Mercedes.Baby is an orphan whose parents were killed in the car accident that left him with the ""hum in the drum"" (tinnitus) that he has since counteracted by using his collection of I-Pods to drown out the noise. His mother was a talented singer who was physically abused by his father and he still thinks of her regularly and misses her greatly. Since losing his parents, he has lived with his kind, good-natured foster dad, Joe (C.S. Jones), who quietly despairs about Baby's involvement in crime but also relies on him more than ever since he's become deaf and elderly.At ""Bo's Diner"", where his mother used to work, he meets and falls for a young waitress called Debora (Lily Jones) and despite them spending their first date at a Laundromat, they get on well with Debora also having had the experience of caring for a parent and saying ""it might seem tough now, but when they're gone, you miss having someone to care for"". By the time they're out on their second date, Baby's under the impression that he no longer has to work for Doc because he's paid off his full debt but Doc doesn't see it that way and threatens to harm Joe and Debora if Baby doesn't co-operate.With his ear-buds always plugged-in and his natural reticence, Baby is seen as the outsider of the gang and is viewed with suspicion by the other gang-members who openly question his mental well-being and encourage him to not pick up the phone if Doc invites him to take part in any further jobs. By contrast, Doc has absolutely no doubts about his intelligence or the value of his other skills.Doc's modus operandi involves changing his gang-members for each new heist and likewise, he decides that, for their next job, they should acquire some new ""hardware"" but when the gang, including Baby, meet a group of arms dealers to do this, things turn chaotic and the dealers all end up dead. The heist that follows then goes equally badly and from that point on, things degenerate into the storm of violence that eventually brings the gang's activities to a definite end.The chases and stunts in this movie are incredibly well-staged and tremendous fun to watch. It's also enjoyable to see how Baby changes gear and hits the accelerator during one of his getaways in time to the tune that he's playing on his I-Pod and similarly, when he's on the coffee run for the gang, the way he walks, weaves and swerves between the other people on the street is all synchronised to the rhythm of his music. There's also another great moment in the Laundromat sequence when he and Debora are seen foot-tapping together in time to T-Rex.Jon Bernthal, Eiza Gonzalez, Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx are all superb as fellow gang-members and Kevin Spacey brings great authority to his role as a criminal who has survived well over the years by being exceptionally smart and ruthless but when events expose his Achilles heel (he's an old romantic), it makes him change his behaviour and as a consequence, he puts himself in danger.It's really rare to see such a slick, stylish and smart movie that so naturally emits so much energy, excitement and exhilaration. It's a real thrill-ride from start to finish and is unquestionably one of the freshest and best crime movies to have been released in recent years.",Baby Driver
125,miguelneto-74936,"a fun, creative movie where the music guides the character.",9,8 October 2017,"Baby Driver is one of the best movies of the year so far, directed by the talented Edgar Wright, is a very creative film, not having the story as a highlight, is a fun movie and with great action scenes, the cast is very well chosen, all the actors are great, the direction of the Wright great, he is the great differential of the film, if it were not the director, I'm sure he does not series the same thing, the soundtrack is great, the characters are very good, some very funny, the Ansel Elgort who plays Baby is very good and the chemistry of the character with Debora who played by Lily James is very good, what I think the most incredible in the film is how the music connects with the movie, is the type of movie to see more than 1 time to get the references, Baby Driver is a great movie, sins in the script, but hits in the right direction.

126,Jeremy_Urquhart,A mostly good movie that frustrates because it could have been amazing,6,4 March 2020,"I saw Baby Driver for the first time close to three years ago now, back when it came out in cinemas. I remembered enjoying a good deal about it, but I've never found myself loving it; certainly not in the same way I've loved and still love Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and even Scott Pilgrim VS The World. Maybe my expectations were too high, I thought to myself. Because those last four Edgar Wright movies were so good, maybe I had hyped myself up too much for Baby Driver.Having rewatched it now, only about a week ago, without a level of hype and with an open mind, I have to say, it still disappoints in many regards. HOWEVER: it's not a bad movie. Not by a long shot. There are things it does really well and I'll get to them of course, but I think it's the fact that it does so much right while also being slightly off in some regards that makes it feel disappointing. With just a few tweaks, I have no doubt this could be on the same level as the four aforementioned Edgar Wright movies, because ultimately, it's not too far behind (like I said: STILL A GOOD MOVIE).So what's good? Well, most of the stuff the movie has always been praised for. It's got an inventive soundtrack, done in the Tarantino-style where many of the songs are relatively obscure (sure there are artists like The Beach Boys and Queen in there, but nothing as well-known as God Only Knows or Bohemian Rhapsody, respectively). I don't think it's done quite as well as Tarantino has pulled off in some of his best movies, but the soundtrack's there and it's pretty good overall. Some sequences are edited to the music (but not all, which was somewhat disappointing), and these were really impressive on a first watch, but sometimes a little gimmicky on a second watch. I guess the film has a bold, colourful, visually pleasing look, at least as good as all of Wright's other films. When compared to his other work, Baby Driver probably has the best action sequences too, with two very good car chases near the start (wish we'd gotten at least one more though), and an exciting shoot-out and on-foot chase later in the movie. It satisfies visually, and for the most part satisfies as an action movie, and these combined with the snappy editing and music largely serves to keep the movie from being truly boring.Although something that doesn't help in this regard is the screenplay. It's easily Wright's weakest, and I do realise he was trying to branch out, and write something a little less comedic, but to me the tone is a mess. It's not funny enough to feel like a comedy, but it's too wacky and reliant on clichés (maybe in a self-aware way? I don't always know to be honest) to be taken seriously in the same way you might be able to take a movie a sort of similar film like Drive seriously. Take the opening scene: the title character jams out and lip syncs to music in his car while he waits for the criminals he drives to finish their heist. Is this supposed to be funny? Is he supposed to be cool here? Are we supposed to be laughing at him, or with him? Are we even supposed to be laughing?The comedy in Wright's previous films was always done incredibly well. It's a shame there's little comedy here, because of how funny those movies were, and it's a shame there isn't genuine drama or even much tension in this film in place of the comedy. Somehow, Wright balanced comedy and drama in those previous movies so well that they were both funnier and more emotionally potent than Baby Driver. Shaun of the Dead and The World's End in particular both have some surprisingly heart-wrenching moments that somehow mesh perfectly well with the comedy. In Hot Fuzz's case, it has a legitimately fantastic twist that is far more engaging than any curveball thrown by Baby Driver, and Scott Pilgrim has more style (arguably too much) and in a way, more to say (about modern day relationships) than Baby Driver has to say about pretty much anything.The confusing tone doesn't help the performances here either. I don't want to blame any performers specifically here because I'm not confident Wright had the best handle on his material in the first place. Jamie Foxx overacts, Ansel Elgort is a bit boring as a protagonist, and Lily James is disappointing, probably because she's given the weakest and most poorly written character in the film by far. Because of the latter case, I'm not sure how at fault Foxx and Elgort are. Jon Hamm is good though, and as much as I hate saying it post-#MeToo, Spacey does do a decent job for what he's given.But yeah, when it comes to all the stuff with Lily James' character: it's honestly close to awful. I remember not loving the romance stuff the first time I watched the film, but the second time, it was sometimes wince inducing. Again, because of the lack of self-awareness (at least from what I can tell), I think we're supposed to take the instant relationship between her and Baby seriously, but I couldn't buy it for a second. Their first conversation is so bad, and the kind of thing that feels like it was written by a teenager who is still yet to form a relationship with somebody. Her willingness to go along with Baby's insane lifestyle while barely questioning it might have been believable with a goofier, more light-hearted tone, but because so much of the movie seems to want to be taken seriously, it makes the romance subplot really unconvincing and even uncomfortable.So if the movie had been either funnier, or more serious, or done without a romance subplot, or had just contained another car chase or two, I think it could have been better. There is so much wrong here that could have been fixed with some more work on the screenplay; things that could've been tweaked to make the film flow more, and be either funnier or more emotionally satisfying. The fact this is both Wright's least funny and least emotionally engaging film is so disappointing. He usually does both so well in all his other movies, and so his failure to do so here is baffling. I'm curious rather than excited about his next film, because it's apparently a non-comedic horror movie. He's still a great director, so at the very least, I'm sure it will move well and look good in a similar way to Baby Driver. But if he doesn't nail the tone again, and fails once more to make something that isn't going for laughs, then I'll be disappointed.And I know I'm overall in the minority, because Baby Driver was well received and regarded by most as just as good as his other films. I had some grievances I had to write down and get out of my system though, and for all my problems, I'll once again reiterate that Baby Driver does a good deal of things very well. I just hope I love Wright's future work the same way I loved the four films he made prior to Baby Driver, because it wasn't one I can say I love the same way I can for his others. I may be being pedantic, and I can't speak for everyone, but there are my thoughts on Baby Driver, close to three years in the making I guess...",Baby Driver
127,areatw,Cool idea but it falls well short of its potential,5,24 September 2017,"'Baby Driver' was probably the movie I was most looking forward to seeing this year. The trailers looked awesome and with a director as talented as Edgar Wright at the helm, my expectations were high. Unfortunately, after a great start and a memorable opening sequence, it gradually falls away. The film is so obsessed with its style and appearance that it completely forgets to do what all movies are supposed to - entertain.The plot is, in a word, rubbish. I can't believe Edgar Wright went from thinking up something as brilliantly original as 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' to a generic car chase action flick like 'Baby Driver'. If you take away the music, this film has already been done dozens of times before. The main character is also remarkably uninteresting. I don't know if the actor is to blame here, but 'Baby' spends 90% of the film just standing there looking smug. I found the character boring and a bad rip-off of Ryan Gosling's intriguing character in 'Drive'.",Baby Driver

129,proud_luddite,okay but done before,6,13 January 2018,"Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a boyish, young man caught up in Atlanta's crime scene. As he is indebted to a crime-lord (Kevin Spacey), his expert driving skills are exploited as a getaway driver for various robberies. Baby would eventually like to go ""straight"" but the crime-lord won't allow this.""Baby Driver"" is a competent film: the story is consistent and sometimes exciting; the acting is good; the main character is interesting; the car chases and criminal showdowns are well done; and it has a superb soundtrack (Baby has to constantly listen to music due to a traumatic incident in his childhood).With all the praise in the above paragraph, a rating of at least three stars should be in order. But it goes down a half notch for a couple of reasons. As a film that is dependent on car chases and shoot-'em-ups, ""Baby Driver"" would inevitably be compared to the hundreds of others that have already been done in this genre. More unique films that advance this well-worn genre would deserve a three-star rating or higher. While not quite formulaic, ""Baby Driver""'s depth goes only so far.

131,one9eighty,Loves itself that much it should get a room with itself,4,17 July 2018,"FTR this review does have spoilers - that's because I had a lot to write and get off my chest.Baby (Ansel Elgort) has somehow wronged (Kevin Spacey) Doc and to make up for it he is being used as a getaway driver, after all, he's the best there is (apparently). While this is generally okay as he's a damn good driver, it's also bad as it's exposing him to a world of crime and danger that a young man of his age shouldn't be exposed to. Baby is obsessed with music (he produces his own music), he has been since he was young, it also helps him cover a medical condition, he loves nothing more than dancing through life, whether it's putting a soundtrack to the crimes he's forced to support, caring for his deaf foster father, or falling for a local waitress. After all the hype and promos in the lead up to this I actually expected this to be an all singing and all dancing driving movie - unfortunately I wasn't blown away. The film was enjoyable and had some slick driving scenes, but it wasn't anything new, or exciting. The plot starts ok, but then quickly becomes pretty standard, before it becomes fairly dull and predictable. Some of the characters were weak and didn't feel convincing and some were just outright annoying, in some instances they drifted between delivery of emotions worse than Baby's lane discipline when outrunning the cops. I know it was supposed to be a 'car' movie rather than a character movie - but I'm afraid, for me, it was neither. Let's start with Baby himself, I found myself wanting to punch him in the throat at the start of the film for trying to be smug and cool - he's young, hip, music making, fast car driving, street dancing, free-running, caring, plucky and lucky (vomited yet?). Towards the end of the film I really wanted him to suffer on account of letting his foster dad suffer because he was too scared to step away from the criminal life, despite having the means and evidence to rat them all out, and for bringing Deborah into a world she didn't deserve (as well as just being a general jerk). I didn't feel sorry for him or his back story (dead parents), I didn't think he was sweet for trying to be caring, I didn't think he was enjoyable because he danced in the street to his own beat, I didn't care that he could drive well. Ansel Elgort did a damned fine job of disinteresting me and making me not give a monkey's. Next, Jamie Foxx, he played an out and out nasty piece of stuff in Bats, he's probably the second most featured person in this film so he gets a mention over anyone else. Frankly, he deserved what he got - and I was actually hoping for that outcome sooner in fact. He was the catalyst to everything going wrong but even before that he just upset my film taste-bud's, it was like he was acting out a 80/90's gangster stereotype - come on dude, hasn't society moved on?? Maybe the fact that he angered me so made his performance actually really good and I'm the idiot here?! Griff, JD, Flea pretending to be Flea, Buddy and Darling and others were neither here, nor there. At times they were just 'meh'. Even towards the end of the film when Baby is being hunted down by Buddy for Darling's eventuality (I didn't spoil it) - it didn't feel that passionate or driven. If anything I was surprised that he'd managed to escape soo many cops randomly, take multiple bullet-wounds, and still appear to walk, talk, and balk without trouble - he was a genuine superhero!! Doc is another example of giving mixed emotions; he's sinister, menacing and threatening all the way through the film, but then forgives Baby and sacrifices himself at the end of it (d'oh, I spoiled it). Some of the scenes had no relevance being featured and just ended up being stupid - buying guns from crooked cops, when they already had guns already - why would Doc send them with next to no info, especially with Bats and Baby - hell, why didn't he go himself?!?! Why make Baby 'scope' the post office when he looks guilty as sin, scared as hell and he's the getaway driver and does best off know nothing anyway?!? How stupid is it to find Doc still in the same office after every job, even when things go wrong - d'uh! The only character I felt emotional about (other than the hatred for Bats) was poor Deborah, she was fooled by a potential suiter who claims to be sweet, it turns out he's not as sweet as she was led to believe - loses her job, loses friendship of any colleagues she may have, gets exposed to violence and death, shot at, threatened, kills a man and then has to wait while the person she's fallen in love with spends time behind bars. And FTR, I didn't believe the chemistry between Deborah and Baby; it felt too rushed and unbelievable. They didn't appear infatuated enough to be convinced to run away together after just two or three conversations, in reality I wouldn't expect her to wait for him to be released from prison - but then hey, suspended disbelief and Hollywood ending so I suppose she would. I thought I'd feel sorry for Baby's foster dad he that felt like he was just there to meet a PC quote, he's black, old and disabled - well done, that gets a lot of ticks. I think the film had the potential to be really good, it had some decent action, it was modern and stylish with a good soundtrack - but it felt heartless due to its lack of character substance, and the quick degradation of an interesting plot. It felt to forced and too in love with its own hip-ness.

134,phubbs,Baby Driver,5,20 January 2018,"Stupid name for a heist movie, unless that movie is a kids comedy all about a bloke having to drive babies around during a heist. Or maybe an adult who drives like a baby or some sh*t like that. Why hasn't anyone made a comedy about learner drivers yet? You could call it 'Learner Driver', hey that's not a bad idea (copyrighted). So this is a heist movie. In this movie a mysterious kingpin (?) called Doc (Kevin Spacey) uses various people to pull off various daring jobs, but he always uses the same driver. This driver is a young man called Baby or Miles (Ansel Elgort). Apparently Doc caught Baby breaking into his car many years prior and was so impressed with his skills that he decided to use him for his heists. Naturally Baby had to comply or face the obvious consequences. Now for a long time every heist has gone well for Doc, but clearly that doesn't last and that's the main crux here. So straight away there are various questions here. Firstly, who is Doc exactly? What is this guys deal? Where does he come from? How is he so powerful? What does he do? Nothing is explained about this character and its kinda frustrating because he simply doesn't come across like a bad guy (especially with Spacey's performance). The fact he also makes such glaring mistakes with his decisions also raises questions about how he's managed to gain so much power. Doc uses Baby as a getaway driver despite the fact he's literally only a teenager, or at least in his early 20's. Yeah OK Baby is a good driver, but is that still a good decision? To use such a young person as your heist getaway driver?? I can think of many problems that might arise with that.Doc also claims to never use the same people for each heist, but he does! He also uses Baby for every heist so what is he talking about. Then at one point when the gang suspects Baby of being an informant, and the fact he's being telling his foster father all about their deeds; Doc and co still allow him to carry on being their getaway driver! These are what you call eye rolling movie decisions.Now lets look at Baby, why is he called Baby? Dunno. This young man has tinnitus from an accident as a child (which killed his parents). Since then he's been raised by a black man who is deaf. Is it me or does that sound both unnecessarily pc and kinda counter productive? Would a deaf (apparently single?) man be the right choice to raise a child with tinnitus? I honesty don't know, it just seems like an odd decision, but hey what do I know. So Baby is a good driver, again we don't know how this is, it just is. He's a good driver don't question it. Baby is also very much into his music, mainly because of the tinnitus. He listens to music virtually all the time and uses it to help him concentrate, even on heist jobs. The weird part is he often records people (without consent) and uses snippets of their speech to make mix tapes. Its a very odd part of his character and really doesn't make any sense, or it didn't to me.So things all go wrong for Doc when he uses a (quota pleasing) team consisting of a couple of crooks who are in love, Buddy and Darling (Jon Hamm and Eiza González), and the violent Bats (Jamie Foxx). Of course the highly predictable outcomes are all a result of the highly predictable out of control character Bats. Because a trigger-happy, tattooed, ghetto lunatic is what you need in your specialised heist team, what could go wrong? The other two don't really do much other than smooch, although Buddy does stick up for Baby at times leading you to think he's a good guy. All the while Doc is supposed to be intimidating...but really isn't.What follows is a bog standard turn of events that see the plot holes get bigger and bigger. At one point after discovering one of Baby's mix tapes Bats and Buddy decide to go back to his place to get the rest of his stash, and question his foster father. Bats proceeds to knock Baby out...but how did they then manage to find Baby's place?? When the heist goes wrong and the police react, I don't believe any of the cops actually saw Baby involved in any way. Yet Baby runs off, and continues running even when in the clear, which would obviously cause the police to follow out of suspicion (as they would in reality, if you run you've got something to hide). Baby continues to escape by then carjacking and driving like a lunatic...which again will always make you stick out like a sore thumb. Why do characters in movies never get this?? You wanna blend into a crowd of people or traffic, act or drive normally, don't run or drive like a nut.Anywho the movie is formulaic right down to the last moment where Buddy keeps popping up despite Baby shooting him point blank (in the shoulder?? How did he f*ck that up??). The only thing that got me was the fact Baby didn't go down in a blaze of glory, or escape fully. But then we get this dreadful soppy ending which is even worse so...I find myself baffled by the reaction to this movie, once again I just don't get it. It didn't offer anything much in terms of originality, except for the main protagonist having hearing issues; and everything action wise was terribly average. I think the thing that disappointed me the most was the trailer giving me the impression that Baby drove a Subaru Impreza for the whole movie, which he didn't.5/10",Baby Driver

Edgar Wright never disappoints, and he's done it again with Baby Driver. This is no clichéd action flick. What Wright does here is innovative and badass. It's set to a groovy soundtrack of vinyl crackling hits, mostly from the early sixties. The bullets fly and the cars skid in sync with the songs. The opening sequence of the film is nearly a masterpiece. Right from the first five minutes, you are in love with Baby.. yeah, that's his name.

137,rockman182,Baby Driver (2017),8,2 July 2017,"I'm not the biggest Edgar Wright fan but man, I saw the trailer for this and I knew I had to see this as soon as I could. Everything about it seemed like a good time. I like the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, each film is funny and solid. I absolutely loathed Scott Pilgrim vs The World though and thought it was terrible. I was hoping for the best Wright ever made with Baby Driver and its pretty nice to say I think we are there with this film. I had pretty high hopes and have to say while the film isn't perfect and struggles a bit at the end its still a satisfying ride.The film follows a quiet but expert heist driver named Baby, and his toils in life which include finding love and the high risk/high reward lifestyle he lives as a getaway driver. Baby is constantly listening to music on different iPods to drown out the sound of tinnitus he developed during a traumatic childhood car accident which killed his parents. I really loved the interactions between Baby (Elgort) and Debora (James). I loved Lily James in Cinderella but I love her even more as the innocent waitress in love here. Side note, but holy cow she really looks like prime Shelly Johnson from Twin Peaks in this.I have to say Edgar Wright puts a wonderful spin on a heist film. Unlike his previous films, the film is really light on comedy and is solely action and style. Its great though. The car weaving scenes are very fun to watch, action scenes edited quite well. As with previous bank heist films the action brings it either with the guns or the frenetic car chases. I have yet to really like Ansel Elgort in something, but this has to be the film that's going to make him a star. I love the characters in this film. Spacey works so well as the leading mastermind behind the heists. Jon Hamm in a villainous role works just as well as Jamie Foxx as Bats. Eiza González is new to me but wow is she such a gorgeous actress, I may actually take up the From Dusk Till Dawn series now.The best touch in the creation of this film is the ever present soundtrack. Almost every part of the film is accompanied by Baby's iPod song. Its fantastically eclectic and does well to keep pace with the film and accompany different moods and themes as the film progresses. Things get a little messy near the end but I think Edgar Wright is somehow still able to keep it coherent and crazy till the end. This is the type of film that needs a second watch. Its possible that it will go down in in rating on a re-watch. However, its also equally possible for this to enter a personal cult status with another viewing. I'd say Edgar Wright did very well with this one.8/10",Baby Driver
138,jon.h.ochiai,It's About the Girl,10,2 July 2017,"""Baby Driver"" is awesome. Ansel Elgort is the star. Elgort is a young Clint Eastwood. He has a quiet gentleness and undeniable power. Ansel was amazing in ""The Fault in Our Stars"". Here he shines brighter than Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Hamm, who are much older and all great. In the opening scene Baby, played by Elgort, races away in robbery getaway heist in his red Mitsubishi with beguiling mastery. He is a protégé of sorts. Writer and Director Edgar Wright goes full throttle from the start, while subtly painting the portrait of his hero Baby. Baby is a kid in his twenties, who is plugged into his headphones from his iPod, to drown out the noise. He has Tinnitus, a ringing in his ears, the result of a tragic car accident when he was a child, revealed in flashback. Wright's car chase sequence is astounding. Baby drives fearlessly, ice water in his veins. However, he drives like a chess master. Wright is brilliant in his layered character reveal. And Elgort's unassuming charisma fuels this. For me the signature scene unfolds when Baby grasps the hand of Jamie Foxx's Bats as he tries to draw his Beretta on the love of his life Debora. Elgort's Baby gazes into the eyes of Bats, ""No."" Elgort has the calm power and resolve embodying Wright's story of love and courage. The most compelling occurs not when ""Baby Driver"" is roaring 140 mph, rather in the blossoming romance of Baby and waitress Debora, played by radiant and beautiful Lily James. Baby records Debora singing in his favorite diner. Then the two talk about their favorite music and song. Debora and Baby are sweet and kind to each other. Spectacular car chases and automatic weapons battles aside, ""Baby Driver"" is really 'about the girl'. As with most great stories, this is usually true. Kevin Spacey is Doc, the robbery maestro who orchestrates the mayhem. His star driver is Baby. Doc's crew includes the couple Buddy and Darling, played by solid Jon Hamm and Eliza Gonzalez. Baby teams with Bats, played by calculated cold Jamie Foxx, for one more job to get straight in the bond beholding him to his boss and mentor Doc. Thinking he is free, and be with Debora, Baby soon discovers that ""straight"" doesn't mean done for Doc. Baby lives with his deaf and wheelchair bound guardian Joseph, played by kind C.J. Jones. They touchingly converse in sign language. In the amazing dance sequence Baby makes a sandwich for Joseph, while plugged into his tunes. The music not only tones ""Baby Driver"", it defines it. Director Wright seamlessly atmospheres the songs ranging from Barry White, Lionel Richie to Queen as the provocative narrative. At times the movie is an elegant musical with song and dance set amidst mesmerizing action. This is distinctly ""Baby Driver""'s art and profound charm. Betrayal, conspiracy, and gunfire abound in Wright's visual portrait. The sharp furious dialogue of Doc, Bats, Buddy, and Darling are captivating, though ultimately for show. Really, this is ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" This only accentuates the quiet and measured eloquence of Baby. Baby knows he is cursed as a thief, lives by a code, and lives for love. Kevin Spacey is surprising and powerful as Doc. He reveals not as we expect, displaying nobility in the end. Like both Spacey and Elgort, ""Baby Driver"" is a surprise. Yes, it is the visual adrenaline thrill ride. What touches most: ""Baby Driver"" is about the girl.",Baby Driver
139,phanthinga,Baby Driver is your new favorite movie,10,29 June 2017,Edgar Wright is one of my favorite movie director in the world.With Scott Pilgrim at number 1 in my favorite movie of 2010 when i hear he gonna direct a new movie after a long time i immediately check it out as soon as it hit my country and i gotta say:Yeah this movie definitely is one of Edgar best work yet.To fully enjoy this movie i suggest viewer go to the theater completely blind and know nothing about the plot cause that what i did and it paid off very well.With Edgar unique visual directing style the movie nearly about 2h but it very fast paced and packed with so much awesome things so it very re watchable.Although the plot being done a million time before so you kinda know how it gonna end and how the characters being played but with Edgar dialogue style the movie always know when it need to be serious and when it need to be funny.All the characters interact with each other very smooth.Ansel Elgort for the first time i saw him on the big screen is brilliant as Baby the main character that relate very much to me.With a cast full of A-list actors seeing them each have their own backstory and mystery also please me a lot and add so much weight to the movie.With all the thing i list up there i highly recommend it for everyone,Baby Driver
140,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"A standard heist film with fun music, engaging characters, and flashy driving.",8,8 March 2019,"There are so many ""heist"" films nowadays that it's practically its own genre, with all the tropes and clichés that go with it. Consequently, when I learned that Edgar Wright had directed a heist film, my interest was piqued. Best known for his parody comedies, Shaun of the Dead(2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), and The World's End (2013), the film of his I have enjoyed the most is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010). His style is distinct throughout these films, which is what I was hoping for in Baby Driver (2017).While Wright's visual style is present in Baby Driver, it is muted, almost in the background of the standard heist framework. With an almost 1980's undertone, Baby Driver takes many cues from its predecessor, Drive (2011). Both feature an almost silent heist driver as the main character and plenty of entertaining driving sequences that are practically ballet on the boulevards. Fortunately, both films also focus on the characters, and not so much on the heist, giving personality to their actions. Aside from the likable and titular Baby (Ansel Elgort), Kevin Spacey seems to be satiated through all the scenery he chews (to entertaining effect), and Jon Hamm was almost recognizable with his rough stubble and attitude.Granted, Baby Driver is not the goofball comedy I expected. Instead, the film is almost musical, revealing the rhythm in everything by overlaying the action on screen with a curated set-list of obscure and catchy tunes. Sure, the film feels more ""mainstream,"" but it's also trying to do something new. Synching up bullets to rhythms and wads of cash to downbeats almost goes unnoticed unless you're taking in the whole experience. At the very least, we know what music Edgar Wright likes, and I must say that I approve (especially of the ""Hocus Pocus"" sequence, which is a song that should be in more action sequences (like Robocop (2014) did to similar effect)).A standard heist film with fun music, engaging characters, and flashy driving, I give Baby Driver 4.0 stars out of 5.",Baby Driver
141,RforFilm,Baby Driver is one of the best of 2017. It's musically-synced story to car chases are perfection,10,28 June 2017,"Let's talk about Edgar Wright. He is clearly a fan of the movies, given how much he references them in his own work. Heck, his Cornetto trilogy films (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World's End) are love letters to various genres while telling good stories about friendships. But his work has come of the best editing that I've seen. Not only is he good at creating speed and pace, but his use of sound (and not just music, but little sound effects) makes his work rewatchable just so that you can catch every little joke he threw in. Baby Driver continues his plight to pay tribute to his favorite American movies. In the case of driving movies like Smokey and the Bandit and thief movies like Heat and Reservoir Dogs, their legacy is felt, along with more hits as a comedy. This also happens to be Edgar Wright's first American movie, so you could tell he wanted to make something that would please his fans and a mainstream audience, likely hoping that this will lead to bigger things. I for one have been excited to see Baby Driver and how entertaining it could be as a car movie. Getaway driver ""Baby"" (played by Ansel Elgort) works for criminal mastermind Doc (played by Kevin Spacy) as the best driver for bank robbers in Atlanta. Baby seems to get himself in the mindset by constantly playing music, depending on his mood and situation. This extends to his home life where he cares for his foster father, but also mixes his recorded conversations into songs. His recent mission with robbers ""Buddy"" (played by Jon Hamm), ""Griff"" (played by Jon Bernthal) and ""Darling"" (played by Eliza González), gets him closer to settling whatever debt he has with Doc. Baby seems to be finding some new happiness with waitress Debora (played by Lilly James) who has a similar interest in music. To top it off, after performing a mission with ""Bats"" (played by Jamie Foxx), Baby thinks that his life of crime is finally over. Doc quickly visits him to tell him that is far from the truth. Baby agrees to be the getaway driver for a mission involving the US Postal service before secretly escaping with Debora. Like any good movie, several things go wrong and it's now a chase for Baby to escape his fellow robbers and the police. Baby Driver is exactly what I think about when I define ""cinematic fun"". Like a lot of Edgar Wright's previous movies, it's all orchestrated in musical perfection. While this is not a musical, the constant songs are almost like a character in the movie, giving us a reminder how music can make or break a film. The first five minutes perfectly set up the comedic, but badass tone with the use of ""Bellbottoms"" by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. The movie keeps up it's fast pace throughout the hour and fifty minute runtime. Think of this as a modern day American Graffiti if it had bank robbers. The casting is a rare complete perfection. I cannot think of one person that was not right for the part. Ansel Elgort is very likable and charming as the young driver. He manages to carry the weight of this character's ear problem that makes him listen to his music (which I didn't mention before, but didn't want to spoil too much of). Performances from Kevin Spacy, Jamie Fox and Lilly James are good, though my favorite was of Jon Hamm for reasons that I can't give away without spoiling. Let's just say that the role of the main villain is not who you think. You may be surprised to learn that while there are a lot of car chases, a majority of the action does not happen till the second half. The first takes a great deal of time getting to know our characters, and the relationship that happens between Baby and Debora. If I had to make any criticism of some sort, I wish that Lilly James would have been given a little more to do, even though they make her a good ""damsel in distress"" type for the purpose of the story. Aside from that, I can guarantee that Baby Driver is already on my future list of favorite movies of 2017.I'll give this ten classic IPods out of ten. I have a hard time imagining that anyone will hate Baby Driver. It's very entertaining that's timed to perfection, like our story's bank robbers. I can only say to get in the car and see thisin the theater. We need more original content like this.",Baby Driver

There's a level of violence that might be a problem, but it's more like video game violence or cartoon violence where the coyote comes back for more. Director, writer Edgar Wright gets the credit for creating a unique entertaining world. Ansel Elgort gives an outstanding understated performance as Baby. The supporting cast is right on even if some are so well known you feel like you are watching Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx rather then the characters they play.The technical aspects are award worthy. The sound and sound editing are amazing. The cinematography outstanding. The art direction and costume design add to the slick look.

143,juliankennedy23,Nobody put Baby in a Corolla,9,18 March 2018,"Baby Driver is an action heist film from too talented by half director Edgar Wright who made Shaun of the Dead and Scott Pilgrim among others. Our main character Baby is a talented get away driver who is a little off, a little young, and who listens to music on an old ipod all the time to cover for his tinnitus that he got in a tragic childhood incident. The plot itself is a simple affair that would not be out of place in a Grand Theft Auto movie adaptation. Baby needs to do ""one more job"" for creepy boss Kevin Spacey (who lets face ot is even creepier in the role now)while his heist mates are heavily tattooed, unstable violent sociopaths that are often not all that bright. Baby has fallen for a diner waitress who shares his love of music and road trips and a they plan to drive off into the sunset after his task is completed. I am sure this will go smoothly. The Good: Some movies are extremely well directed and you are never the wiser except perhaps in retrospect (Logan Lucky). Other movies are extremely well directed and are not afraid to shout this out during the film (Dunkirk). Baby Driver is definitely in the latter category. From the opening one shot where the scenery and character and extras are all perfectly timed to the music to the driving sequences done in real time without CGI the every minute detail direction is all over the place. The is a finely crafted film.Baby Driver is also an entertaining film. If a film adaptation of say Grand Theft Auto V sounds entertaining to you it is because it is. By making our protagonist a little off and hos cohorts so very violent it creates tension in scenes where lesser films would have none. It also has a decent sense of humor with a ""Halloween"" mask gag being particularly funny. Needless to say a decent soundtrack as well.
The Bad: Emma Stone was originally supposed to play the diner waitress in the film (she did La La land instead) and the movie suffers for it. Lily James does her best but simply cannot overcome an underwritten role.
In Conclusion: Kevin Spacey probably cost this film a best director Oscar nomination and a host of other end of the year accolades. His scenes can be be awkward or unintentionally funny in hindsight. I liked this movie more upon reflection than right after the original viewing (Yes the ending grated on me as well) and some of the hokier heartstring tugging scenes left me a bit cold. Some people will have a visceral dislike of this movie and I get that. It is a truly artificial construct with a lead character that seems to morph as the script dictates. I liked the little touches, the music, the fun cameos and the overall ride. It really is the Grand Theft Auto V film adaptation I didn't know I wanted by a director who never fails to entertain.",Baby Driver

145,Anurag-Shetty,"A head-banging, foot-tapping & insane ride!",10,4 July 2017,"Baby Driver tells the story of Baby(Ansel Elgort). Baby is a car driver who works for a crime boss named, Doc(Kevin Spacey). Baby acts as a getaway driver for all the bank robbers who take part in heists, planned by Doc. After a bunch of successful heists, Baby wants out. However, Doc has other plans for him. Baby Driver is a mind blowing film. Writer & director Edgar Wright has given us a one of a kind action-packed thrill ride, that will keep you on the edge of your seat, throughout. The songs in the movie are extremely catchy & are in total sync with the proceedings on screen. The music of the film, is a character by itself. The car chase scenes are spectacular. What's even more impressive is the fact that, they were all shot practically & with no CGI. The highlight of the movie, is the climactic set piece. The performances are flawless. Ansel Elgort is outstanding as Baby. Elgort puts in a riveting performance & plays a completely different character, that is nothing like his breakout role in The Fault in Our Stars(2014). Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Doc. Lily James is excellent as Debora. Eiza Gonzalez is great as Darling. Jon Hamm is fantastic as Buddy. Jamie Foxx is hysterical as Bats. Jon Bernthal is awesome in his cameo, as Griff. Baby Driver is a must watch for everyone, who wants to watch something unique in this world of adaptations, reboots, remakes & sequels.

146,bankofmarquis,"VERY Original, VERY fun",9,2 July 2017,"Walking into the movie BABY DRIVER, I had heard some strong superlatives - ""very original"", ""haven't ever seen anything like it"", ""a thrilling combination of action and music"".  So, when I went into the Cineplex to see what the fuss was all about, I sat in my seat with my arms crossed and said ""prove it"".And ""prove it"" they did.BABY DRIVER is a ""very original"" film that combines music and action in such a way that I have not seen before.  Writer/Director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) has a unique vision with the look, feel and storytelling style of this film and delivers - strongly - on all accounts.Starring Ansel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars, Divergent) as Baby who is a getaway driver for a ""crime boss"".  Due to an accident as a youth, Baby has Tinnitus - a constant ringing in his ears - and copes with it by drowning the ringing out with constant music playing through his earbuds.  Consequently, we see the world through Baby's eyes - or more accurately - we experience the world through Baby's ears and so almost the entirety of the action that unfolds in front of us is played to a musical soundtrack that plays out of Baby's i-Pod.Elgort's performance as Baby is strong - keeping the emotion going on his face, even though he has a tendency to not say much.  Director Wright was smart to realize that the color of this film would have to come from the criminals that are in Baby's world - and he casts extremely strong actors to portray these crooks.  Starting with Kevin Spacey as the crime boss who brings crooks together for a job.  Spacey shows that he still ""has it"" and brings a strong screen presence to every scene he is in.Ably assisting in this ""rogues gallery""  are Jon Hamm (in his best role since MadMen), Jon Bernthal  (his usual menacing self), relative unknown (at least to me) Eiza Gonzalez (who is more than ""just a pretty face"" here) and Flea (yes, Flea!).  All of these performances are strong, but they pale in comparison to the ""jump off the screen"" performance of Jamie Foxx as ""Bats"" a criminal who got that nickname because he is ""Bat-Sh**"" crazy - and he is.Also joining in is Lily James (Cinderella) as Baby's love interest.  I've stated earlier about good and bad chemistry between actors.  James and Elgort HAVE strong chemistry with each other and I believe that they have fallen in love - even though they meet at the beginning of the film.The best part of this film is that these strong performances play a supporting role to the dance that is the combination of music and action.  As I stated earlier, Director Wright brings a singular vision to the screen and this vision plays out marvelously over the 1 hour 53 minutes playing time - never wearing out it's welcome and knowing when to get off the screen.This film isn't for everyone - it is ACTION and MUSIC with strong characters.  But, if you like this sort of thing (and I do) it is a very ORIGINAL entry into this genre.Letter Grade:  A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Baby Driver

149,joebloggscity,Fun ride homage with a great heart,8,2 July 2017,"I got to say that the mainstream cinema has been for me a letdown of late, and the better films have been really those under the bridge where I've found a few gems (e.g. Raw).Baby Driver is an antidote to the poor and identikit set of films released by the majors, and I hope it influences others to think outside the box.As with other Edgar Wright movies, this film is a homage to many favourites of years go by (I'd say major influences are Res Dogs + Gdns of Glxy + Point Blank = Baby Driver), but this is still a fine movie.We have a mostly light hearted and tender movie, as our lead with his obsession with his iPod music collection to help drown out tinnitus, is caught up in a world that is way too far for him. He's an incredible getaway driver, but the heist world is too much for him. He falls in love and it's a race to find a way out, not easy.It's funny, it's cruel, it's got a great soundtrack and great empathetic characters that are well fleshed out. Jamie Foxx is a cruel heist colleague and really ramps up the tension.The only problems are the derivative aspects to it, but that's part of the joy as it brings out memories of all favourites. It pays homage without ripping off. The first 30mins I got the impression that it would be too light hearted, but it does ram up heavily after that and the story picks up pace. Very good stuff.For a film to watch in the cinema, I can't think of too much better in the mainstream. It's not by any means perfect, but all who go to watch it will enjoy it.It's also great to see personal favourite The Damned get one of their songs out there for others to hear. Wonderful from the film makers. Give the film a chance.",Baby Driver

The action takes centre stage, but the plot and script are not just an afterthought. The actors look like they are enjoying their roles and it is a really entertaining ride. Definitely worth checking out.",Baby Driver
151,swilliky,"Brilliant, funny, and highly entertaining",9,27 June 2017,"Car chases and music fill the streets of Edgar Wright's fun and action-packed film. In what feels like it could be one of the best movies of the summer, Baby (Ansel Elgort) speeds around Atlanta while listening to music and even when he walks on the streets, he is completely in step with the rhythm. Nothing throws him off as he pulls off a series of heists for the gangster leader Doc (Kevin Spacey). He works with various crews that include hard boiled robbers like Griff (Jon Bernthal), Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza González), and Bats (Jamie Foxx). After the initial chase, Baby has nearly paid back Doc with only one more job required and during the time between he stays at home with his foster dad Joseph (CJ Jones).Baby is starstruck when he sees Debora (Lily James) a waitress at a 24-hour diner. They form a quick bond in scenes that ooze romantic chemistry as both young actors deliver charming performances under the brilliant direction. The music doesn't stop and after Baby helps Doc dispose of a body and finally pays him back, he just can't get away. Doc wrangles him into another job with coercive threats and sends him out to scout their next job, a post office. In a hilarious scene, Doc sends his 8-year-old nephew into to help scope out the bank, adding brilliant humor in a tense scene.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Baby Driver

Jamie Foxx was just in the film for a quick paycheck and, like Kevin Spacey, simply dialed in their performance.

155,bob-the-movie-man,A summer film so cool that air-con is optional.,10,21 June 2017,"There's something inherently appealing about the concept of a getaway driver.  A skillful 'bad-boy', but not normally bad enough to actually DO the nasty crime stuff. merely be an active accomplice to it.  As a result, it's a subject that the movies have returned to time after time.  I'm old and crusty enough to remember being wowed at seeing Ryan O'Neal in Walter Hill's ""Driver"" on the big screen in 1978. And well before that, as a kid, my poor departed mother used to be driven crazy by me begging her to take me to see ""The Italian Job"" (the original 1969 version) YET again probably the greatest getaway chase in movie history: I must have seen that film at least 20 times in the cinema. Of course more recently we've also had Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan in ""Drive"" on the same theme. But with Edgar Wright at the helm, a big name cast and an enticing trailer, I had high expectations for ""Baby Driver"" – and boy was I happy! This is such a seriously cool film on so many levels.Opening with a bank heist followed by a kick-ass car chase, we follow 'Baby' (Ansel Elgort, ""Allegiant"", ""The Fault in our Stars"") as a tinnitus-suffering, music-infused getaway driver under the thumb of the criminal overlord Doc (Kevin Spacey, in icy Frank Underwood mode). Doc recruits an ever-changing mix-tape of villains for each job, including the psychopathic and appropriately named 'Bats' (Jamie Foxx, ""Sleepless""), the chillingly dangerous Buddy (Jon Hamm, ""Mad Men"", ""Keeping Up With The Joneses"") and his ""Bonnie-style"" wife 'Darling' (Eiza González) and the moderately incompetent JD (Lanny Joon) (who changed his neck tattoo of ""HATE"" to ""HAT"" since it improved his job prospects. ""everybody loves a hat""!).Baby's life gets more complicated when the hoods become aware of his fledgling relationship with fellow-orphan Debora (Lily James) a waitress in a diner and another lever to keep Baby locked into the job that he is just so, so good at.On the surface this might be perceived as being just another good excuse for a lot of CGI-driven car stunts in the style of ""The Fate of the Furious"". But no. Firstly, as Edgar Wright declared before the special screening I saw, all of the car stunts were actually performed for real on the mean streets of Atlanta (and hats off to the film's stunt coordinator Robert Nagle and his team for these).  And secondly, the car scenes are almost secondary to the fabulous story and character development in the film. The script (also by Edgar Wright) is just brilliant. There are genuinely laugh-out loud moments in the movie, with one of the highlights for me being JD tasked with procuring Michael Myers ""Halloween"" masks for a heist. If you don't find this scene hilarious, you are not human – official.Elgort is really strong in the lead role, and suggested to me that if the role of the young Han Solo in the upcoming Star Wars spin-off hadn't already gone to Alden Ehrenreich, then here was a very strong contender.  All of the supporting roles are strong (as you would expect from such a stellar cast) with Jon Hamm being a standout, appearing truly demonic in the closing scenes.  The one role I was less sure about in the film was that of Lily James, whose performance as the 'sweet as apple pie' waitress seemed a little too ""animated"" for the big screen in the early scenes - I remember an acting class by Michael Caine where he advised that given the size of the movie screen 'stillness was good' sometimes. What works well on the small screen (I am a big fan of her roles in historical TV dramas like ""Downton Abbey"" and the impeccable ""War and Peace"") perhaps sometimes needs modifying for the wide-screen experience. I greatly warmed to her portrayal in the action sequences later on though: she's a great actress and one that this film can hopefully now propel into the higher echelons in Hollywood.Another star of the film is the fabulous soundtrack coordinated by Oscar-winner Steven Price (""Gravity"") featuring (amongst many other classics) Queen's ""Brighton Rock"", Golden Earring's ""Radar Love"", the Simon and Garfunkel classic (obviously) and Bob & Earl's ""Harlem Shuffle"", all used to brilliant effect.  This latter track leads me on to some early Oscar predictions:  if this film doesn't get nominated this year for Oscars for Best Editing (Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss, ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"") and Best Sound Editing (Julian Slater), then there is no God! The ""Harlem Shuffle"" coffee run sequence is a masterclass in editing and direction.  Starting off with what I thought might turn into a tribute to ""Saturday Night Fever"", the scene neatly takes on a style all of its own. It's use of – erm – ""subtitles"" is just brilliant.The often subtle, and occasionally not so subtle, edits between scenes are also truly masterful, making this moviegoer laugh-out-loud with delight periodically at the movie-making skill on display.All of this is orchestrated by Edgar Wright as director who – for me – has been a little inconsistent over the years (loved, loved, loved ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"";  ""The World's End"" – not so much).  Here, he delivers in spades and this film rockets immediately into my Films of the Year list for 2017.  Awe inspiring. Beg, steal, borrow, rob a bank - - do what you have to, but make sure you catch this film on the big screen.(For the full and graphical version of this review please visit bob- the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

158,bopdog,Over-hyped! Tarantino-style wannabe that mostly fails,1,28 June 2017,"Here's a nutshell version why ""Baby Driver"" failed: Director Edgar Wright did some great 'homemade-style' British indie flicks: ""Hot Fuzz,"" ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""World's End."" With Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (and many other great British actors, like Bill Nighy, etc.), the small indie UK movies could be small, because the talent was so huge. They could be a bit 'loose', even sloppy. It was OK with those previous hits, because the wonderful cast filled up the screen for the audience, and kept them entranced. ""Baby Driver"" was simply too big for Wright's casual, loopy style, however. What might seem charming in a casual context can now seem woefully under-developed. The movie came off more as unfocused and an annoying, disjointed ramble (albeit a frenetic one), than creative and edgy.Lots of hype with ""Baby Driver,"" but sadly, it is misplaced. The vaunted soundtrack is meh - 'OK' but not memorable. The music sounded geriatric, as if it was being played on a desk-top stereo by someone's Nan, at her Rest Home on an afternoon when she was feeling frisky. The actors are superb! But the overall theme and direction has mislead them into a no-win confused mess.Yes, there is LOTS of action. LOTS of violence. LOTS of the 'no talk, just shoot' heroics that so often can be energizing and refreshing in a macho action movie. But here it just comes off as cruel, even creepy. In fact, after this movie was over I was stuck with the nagging feeling that this was little more than a flabby rip-off of Quentin Tarantino's style. While Edgar Wright is undoubtedly a lovely man in person, and possesses many other talents, as a director, he is no Tarantino (after all, Tarantino is just barely Tarantino).One trembles a bit when one considers what last year's amazing ""Antman"" would have been like had Wright, and his uneven lounge-party style, not been replaced!",Baby Driver

The story is of 'Baby', who is a teenager and the best getaway driver in the business, his quirk is he plays music continuously through earplugs to cope with constant tinnitus following a childhood accident. Baby works for a crime boss, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey. Baby is the lucky charm and is used for every bank job or armed robbery. Baby meets a waitress who provides the romantic element and who shares his passion for music. They fall in love and plan to run away together. But, of course, Baby has just one last job before he can leave the crime world.The plot is very cleverly written, there's an excellent non-stop soundtrack that coordinates the action and music, that is as much a character as any of the actors.

Baby Driver is a heist movie from the perspective of the getaway driver, Baby. Baby is a genius getaway driver that is involved in Doc's schemes due to old debts. Along the way, Baby finds love and tries to leave his past.Baby Driver heavily utilizes music in its presentation. As the story is from Baby's perspective, he drowns out his tinnitus by music. The music is fitting as many scenes are choreographed to the beat of Baby's songs. The songs also give extra detail to the movie with each scene's song having additional meaning. An example of this is Buddy's encounter with Baby in the beginning of the third act with 'Never gonna give you up' playing. music is Baby's love and personality. The movie is filled with each character having a unique style and mannerism.Baby Driver is directed and edited similarly to Edgar Wright's other movies. There are an abundance of quick cuts and well directed action scenes. Each scene had much thought and planning. This planning is so excellent that I have to give great praise to the entire crew.The excellent writing deserves its own column. The characters feel organic and distinct. It is impossible to confuse them with one another. The movie utilizes its great dialogue to immerse the viewer into the world and understand each of the character's motivations. It was easy to understand how Buddy becomes the villain as he had everything taken away from him by Baby. The story is a slow build with the third act being the act that tears everything down. As stated before the soundtrack is worthy of praise with its great selection of tracks.Baby Driver is highly recommended.Grade: A",Baby Driver

It doesn't matter if it's a musical, a drama or a horror film, its soundtrack must be epic and memorable so that it triumphs in the big scenes.Baby Driver has THAT score! Without it, this movie wouldn't be as awesome as it is and it wouldn't definitely be part of my favorite films of 2017! The soundtrack is part of the story, it adds more depth to the dialogue scenes, it helps developing characters and it elevates the action sequences making them feel much more fun and entertaining. It's a perfect score to an amazing movie.As expected in an action film with pretty much only car chases, the direction skills used are always my biggest concern: am I going to be able to actually follow the action sequences? Or is it going to be full of cuts and cars with no route whatsoever which will make it all extremely confusing and disorienting? Well, Edgar Wright nails the chasing scenes and adds some more cool shootouts and bank heists!They are riveting, captivating, extremely fun and edited flawlessly. There's very little CGI in the chasing sequences and some long takes help to fluidly follow the cars without it becoming a mess in my head. I always know where they are, where they're going and what they're doing. The phenomenal editing is consistent throughout the movie and the cinematography is just beautiful. Excellent camera work with incredibly long one-takes (one of the opening scenes is a complete masterpiece) prove that Edgar Wright is one of the best directors working today!The cast also plays a huge role. Ansel Elgort, who I didn't know that well, has a great performance even if it is very subtle. It's not a ""full-on"" performance with tons of scenes where he shines, but he definitely brings the attention all to himself due to his well- portrayed character's personality. Kevin Spacey is a legend! He just does what he always does: be himself. He doesn't even act, he just goes through the dialogue so fascinatingly fast, but in a way that keeps us very captivated and mindful. His character has some slight depth that he elevates brilliantly alongside his usual burst of charisma.As for the rest of the cast, everyone is really great, but I have to take my hat off to Lily James (Deborah), who is able to be romantic as well as dramatic without ever feeling over-the-top or even cliché. Her chemistry with Ansel is amazing and the dialogue scenes become very captivating at the sound of some perfect music. The romance is one of the things that some people might find boring, ""more of the same"" or just unnecessary (this last one is nonsense), but the actors/characters are so interesting and compelling that they are able to raise the quality of a potential flaw, one that I find pretty great.Jon Hamm (Buddy) is a surprise and pulls off a great performance as well as Jamie Foxx (Bats) who portrays a badass in a cool way. The cast's chemistry is palpable and everyone seems to be having fun with the shooting instead of being there just to collect their paycheck.Baby is the main character so his backstory and present situation is very well developed, but I'm happy that the writers didn't forget the supporting characters. Everyone receives something that makes me care for them, at least enough for me to be at the edge of my seat during the action scenes. The writing is extremely well-balanced, it never transforms the film into just a comedy (due to the fantastic humor) or just a drama (due to the dialogue/character development scenes). It's just right on point.My only issue with this movie are some moments during the second act. Despite the film's fast pacing, the main story isn't anything new or unique, it pretty much follows the path that I am expecting from the beginning. Because of that, the second act drags a little bit during some scenes that aren't that interesting and that don't have that much depth or significance to them.All in all, Baby Driver is one of my favorite movies of this year! Exciting action/chasing sequences, a brilliant direction from Edgar Wright (from the beautiful cinematography to the extremely well- handled camera work and flawless editing), some captivating and compelling characters, a cast with terrific chemistry and with Ansel Elgort surprisingly stepping up to the plate. The writing's on point and the soundtrack is the film's main attribute: without it, everything else loses both depth and awesomeness. It's just memorable. Some pacing issues during the second act don't let me give it the maximum rating, but it's still a simply fantastic, fun and super entertaining movie!",Baby Driver

163,ThurstonHunger,Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Vroom Vroom,7,8 August 2021,"Pop it in on a Saturday night and leave your safety belt and thinking cap unbuckled. It's a lot closer to ""Speed"" than Cronenberg/Ballard's ""Crash"" well there are some scenes that almost tricked me into analyzing. Also I am *not* recommending ""Speed.""I've seen most of Wright's movies, and was looking for the ""The Sparks Brothers"" when I realized I had missed this; I think I confused it with Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof.""I'm not sure if Wright was challenged to make a movie where people who mentally check out when an action film has the obligatory car chase scenes - insert stock footage from the Streets of San Francisco and some care flying over the camera. Yawn, right?Well the music and and the automotive dance (and the actors quasi-choreography) managed to keep me dialed in. Speaking of dialing, I definitely dug that the radio came through for our Baby Driver when he was Ipod-less, and once he locked that in he then was a polite young Robin Hood to the lady/victim with the swanky purple ride.Also have to recommend this for folks who know Queen's ""Sheer Heart Attack"" is by far their best album, and have a hard time not pushing the needle back to the opening track over and over again.It's an action film....and a mixtape too. There's the fairy tale classic abandoned child becoming a man on his own (well guided by a wizened foster father who is blind but sees things as they are) but mostly it's a film with cars tearing up the streets, and over-the-top actors chewing what's left of the scenery.Again Friday or Saturday night viewing, your mileage will plummet during the working week.",Baby Driver
164,Andres-Camara,So much music very poorly integrated,5,5 November 2017,"It's one of the best-shot car movies I've seen in a long time. It is also very entertaining, although for the end it gets much worse. If you want to have fun watching well-shot races and not with infinite assembly plans this is the movie. I do not like it when it starts to explain things in the end, or how it becomes beautiful.The actors are pretty good for an action movie.What I do not like is that the music is very poorly integrated. There are times when you do vibrate with the music that sounds, but in the part of the film that is dedicated to explaining the songs and see that it is a short time, but I get a lot out of the movie.I think he's trying to be too funny and he's superimposed. He is forced when Ansel tries to look great and that's enough for me.It has a good picture, but it's not great. The outdoor part is too natural, it's not cinemaThe address changes at times. Just like the races are very well shot, then for the end, it starts to roll based on a lot of editing and it spoils it. Do not bore the film, the other way around, it's entertaining, but it's not a great movie, it's a movie to entertain.Enjoy the sequences of cars and forget about the rest",Baby Driver
165,MrDHWong,A quintessential example of Edgar Wright's work,9,13 July 2017,"Baby Driver is an action comedy film starring Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Bernthal. Directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), this film is a quintessential example of the popular director's work.In Atlanta, Georgia, a young and talented getaway driver calling himself ""Baby"" (Ansel Elgort) is forcibly employed by a mysterious heist kingpin known only as ""Doc"" (Kevin Spacey). Baby has serious tinnitus due to his involvement in a car accident as a child which killed his parents, which he drowns out with music from his iPod. One day, Baby is recruited into one ill-fated heist, which, as as he expected from the beginning, requires him to take matters into his own hands to protect both himself and those he cares about.With fast-paced editing, breathtaking car chases, memorable characters, and the best retro soundtrack since the Guardians of the Galaxy films, Baby Driver is definitely a worthy entry in Edgar Wright's filmography and features all of the director's hallmarks. What the film lacks in comedy, it more than makes up for in sheer action and fun. The cast was perfect, Ansel Elgort is likable and fun to watch as the title character, you can't help but cheer him on as he pulls off some of the most creative car chase scenes since Mad Max: Fury Road. Kevin Spacey also gives a Frank Underwood-esque performance as Doc, menacing, yet, compelling. However, I believe that Jon Bernthal was underused and should have been more involved in the story, as he doesn't play as big of a role as was previously thought.I rate it 8.5/10",Baby Driver
166,Alexander_Blanchett,Solid entertainment,7,15 December 2017,"A nice thriller comedy but a bit overrated in terms of the huge fandom and cult status it received. It was an original approach to the heist movie genre and much more open for a younger audience which I liked because it was fresh. I liked the soundtrack and the leading character Baby, extremely well played by Ansel Egort who hopefully escapes his current image with that as he really has some talent. 
I also liked Kevin Spacey, yes need to be objective here, he did give a decent performance and I always liked to see him playing a villain character. It was not among his best performance but a good turn after all. Jamie Foxx was fun and I liked every scene he was in. Good scene stealer. Jon Hamm was probably the best of the cast, also playing totally against image and extremely believable so. Lily James was ok but nothing too special. Good screenplay and soundtrack. Extremly well edited action scenes and a solid direction. Its a fun bag yes, but something was a bit off sometimes. Still a watchable and entertaining film",Baby Driver

168,Laakbaar,The story of Baby,8,29 July 2017,"OK, I really dislike American action films that are about music, cars chases, shootouts and crime (in any combination). However, this movie was exactly that, and I rather enjoyed it. I think it's because this movie was really all about Baby (played by Ansel Elgort), an interesting, multi-faceted, sympathetic and attractive character. It's a dense, well-written, self-aware and overtly cool movie. There are some funny and unexpected aspects. Not a run of the mill film. I wouldn't miss it.",Baby Driver
169,CANpatbuck3664,Baby Driver Delivers a Nice Genre Mashup and it Provides a Much Needed Break From a Summer Dominated by Franchises and Tentpoles,9,6 July 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We join our titular hero Baby (Ansel Elgort) sitting outside in a red Subaru. The rest of the crew is in robbing a bank while he's rocking out to the song Bellbottoms by the band John Spencer Blues Explosion. Baby was in an accident as a child and he's been plagued by tinnitus (a constant ringing in his ears) so he listens to music constantly to drown it out. The alarms sound and the rest of the crew: Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza Gonzalez) and Griff (Jon Bernthal) bolt out of the exit. Baby is their getaway driver and through some impressive work behind the wheel, he's able to get the crew out of harm's way and to their safe house. Doc (Kevin Spacey) divides up the take and they go their separate ways. Doc and Baby hang back, Doc plans the heists but he and Baby have an off-the-books arrangement. Baby doesn't get a share as recompense for a debt he's working off to Doc. Baby stands out from the rest of the crew because he's young and relatively innocent. He doesn't enjoy what he does and he seeks an escape, which he finds in Debora (Lily James). She's a waitress at a local diner and they bond over music. The only thing in the way of their relationship is Baby's job because all it takes is a ring of the phone and he has to set out for another dangerous mission.Baby Driver isn't as big or as flashy as some of the other movies coming out this summer. It was done on a relatively small budget and compared to movies like the Fate of the Furious, it's also relatively low key. This isn't a bad thing though, the action scenes are thrilling and I appreciated the fact that they were a little closer to reality. The movie also stays very grounded in this gangster/heist story. It doesn't have a lot of grand ambition but that didn't bother me at all. They handle it well and they provide enough surprises to keep things entertaining. The other thing is that this movie has style to burn. They really commit to utilizing the soundtrack. I loved how the action turns with the music, some of gunfire syncs up with the bass for example and it made things just that much more fun.With such a big name director, an accomplished cast was an almost certainty and there's plenty of talent to go around in Baby Driver. I'm not really familiar with Ansel and he threw me off a little at the beginning because he's so animated when he's jamming to his music. Once the character settles down a little, Baby is easy to like and the same goes for Elgort's performance. Lily James doesn't have a ton to work with as Debora but she has good chemistry with Elgort and she adds to the movie. Jon Hamm slips into his role as Buddy seamlessly and he looks like he's having funny playing a different type of role. Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors working and I enjoyed his performance in every scene. He borders on chewing the scenery but he hit the right notes. Eiza Gonzalez is beautiful and she works really well with Jon Hamm. If I walked away surprised with anyone it was Jamie Foxx. He was really menacing here, and although he's playing a terrible person, he was impressive. Don't go in expecting a lot of Jon Bernthal screen time though.Baby Driver delivers a lean story but Edgar Wright doesn't pull any punches with the ending. The movie shifts into a breakneck pace and it sprints from plot point to plot point and set piece to set piece. You get some unexpected twists and turns and although they throw so much at you in a short period, I thought they largely nailed it. I always prefer an exciting wrap up if the movie can execute it and I think that Baby Driver accomplished that.I'm more than willing to keep shouting this movie's praises but I have to include some very minor complaints. Involving a romance as a subplot in a movie is difficult because unless they shape some really interesting characters, you just want to get back to the action. Baby Driver does this better than most but I didn't buy the romance completely. I saw this with a friend and she thought that it drifted around being really corny. I wouldn't describe it that way but Baby and Debora fall for each other real hard, real quick and it can be hard to buy that she'd be so willing to give up her entire life after only knowing Baby for so long. How certain characters act stretches believability, they don't go too far but these characters acted crazy enough to strain plausibility.With the surprise success of Baby Driver at the box office, there's already talk of a possible sequel which isn't usually Edgar Wright's style. If we get that sequel, I'd be happy as this was a fresh and well-crafted summer movie. But I'd honestly be okay if Baby Driver was a standalone. They wrap up the movie so well and Baby doesn't need another adventure to expand upon his story. This movie doesn't leave you wanting more, it makes you want to go see this again. I can't give Baby Driver a perfect grade but I was so excited leaving the theatre. You don't get a movie that comes so close to ticking all the boxes of things you want very often. Baby Driver blows by the competition and leaves you with some great action, an interesting and tight story and some funky tunes to boot.",Baby Driver
170,cliftonofun,Enough style to make up for the substance,8,27 December 2017,"Every sequel or comic book movie promises ""adrenaline"" and/or ""thrills."" This is the rare summer film that delivered just that. It was perfectly scored, perfectly filmed, and perfectly executed - from beginning to end. Was the ending a bit TOO perfect? Yeah, perhaps. But by that point I didn't care. Anyone who did not enjoy this movie has something wrong with them. I mean, it was practically an action romance musical! It shouldn't win any Oscars, but anyone buying tix to the latest franchise should seriously reconsider. This is what blockbusters should look like.",Baby Driver
171,elicopperman,That is One Fine Baby,9,23 November 2017,"I'm not a huge fan of the work Edgar Wright, but I do admire his comedic and often fast paced style of filmmaking that can really grope a viewer into his work. So when I heard about Baby Driver, I didn't know what to expect from it, and let me just say, this could very well be Wright's finest achievement in filmmaking that I've seen thus far. This is in every sense of the word an amazing thrill ride that must be seen by all.As a die hard fan of action movies, Wright really captures the style, the suspense, the fast pace, and even the dark grittiness and humor that you'd find in a modern day action flick, and boy did this movie come with a kick. The action is always on full throttle, the fact that this was all filmed with little to no special effects is just mind boggling, the editing goes nuts without getting choppy or all over the place, the timing is excellent, and it really got me on the edge of my seat.Since this is a movie about a young man who was a victim of childhood trauma and must drown his sorrows out with music, that's where the movie shines phenomenally. Not only does each song play in accordance to the plot, but the timing, the choreography, and especially the pacing really elevate this film to new heights creating a sense of fun along the ride.Story wise, it's not that great in concept, since the titular character works for a kingpin but must get out of there after falling for a waitress. However, the romance, the character's charm, the stellar performance from Ansel Elgort, and earning to get out somewhere far really makes the titular character all the more worth rooting for. As for the other characters, they range from delightful like Debora and Joseph, to subtly maniacal like Kevin Spacey's Doc, to sinister yet witty like Darling and Jamie Foxx's Bats, to charming albeit disturbing like....well, I would say his name, but you just have to see the movie to find out.To sum it all up, Edgar Wright successfully packed raw and upbeat music into an already kick ass action flick complete with cute romance, a lovable main protagonist, high stakes, subtle emotion, breathtaking cinematography and stunts, and even a few laughs here and there. There is not a single moment in this film where Wright's passion can not be seen on screen, he put that much heart and soul into this given his admiration for action films. One of if not THE best movie of summer 2017, and here's to more delightful flicks like it in the future.",Baby Driver
172,ronakkotian,Some of the best sound editing and mixing I've seen,9,25 June 2021,"Edgar Wright can do no wrong. From the Cornetto trilogy to Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Edgar Wright has consistently delivered outstanding films and Baby Driver is yet another superb entry in his filmography.Baby Driver follows Baby, a getaway driver that wants to leave his life of crime. One day he meets a waitress and falls in love with her which leads to problems that threaten his love and life.This is a film that's so unique and entertaining on many levels. The amount of detail and creativity Edgar Wright puts into his films amazes me to this day and Baby Driver is full of it. This film is slick and stylish all the way through with exhilarating action sequences and tension. The opening car chase sequence alone had me hooked. The way this entire sequence is shot and edited brings the exact amount of enjoyment and adrenaline I love to see in a film like this. The biggest selling point is how Wright incorporates the soundtrack into the film. Whilst being an action thriller, Baby Driver equally works as a musical. The song choices are all great and play a purpose in accordance with the scene they're playing on top of. Wright also manages to sync the music to the film's world. Doing this is no easy feat but Wright does it with ease. Not only is it impressive but it's fun to pick up on the those details during multiple rewatches. It's some of the best sound editing and mixing I've seen in a film and I honestly believe it should've won Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing because of how well done it is.This is the first solo screenplay Wright has written but it still contains the charm and wit of his previous ventures. The dialogues are crisp and clever. Not not only do they reveal traits of certain characters but I love how certain scenes are referenced later on making them serve a greater purpose. The editing is immaculate, maintaining the thrill and entertainment all the way through. Upon rewatches, I also noticed elements of foreshadowing and symbolism sprinkled throughout that made me appreciate the level of detail Edgar Wright infuses into his films. The only flaw I have is the romance. The film is very fast paced and so the romance develops very quickly but I felt it required more depth as the character of Debora makes decisions that could change her life drastically in an instant without thinking twice. I just wish the film took more time to develop Baby and Debora's relationship so it wouldn't seem as unbelievable.Edgar Wright's previous films played out like comedies whereas Baby Driver takes itself more seriously compared to them. The more intense scenes are executed brilliantly and all the actors do such a great job during them. Ansel Elgort does a very good job as Baby. Despite his character being very quiet, Elgort conveys the thoughts and feelings Baby has during each scene really well. Lily James does a great job as Debora and has great chemistry with Elgort. Kevin Spacey and Eiza González are also great. Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm are absolutely excellent and play their characters really well.Baby Driver is another success for Edgar Wright. I've seen it a few times now and every time I'm enthralled by Wright's talent as a director and writer. If you're looking to watch something fun and exhilarating, I would highly recommend Baby Driver.",Baby Driver
173,garethcrook,This is slick. Maybe too slick.,6,18 May 2018,"This is slick. Maybe too slick, but from the opening car chase and the carefully choreographed sequence that follows, everything hits the beat. It's as much about music as it's characters and the heists they're involved with. It's fun. A bit dumb and full of... well predictability really... but mostly it's fun!!",Baby Driver
174,statuskuo,A Spinning Record,7,3 August 2017,"A very steady directing hand by Edgar Wright. Music is the sync of life and he plays it to the hilt about a driver for crimes because...he's indebted to a crime boss. Simple enough. Until you introduce nutjobs.Quirky fun and clearly a filmmaker who knows how to put together a movie that isn't trying to be so computer graphics heavy. What a relief it is to watch a movie where you see the director's personality in it rather than stupid superheroes being thrown through drywall. God, I hate Marvel. Anyway, the ending looks like they ran out of money. But the movie is fun enough, and I hope it does well, because we need more movie makers who know how to make movies.",Baby Driver
175,rubenm,Slightly disappointing,5,7 August 2017,"This film has plenty of scenes that put a smile on your face. The combination of an ultra-cool baby-faced hero, a killer soundtrack and a tongue-in-cheek heist theme should be the ultimate recipe for a film with maximum entertainment value. Especially when the director is not afraid to make creative use of those ingredients. The scene of lead character Baby walking down the street to the music of Bob and Earl's Harlem Shuffle, and using everything he sees as an imaginary musical instrument, is great cinema. There are many such moments in this film, which is driven (pun intended) by its soundtrack of 35 songs that are almost without exception great music.Still, I left the cinema slightly disappointed. Towards the end, this cool, stylish and original film morphs into an unimaginative succession of shootouts and car chases, not so much different from any commercial Hollywood blockbuster. By then, the multitude of screeching tires, machine guns and crashing police vehicles has become a bit tiresome. The contrast between the super exciting first five minutes of the film and the dull and boring last fifteen, couldn't have been bigger.",Baby Driver

177,saadanathan,The best movie ever of 2017. 9/10,9,8 June 2020,"There is no movie more amazing, more intense, more original and more awesome than Edgar Wright's baby driver (2017). I know I might be exaggerating but for real, this is one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years. It has a great and original script idea. The whole tone of the movie is intriguing, fun and fast. If you thought ""The Fast and The Furious"" franchise has no content, you won't be disappointed with this killer heist movie. Ansel Elgort delivers his best performance in a movie. His acting and coolness on screen is amazing. I'm attached to his character. Lily James is stunning in her performance. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as a mob guy who runs the whole operation. Jamie Foxx is annoying but that's the whole point with his character and that's why I loved him. Jon Bernthal, Jon Hamm and Eisa Gonzales are fabulous and great actors. Hands down to Edgar Wright on the writing and directing of the movie. He made the best out of it. I think for the whole movie I had absolutely no problem. Nothing bad to say about it, I enjoyed most sequences although I can point on a few things that bothered me:
1) when baby was interrogated by Doc and the rest of the team, after they went to his house and stole all his records. Baby is facing a big challenge. The crew members of the heist are accusing him of betrayal and calling him a ""snitch"", throughout the movie baby's character is silent and cool but I was hoping for him to get more mad. Instead of playing one of his records to show he is just making music, why can't he defend himself a little more?. His adoptive father was probably hit, his girlfriend is in danger, why I don't see his character changing a bit and turning from cool mode to bad mode?. I really hoped in this particular scene where he is in danger and being questioned. That we will see him all hothead.
That's it, that's how I enjoyed the movie, and it is rare cause I have nothing else bad to say about it.
The soundtrack is probably the main feature here, every song is a masterpiece and fits so well into every scene or sequence. Every scene has a song that matches perfectly for the tone and genre of the movie. One of the best soundtracks ever made for a movie. My favorite moment of the film has to be opening sequence of baby walking to get coffee for the others. This scene is just so well made, the one shot filming of the scene that focuses on baby, the song ""Harlem Shuffle"" by Bob and Earl in the background is fantastic, and all the words of the song on the background was a nice touch: when baby slides, the words ""right here"" appear on the floor (genius). I wish I can talk more about this movie but maybe it's better to highly recommend this film, a nice, furious and thriller packed heist movie. With an original idea. This movie should have won:
Best picture, Best original screenplay, Best leading actor for Ansel Elgort, Best supporting actor for Jamie Foxx and of course Best soundtrack. That's not an oscar category but it delivers my point.",Baby Driver
178,Java_Joe,Great movie all around.,8,1 June 2019,"Baby driver is what you get when you put Edgar Wright in charge of an ordinary heist movie. It's fast paced, has terrific action scenes and manages to incorporate a human element to the whole thing.The story deals with the titular Baby who due to an accident suffered as a child has tinnitus. To combat this he's constantly listening to music on his headphones. He's also one of the most gifted drivers out there so in order to pay off a debt to a big time gangster, he's become the getaway driver.Add to this a bunch of colorful characters that go along with him on these heists, a human element story where young Baby is enamored with not only making music from taped conversations but also what he plays during his getaways and the girl that he's trying to get to know.Strong performances all around from Kevin Spacey as the big time gangster, Jon Hamm as one of the bank robbers and Lily James as the girl that reminds Baby of his mother.

180,latinfineart,"A horrific wish mash, with tedious lip syncing to Lionel Richie!",2,22 September 2017,"I do not even know where to start, to describe this so called entertainment. I admit, I am not into musicals. My guess, is that the filmmakers were trying to capture some of the magic of La La Land, a film I loved despite the fact that it was a musical, because it was such a damn good film. This turkey on the other hand, had a lead actor, who was kind of an idiot savant, wounded twerp, muted sort of guy. Who, all of a sudden came to life, when in the presence of a cute waitress working in a diner. Wait a minute. He was holding in all of that charm, just waiting for the right waitress to light up his heart? Pure, unadulterated silliness and nonsense. On their first encounter, at a laundromat, where all of the clothes in the machines were color coordinated, they display the kind of chemistry only Romeo and Juliet enjoyed.This guy drives in a way that would shame Lewis Hamilton. His skills behind the wheel are nothing short of Houdini, combined with Michael Schumacher, and Sebastian Vettel, with a little bit of Valentino Rossi thrown in for good measure. The first sequence is quite impressive, though ridiculously over the top. But then that's it. Baby Driver still has another hour and 40 minutes to go, and it never reaches that level of breezy magnificence again. Not even close. Not visually, and not thematically, either: the insouciance of laid-back criminals gives way to tedious angst and handwringing. I can't recall ever before seeing a movie that gave up this early: usually they wait till the last act to pop out on us, to run out of ideas and steam. Perhaps the only truly original thing about Baby Driver is its astonishing pivot from gripping opener to rote plot full of totally unsurprising clichés: Baby doesn't really want to live a life of crime, but boss Doc (Kevin Spacey) is blackmailing him. Baby is so tormented, so haunted by the memory of his dead mother. Get over it. Of course it was traumatic. But, you were a kid. And now supposedly you are a man. Act like one. Please.The worst scenes are the ones where he is dancing and grooving to the music he is listening to on his vast selection of iPods, including one with pink glitter, that Richard Simmons or Freddie Mercury, would not be caught dead using. In one scene, he is a junkyard, dancing and lip syncing to a Lionel Richie song! Unbelievable. Kind of a rehash of Flashdance, without the gorgeous lead actress. Who on earth does that? Does anyone even remember Lionel? And if they do, do they have his music on his iPod? This film tries so hard to be hip, and it fails miserable. The lead is not hip, his moves are not hip, and they portray him as this savant, who hears the sounds of the universe all around him, in the forms of singing and silly songs. Inane. Dumb. Unconvincing. Contrived. Nonsensical. I walked out after an hour. I just could not take any more abuse. If you are under 13 you might enjoy this film. It does have sort of a teeny bopper quality to it.Kevin Spacey was a caricature. A totally comic book character. His lines were stupid. This is a really bad film. I just do not get all of the good reviews. I think audiences are getting a lot more tolerant of nonsense.",Baby Driver
181,PyroSikTh,A Messy Third Act doesn't undermine Baby Driver's Entertainment Value,8,4 July 2017,"Edgar Wright does Drive. I mean, I didn't need any more reason than that to see this movie did I? And neither do you. Like pretty much every film in Wright's repertoire, Baby Driver is a display of such insanely tight direction and writing. Nothing in this movie is accidental, from the obvious foreground to the subtle background. Every cut and every pan is there for a reason, timed and placed for maximum effect. Wright has a hard-on for the little details, and Baby Driver is absolutely brimming with them, from song lyrics written in graffiti in the background, to foreshadowing channel hopping on television, to insignificant lines of dialogue resurfacing later on to great effect.The story is almost not the point of Baby Driver. I'm not going to lie, it's a little lacklustre as stories go. It hits all the right beats, and has some fantastic moments, but it's not particularly deep or complicated. Baby Driver is mainly a character- driven story, and even then certain characters aren't dealt with particularly well (Doc's sudden and out-of-character flip of priorities in the third act definitely stands out as the movie's weakest point). The third act is also overlong and a little messy, interweaving multiple action scenes across a whole day, leaving it's fast pace to get a bit away from the narrative.But as I said, what might be perceived as the most important aspects of a good movie, these are only minor details in the grander scheme of Baby Driver's aim, which is the quintessential marriage of audio and visuals. The movie is absolutely chock full of popular music from every era, from the moment the movie starts to when the final credits roll. Music permeates every scene and is used to such brilliant effect. Every movement on camera is tied to the music's beat, from gunshots to money counting, to character movements and even the rhythm of dialogue. My favourite touch though is when the music disappears, alongside narrative reasoning in the movie, and the audio gap is filled with a single high- pitched note offering the effect of Baby's tinnitus, while simultaneously marking these scenes out as more serious and intense than the rest of the movie.As I've mentioned, every song serves a meticulous purpose in the movie, and the soundtrack is full of songs both iconic and obscure from every era of music, from Simon and Garfunkel and Queen to the Harlem Shuffle and Tequila, to Blur and Beck. Personally very little of it is to my personal tastes, so it's not really a soundtrack I would choose to listen to by itself, but I can't deny that it's an expertly chosen selection of songs. And seeing as there's a song for almost every scene, that's a hell of a lot of music.The choreography of fight scenes and car chases also deserves mention. No CGI or green screen was used, and it shows. While the fights and car chases are smaller and more intimate than what you might find in the Fast and Furious franchise, this is only a strength, allowing it all to be filmed in-camera and, as such, keep its realism and plausibility intact. Baby Driver easily has the best car chases of the year; complex, stylish, real, and above all hugely entertaining to watch.While the character work in the script leaves a lot to be desired, every actor's performance stands on it's own and thanks to great direction by Wright, are left to flourish and dig deeper than the script and dialogue could. Ansel Elgort is subdued, mysterious, quiet and thoughtful, and yet driven by morals not befitting of a criminal. All he wants is to pay off his debt to Doc and carry on with his life like a normal person. Jon Hamm's Buddy is a masterclass on character building, using his handsomeness and charming masculinity to great effect, appearing first as a friend, and then an antagonist without skipping a beat or breaking character. Jamie Foxx is another example of the finest character building I've seen in a long time. His turn as a pure villain is so easy to hate and fear in equal measure, oozing real threat and intimidation in every scene he's in, without being an overly dark spot in an otherwise light-hearted movie. Lily James employs her signature charisma and ability to hit real chemistry with anyone and everyone. She's simply endearing and easy to love in every scene she's in.Baby Driver is also, unsurprisingly, very funny to watch. It's certainly not your typical comedy movie, as each joke is so natural that it doesn't feel like a joke at all. There's a general air of brevity, particularly in the first and second acts that's infectious to watch. There's no possible way to feel bad during this movie. Even once the third act ditches the light-hearted edge and turns more serious, the shift in tone doesn't feel sudden or out-of-place.Baby Driver is a thoroughly entertaining heist flick employing the best use of music in a long time, with some great performances elevating otherwise lacklustre characters to levels higher than they realistically should be. It manages to carefully balance a light-hearted and fun tone with a level of seriousness and threat that keeps the stakes real and high throughout. It's hard to detach yourself from the characters and story, as they take you on a rip-roaring ride through action, romance, comedy, thriller, and musical, often within the space of a few minutes. Would I recommend Baby Driver? Yes, I would recommend Baby Driver. 8/10. I just wish that third act wasn't quite as messy and all over the place, and that Doc didn't just suddenly jump out of character.",Baby Driver
182,CinematicInceptions,The Spirit of the Radio.,8,1 December 2017,"There were some things that this movie could have done better, but it was refreshing on the whole. It did pretty well considering that it had a fairly small budget and is an original R-rated movie. I had expected it to be funnier, but it was still fun despite getting a little bit heavy toward the end. Even though I would have appreciated it to have a more streamlined and cohesive story, I liked that Edgar Wright decided to make his own thing rather than let himself be restricted by story conventions. Things like changing which characters were the villains at several points was an interesting choice, that I found a little frustrating, but perhaps truer to how villains in real life work.By and large, the movie does a lot of traditional things. The criminal ring is pretty standard, as is the tale of young love between Baby and Deborah, but I like the way that they were mixed together. There a lot of movies about criminals or ex-criminals doing ""one last job"", but I found that trope to be more believable here. Maybe it's because Baby is young and has his whole life ahead of him or because he is so different from the world of crime that he has become involved in. Oftentimes, we'll see movies with hit men or something like that who say they want to get out of the game, but they are so good at what they do that it's hard for them to have a simple life, but this is not the case with Baby. He's not a violent person like those around him, and has a youthful hope and innocence that gives a lighter feel to what is a fairly dark plot. I really liked the scene where he meets Doc's new prodigy Sam, because it put Baby's situation into perspective a little more and made me want him to escape the criminal underground. The action was certainly not the most spectacular, but I liked it better because of that. Edgar Wright didn't have to make Baby the greatest getaway driver to make his skill as a driver impressive or the chase scenes and stunts exciting. I sometimes find it more engaging to watch action movies with people who aren't especially great fighters because it makes for more interesting fight scenes. Yes, it is fun to see action heroes tear apart their enemies or fight equally skilled enemies, but it often lacks the drama of seeing a character with no combat skills be forced to defend themselves. Of course, the most important part of the movie is the music. The way music was used here made me want to have music on all the time and I loved the way it serves as sort of a tribute to just music as a general concept. Music is arguably a crucial part of our existence as humans and it was nice to see a movie that centered itself around music. I loved the moment where Baby goes ""Wait, I gotta start the song over"" as they are trying to get away. It was such a great testament to the power of music.So in summary, it's an imperfect movie, but I would definitely pay to see more movies like it. Overall Rating: 8/10.",Baby Driver
183,JakeBrinkman,Best movie of the year,9,2 January 2019,"This movie was the most entertaining film all year. The acting, plot, cinematography, sound, and music were all flawless. My only complaint was that the opening sequence was so exhilarating that I was expecting the finale to be even more incredible. The finale certainly met the same level of excitement from the opening, but I don't feel like it exceeded it, which a finale should.",Baby Driver
184,Offworld_Colony,"There's no doubt some impressive work here, some cleverly designed sequences and some tasty long takes with some lively dynamism.",6,18 February 2020,"However Edgar Wright is a director that seems to get more immature as opposed to maturing with his audience as his films go on.Baby Driver, a film idea that was, no doubt, pulled from a drawer of high concept, high-school ideas from Mr. Wright, has that sort of aged 90's Tarantino vibe, from the musical OTT dialogue, attention to soundtrack, and the Natural Born Killers style star-crossed main characters.
Unfortunately that makes the idea very dated and the promise of a musical car-chase movie a bit of misdirection. It's more of a 90's gangster film with a painful hipster hand guiding it, interspersed with music videos made of car chases.There's some humour, neat little ideas, satisfying and creative moments, but they're unpleasantly jammed in to a a few moulds that don't do some of the core concepts justice. Lily James is a delight but her character is shortchanged, the idea of replacing core characters for each job is nonsensical probably to get rid of actors to other commitments. And the less said about the two dimensional Darling and Kevin Spacey the better.",Baby Driver
185,namstonk,Puerile Pretentious Pish,4,8 July 2020,"So I have watched this film 3 times now as I didn't see the hullabaloo previous and all I can say I was right and anyone giving more than 5 stars to this self-deprecating average twaddle needs a stiff drink, preferably still in the bottle and to the back of the head. Edgar Wright is a very average director, his best work being Scott Pilgrim which did have promise, then his 'comedies' that were so repetitive it beggars belief, they have basically pandered his ego and voilà here is his ego on screen. Having a love of music is one thing but trying to shoehorn it into a robbery, murder, violent crime movie is just OTT. You cannot rely on a soundtrack carrying a film as is hoped here, the plot is thin, there is no action for half an hour and the dialogue is puerile. As for the lead, well an action star he ain't, he has the range of a dishcloth and has as much charisma as a gallstone, not his fault but bad casting.
There are loads better driving films and loads more with better driving action.",Baby Driver

I loved the way the music and the action was synchronized - pretty slick! And the women in here were so pretty! Lily James is just so..., just so wow! Sweet and gorgeous!

187,rdoyle29,A magnificent action musical,9,12 July 2017,"This film opens with a robbery and car chase, not exactly set to ""Bellbottoms"" by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, but more like choreographed to it. I can truly say I was 100% with this one from the very beginning. There are similar action sequences set to ""Neat Neat Neat"" by the Damned and ""Hocus Pocus"" by Focus. They are all incredible. It doesn't stop there ... music suffuses this film. All the performances are good ... Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm stand out as criminals who are varying degrees of menacing ... but this is really a film about music and action. I do think that the last half hour works a bit less well than the rest of it. In particular, I thought the climactic action set to ""Brighton Rock"" by Queen was a lot more frenetic and less well choreographed than the rest of the film, but by this point in the film, it's a quibble to say that it's working less well.",Baby Driver
188,stevenrotherforth,"If Vin runs on Diesel, Baby runs on High octane",10,14 July 2017,"Baby DriverMaybe the title for this review is a little misleading. This movie unlike Fast and Furious 25 (I've lost count) isn't all CGI crash bang and a wallop. Instead here the audience are treated to engaging characters and a thoroughly engaging storyline. Don't get me wrong there are some wonderful set pieces involving some fantastic car chases but all four wheels are placed firmly on the ground. Believable action, no jumping over submarines or parachuting cars out of planes here. Baby Driver follows the lead character played by Angel Elgort who is named Baby. He's a young man with a special gift. He can make a car sing enabling him to be the best wheel man in the business. However an hearing deficiency caused by an accident when he was younger plagues him with a constant ringing in his ears. Music helps combat this and the beat of his favourite tunes help him perform car manoeuvres that would put the Stig to shame. Think of the music as being the fuel to his ability just as the sun is to Superman. Baby owes a debt to criminal mastermind Doc played by the excellent Kevin Spacey. By driving for him Baby is able to pay back the money he owes. I'll not go into too much about the storyline because as it unfolds it grips the audience and doesn't let go. The superb performances by all, well written material and the superior direction by Edgar Wright give us reason to invest and care about the characters on screen. In reality they're the bad guys doing bad guy stuff. Robbing banks and so on but it's hard not to root for them. Baby however isn't a bad guy he's just a guy caught up in the circumstances that life has dealt him. His goal to ride off into the sunset with the love of his life just out of reach. I recommend Baby Driver. It's not just a movie for people who like cars and car chases. It's a movie for people who like characters and good story telling. A refreshing action movie. Baby is fast but too cool to get furious.",Baby Driver
189,socrates99,Entertaining and even brilliant until the last 10 minutes or so,9,4 July 2017,"Still, not to be missed. The director's hand is so assured and compelling that at times the movie seems head and shoulders above its many competitors. Some of the simplest scenes, where Baby and Debora are just flirting with each other are so well done, they seem miraculous. You will wonder, What kind of strange luck or ability would allow someone to get those scenes on screen? I can't think of anyone able to catch such fresh and candid banter before. And that's not even the main course.The main course is the hostility that Baby exposes himself to in the underworld he is forced to be part of. Jamie Foxx comes across as pure street as does Jon Hamm, both actors I don't associate with seasoned physical menace, but who deliver in spades. And then there's the driving which is fast and furious and made as entertaining as any other I've seen.Baby is a kind of Man With No Name figure but much younger and not prone to violence. Instead of being a dead shot he's an unflappable driver and there's nothing he'd rather do than get out of the life. My only complaint is that the storyline paints our hero into a corner and sort of fumbles a bit in its resolution, but that's after having kept us at full attention, very stylishly, for more than 90 minutes straight. No mean feat.",Baby Driver
190,LloydBayer,"As homage to classic heist films, Baby Driver starts exceptionally well but ends with a whimper.",6,19 July 2017,"When you have bank robberies, armed gunmen wearing caricature masks and fast getaway cars, you are most certainly watching a heist movie. Add music in every scene, a bit of old fashioned misty-eyed romance, oddball characters thrown into a madcap mix and you are now watching Edger Wright's Baby Driver - a kinetic, off-the-wall action comedy that starts with a bang, but before you know it, is gone in 60 minutes. Everything after is like the recoil of a gun ejecting a spent cartridge.The first hour is so much fun, it contains every reason you would recommend watching this film. Even so, the first two minutes is all the viewer needs to get hooked in. Written and directed by Wright, the film begins with infectious energy soon after we are introduced to baby-faced Ansel Elgort as the titular getaway driver for a group of armed robbers organised by Doc (Kevin Spacey). He is called Baby because he is the youngest member of the crew and basically a kid. Baby also suffers from permanent hearing damage owing to a tragic accident, so must listen to music to drown out a constant hum in his ears. Seen through Baby's perspective, everything that happens in the film is synchronised to his music. Be it gun shots, doors opening and closing, tyres screeching, dialogue, and every other sound effect is seamlessly integrated into the soundtrack and camera-work with stupendous attention to detail. And as soon as we are hooked to the music, Wright moves swiftly into the plot specifics – Baby owes Doc one last job, after which he is free to pursue his own life. But as we have seen in previous heist films, there is no such thing as a last job. Once you're in, there is no way out. Despite his obligation to Doc, Baby is a nice guy and sure enough things get complicated when he meets love interest Deborah (Lily James), a waitress at a local diner. They plan a perfect getaway but with the arrival of a new stick-em-up crew, ala Bonny and Clyde couple Buddy and Darling (John Hamm and Eiza González), and trigger- happy badass Bats (Jamie Fox), all hell breaks loose. What ensues is a roller-coaster, edge-of-your seat thrill ride all the way but is it the best from visionary director Wright as early reviews seem to say? Including Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, all of Wright's six films to date have been wildly entertaining action comedies with clear love for genre films that came before. Baby Driver is no different in that it is a love letter to some of the greatest heist films from Hollywood (how many references to heist films can you spot in this review?). The car chase scenes for example are non CGI rendered, meaning actual stuntmen were used in white-knuckle maneuvering that resembles chase scenes from the original The Italian Job. But while the film could have remained a simple heist movie (where inevitably the last heist is always botched), Wright's story gets muddled with grand themes of loss and love heals all wounds, and then turns into a farce with a hammy ending where characters refuse to die. No pun intended. Compared to some of the big titles opening this summer, Baby Driver is much smaller in scale and budget, but still manages to stand its ground as an exhilarating action-comedy with nothing but the will to entertain. Add to that a fantastically assembled soundtrack fused with almost every scene and we are essentially watching a musical on wheels. There is also Wright's unique sense of pulp cinema style oozing in every scene, but despite all that has gone into making Baby Driver an interesting and fun film (including a well assembled cast), the biggest downfall is the lack of any relatable or lovable character. That, and the fact that the film opens on an octane high but simmers down to a whimper towards the end undermines what could have been a scorcher of a film this summer.",Baby Driver
191,Finfrosk86,It was OK. But I'm a little disappointed (prob bcs of hype),7,5 August 2017,"Once again, expectations ruins the party. It's impossible not to expect great things when a movie gets such praise as this one got. And I gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.It's not bad, it doesn't suck. It has qualities, no doubt. It's an alright movie, but that's it for me. Alright.The first half hour or so, was kind of boring to me. Some cool details sprinkled here and there, but nothing more. Then something clicks and the movie steps it up a little. But still it's like.. overall it's just OK. The characters are OK, sadly not half as cool as they (try hard) are supposed to be. Some of them are slightly annoying, but nothing that ruins the movie or anything. The action is pretty good and well edited, I maybe thought the shootouts were a little too hectic though. But the driving is solid, but not out of this world.The music I found to be tiring. Yes, it's there for a reason, but it's just too much. And the love story? Gtfo. Love story? Like really? That did suck.To sum up. If I hadn't known anything, I would probably have liked it better, but I did know something, so here we are. Score. I'll probably rate it a 7, even though I am tempted to give it a 6, but I think that's too low. Somewhere between 6 and 7, then. If I see it again, maybe I'll bump it up, who knows.

All is going well but when his skills become invaluable to Doc, he must protect his loved ones and try to escape while he still can.Wow. Where do I start with this movie. I'm not rating it a 10/10 just for the sake of it, it is one of the best movies I've seen all year around. The acting is phenomenal, the stuntwork is up there with the best, the action is great, the plot is great; I have no major flaws with this movie. It's awesome!!!!The story for this movie is fast paced, bright, interesting and most importantly, unpredictable. You may be able to predict certain plot point but I guarantee you won't be able to tell me exactly what will happen. The ending is great. The love story between Baby and Deborah is believable. Edgar Wright you beautiful, beautiful man, you have wrote an fantastic screenplay. Thank you, sir!Ansel Elgort was spectacular in this movie and really impressed me as Baby. He was funny, he was smart, he was cool, he was likable; he's a spectacular character that I guarantee will be copied in future films to come. Lily James was great as Deborah and I really bought their relationship. This was a major complain for many critics but I don't see why. It was engaging, it was believable, and, while Deborah made some incredibly dumb decisions, it was fantastical. Jamie Foxx was brilliant as the sly and distrustful Bats. Kevin Spacey command the scenes he's in as Doc and is the best non-actor working today. Jon Hamm was excellent as Buddy. Nothing acting or character wise was flawed in this movie but I guess that is to be expected from Wright's pristine track record.Wright directed the hell out of this movie. Every shot is masterfully crafted. Every edit is specifically chosen and targeted. The colour pallet is bright and bold and artistically captivating. This movie is hilarious. All the characters have funny lines and Wright is a genius at comedy. The chase sequences in this movie are probably some of the best ever put to film. And no, I am not overselling them.

The script borders on the crazy ""Fast and Furious"", we have incredulous situations, simple solutions, and motivation fails, but in ""Baby Driver"", the script is somewhat secondary, the action is also, all this is almost an excuse to do A single two-hour video clip. We have the story of Baby (Ansel Elgort), a young man who has incredible talent, drove a car like nobody else, and ends up owing favors to a mafioso, who ends up using him as an escape pilot for his assaults, but halfway He falls in love and tries to get rid of his threats. It is interesting that even a movie that can be considered a musical, a novel, a comedy and an action, contains a lot of symbolism, such as the fact that Baby needs to listen to music not to hear the buzzing in her ear, and as if Baby stifles her conscience With music being subject to anything, or like the dress of Baby and Debora (Lily James) always pass an air of something nostalgic and of the past, as if its love was something classic, or an old passion, and Edgar leaves it well Clear in small flames simulating a passion that happens in the 50's, or even the fact that the character of Jamie Foxx always have to be victimized to justify their crimes, or the mirror that has the character of Jon Hamm, where the He was a stockbroker and now he's a bad guy, as if there were no differences. Edgar, even though he is a comedic director, takes exquisite care in the technical part of his films, and his last film was not different, until the sound of the bullet of the shots had soundplasty, until the walk of the characters aligned to the rhythm of the music , Is an extreme caution, his sound editing is good, but his mix is ​​spectacular- Dunkirk's serious competitor to the category- but other aspects are also notorious, such as the angle of the cameras in the action scenes, Innovative, they use an absurdly good mount, or rather, the whole assembly of the film is very good and Edgar knows how to use the camera, aerial plans, open plans, closed plans, 360, change of frame, an incredible, gorgeous and wonderful Plane sequence and even a duel of eyes in the best style Sergio Leone, we can not fail to mention also his good and eclectic track with more than 30 musics and his urban photography. Ansel Elgort is great as Baby, understands his character as no one, knows how to be sad, angry and indifferent, Jamie Foxx and Lily James are also very well, Keven Spacey imposing as always, and Jon Hamm is wonderful interpreting his passionate and psychotic Buddy.

200,jamiedarlow-37510,A surprisingly intense but naturally exciting car-chase movie with heart,8,10 February 2020,"I finally got round to watching it! And it is yet again another great film by filmmaking maestro Edgar Wright (Shaun Of The Dead, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World) It began life in 2002 as the music video Wright directed for Mint Royale's Blue Song starring Noel Fielding, Julian Barratt, Nick Frost and Michael Smiley (awesome stuff) and is based on the character Baby played by Ansel Elgort (The Fault In Our Stars, Divergent series) who is a very talented getaway driver working for Doc (Kevin Spacey) paying off his debt in order to finally begin a peaceful life without crime. It's a very thrilling, at times amusing and feel good but mostly dramatic and intense watch. The intensity of the film surprised me, making for a very edge of your seat experience in which you really root for and want Baby to find his peace and leave the criminal world behind. A lot of the tension is brewed by Jamie Foxx's Bats; a genuinely terrifying psychopath who does not make things easy for our hero. Foxx is quite brilliant here as always along with a terrific cast including Spacey and Jon Hamm in great scenery chewing roles. Three particular stand outs for me were Elgort who is absolutely brilliant in the title role; Debora played by Lily James who is an incredibly cool character and Baby's true love in the story (James continues to proves she is one of the most engaging screen actors of our time) and last but not least Joseph played by CJ Jones, Baby's adoptive parent. A lovely heartfelt performance rounding off an ensemble of heartfelt performances. Wright's style is clearly seen here in full blissful musical style; the choreography is amazing and makes for such an entertaining watch. Wright's editing collaborators Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss do another wonderful job of splicing the fast paced camera shots together to form an elegant, artistic but very natural narrative stream.

Action scenes are amazingly directed, music and editing are synced and very creative, it is a different way to mix music and images. The result are dynamic and funny scenes. Technically speaking I don't have any complaint, the editing is fluid and smart.The story is pretty basic, something that has been seen in the cinema history many, many times. There are no plot twists, no clever or particular smart scenes that are worth to be remembered, but honestly I was not expecting something deeper. We are talking a movie that make you spend two hours, if you have some time to kill and if you don't want to watch something too challenging and just chill.",Baby Driver
203,dr_clarke_2,An energetic action film with great characters and a blistering soundtrack,8,27 September 2021,"Edgar Wright was best known in the United Kingdom for his ""Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy"" (and internationally co-produced wonderfully bizarre cult-film Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) prior to the release of 2017's Baby Driver, a UK-US co-production that saw the director decamp to the States for this Atlanta-set action film starring a mostly American cast. And whilst Wright may have proved his mettle with those quintessentially British, tongue-in-cheek genre films, Baby Driver demonstrates that he is more than capable of handling American-style action films whilst retaining his own idiosyncratic quirks.Baby Driver revolves around a talented young getaway driver known as Baby, who works for crime boss Doc. Despite the reservations of his deaf foster father Joe, Baby continues to avoid capture whilst paying off his debt to Doc, effortlessly handling cars with the aid of a constant soundtrack of carefully selected songs. He perspective on his criminal career changes however when he falls in love with waitress Debora and seeks to free himself from Doc's employ.Filmed on location in Atlanta, the film is fast-paced, frenetic and meticulously directed by Wright, who personally selected the film's blistering soundtrack (the film only includes two original pieces, and this must surely be the only movie ever made that features both Focus's ""Hocus Pocus"" and Golden Earring's ""Radar Love""). The impressive car chases are precisely choreographed, and Wright worked with cinematographer Bill Pope to ensure that minimal effects were used and as much as possible was filmed in-camera, with memorably impressive results. It's brilliantly directed and edited, with Wright deploying all of his favourite camera techniques to striking effect.Having co-written all of his previous films (except his very low-budget and rarely seen debut A Fistful of Fingers), Wright went solo to pen the screenplay for Baby Driver, a film long gestated and which boasts excellent characterisation. Ansel Elgort's tinnitus-suffering, music-loving Baby who is haunted by memories of his parents' death makes a suitably sympathetic protagonist, whilst Lily James' Debora is appropriately endearing. Baby is surrounded by a colourful selection of villains, led by Kevin Spacey's Doc, and including Jamie Foxx's psychotic Bats, and Jon Hamm and Eiza González's Bonnie and Clyde-style married couple Buddy and Monica. Spacey, Foxx and Hamm all ooze menace in entirely different ways as the screenplay demands, with Doc ultimately proving to be an old romantic at heart. Mention must also be made of C. J. Jones' delightful performance as Joe, who gets some lovely scenes with Baby. Elgort, given the lead role, is superb as Baby, constantly in motion whether driving or dancing.Whilst less overtly comic than Wright's previous films, Baby Driver is also often quite funny, for example during the confusion over which Michael Myers the Halloween masks used in one of the heists should be based on. There's plenty of witty, quick-fire dialogue, but it is set against a backdrop of real emotion and real danger, with real dramatic stakes, proving Wright's versatility. This is deceptively simply storytelling done well, with plenty of verve and sheer excitement: achieving box-office success and critical acclaim, it marks a successfully transition across the pond for a cult British director, a feat that few of them manage. Quite what future films that might lead to remains to be seen, but it will be exciting to find out.",Baby Driver
204,DeBBss,Something unique and different...,9,15 October 2017,"This movie is just pure fun, you get to listen to awesome music and watch some entertaining chase scenes. This movie has a perfect blend of action and music.Story: 9/10Baby, as a teen he stole a car from a heist planner, he gets caught, and baby has to help him until Doc (heist planner) is satisfied. Baby is a driver, a heist driver, you get to see his skills in the most entertaining way possible, jamming it out with epic music. While he's doing the dirty work, he's living with his deaf foster parent. He also has a hearing problem, so he drowns it out with music. He also has a girlfriend, and he wants to be with her, but he doesn't want to tell her what he actually does. The story is fresh, and it takes some key elements from other movies.Characters: 8/10Baby: After being in a car accident, he lost his parents, and he has hearing problems. He has a good personality, but he's stuck with a wrong group of people.Debora: Debora is a waitress in a diner. She quickly becomes Baby's girlfriend. She finds out about his job, but she still loves him because she knows he's not a bad person.Doc: Doc is a heist planner. He forces Baby as his driver because Baby is in debt. He later becomes some what of a good guy at the end, and makes you have second thoughts about him.Action: 10/10This movie has the best action of the year in my opinion. I love the classy music, it sets the tone. There is also a lot of gun fights, which I wasn't expecting. The car chase scenes are also entertaining and creative.Baby Driver is the type of movie you can watch with everyone at every time.

208,x_manicure_x,So much fun,7,14 August 2021,"""Baby Driver"" is a generic heist action flick synched to the main character's iPod playlist. There could be more substance, but the sharp visuals and flawless direction are enough to deliver some solid entertainment.The script is Edgar Wright's first effort as a solo writer, and unfortunately, it felt a bit too simplistic and lackluster compared to his other productions. Characters are as memorable as they are cartoony, their backstories. Their motivations and personal relationships get hardly explored, and there are a bit too many contrived plot points towards the end. Due to the film's hybrid nature, it's not clear if we are supposed to think of it as a regular action film or just a parody of the genre.Nevertheless, it's an excellent film for a casual, relaxed evening, with some surprisingly thrilling car chases and action sequences for a comedy director.",Baby Driver
209,shanayneigh,Just a gimmick,3,6 December 2017,"Being a huge fan of the Cornetto trilogy, I had high hopes for this movie. But I have to say that I had the same feeling I had when watching ""Hardcore Henry"" which was based on earlier music videos for its director's band.What might be a cool concept for a 4 minute video (POV action vs. character action and cuts in beat to the music) is something different from it being a solid foundation upon which to build a 90+ minute film. Once the initial excitement is gone, then what's left in the form of character and story? Not much, it turns out. We don't really get to know the characters except for little glimpses here and there. The story is as rote as it can get, not to mention that it violates its own logic at times. And what can be said about the love story other than it is utterly unconvincing? I don't remember seeing Ansel Elgort in anything else, but it's not often that one sees something as wooden as Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars prequels. Jamie Foxx plays Jamie Foxx. Jon Bernthal does his usual tough guy schtick. The only one remotely interesting in this movie is Jon Hamm, but that is such a minor character.That being said, the car stunts in this movie are fantastic, and if their claims that virtually none were done with CGI or green screen is correct, that can only be commended. But good stunts alone does not a good movie make. Too bad it didn't spend some of the time used to work on securing soundtrack rights to develop the story and characters more.",Baby Driver
210,gavinp9,Excellent heist/action film,8,2 January 2018,"Edgar Wright's first film that hasn't been styled as a comedy (and his first since 'The World's End'), 'Baby Driver' is a fast-paced crime caper, with plenty of car chases, action, gun fights and a great soundtrack. There's almost no score - basically every scene is set to a song, starting with the first robbery (Jon Spencer Blues Explosion), ""Tequila"", T. Rex, The Damned, ""Easy"" and Baby (Elgort)'s own mixes. Music is so important to him, as he has tinnitus and uses an iPod to drown it out - and help him focus on his getaway driving.Baby is helping criminals get away with robberies to pay back crime boss Doc (Spacey - always good), and the first crew is Buddy (Hamm - great as the criminal with an almost-conscience), Darling (Gonzalez - mostly just eye candy) and Griff (Bernthal - gruff). Then he falls in love with Debora (James - cute), a waiter at an Atlanta diner and needs to extricate himself from this shady world. This is made harder when Bats (Foxx - crazy) gets involved and doesn't like Baby always wearing earplugs.The car chases are filmed/edited magnificently, with the music adding urgency and tone where needed. Nowhere is this more evident than the final scene, with Queen's ""Brighton Rock"" (one of their less famous songs) seamlessly complementing the visual. The stakes are high for the final 30min and the ending is appropriate and not corny. There's plenty of style, but also substance, here.",Baby Driver
211,thebricks,Bad movie,1,2 July 2017,"Wrote a big write-up, but unfortunately, this stupid site somehow ate my comment, so I'll just summarize and say, Lily James did a great job, I hated Ansel Elgort, I hated the writing, I hated most of the other performances, there were numerous plot holes and that Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx's roles got incredibly annoying and unbelievable as the film went on. This was also another film where you can tell the writer grew up rich and does not understand how working class people behave. One part in the movie, Baby works off his debt and just walks away to become a pizza delivery driver and Doc never says anything like, ""You excited to make real money now?"" There was just a lot about Baby that reminded me more of a trust fund kid than a real lower-class person struggling to make it.I just can't recommend this movie until it comes out on DVD.

However what makes Ansel elgort character miles different is that he suffers from tintinus as a result of a car accident as a child and uses music a a way of driving out the ringing in his ears.

Great action sequences, the car chase/driving scenes definitely was the highlight of this movie.The plot and pacing of this movie were very formulated. You have seen this movie before and probably better done, Gone in Sixty Seconds rings a bell here and is a better movie.

216,themadmovieman,A super-stylish and massively entertaining visual and audial feast,9,21 July 2017,"This might just be the coolest film I've ever seen. Powering along at a lightning speed to the tune of a stunning soundtrack, and popping with energetic performances across the board, as well as some exceptionally stylish directing, Baby Driver is an exciting, rapid- fire and triumphant piece of entertainment, and a film you won't be able to take your eyes and ears off for one second.Let's start with what really makes this film so stunning: the directing. From the legendary Cornetto Trilogy and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, we know how well Edgar Wright can direct a movie, with his iconic fast editing and rapid-fire comedy.What's interesting about Baby Driver, however, is the fact that it's quite a lot different from Wright's previous films. For one, it's not a comedy. While it does have a brilliant sense of humour, and is a hell of a lot of fun to watch, it's not a film that's designed to make you laugh out loud again and again like Hot Fuzz and Shaun Of The Dead. Instead, the best entertainment comes from the visual and audial roller-coaster ride that Edgar Wright takes you on throughout the movie.First off, Wright's visual style is a little different from his previous movies. The film's opening act, for example, is full of long, sweeping takes that differ hugely from his traditional quick cutting. However, when used in the context of an insane car chase through the city of Atlanta, it has a very similar effect, and kicks the film off with some hugely exciting sequences.In the final act, however, Edgar Wright really does come into his own when he brings back his legendary editing techniques, and in tandem with those new spectacular long takes, the entire action finale is exceptionally exciting to watch, with the pulsating beat from those quick cuts working brilliantly with the more grandiose and elegant effect from those sweeping shots.What's more about Baby Driver is that it's absolutely popping with so many vibrant colours. As brutal and even violent as some of the crime story is, you can't help but smile from ear to ear at every moment simply because the film is so bright and enjoyable, with the bright reds of some of Baby's cars, the bright lights of the nearby diners, and the dazzling police sirens that add another level of visual exhilaration to the mix.But it's not just a visually thrilling film, because what really sets Baby Driver apart from so many brilliant action movies is how much of an audial experience it is as well. Centring around a character who listens to music when he drives, the film is set to an amazing soundtrack, barely stopping at all throughout the movie, playing whenever Baby has his earphones in, and giving the film such an amazing pace and rhythm that lasts from the very first to the very last scene.On the whole, it's pretty clear that Edgar Wright's directing here is beyond brilliant, but it's not just his directing that makes the film so good, because his screenplay is equally thrilling. With a genuinely engaging crime story focusing on an interesting central character, the film does brilliantly to prove itself as more than just an action extravaganza, and manages to get you on the edge of your seat with its fantastically exciting, unpredictable and non-stop plot.But it's not just Edgar Wright that runs the show here, because the performances are also fantastic. Despite a brief hiccup in the opening act, all of the actors do brilliantly with some hugely energetic and entertaining performances. From Ansel Elgort's effortlessly cool turn as Baby, to Jamie Foxx's brilliant show as a hothead criminal that threatens to derail all the plans, and from Kevin Spacey's smooth but sly crime boss to Lily James' effortlessly delightful love interest, all of the performances here are fantastic, and bring so much to the table when it comes to adding even more energy and life into an already exhilarating film.Overall, I absolutely loved Baby Driver. It's a film that snowballs brilliantly throughout, starting fast but never stopping as it turns into a relentless and effortlessly exhilarating action thriller by the end. With unbelievably stylish and energetic direction from Edgar Wright that defines the film's brilliance, as well as a brilliant screenplay and fantastic performances across the board, Baby Driver is the very definition of entertainment.",Baby Driver
217,kaptenvideo-89875,One memorable adrenaline-pumping mayhem indeed,8,1 August 2017,"Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a young talented getaway driver for criminal mastermind (Kevin Spacey) who values his role in meticulously planned robberies. Also starring, a bunch of cool cats including Jon Hamm (Mad Men""), Jon Bernthal (The Walking Dead"", also Frank Castle in Daredevil"" and The Punisher"" series), Jamie Foxx, Eiza González, Lily James, CJ Jones, Sky Ferreira, Flea et al. I have always felt that people shouldn't be OK with mediocre or shitty screenplays in action movies just because we're talking about just action movies"" or just entertainment"". I can't enjoy bad writing or lots of tired clichés in any genre, and luckily once in a while I do come across a good action movie which has, among other good things, a quality storytelling. Baby Driver"" is one of those – easily one of the best action movie of the summer, of the year and recent times. I love almost everything about it, although I think it would benefit from a more compact final act which turns out to be a overlong series of chases, some by car, some by foot. The main man behind all that goodness is Edgar Wright, director and a sole screenwriter. Yeah, I had to look his name up from IMDb, too. Wright has already given birth to some modern classics already, namely cult action comedies Shaun of the Dead"" and Hot Fuzz"" (paving way to the stardom of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" (one of the most constantly entertaining comic-based movies ever). And Baby Driver"" may well be his best, most fully realized work yet. One would think that a story based on driving cars fast can't give us anything fresh, but Baby Driver"" actually manages to breath a lot of new life into this. According to the makers, tricks and chases do not rely on computer effects, and the result is one memorable adrenaline-pumping mayhem indeed. But there's much more to it than fast cars. The movie is above average in every aspect I can think of – character-building, storytelling, creating suspense, making the actors look cool (an important thing for any action movie!). The visual side is a constant source of pleasure as well, it's carefully and masterfully orchestrated, down to details and including the inventive use of pop music which turns out to be quite an important part of the whole result. All that seems to have inspired actors too whose work is memorable all-around. Wright seems to have almost Tarantino-like talent to make actors cool, or formerly quite cool actors interesting again. Case in point: Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm in Baby Driver"". The central weight of the story still lies on one character, Baby. And this turns out to be one of the rare instances in action movies where giving a lot of backstory to central hero pays off totally and doesn't bore at all. Any of the ten million generic superhero movies made in past, present and future should learn from that. (BTW, Wright has co- written ""Ant-Man"" and Spielberg's ""Tintin"".) Ansel Elgort has previously starred as Caleb in Divergent"" series, which is some YA crap or other. He was also in The Fault in Our Stars"" (also YA, but not crappy) and Jason Reitman's forgettable Men, Women & Children"". But Baby Driver"" could be his true ticket to wider fame, and this young man is likable enough to deserve it. The only thing a bit unattractive about Baby Driver"" is its title, although you will understand and like it more once you have started watching. It's the best 112 minutes I've spent watching action movie in a long time. Give it a chance. It kicks ass.",Baby Driver
218,jb_campo,Fast and Furious combined with Bank Robbers,6,8 December 2018,"Baby Driver starts out with a lot of promise but takes way too long to get there. Baby is a young kid with unbelievable driving skills who, as we learn, gets drawn from a normal life into the life of bad guys and guns. He listens and lives out his life thru music, which is brought out in excellently choreographed coffee shop and chase scenes.The story develops and you learn about how the poor kid experienced childhood trauma. And you learn how he got pushed to the wrong side of the road. But when he meets his dream girl, he gains hope of escape. Can he, is the question, and the driving line underneath the entire movie.Along the way we meet some really bad people played by Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx. The mastermind, who I found a bit miscast, was Kevin Spacey. The banter between bad guys got pedantic after a while, with violence executed for the sake of it, without adding any value to the story. Baby's girlfriend smoothly moves from normal to abnormal life, which was probably trying to have us think of them as Bonnie and Clyde.Great driving scenes. Some witty lines. Some good music. But too long. This should have been over in 85 minutes, not 110. The director spent way too much time with useless dialog between bad guys and many useless scenes. The kids end up being stupid, and I found the ending predictable and contrived.But overall, it was an OK movie if you're ok with gratuitous violence, lots of blood, great car scenes, and stories of young love, both lost and found.",Baby Driver
219,WalkdenEntertainment,Yeah BABY!,8,9 January 2019,"Meet ""Baby"" (Ansel Elgort), a young, male, getaway driver who also happens to have Tinnitus. Baby works for a crime boss who calls himself ""Doc"" (played perfectly by Kevin Spacey). Doc is known for crafting robberies using different teams each time. No matter who is in the team (normally thugs or violent criminals), Baby is called upon as the perfect getaway driver for the job. After completing what was announced to be his ""last getaway job"", Baby wishes to live a normal life, even more so after he meets a young girl named Debora and falls in love. Baby soon discovers that he can't escape his old life just yet...This film is directed by Edgar Wright, whose resume of films include smashing hits such as Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz & Scott Pilgrim VS the World. Once again, Edgar Wright delivers another film with clever action sequences and an audio track that will have you leaving the cinema wanting to purchase the film's soundtrack (on vinyl naturally). I was amazed during musical numbers just how many sound effects were in time with the music and I cannot deny how much fun it was to see. The list of effects includes Gunshots, footsteps, car engines, phones ringing and the list goes on. All of these sounds are critical to the film's soundtrack and also assist in how the film is overall paced.The criminal cast in Baby Driver is a cast loaded with fun and talent. Actors Jon Hamm, Elza Gonzalez and Jamie Foxx all added a wide range of chemistry, all carrying something different. Ultimately, their actions as characters become unpredictable and it was surprising to see where they end up. The stand out from the extra cast members was easily Jamie Foxx for me- I enjoyed seeing his delivery of witty one liners. Overall, you can tell the actors here are all enjoying the film themselves.With an opening that gets the cinema crowd fueled for the ride, Baby Driver does feel like it slows down in its gears until the 3rd act where it once again becomes a fast paced film. In the slower middle section, we watch Baby discover a new love, even a new job, until Baby is forced into action once again. The romance in this film is also a little cheesy as characters fall in love with each after one date, to the point they are both prepared to leave the city forever in just in a snap of short time. This isn't a massive issue for me, but for some it may come across as a very corny romance sequence.Overall, Baby Driver, as expected, delivers the goods. With an overall fast paced ride at the start and finish of the film, sadly the slower portions in the middle hold back the film. Director Edgar Wright has captured and created a film with solid sound effects, car stunts, a great soundtrack and by working with a talented cast line, the film will leave most of the cinema audiences shocked and stunned. As expected for an Edgar Wright film, there's some fun to be had here.8.3/10

220,trublu215,The Most Surprising Film of SXSW 2017.,3,19 March 2017,"Edgar Wright is known to deliver, if nothing at all, very entertaining films. Baby Driver is no exception. With an all star cast including Ansol Elgort, Jamie Foxx, Lilly James, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey, Baby Driver not only is an extremely well cast and choreographed film, it just might be the best film of Edgar Wright's career. Telling the story of a young man named Baby, who is a professional getaway driver who needs music in order to complete his jobs, as he navigates through the criminal underworld. When he takes a risky job for a mysterious gangster (played by Kevin Spacey), he finds himself on the run after things go horribly wrong. With his girl by his side and his music in his hands, Baby must use his specific skillset to get out of the underworld.Before anyone says it, yes, this film plays like a less serious Drive. The storyline is not what is supposed to stand out here, the incredible direction under Edgar Wright and the great central performance from Ansol Elgort are definitely the stand outs here. Granted, I doubt that Elgort would have been able to deliver such a great performance without the amazing supporting cast that Wright wrangles up, but he ends up giving a great performance here as Baby. The rest of the cast is more or less there for name recognition only as none of them go above and beyond in their performance. Despite this, the cast are mere pawns in Edgar Wright's brilliant film. The real stars of Baby Driver are the stunt teams. These car chases are finally something new. With the incredible automobile warfare that the Fast and Furious franchise has given us for decades, it was nice to see a film embrace a smaller scale of car chase. It is real, exhilarating and downright perfect for this film. Truthfully, the car chase sequences here are some of the best that I've seen since Refn's Drive but that's just me. Speaking of Drive, how could I forget Wright's amazing choice of soundtrack. The soundtrack is about just as great as the stunt team's work on this film. This is very much in the vein of Scott Pilgrim as far as soundtrack is concerned and is bound to be a hit come time for the film to premiere in its wide release.Overall, Edgar Wright delivers an action movie with a flawed perfection to it. The story is paper thin, the acting is passable (except for Ansol Elgort, who is terrific), but the action sequences and soundtrack are amazing. These two components are more than enough reasons to go see this film.",Baby Driver

I think so. Anyway, pretty glad to discover that I did like this more than Scott Pilgrim. Not sure what I was talking about when I said that that's Edgar Wright's least funny film to me though, this is by far his most serious. Crucially though, it's no less fun. It lacks most of the brilliant comedy from his other films, but it more than makes up for it with some of the best car chases of the last decade.The soundtrack is what this film lives or dies on, and let me tell you, it soars on the soundtrack. And it's not just that it chose a lot of good songs, it's that they all so perfectly match what is going on in tone, personality, and what the characters are doing. And I can't even begin to imagine how much rehearsal and how many takes it must have taken to get everything matched up so perfectly, so buds out to everyone involved.Everyone fits their role perfectly and even though I did feel a bit of a lack of personality to both Baby and Debora, what makes this relationship work for me whereas Scott and Ramona didn't is a) you believe their chemistry, b), neither of them are obnoxious, and c) both of their performances are great. Still, it wouldn't have hurt to know a bit more about Debora, or get some development on her end.It also wouldn't have hurt to have Jamie Foxx acting as deranged as he insists he is the whole time, or maybe just a little bit more of Edgar Wright's signature flair (this is also by far his most traditionally directed film), but it proves that he's absolutely not a one-genre pony, so I'm very much still excited for Last Night In Soho.Ah yeah, got an essay to get back to...",Baby Driver

Baby Driver is a magnificent blend of car chase and music complete with amazing and interesting characters. You know that feeling when there is a particular tune or melody that gets you grinning? Well, Baby Driver is exactly that, the way that every action and shift follows the beat of the music just creates such an interesting storytelling form. Ansel Elgort was probably at his best in this movie, perhaps proving that he can move out of the YA genre. Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx played really great support roles too. Baby Driver just manages to pack in so much fun, intense action/car chase sequences but also hits the emotional points creating a truly unique and enjoyable cinematic experience.",Baby Driver
227,FallenEye,"No Plan. Just Drive, for Miles and Miles.",6,15 April 2018,"Why didn't Baby agree with Doc to rather not go through with the job after Bats' mess up? Why was his plan to say yes, then run in the middle of the night? Saying ""no"" seems to me like it would've been the shortest route between him getting out of there, and getting to Debora for their 2 a.m. road trip.Speaking of Debora, I'm not really all that crazy about Lily James, but my was she just delicious in this movie. Also, I could feel the calm Debora was for Baby. Ansel and Lily had great chemistry, and made a wonderful onscreen couple.The dialogue, script and word play was especially entertaining, and the performances were effortless all around, and well executed. I would've liked to see a little more of Jon Bernthal however. The action sequences syncing with the score was also a nice touch.Baby Driver is enjoyable, and Edgar Wright is a virtuoso, but at points, it seemed to lose a little bit of control; like Bats insisting on going to the diner, just to want to shoot Debora afterwards. That situation was contrived to have the team meet Debora, however contained little sense in that; why after the night they'd had, would Bats want to further risk the operation?I would absolutely love to give this film a 7/10, but, it left me wanting. I feel like Edgar did in fact write and direct something pretty awesome, but, it lacked. Baby being a driver and his name being ""Miles"" were those nice elements, but, I couldn't help feeling not as satisfied as I wanted to. 6.5/10.",Baby Driver
228,fluffset,Not what I expected from Edgar Wright...,6,25 July 2017,"I love Shaun, Nick Angel, Scott Pilgrim. They are really awesome! & so funny by the way. I carry my expectation to ""The World's End"" and yeah, its OK. So, after all the buzz, the hype and good critics, my expectation is way too high too for this movie. Its my fault to expect a perfect movie, ""Baby Driver"" is just a good, cool and stylized action movie. Its OK overall, I like it. I guess this movie will appeal more well to American audience because they know all the old song that have been played in the movie. They might enjoy it better than people from other continent that's not very familiar with the song selection. I love some of the song too but in some scene I think its too much and kind of annoying when its so loud with the help of the cinema audio system. Enough said, just enjoy it, its OK. If you ask me the ""stuff"" that I expected from this movie. I just expect some ""hot fuzz"" kind of stuff. What can I do? I just love that movie very much.",Baby Driver
229,asifahsankhan,All those fusses you're hearing about this Film ain't fake – It's 100% pure class of Entertainment!,9,27 June 2017,"This film blends awesome action with a superior soundtrack in an original and logical way that makes it all an incredibly fun thrill ride, where the tunes bring the audience into the protagonist's head in a uniquely fun way that I've never experienced before.Imagine if OK Go videos were full-length films and you've only cracked half the technical excitement inside of Baby Driver. The 80's aesthetic that Wright is channelling extends far beyond just some of the song choices. It permeates from every choice in sets design, car models, wardrobe and even the characters. True to the colour palette of the decades the film is paying homage to, every aspect of the film is vibrant. The colours pop and draw us into the film like moths to a very inviting flame.The beauty of the film isn't just in the physical pieces, but in how Wright uses them in a complex ballet of moving parts to tell the story. This includes the often comical interactions with characters that are themselves semi-anachronistic archetypes of films past. We have the Bonny and Clyde duo working with the mercurial, unhinged gangster and the mob boss in businessman skin. There's even the misunderstood hero with a rough past falling for someone whose speed is the opposite of his own. The great unifying force that brings Baby Driver together goes beyond the way they interact with each other and includes how they interact with their surroundings.In addition to the edge-of-your-seat car action, Baby Driver is also the best and most convincing love story that you are likely to see in the cinema this year – making it an almost perfect date-movie, in that you'll likely fall in love with its leads, Baby (Ansel Elgort) and Debora (Lily James).Without getting into the film's minutia, which is revealed in flashbacks as the narrative progresses, Baby is an indentured servant of sorts to a criminal kingpin known as Doc (Kevin Spacey), who masterminds bank heists with the young man as the getaway driver.But, Baby is not just any wheel-man. He has supernatural skills behind the wheel, powered by an iPod mix that fuels and focuses his special abilities. Through the film's soundtrack, you hear the tunes he hears and you will believe a man can fly – through traffic – going any direction – as if he were Superman on wheels.Like any good anti-hero, our man just has to do one more job and then he's out and can walk away from ""the life"" forever and, of course, things are never that easy. Just as Baby meets diner waitress, Debora, and falls madly in love, his world goes uncontrollably awry.In the past, Wright has always included a core theme into his films that everything else revolves around. This time it isn't zombies, aliens or even a cabal of evil exes, but something more relivable: moving music and fast cars. We've all been in the car when our favourite song comes on and we can't help but loudly belt it out while doing some very misguided form of choreography when you probably have both hands on the wheel. Or maybe it's just me? Either way, use that image and increase it exponentially.The film's choreography and car-epigraphy (what I lovingly call car movements set to music, duh) treats every object, including the cars, as a sort of character or an extension of their expression. Every action is synchronised to create a perfect punctuation for that scene. Every song choice mirrors and embodies the emotion of the moment.",Baby Driver

231,FelipeCarrillo,"""Baby Driver"" is a masterful tour de force driving genuine originality and blistering narrative",8,22 September 2017,"In a film period where edginess is often lacking and the few ones that come to light are squandered by unreasonably bombastic pieces of cinema entertainment, filmmaker Edgar Wright breaks into this parched audiovisual panorama with a film oasis that is reaching, at full speed, the summit just after the first two minutes.As a heist cinema veneration, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion welcomes, with a fiery punk blues, the circumstantial maelstrom experienced by the main role, placing the spectator in the middle of the core since the opening, putting us alternatively inside and outside a lavish red car, which symbolizes the fierce, intriguing and frantic path the main character must drive. Undoubtedly, the film encompasses and handles, with an impressive care, a set of juicy components that enable it to do and be tremendous deed: a frenetic and spellbinder stylistic journey (of no return) to a severe personal maturation, an awakening greatly empowered by music, rather by good music. Steven Price, Academy Award winner for his hair-raising compositions for Alfonso Cuarón's ""Gravity"" film, orchestrates and gears, alongside the large sound department, both the created scores and the ultra- popular songs (which monopolize more than 80% of the footage) with the most accurate expertise throughout the story, they're the tires of the film, they take the plot hand-in-hand, a homologous thing to Gunn's work with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", only in an atmosphere a little more worldly. Tossing around icons such as James Brown, Boga, Ennio Morricone or T-REX, the explosive, nostalgic and functional soundtrack effectively slides among more than forty hits from the last centuries that make the wonders of any inveterate musical nerd and assistant who gets involved in the events, an illustrious repertoire pressing the trigger in order to activate the film.The visual section is simply masterful, glorifying frames that synthesize the most beautiful attributes of the scene. Bill Pope's camera emanates magic from the opening sequence; unsuspected angles, smart focus and avant-garde photographic games lead the preconception of the typical and theatrical American crime to another level, one that is hard to reach. Justin O'Neal Miller, Marcus Rowland and Nigel Churcher decorate settings with (on the surface) a limited view of artistic potential: a conservative cafe, a grayish control center, an urban parking plot or depressing banking entities. Leaning on nuances, colors, contrasts and bright visual tricks that, together with Pope's cinematography and Courtney Hoffman's costume design work, conceive a high-octane motion picture in general and specific terms. To finish the flattery, the soul of the footage could not miss, magnified by the task of Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss in the editing room, a fundamental work for the technical and creative results, which must be considered as one of the best incursions within the genre so far this century. Each of the features, mentioned above, are dependent, thus they work such as an intricate Swiss timepiece, an Edgar Wright watch.Actors and storytelling merge into one. Without the excellence of one, there is no excellence of the other. Teaming up with a cast of real talent, the plot doesn't miss the focus and presents what it desires; Here the action scenes don't have mere ends of entertainment, here these are chess chips that jointly address the future of Baby, the leading role. The way in which it brings together the circumstances can be counterproductive, since assembling an interactive puzzle that doesn't demand a high degree of attention by the audience, because of some permissions are taken to sort out some key mysteries in the movie, one of the near non- existent drawbacks. ""The Fast & the Furious"" carries the banner for the car film universe, the high demand action films are led by DC Comics and Marvel Studios titans, thriller genre feeds on periodic indie strangeness and comedies are governed by laughable ideas of major studios, so how does ""Baby Driver"" get to encompass and execute perfectly each of these genres without falling into the classic homage or the shameful copy? Well, the answer is in the successful narrative management. It's practically impossible that a current film doesn't present reminiscences to previous ones, and even this one cannot be saved, however, the way to intersperse surprises, sadness, and twists is sharp and sudden, distributing them naturally thanks to the excellent sketch of the narrative script, an authentic fear of the 21st century. Beauty, masculinity, panache, and energy possesses the acting team that has as head the DJ and actor Ansel Elgort. The performances are unbeatable, something that was predictable in advance by having a first-grade diverse cast, they all have a chance to catch and reach at least a few seconds of glory, however, the main actor, Hamm, James and Spacey are those who freeze the screen with their amazing interpretations, which drive this crazy carriage, which take the greatest praises.""Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, right now I got to tell you about the fabulous, most groovy"" action, crime and thriller motion picture of the year. Wright leads on firmly with one of the most original, potential and coolest proposals within the thriller/crime so far this century. With a remarkable third act, the margins of error are iotas in respect of the sublime work, a contemporary movie with nostalgic and old references by a Hollywood that is claimed step by step; A must-see that needs to be experienced by any cinema fan thirsty for speed, comedy, drama and many, many great twists. Complexly striking, perhaps the best crime is the one made by Edgar Wright, a master of huge magnitudes.",Baby Driver

I have not had this much fun at the theater since I saw Deadpool. Baby Driver is a great movie from an entertainment perspective. Although the movie basically contains a lot of scenes and a plot we've all seen 10 times before, it still feels fresh, fun and original. I am uncertain about the last 10min and the end of the movie, and there are a few misses, and sometimes things goes too fast or have too many cuts, which coupled with the unoriginal originality drops the score somewhat. I believe this to be a strong 8.This is one of those movies you know, while watching it, that it will be a classic movie. 30- 40 years from now essays will be written about this movie, it will be quoted and referenced by critics. I am also 100% certain it will get a sequel, but please don't do it! This felt fresh and fun, I do not think a sequel will top or even come close to what this movie did.Most entertaining movie of the summer so far and yes, you should see this, and buckle up: the music score itself is worth the ticket price.",Baby Driver

236,Lewis_Heather787,Style over substance???,6,18 July 2017,"Went into this film with an open mind because the trailers looked promising and the cast was excellent. Edgar Wright has never been a director that I've personally held in high regard, that is not to say that any of his films are bad, its just there solid and enjoyable films nothing to rave about a lot. Now Im personally quite conflicted in my opinion of this film because I want to like it a lot, there is a lot to like in this film, however there are big aspects of it that just don't work for me personally. The problems I have however probably don't have an impact on anyone else's experience watching this film. Lets start with the positives of the film, Firstly Edgar Wright and his directing and style. This film is beautifully shot every frame in the film is a joy to watch, complimented brilliantly with the fantastic editing of the film. I can't remember watching a film that has been so brilliantly and elegantly edited, it elevates scenes perfectly especially in the fast paced car actions. Wright has pulled out all the stops with this film in terms of his directing there is clear sense of purpose for every shot and movement the camera makes thought out the film. His directing and editing in this film is something to be marvelled at and applauded. The cast of the film, as mentioned earlier, was one of the main reasons for watching the film in the first place. Everyone in the film gives a good performance with what their given, more about the screenplay later, and majority of them seem to have great chemistry together. Ansel Elgort steps up and gives a good, solid main performance of the film, which I was slightly nervous about however he proved me wrong and was great. Lily James also made me little nervous about her casting in this film but once again she proved me wrong and was a good addition to the cast, even though her role was not as big as I though it would have been. As for the rest of the cast legends like Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and John Hamm are all great but you would expect that from them. The final positive of the film for me is the action which is done perfectly and is stunning to watch, however it must have been a nightmare to put together. All the car chases in the film and especially the opening of the film are heart pounding and a edge of your seat ride to watch, they are never a dull moment. The action coupled together with Wright's directing and editing style is a match made in heaven, pure brilliance. Now lets turn our attention to the negatives of the film, firstly the soundtrack to the film. At the first and especially in the opening scene the soundtrack works brilliantly and is joy to watch, however the more the film goes on the more stagnant, boring and annoying it becomes. For me personally it becomes to repetitive of just one greatest hit after another and another and another and so on......It starts to take me out of the film which is really annoying and can ruin some scenes, it suffers from the same problem that Suicide Squad had when it comes to soundtrack, dare I say it. The story and screenplay of the film, it is simple at its core however the majority of the characters are given terrible dialogue to say. The story of a get-a-way driver is nothing new, there is nothing wrong with that, and this film has a simple premise of bank jobs and such. However the stories and background stories to the characters is pathetic, majority of them including the main character Baby hardly have a backstory apart from the fact his parents are dead. The only character with any charisma , charm and wit throughout the film is Jamie Foxx's character, which at best is a side character to the film. The story and the journey of the film becomes really boring and dull because you as the audience don't have a great bond with any of the ""good"" characters, because it is forced upon us. Talking of a force relationship the ""romance"" of the film is really poorly set up and after just one day, its like they've been together for years. Its really rushed and really cliché and a poor attempt to make us, the audience care. All in all the core problems of the film, for me personally, have hindered me from enjoying it. Yes there are some great moments in the film and some really good technical accomplishments but however when a film can't get the solid needs of a foundation for a story right then the rest of the film is trying to balance. I saw an interview recently with Edgar Wright saying that he designed the soundtrack to the film, before writing the script, and oh boy does it show, definitely not one of his best written films to date. 60% out of 100 or 6 out of 10 a Good film however is let down in certain areas, if your just looking for a film to be entertained by great action and music then this is the film for you and that is fine, its just not for everyone a bit of a disappointment.",Baby Driver
237,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"And once upon a pair of wheels, I hit the road and I'm gone",8,30 July 2017,"I thought this was a very fun, high paced action-comedy film. The use of music was great. And I don't just mean soundtrack. The way it was filmed and edited perfectly matched the beats of the songs that were playing. The story is pretty straight forward. Its not something we haven't seen before. Nice guy gets caught up in the wrong crowd, tries to get out and things go sour. But what I think makes this one stand out and be different, is how stylistic it is. There's a certain flair to it. The editing is great (I already mentioned with the use of music, but even with transition shots, and the car chase scene at the beginning in particular was awesome). The direction is great. And there are some funny moments and quips in there as well.Now if I had to get nitpicky, I'd say that I thought the 3rd act gets a little ridiculous at times. It kind of gets turned into a revenge story (which don't get me wrong, I understand Buddy's motives)but having him show up in a cop car mowing people down (not too mention how he somehow knew where they would show up), and Baby and Debora somehow managing to switch cars without him noticing in a freaking parking lot to ""surprise him"" or the fakeout death scene for instance was just over the top. Like the crazy dial was turned up to 100. And its not that it was bad. There was some good action, in particular I quite enjoyed the scene where Buddy is trying to ram Baby down and Baby parkours over the car. It was an awesome shot. I just would have preferred if the overall 3rd act was toned down somewhat. My other problem with the third act is some of the character motivations. I don't feel like they really established Baby and Debora's relationship enough to make me believe that she would just drop everything at the drop of hat for this guy (especially after witnessing him shoot people, steal cars etc). I didn't feel like it made sense that Doc would suddenly decide to help Baby just because Debora shows up. I mean we are talking about a character who had zero problems having other people killed, and threatening Baby before. It just felt like a sudden 180 for that character.But besides those few detractors, it was honestly a fun film that kicks ass.",Baby Driver
238,Ziya90,"Enjoyable, full of nice songs, but in the second half, the movie loses its authenticity",5,26 August 2017,"I like and follow Mr. Wright as an original and creative director and in my opinion, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" is his masterpiece. Hot Fuzz was flawed, but it was a fun and thrill ride and I enjoyed it. Shaun of the Dead was brilliant and funny, but The Baby Driver doesn't feel like it was made by Edgar Wright. This is not his style as a filmmaker. The first half is very entertaining and very colorful like a candy, the camera work, music, characters are all great. However, in the second half, the movie turns into an ordinary crime/heist movie like any other director can shoot. The movie pays homage to some cult movies such as The Terminator, Bonnie and Clyde etc. but it loses its charm and becomes predictable with a boring, weird and unnecessary climax. This movie is supposed to be about music, old tracks and car chases, but other than songs, actually it is not! Don't expect impressive and long car chases like Bullitt or Gone in 60 Seconds etc. If you think that this movie is a car-driven film, you get seriously disappointed. Kevin Spacey is fun here, but the character's changeable motivations kill the rationality here. Jamie Foxx is the star of the movie and also he was my favorite character in the movie. The other couple was very repulsive for me, but the actors plays in a very passionate way, but I didn't care their survival. Music is great here like The first Guardians of the Galaxy and especially the first half was a great piece of entertainment, but the movie has so many flaws. The chemistry and love story between two main characters feels superficial and unrealistic. It is just a plot device. In the final chapter, the movie is a real letdown because of some bad plot twists. I recommend this movie for entertainment, but also if you have zero expectation.",Baby Driver
239,heisenberg12,Fun action-crime flick that is unrealistic and a tad bit overrated,6,19 August 2017,"Is it a fun movie? Besides the boring parts of it (and there are plenty of boring portions), yes. But is it an Oscar-worthy 10/10 or 94% score on RT the reviews and ratings would have you believe? No. Baby Driver is a fun, if yet awfully unrealistic action-heist-crime flick. While parts of it excel, parts also falter; it's not a perfect movie. The main character's driving strategy is a good metaphor for its quality: speed forward, hit brakes, then go backwards in reverse; it's all over the place. However, overall I did like it and it is good. I just don't quite understand how a movie this unrealistic scored so high with critics. Usually movies with this much deus ex machina don't fare as well overall. But if you are in the mood for action packed mindless entertainment, it does a good job in that department keeping you entertained. And it has some laughs mixed in. 6.5/10",Baby Driver
240,niutta-enrico,Baby Driver: Great film. Easy to appreciate if you love comics.,10,29 September 2017,"Edgar Wright has two souls. One is his Simon Pegg, British (he is actually Brit) comedic soul: Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, End of the World enjoyable movies, nothing to say (except maybe that the latter was not so funny).Anyway what i really like is his International (US, Canada) Comic Book soul: Scott Pilgrim vs the World! A fantastic and original movie (based on a comic book) and this last one, Baby Driver, whose reality and characters (Baby, Doc, Bats) are taken by all means from a comic book. Except that there is no book and everything was made by his imagination.The film is really good. A stellar cast. Few incredibly good scenes, maniacally cured down to the last word and to the tiniest detail. And music sync, fresh and meaningful as it was in 'Steamboat Willie' Disney, 1928.",Baby Driver
241,Jared_Andrews,The Most Fun Movie in Many Years,9,20 July 2017,"Baby Driver wins you over immediately.It opens with four people in a car. Three of them are about to commit robbery and the fourth is going to drive them away—that's Baby. As soon as the others leave the car, Baby starts jamming to his lucky robbery song and he does so to a cartoonish extent without an ounce of self-doubt. It sounds cheesy, but it's not, and it also kind of is but in the most charming way possible. Don't worry, it works.As the three others sprint back to the car after finishing their work inside, Baby steals the show. The police chase that ensues is the best one in many, many years. Baby's skills, along with those of the director, make for a dazzling display that will leave your jaw dropped. Keep in mind, this entire sequence is brilliantly enhanced by an absolutely perfect song for the occasion.That's a trend throughout the movie—the music maintains a steady flow of fun energy that always elevates the action, never distracting from it. Don't try to keep your toe from tapping or your head from nodding. The music will win. It's unstoppable.The opening scene provides both a seductive tease and a prescient indication of what will follow. It's all fun and games, even in the perilous parts.Remember how Jamie Foxx subtly stole the show in Horrible Bosses? He does that again here, only to an extent 10x greater. That's not to say he overshadows anyone. They each shine too brightly to stand in anyone's shade.Each actor stars in his or her own role. They thrive. The music thrives. The action thrives. And the Baby drives. Go watch the magic happen.",Baby Driver

This is action cinema done right and the best film I've seen this year thus far.

The film was a nice mix of comedy, white-knuckle thrills, and in your face action. There really wasn't much that I didn't love about this movie.The way the film was built around the soundtrack was interesting and fun. I would be hard-pressed to name a film that meticulously worked with a soundtrack of the way Baby Driver does. Every song is at the centerpiece of a scene and they almost feel like roles in them self. Of course it helps to be soundtrack is just all around awesome also. Baby driver has a Guardians of the Galaxy level good soundtrack.The action scenes were all well choreographed and entertaining. The chase scenes were some of the best I've seen in years. It is impossible not to have fun watching Baby drive. The choreography with some of the best I've seen all year.The plot of the move is simple enough. Boy drives cars fast to help rob banks. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. Bad things happen and boy must save girl by driving fast. Simple, sweet, and a lot of fun. Mixed in is a rogues gallery of interesting characters that all have a life of their own.It also had just the right amount of charm in the plot and characters.

That doesn't mean the other characters were of no importance, but this one got my attention a bit more.

The film gets to that point at breakneck speed. Then it just sputters through moments like Wright didn't know how to finish things through at the same pace.Oh, and Jamie Foxx is intolerable beyond imagination. I know he was meant to be villainous. But it went from being apt characterization to cinematic teeth-grinding smugness without a trace of even devilish nuance.

248,ctowyi,What a ride!,9,26 July 2017,"Freshly minted, super-duper fun, uber cool, confident, thrilling, propulsive, exhilarating, inspired, geeky glee inducing these are just some adjectives I would bandy around Baby Driver and it is definitely deserving of even more. This is pop-culture filmmaking at its best.I once read that there are seven basic plots for telling any story in movies. Nowadays, hardly anyone tries to do anything remotely original anymore. ""Better tell the same story and mixed it up with CGI"" feels almost like a template. I can count on the fingers of one hand, movies that dare to push the envelope this year (Get Out, Bad Genius, Dunkirk) In that respect, Baby Driver isn't original in its story – how many times have you seen a story about a nice guy who thinks he is out, but he is pull back in for one last score and it all goes to shite? It is in its execution and style that it hits the sweet spot.Edgar Wright shot the action to the rhythm of music, not the other way around. Everything about Baby Driver and Baby is about the rhythm and the beat. Bullets exploding from gun barrels to the beat and car drifting to the tempo. The whole thing feels like a magic carpet ride to geek innercity. I love how Baby's character is established gradually – we see his uncanny ability in weaving in and out of traffic like a bat out of hell, always a few steps ahead of the police cruisers. We see how he has different iPods with carefully curated playlists for any occasion and mood (Apple, please bring back the Classic 😬). In Baby's world, music exists in every frame, so much so that his world turns to shite when the music is gone or when he can't find the right tune.Ansel Elgort brought the winsome character to life. From the very first scene, he is the propulsive beat of the whole movie. This is a career-defining and star-making role, and he nailed it. However, the movie doesn't rest on his shoulders alone and the supporting cast is a match made in heaven. We have the ""Man with the Plan"" Doc (Kevin Spacey), Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza González), Griff (Jon Bernthal) and Bats (Jamie Foxx). Just let their monikers roll off your tongue. Aren't they cool? The characters have disparate personalities and each of them brings their own distinctive spin on their roles. These are not cannon fodder or plot movers, each of them menacingly memorable in their own way.In the heart of it all, is a romantic interest played by Lily James. The meet cute is scored to, you guess right, music. We hear the music first before we see the face. By the time the scene hits, you would be so into Baby you know he has now something to look forward to without the movie telling you in boring expositional passages. Their chemistry is palpable and sincere. You want them to get in a don't-know-what car and head west into don't- know-where.Where Baby Driver sort of gone off track for me is in the final reel where characters take somewhat jarring detours and a coda that feels too convenient, but I am not dissing this one little bit. I saw the whole movie with a wide geeky grin on my face, and the first hour is one amazing tour de force. The gears and mechanics at work are calibrated for maximum impact and the car chases are shot with such verve. IMHO this one left any movie in the Fast and Furious franchise in its wake and it is up there together with Bullitt, The French Connection and Ronin.",Baby Driver

250,Morten_5,Lacking the humour it would have needed,5,28 July 2017,"It sounds like the perfect action crime movie for Edgar Wright, but ""Baby Driver"" doesn't hold all way through, despite a strong opening.In 2004, director Wright gave us the brilliant zombie comedy ""Shaun of the Dead."" Then came another successful comedy, ""Hot Fuzz."" Now watching his latest pic, I couldn't help wishing it too would have been an Edgar Wright comedy, rather than yet another heist/car chase/action movie. It does, of course, try to bring something new and Ansel Elgort is terrific, and charming, in the leading role. That's not enough, however, to carry the film through the 112 minutes of running time.",Baby Driver
251,js-66130,One gear.,6,10 August 2017,"Boo! Booooo! Bring it on. I can take it. Despite a plethora of gushing reviews, ""Baby Driver"" is not a great movie. Passable, but not great.How can this be? Car chases, tricky heists, great cast, and director genius Edgar Wright at the helm. Surely this must be one helluva grand cinema going adventure? Well, it is, but only in very short spurts.Cartoonish characters, good and bad, in any action flick worth it's salt lick, gotta have some, um, character. Something sorely lacking over here. Normally juicy actors Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx, are wasted in one dimensional, dry roles. Totally forgettable. Worst of all is newcomer Ansel Elgort, who fits the title profile - he can drive and has peach fuzz - but brings nothing to the table. The opening scene is great: primo, clever four wheel and six barrel action with super cool tunes a blaring (Jon Spencer). Wright films style like no one else, but here, he forgets to pepper the thing with substance. ""Baby Driver"" is a coupla hours of drivin' and shootin'; nothing more than an average video game offers.",Baby Driver
252,Br4ve-trave1or,Best movie of the year,9,25 July 2017,"Edgar Wright has a ungodly craft and with his tremendous resume, his most recent is his best work yet! Movie theaters are a place of escapism for me. It's like a portal from reality. I went into this movie with so much on my mind but soon as it started and the lights dimmed my brain turned off my thoughts as I was captivated and glued to my seat for what was the best possible opening. I knew nothing going in so please I urge you to gain the full experience, don't read up on it, just go in blind. This has to be the most fun I've had in years watching a movie and the cast oh my god, it's superb! Jamie fox, Kevin spacey etc, all great top of their game. But Ansel Elgort steals this movie as Baby. He is baby picked perfectly as a devil driver. If la la land and fast and the furious and drive has a baby this would be it. This is the movie that started the summer films and may be the best! It takes me awhile to re-watch a movie but I could easily re-watch this right now having just seen it! Oh, you thought I'd forget the main character of this movie, the music! Best soundtrack for a movie and I believe music makes movies go from good to great but in this case it's literally a character. You'll find out. This movie is so sharp, engrossing, captivating, fun, funny and a great time to spend where you can escape reality! MUST SEE",Baby Driver
253,Br4ve-trave1or,HUGELY UNDERRATED,9,28 February 2020,"First m, Ansel Elgort is the vehicle of this whole movie and my mind is blown that this actor is not a superstar in Hollywood. Let's talk about how insanely incredible Ansol is in this movie and I swear I DONT THINK ANYONE could have executed or captured his character better. NO ONE. I can only imagine the feeling the director and screenplay writer had to feel seeing it come to life on the shoulders of Elgort.You know Ansol Elgort. Mostly think ""oh that Divergent kid who acted in another movie as her co-star"" but do not let that fool you. This actor can act his ass off but not just that, this movie required, demanded this type of role played flawlessly or else it could not have been so effective. This movie wins you over in the fist ten minutes. Its rare we get these movies that you just know almost instantly that you're about to escape reality for 2 hours. However, on the same token, I did not know this ten minutes into Once Upon a Time in Hollywood but felt it the last ten minutes.
With all that said, this is a movie to watch at night relaxing. Preferably stoned (stoned adds 1 star easily). This movie is a very compelling story but how insanely in sync it is with the whole soundtrack----in sync with Ansols character BABY, is what drives this home. It is balls to walls amazing. Oh yeah forgot to say no pun a sentence earlier.Kevin Spacey is great at being Kevin Spacey. Jamie Fox is miscast. This is Babys movie. His story. The best way to tell a story is to always try your best to instill constant conflicts that these characters face to boost the story and plot forward. Any movie or show that does these things I know its just gonna be a very well made story. It's how we get to love the characters more and see them humanized.This review is way overlong in what I should have just said this is the kind of movie after completing you just feel happy. You know. That feeling after investing 2 hours of life and being suprised by a good story especially with movies now a days. This is it. You will love it. If this movie was released in 2020, I think it would have been an even bigger hit. Also, I'd love to see this same concept adapted into a TV series for only the big time streaming platforms",Baby Driver
254,somf,Believe the hype,10,22 June 2017,"Everything about the film is pretty much pitch perfect if you ask me. Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furious films, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that series if a certain reality of the moves matters to you. This is more in line with Bullit,French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far as great chases.The music, fun, simply fun. Songs from every decade of my lifetime. Action best pure adrenaline action in years. You will be truly on the edge of your seat during much of the film.Humor, what can I say, love Edgar Wright's humor and this is his best.And oh what a cast! Loved every one of the leads performances. I think Ansel was a standout, but come on Jamie Foxx, Spacey, Hamm and the beautiful Lily James. And the other leading lady, Eiza Gonzalez, was unknown to me, but she was great with one terrific diner speech in particular. I was lucky enough to see this at an early screening in Denver. I will be seeing this in the theaters once again when it opens, and I very rarely watch movies more than once.Sometimes when I see a review fawning over a film like this, I think troll. Best way to check that out is see how many films the reviewer has reviewed and rated. I have over 4,000 rated films here. Not a lot of tens either.Best film so far this year.",Baby Driver
255,headly66,"Tedious, slow and ultimately moronic",3,13 September 2017,"This starts out like a 20 min music video with this kid singing and dancing through the streets, turns into a bank robber movie, then a dull love story, then into a free for all.The amount of ""instant police"" in this is ridiculous, no matter where they run there is another cop. The supposed ""brains"" of the outfit hires total screw ups and maniacs to pull off the simplest robberies. At one point they go to get a ton of guns to rob a post office?? The whole premise is that the kid somehow owes Spacey money but when he pays up he is not allowed to get out. The ending is over the top stupid. The use of constant music is fun at first but becomes tedious.",Baby Driver
256,Semisonic,"A hot ride indeed, but still not a space rocket",7,14 January 2018,"If you're reading this then you have probably read a lot of other reviews by now. So you know the upper sides of this film. It's fast-paced, full of slick dialogues and hot car chases. Acting isn't exactly stellar, so isn't the story, but both are fine just enough to keep you entertained.What you might not know is that, despite all its glossy charm and a pretty mighty cast (Kevin Spacey might be an a-hole off stage, but a fine actor he remains), this movie is still a rehash of the old ""good guy force-tied to a bad company"" story. The old-school soundtrack trope, one which worked so well for Guardians of the Galaxy, is effective in this film too, adding to its mojo, but dig one layer deeper - and everything becomes way too black and white and convenient. Ansel Elgort is charming and handsome as ever, and his character is peculiar but nonetheless charismatic. The bandits each have a one track mind they over-exploit in each scene. And even Doc's latest switch of tune - the ""I was in love once"" one - is as expected as it is cheesy. All rolling to a finale convenient and satisfying.I liked Baby Driver for being just what it is - an awesome popcorn flick. It's great at that, never pretending to be anything greater. So if you want to watch a movie to have fun, then choosing this one will make you a happy person. But anything outside the entertainment scenario - including the thought-provoking part - is clearly not what Baby Driver can deliver, no matter how fast it rides. So be straight to yourself and expect no Drive from this film - to avoid any possible disillusionment afterwards.",Baby Driver

It was a really well done film and feels completely different from what I'm used to seeing, but it works. I may have rated this film lower than his other films, but that doesn't mean I didn't really enjoy this film.",Baby Driver
258,spencergrande6,"First and foremost, Baby Driver is a lot of fun",8,7 August 2017,"First and foremost, Baby Driver is a lot of fun. By now most people know that it's a series of music videos set to car chases turned into a feature length film which is a great idea and it's executed with aplomb.The car chases are cool, nothing ground-breaking but they're visceral and real and again, fun. The music matches the scenes brilliantly for the most part. The opening chase set to Bellbottoms is perfect and so is Baby play-dancing down the street to the Harlem Shuffle. Sometimes the music feels a bit too on the nose. Would someone like Baby really only listen to music like this from the 60s and 70s, pretty obscure stuff? Just because his mom left him these iPods? He has no taste that he's formed on his own.This feeling of affectation permeates a lot of this film. It's enjoyable enough that it doesn't matter that much but it does prevent the film from becoming more than its trappings. It can be a bit scatterbrained and meaningless. Not in a brilliant pure pulp kind of way either - make no mistake, this film like most of Wright's films, wants you to care about the characters and make a connection but it doesn't quite achieve that.The story is pretty standard fare for a film like this. One last job, kid with a heart of gold mixed up with the wrong crowd, perfect girl waiting in the wings for him to get out. Ansel Elgort is alright. There's a lot being said that he isn't nearly charismatic enough for this role, and though I would agree, I also think that's part of his character - he's in over his head acting cool to stay sane.The problem is that just enough of his backstory is filled in for the audience to feel that it isn't quite right. His parents died in a wreck, so he became a badass driver - presumably to overcome his fear of car accidents - then became a bad kid with a lot of emotional problems. Somewhere in here a deaf man adopts him (did Baby know sign language before this? why would he? is this even allowed?) and Baby gets involved with Doc against his will (though based on the fact that he was stealing at the time, you think this would be a win win?) and then sometime later he becomes a good kid again who can't look away from the violence he's helping create. It all has the feeling of plot set-up exposition and may have been better left unexplained.Everyone in this is like a comic book character, it's built into their nicknames and their personalities but Bats is the one character grounded in reality and Jamie Foxx imbibes him with the kind of gravitas this movie needed more of - he's great enough that it feels special (that speech about Hamm being a wall street guy who ran away with his stripper is good enough to have thematic weight but not indulged enough for pulp) but there's not enough of his impact for it to hit all the way home. Bats won't let Baby escape into his music and forget about reality - but it could also just be that his character is plot to motivate Baby into finally making a change. Debra literally exists as a figment of Baby's imagination (at least she could be). A girl her age, with her temperament, would not be starting some dive diner waitress job with no boyfriend or outside life to speak of. All we know is that she has a mom she took care of, but then what? She's a plot cipher too involved for that to work as is. Dialogue between her and Baby has a crisp pulp feel to it but it doesn't quite work because the film can't quite decide if it should be taken seriously or not.The ending is up for debate and I read some interviews with the cast that say it's only in Baby's head. This isn't that kind of bleak nihilistic movie so I took the ending at face value. And as for Baby's hearing it's impossible to tell what happened. It seemed like a big deal but fades out of mind almost instantly.",Baby Driver

262,PotassiumMan,Action flick with endless panache and swagger,8,2 July 2017,"There is never a dull moment in this action crime film about a getaway driver who has his own unlimited getaway soundtrack but who also wants to break free from the crime boss who owns his life.There is enough style and visceral strut in this film that it neutralizes the one or two credibility gaps in the plot. Ansel Elgort is great as the title character, but Jamie Foxx steals the film with a lively performance as the loose cannon in the crew. Performances all around are solid and the dialogue is so rife with dueling wits, it's like watching a recurring display of verbal fireworks. These firecracker scenes of competitive criminals showing off their bravado are just as exciting as the chase scenes through downtown Atlanta.The film also banks heavily on a heady, omnipresent soundtrack that keeps the tempo perpetually hyperactive. A word of caution: The action can be tough going at times; the film revels in its permanent state of anarchy before ultimately developing a mean streak. But for all the blistering gunfire and screeching tires, this is not a one-note film. It has its moments of quietly boiling tension and eerie backstory flashbacks. It's a film that wears its attitude on its sleeve and doesn't shrivel into conventionality. Not an absolute bull's eye, but recommended to everyone who wants a good rush.",Baby Driver

264,AnishMisra,Baby Driver Review,9,16 September 2017,"Baby Driver is a film written and directed by Edgar Wright. When I saw the initial trailer of the film itself, I was sure that this film was going to be a blast. And yes, I was quite overjoyed with the film. I haven't seen much of Edgar's work (I have only seen Shaun of the Dead). But I can definitely say that this is one of the best action films I have seen in quite some time.Plot: baby is a getaway driver for a group of robbers led by Doc. Meeting Debora, he decides to leave this job. Can he?? Story and direction: For me, script and direction go hand in hand. If either one of these are faulty the film tends to fail. But in the case of this film, the both of these were just correct. Edgar Wright deserves full credit for this. After the film finished, I was like ""WOW"". I just couldn't stop clapping my hands. This film shows that with the right people on board for a film, you can work wonders. I mean this theme has been worked around for quite long wherein a guy with bad people always wants to get out. But when he decides to, he just realizes that it's just not easy. But the way Edgar handles this theme is just marvelous. And the car chases.... I can basically go on about them. They were just impeccable. Many people have complained about the romance slowing the pace. But, I think that was quite necessary to delve deep into the characters of Baby and Debora. But when the pace picks for the final hour, I mean I seriously had goosebumps. Each and every minute you worry about the lead pair. And finally, I would like to comment on the thing that was the soul of the film: THE MUSIC. I am not quite a keen listener to Engish songs. But man, I liked the choice of songs that were picked up for this film. Excellent work Steven Price (who also scored Suicide songs- which too had a nice pick of songs)!!!! Also, a small mention to choreographer Ryan Heffington who syncs in the action with the music seamlessly.Acting: Ansel Elgort was the star of the film. My god, what a diversity!!!! I loved him in the Fault of Our Stars and here is still proving that he is a great actor. Lily James was just like your next door girl. She was sweet, cute, bubbly, etc... Kevin Spacey was also good as Doc. Jamie Foxx was also great as the twisted Bats. Jon Hamm was also one of the highlights. During the last half hour or so, I quite liked his performance.Favorite Scene: The scene where Doc says Baby to scan the United States Post Office for cameras, exits, employees, etc... We basically can see the reluctance on Baby's face regarding the work given. And the kid, just blurting out all the info to Baby was just an icing on the cake. And the scene there after, where Baby just gives the info to Doc and the kid reminds him that he forgot something. This scene also showed that Baby was fed up of the kind of work he was doing.Verdict: I had a blast with this film. Watch this film especially for Ansel Elgort, he is a definite star in the making. if you are a music lover too, I guess this film won't disappoint. If you are an action lover too, I recommend this film.I am going with a 9/10.",Baby Driver

266,quinimdb,Baby Driver,9,27 June 2017,"First, I'll address the elephant in the room: ""Baby Driver"" is a pretty stupid name. But, the reason for this title is that the main character's is called Baby, and the reason for that has mainly to do with the constant music he has playing (many, many songs use the word ""baby"") order to drown out the ringing in his ears (and the childhood trauma it reminds him of) due to an injury that was caused by a car crash he was in at a young age that also killed his parents, one of them also being a musical artist. Oh, also, he's a getaway driver. A really, really great one, that moves in the car with such effortless grace as if it were a dance. He started this most likely as a way of combatting the traumatic memory of his parent's car crash and assuring that he'll never make the same mistake that his parents have. He tries to make music out of the conversations he has with his boss (Kevin Spacey) and acquaintances who are all robbers (Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Eiza Gonzalez, mainly), literally taking a negative thing and trying his best to give it a positive spin. His intentions are always good, he was just pulled into this at a young age against his will and has been working to get out since.Now, it may seem like this is all spoiler territory, but most of this characterization is communicated pretty early in the film, and Baby himself rarely talks. What this film does best is communicating Baby's feelings and thoughts through the choice of music in each scene, and the choreography, editing, and camera movement that goes along with this music, often incorporating sounds happening in the scene into the beat of the song that Baby is listening to. It is like there is a constant tempo to the film, giving it a constant upbeat, heart-pounding, fast pace. Baby even often changes the music to get it so it perfectly syncs up with what is happening, as if he needed to keep a perfect rhythm to each and every move that he made. Not to mention how the action scenes themselves reveal character, rather than existing solely to be thrilling. The development happens during the action, such as one instance when Baby quickly veers off the road to prevent Batz from shooting someone. And this is on top of the fact that the action choreography and editing in these scenes is amazing, creating a perfectly symphony of gunshots and car crashes and screeching and classic rock.Even when there isn't music in the film, all of the sounds seem deliberate. Just as we hear whatever music Baby hears, we also hear the ringing in his ears when he doesn't have the music, often creating heightened tension due to a sense of imbalance compared to the easy flow the film has when there is music. There is occasionally an orchestral soundtrack when Baby doesn't have his Ipod or his record player or the radio or cassettes, but this orchestral soundtrack subtly tends to blend with the high pitched whistle that Baby actually has.From the start of the film Baby is told by one robber he worked with named Griff (Jon Beranthal) that one day he is going to have the blood on his hands and he won't be able to wash it off. Throughout the film, it constantly feels as if Baby's gleefully dancing on the rim of the volcano, almost dipping his toe in the lava on the inside. I won't spoil whether he falls in or not, as not knowing is part of the fun, but all I can say is that the ending is as satisfying as it could've possibly been subverting cleverly any expectations you may have had.",Baby Driver

269,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,10,10 July 2017,"Edgar Wright returns to the director's chair after the conclusion of his famous Cornetto Trilogy, with a film that pays not only to the 70's action films but bringing a style that packs a solid ride from start to finish with detail and a soundtrack to love. Baby Driver is one of this year's best and unexpectedly entertaining films to have surfaced.Baby Driver tells the story of 'Baby', Baby is a young and partially hearing impaired getaway driver who can make any wild move while in motion with the right track playing. It's a critical talent he needs to survive his indentured servitude to the crime boss, Doc, who values his role in his meticulously planned robberies. However, just when Baby thinks he is finally free and clear to have his own life with his new girl friend, Deborah; Doc coerces him back for another job. Baby finds himself and everything he cares for in terrible danger. It will take all of Baby's skill, wits and daring, but even on the best track, can he make it when life is forcing him to face the music.What makes the film so engaging throughout is it's incredibly paced concept, style and production value than puts most modern blockbuster films to shame (not to say all are bad) but with a unique vision, eye on concept and making it cool. The cast here handle their roles so well and look to have a blast with their perspective roles; The soundtrack throughout was on point, listening to classic rock, soul and various 60's and 70's tunes through car chase sequences, shootouts and even character engagement makes it so much fun. The action sequences were all taken to levels of high quality, with editing and sound mixing and choreography reaching out to the possibility of Oscar considerations in the next awards season.Baby Driver is a wild ride that will indeed win over audiences, with tight on the spot editing, in sync action set sequences, wickedly good characters and cast performances and a solid eye on detail from story to what's on screen. Take my word, this movie kicks serious arse and with style! 5/5 - Nick In 2004 we witnessed the birth of the the most talented and most clever director and writer in the world. We are talking about a man by the name of Edgar Wright. A man who gave us the funniest Zombie movie of all time...Shaun Of The Dead. And in 2007 he gave us the best action/comedy that had ever been done..Hot Fuzz. Sadly in 2013 Wright's film At Worlds End flopped a bit. Good news is his new film Baby Driver is not a disappointment. Wright is back with all of his comedic, action, clever talents.The acting is top notch, especially from Ansel Elgort (from Divergent and The Fault In Our Stars.) Lily James (UK actress who plays American waitress Debora) is beautiful, and is downright badass and awesome. The supporting actors like Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey and Jon Hamm are all great with their role. It's not until the second act that we get to see just how intimidating and scary Jon Hamm is. There is also a scene in the Cafeteria involving the criminals being in the same place as Debora that is very scary and tense. It's not a scene you will forget very quickly.Should also point out that the music and song choices and even remixes are brilliant. The editing is Oscar Worthy. The gun shots even go along with the beat brilliantly! Edgar Wright keeps on proving that more and more he is the most talented writer and director, and he never gives us a bad film. From 2004's Shaun Of The Dead all the way to 2017's Baby Driver...it's fair to say we have a new classic in our hands. How much better can Edgar Wright get at doing this? 5/5 - Jay",Baby Driver
270,a.lampert,More honest if it had been hyped as a fantasy.,4,21 July 2021,"Although I enjoyed watching the actors and chase scenes, there's not much else to recommend Baby Driver for. Clearly aimed at a teen market, it can't be called a thriller, more a romantic fantasy. On the plus side, there's the beautiful and talented Lily James as Deborah, the much maligned Kevin Spacey (I don't understand the hysteria currently around him), Jamie Foxx and John Hamm. A weak script with adults talking in teen speak I found irritating, particularly with reference to music, a preposterous amount of non-realistic violence and a leading actor of no discernable talent other that he can run fast, it's really a disappointment after some of the hype. I am completely perplexed as to what Lily James' character of Debbie would have seen in this oaf. Unlike her, his smile if he has one, had obviously gone on vacation so we never know if he has any sex appeal and I found Baby as he's called, as dull as a rainy day, in fact that's an insult to rainy days. Did the director think he had another Brad Pitt in the making, well, clearly not. Colourful and noisy, the ridiculous action scenes are well handled but just too silly for words. People are shot but just spring back into action as they do in cartoons. Don't believe the hype if you're expecting a decent thriller.,",Baby Driver

As much as I love his Cornetto trilogy they're all, even if purposefully so, very similar so I wanted to fully see what he was capable of doing, a Baby Driver proved to me that he is a forced to be reckoned with, I do think this is his best film to date and one of the best of the year so far. It's completely clear from the very beginning that this is Edgar Wrights movie, he has a very unique style that I've always loved, it's very sleek with a lot of quick edits which works perfectly with the pace of the action sequences. I loved his decision to match up his action sequences, as well as simple dialogue or movement scenes to music, though I've never listened to any of the songs in this film it made it more engaging as well as unique. This film has a fantastic cast, Ansel Elgort has never impressed me so I wasn't sure how I would feel about him in this movie but I think he nailed it, playing on Baby's more tragic side as well as his complete commitment physically makes this easily his best performance. I loved Jon Hamm in this movie, I liked how he played his characters gradual downward spiral, Jamie Foxx was really intense in this movie as well as having a great back and forth with Elgort, I loved Kevin Spacey he was really ominous and you could tell that he had some kind of motive and other plan behind everything he did. Lily James was great in this movie she was very likable and had a really good romantic chemistry with Ansel Elgorts character. I really liked the arcs of every character in this film, while not every character gets detailed backstory you get the impression that it was what Wright was trying to go for, to try and better show the ominous nature of this whole organisation and the people involved in it. I loved Baby's arc if learning from his mistakes and excepting consequences for his actions it made his character more likable as well as better rounded. There were definitely some cliché aspects of Kevin Spaceys character of a crime boss trying to get back a debt from the protagonist but I liked that they gave the character some heart as well as some good head butting scenes with the people who worked for him. I also loved the ever growing tension between Foxx and Elgorts characters that really came to ahead in a nice way.I didn't know how I'd feel about the romantic sub plot in this movie but I have to say it really worked for me. I absolutely believed that these two characters had a connection. Not only do the actors play off each other very well but the characters are just written so well that you want the whole situation to end in their favour. It also felt very believable, it didn't feel like it was some cheesy romantic drama but a real relationship that I really could get behind. My only real issue with this movie is some aspects of the way it concludes, now I did love how they wrapped up Baby's character and his romance with Collins but in some ways the conclusion to the arcs outside of that did feel a bit rushed, it seemed as if some many arcs had been built up throughout the film that needed to be concluded but it did feel a bit rushed in some ways they went about doing it. Baby Driver completely succeeded at what it was trying to be, an entertaining crime thriller with a good heart, solid characters and an investing love story. I loved the way Edgar Wright directed this movie, all the actors performances as well as the arcs of the characters they played, though the conclusion to a lot of the films arcs did feel a bit rushed the overall quality of the film only makes me more excited for what Edgar Wright is going to do next. 9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)",Baby Driver
272,magnuslhad,hit-and-miss,5,19 March 2019,"An unfortunate dip in form for Edgar Wright who seems to be trying too hard to chase a certain youth democratic in America, and so ends up sacrificing substance for style. The opening chase is a fantastic hook, and the character of Baby is teasingly introduced. There is a full palette of the much-loved Wright tropes, such as fast cutting and self-deprecating humour. But the musical theme is laid on far too thick, and the soundtrack becomes annoying after a while. The romance storyline is under-realised, with the female character really only a token presence. She is a love interest for Baby, but beyond that we know little about her, and she shows no agency or independence. It's a good performance from Ansel Elgort and a stand-out one from Jamie Foxx, but the film drags in places and lacks sincerity.",Baby Driver
273,bronzesrv,AWESOME ACTION ADVENTURE!!!,8,9 November 2018,"I absolutely love this movie, as with all movies, there are plot holes and different things that should have been done different. Overall I thought Baby was adorable! I couldn't stand Jamie Foxx's character it was absolutely disgusting! Glad when they got rid of his a$$ LOL. Kevin Spacey was also awesome in this movie. It would have been nicer to have a bigger backstory on Baby and him and Docs relationship. Overall the music was awesome and the Fast and Furious driving scenes were amazing. I hear they are working on a sequel, that would be awesome as well.",Baby Driver
274,pokemon_trainer_lucas,A unique film!,8,21 June 2019,"I love this film because it has a take on action that is quite unique. You feel a connection to the protagonist, Baby, and you feel sympathy for him despite the fact that he is part of a criminal operation. The ending is a bit unbelievable, which lets it down slightly, but nonetheless it is a heart-warming and yet action-filled film.",Baby Driver
275,danielharden,Plug In Baby,8,22 June 2017,"From Edgar Wright, co-writer and director of the Cornetto trilogy and Scott Pilgrim vs the world, comes a rather fresh take on the Heist genre that is Baby Driver. Ansel Elgot of the Fault in Our Stars and Divergent fame, stars as Baby, a young getaway driver with a deep rooted love of music and indebted to the wrong person, Kevin Spacey. Baby drives to pay his debts and keep those he loves safe, but when things start to escalate its dog eat dog. Wright's first solo writer/director feature is like True Romance as a heist film, while bringing Wright's auteur stamp to the genre. It's a brilliantly acted and directed film, even if the story unfortunately does get progressively worse.The films first half was far better than its second in my opinion. Opening with a heist that immediately solidifies the film as an Edgar Wright one. Baby's car dancing and lip synching establishes a comedic element that has run throughout his work and the signature Edgar Wright fast cuts are used as good as ever in several absolutely fantastic car chases in this film, but especially in the films opening. The films first act is the films peak. I would also like to highlight Wright's choice in this sequence, and throughout the film, to not show the heist take place, he could have easily made the film super conventional and shown a heist, but this film isn't about that. Wright Knows the film he is making and it's really quite a feat to make a heist film without really showing a single one. Not only is he unconventional in not showing a heist, but he also uses the long take quite a lot, and from the 'Master of the Fast Cut' this was very interesting to see. After the excellently executed opening sequence we are graced with an equally well executed title sequence which is all done in one take. I understand why Wright would use the long take. It lets the actors feel the music, move and react to it. The title sequence is exactly that as Baby goes to get coffee while listening and reacting to a song as it plays in its entirety. The long take is used throughout, similar to Wright's signature fast cut, and it simply showcases his versatility as well as his impeccable handle over a soundtrack.At the screening I saw, Edgar Wright stated in an introductory video to get ready for an awesome soundtrack and he isn't wrong. What makes Baby Driver's soundtrack so good isn't just the selection of songs, which is brilliantly done by Steven Price, but the way in which Wright has woven them into the film. I did think to myself before the film started ""are they just trying to capitalise off what Guardians of the Galaxy did and is doing?"", but now having seen Baby Driver I can safely say, that the way Wright has used his soundtrack is truly unique, and not just an easy attempt at merchandising. You can tell that Wright had the songs in mind before and/or during the script writing process as scenes are written and directed around certain songs, such as Debora by T. rex. I have heard critics call Baby Driver a 'sudo-musical', but I would prefer to compare it to more of a 2 hour long music video. The use of music allows for Wright to play with how the film is edited and he does not disappoint as the entire film is edited wonderfully by editors Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss.Now, although Wright directed the absolute hell out of this film and the wove the soundtrack in nicely, the film does however suffer a dip in quality when it tries to create and relationships. My biggest issue is with Kevin Spacey's character who I would like to have known more about, especially in regards to his relationship with Baby. This is mainly a problem as his character takes a sudden U turn in the films third act which is so sudden to which we are given one sentence explanation ""I was in love once."" Maybe Wright wanted his character to be a mystery, I don't know, but personally I would have liked the film to focus a little more on Spacey and Elgort's relationship, thus giving the film's final act a little more kick even if it doesn't really need it. Also the relationship between Baby and Debora was okay but didn't have to take up so much of the run time as it did. The only other issue I have is with the films final act as, although directed fantastically and filled with unexpected moments, it did feel rather expected due to the nature of the heist genre. I can't help but have the films The Town and Triple 9 in mind, and personally this association made the final act a bit too conventional than for what I would have liked. I also didn't really like the ending. I found it a bit rushed and arbitrary and to me it felt like an alternate one you get in the DVD extras But then again who doesn't like a happy ending? In this case me I guess.To conclude, Baby Driver is written and directed to near perfection by Edgar Wright, with a big star cast that more than satisfies expectations the audience would have of it, and a kick ass soundtrack that is woven beautifully into the film, Edgar Wright has made yet another great film here. Although the script could have probably done with one more draft, adding a little more detail into characters and their relations to others, but then again it is because Wright has created such interesting characters that I even want to know more in the first place Watch out Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift because here is the real Drift King.",Baby Driver
276,dcobbimdb,My kind of movie,9,4 July 2020,"My rating scale for movies is simple, how entertaining was it? And I found this very entertaining from start to finish. For one I liked the characters, I actually liked them all. They all had their quirks, but their intriguing points too. For me that's somewhat crucial in that if I can't get behind any of the character it just bounces me out of the movie. That was the case for me with the other recent movie I saw ""Uncut Gems"" which got a great review score, but I couldn't stand it, primarily because I hated or couldn't relate to a single character. This film however was quite the opposite.The flow of the movie throughout was spot on. And as others have already pointed out the music is great and perfectly integrated into the film. For me though what I really loved was all the subtle and unexpected humor. Humor like this is awesome because while the film does take itself serious, it doesn't take itself too serious and has some unexpected and cheesy humor baked in that all works and totally hits the mark.I understand some negative reviews complaints about unrealistic aspects and things, but I didn't mind because again the film doesn't take itself too serious, so at least for me it was easy to suspect disbelief, where as with very serious movies it can be difficult, whereas here it's just kind of comical. That said about the only thing I wasn't fond of (hence the 9 out of 10) was a couple plot points such as the butcher scene or why Doc was at the hideout after the botched heist, but I could overlook these things for an otherwise great film.Bottom line, from the opening scene I was sucked in and found it more and more intriguing as it progressed into the 2nd & 3rd acts. A very enjoyable watch that I was happy to have stumbled upon",Baby Driver
277,andrew-hill515,Terrible,2,4 March 2021,"This was not a movie, it was a feature-length music video.The plot, such as it was, was a paper-thin excuse for 2 watchable car-driving scenes, plus a few small bits of driving that were meant to be the same thing, but weren't.From what I could tell, it couldn't decide if it wanted to be Driver or The Transporter so it tried to be both at the same time and failed entirely to be either, or to be its own thing.Completely not worth watching, and it's so bland and forgettable that I'll have forgotten it entirely by this time tomorrow.",Baby Driver

Man I wish I saw this sooner.Baby Driver is filled with a score that makes the film flow is such a beautiful way. Chase scenes, gunfights, the love story, random encounters, family interactions - they're all complimented with an amazing score.
Other than the score, this film still has so much to offer. You really get to know, love, and hate some of the characters you meet along the way. Their actions and personalities all get shown in a straightforward, beautiful way. Stunts are impactful, chase scenes are jaw dropping, and gun fights are thrilling and feel like they're full of risk. All of it is packed into a nice two hour run time that's grips you from the start and never lets you go.",Baby Driver

Finally a feel good joy ride of a movie, if you fall asleep during this movie, something is wrong with you, the acting, the music, the direction, the action and the cinematography is top notch in this movie. Ansel Elgort is an amazing actor who now has a fan for life and Edgar Wright is a genius. I even loved how there was a deaf actor who was great by the way, his name is CJ Jones and Lanny Joon was really funny as JD even though the character was quick he was awesome. The movie had 3 heist sequences and each one was better than the next and I'm telling you I was literally on the edge of my seat the first two times seeing the movie, I was able to sit back and really enjoy it the last two times. This movie needs to win every award there is because it is that good.

280,Oktay_Tuna,The Movie Feels Like It was Directed by 3 Directors,6,11 August 2020,"The first 45 minutes of the movie is really intriguing and it absorbs the audience with joy and fun. You don't understand how time passes in this part. But after Kevin Spacey tells Baby that they need to keep working the movie goes on a totally different direction, the tone gets more serious and I started enjoying the movie less. I would describe the 30-35 minutes part of this movie mediocre. In comparison, the 35 minutes part had more character development but had less enjoyable parts about driving and music, which I think were the best parts of the movie. The ending though I didn't like a bit. The movie went bonkers in a really childish way with unbelievable action scenes and I felt like they came from a cheap action movie. The only thing I loved about this part was how different it feel when there is no music, it kind of gave a rather interesting message. Like I said, the movie feels like it was directed by 3 directors. The 1st one is trying to direct a fun movie about driving and music, the 2nd one is trying to do a mediocre action movie, and 3rd one is just there to mess this movie up because of some revenge or whatnot I have no idea.",Baby Driver

283,athena24,Minority review,6,15 July 2017,"'Baby Driver' is one of the most praised movies on IMDb that I have ever seen, and after comparing different feature films that are currently screened the choice was quite clear. While overall I did like 'Baby Driver', I definitely do not share the enthusiasm of the vast majority of the reviewers here. I'll briefly go over my point of view on the movie and then share my likes and dislikes.'Baby Driver' is a heist movie; however, the accent here is on the getaway. The plannings and the robberies are in the background. Besides that there are the usual themes: the last job, misfits who find each other and psycho robbers/killers who pull off the heist.For me, the best parts of the movie were the car chases. Not perfect, but still great and quite original. They felt quite authentic as well. Reminiscent of the chases in the Bourne series but slightly better.The other things I liked were: the acting and the camera work. I think that every actors did well, but I'd mention Jamie Foxx as being the most convincing in his role.For the faults (from my perspective) I would pick the third heist as the major one. It is where all started to disintegrate and became quite stupid. It's first evident in the choice of the crew members, the relationship between Baby and Doc, The chain of events and the overlong, quite boring standoff between the main protagonist and the main antagonist.I'll sum it up by saying that It just didn't meet my expectation. Yes, after reading the description and reviews I thought that perhaps it would be something like 'The Town' or even 'Heat' with those ratings. However, unlike the noted movies, this one was full of idiots as robbers and stupidity ruled. The latter is probably on purpose but it didn't make my experience any better since I didn't find it funny either.",Baby Driver

285,joshbarton15,A slice of fried cinematic gold,10,21 June 2017,"Edgar Wright may not have made too many films however, he's one of the few directors working today that can generate such a buzz for his projects, thanks to their originality and sheer entertainment value. His sixth film, Baby Driver, has been no stranger to positive word of mouth and it is well and truly deserved. Believe the hype because Baby Driver is a pure slice of fried cinematic gold.After being coerced into working for a crime boss, young getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail, finding love along the way.Wasting no time in dropping the audience right into the frenetic action, Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is relentlessly paced throughout, building in kinetic energy as each chase sequence rises in intensity and magnitude, leaving you well and truly on the edge of your seat. Featuring incredible stunt work and some swift cinematography from Bill Pope, Baby Driver possesses some of the best chase sequences I've ever seen on film.Another aspect of the film that elevates it to another level is the soundtrack Wright expertly utilises for not only the major chase sequences, but the smaller scale scenes too. Every song works so well, whether it be Tequila accompanying a shootout or Hocus Pocus playing over the film's major chase sequence. Seriously though, the chase sequence that sees Baby trying to escape via both car and foot is just insanely well put together, Hocus Pocus being the real cherry on top.Coming to the performances, Baby Driver features a small yet impressive cast, ranging from relative newcomer Ansel Elgort through to the seasoned pro that is Kevin Spacey. Elgort may not be as charismatic as you'd think however, he really does suit the role of Baby incredibly well because it isn't a role that requires the most charismatic of actors. There are other roles in the film for that, one of them being Jamie Foxx as Bats, a member of the heist team who has a penchant for violence and running his mouth. This is the best I've seen Foxx for a while and, along with the rest of the cast, he looks like he's having a ball.Edgar Wright's Baby Driver has an old school crime caper feel to it but with Wright's sharp writing and knack for humour plus the amazing chase sequences at hand, it really does become something else entirely. This is sure to be one of the most original and thrilling films you could see all year.",Baby Driver

It's directed by Edgar Wright and stars Ansel Elgort, Lily James, Joe Bernthal and Jamie Foxx.From the very beginning, I could tell this was gonna be something fun and I ended up having a blast with this movie. The way the scenes match the music makes it almost feel like an action musical and it's truly refreshing to see, especially with such hypnotic action. At the same time, you can tell how much heart is put into this film. It seems like everything was done with so much care and everyone is enjoying what they're doing. And it sure is an enjoyable experience, this is one of the coolest movies recently and one of the most re-watchable this year. Every actor is great on their own, the story brings a familiar premise in a new way, the direction twists it further and the soundtrack is great. The pacing is even and while it does occasionally slow down, it's not felt, I was entertained every second.I have nothing but words of praise for this movie and I'm happy to say it's one of my favorites of the year.

290,Morejambo54,Movie carried by music and characters,8,3 July 2021,"From the starting scene we instantly learn that music is a huge focus of the movie, the opening scene really sets the tone for the movie and really helps to create Baby's character. He's quiet around others, but as soon as they leave he's extremely extroverted. This is important later in the film where his character opens up to others. The music choices are excellent, I love how the action scenes are timed to the music it's so subtle but really gives a feel for momentum. Even towards the beginning as Baby go's to get coffee the lyrics to the song he is listening to are written on walls, the floor and on posters. It's this attention to detail that drives the film forward. The people Baby works with are intimidating and continue to challenge him in various ways making his situation more and more terrible. Now I've seen a lot of hate for the ending of the film, as if it completely ruined the film, I agree with this to a certain extent. I do think the ending did kinda ruin the flow the movie had going and really just turned it into any other action movie ending, very cliched...quite boring. It's certainly not bad though, I think it is still pulled of well enough to be satisfying to the viewer and is still enjoyable. Honestly I really do like this movie and have actually rewatched twice now. 8/10 :/",Baby Driver

Thankfully, I decided to give it a go and what a fantastic film this is.The movie opens with a bank heist followed by the getaway car chase that would put the Fast and Furious franchise to shame. The main reason...its so much more realistic. This scene lets us know how good of a driver ""Baby"" is, as well as how the music will play an integral part of the film.The acting is top notch all the way around with funny one liners from almost all of the characters. The action is fun, the music is better, and the story brings it all together. Highly recommend this movie. One of my favorites so far this year.",Baby Driver
292,themovieparadise,Absolutely Brilliant!,9,22 June 2017,"Let me cut to the chase: this movie is awesome! Pure and simple. Edgar Wright is a f*cking genius. What he is able to do in crafting this movie is just mindblowing. It is so slick and razor sharp, that I had a hard time thinking about just how much work actually went into the production design, the editing, the cinematography, the sound editing, and the direction in order to have everything run as smoothly as it did. I'd say there is music playing for about 75% of this movie, and it isn't just some random pop songs playing in the background. The movie is entirely constructed around its soundtrack. Every frame, every shot, and every action happens to perfectly coincide with the music. And it's edited to a T! It is stylized in the best way, and it just comes across as a beautiful orchestra of visual awesomeness. If you look in the background, you can see graffiti on the buildings that has some of the song lyrics, and its timed that you hear it in the song as Baby walks past this graffiti. That's the level of care and attention that went into every shot of this movie, and I was blown away by it. There were elegant long shots that you could tell were endless rehearsed and prepped in order to flow seamlessly with the music. There are few movies where I genuinely don't know how they did or pulled something off, and this is one of those movies.",Baby Driver
293,Venomage03,Baby Driver was a really good movie,7,4 June 2021,The movie was very entertaining and kept you engaged. The story was well written with some good characters in it.

294,rabbitmoon,Nowhere near as good as the hype,6,20 June 2017,"I was hugely excited for this, as a fan of Wright ever since Spaced. But I left feeling really underwhelmed. If you want a Kingsman style lightly amusing comedy with a good soundtrack then its great. But if you're looking for the warm, cosy, nuanced and observed humour and subtle wit of the Cornetto trilogy with a bunch of heart and charm then you might feel underwhelmed too. Whats wrong with it? (spoiler free) It over-relies on the central idea of music and syncing. If that had been one element on the side of a much more interesting and character driven heist film (e.g. just a gimmick of the driver), it could have worked brilliantly. But because its been SO built around that idea, you start thinking ""really, is the idea even that interesting?"" The syncing becomes more distracting with its fantasy elements (e.g. Hamm shooting a gun in time to the music that Baby's listening to). Its fine for a short film or music video, but it gets stretched a little thin across a whole feature (especially when there's precious little between these moments to be interested in). There are precious few actual car chases. I was expecting a climactic crazy chase on a scale with the one in Blues Brothers, something over the top and cinematic as with Hot Fuzz, but it never happens. The action shifts instead to some pedestrian action in a car park interior. The chases themselves are fairly short and really not very inventive - beside the music syncing there's just nothing interesting about them. The opening of Drive feels far more engaging and interesting in comparison. The central romance falls flat. The girl just comes across as fake and irritating, with zero chemistry between them. Because of this, Baby's purpose to be with her has no credibility. The other characters are all weak. I craved some of the brilliantly nuanced characters of Wrights other work, even ones that pop up for brief moments (e.g. Peggs housemate or Reese Shearsmith's character in Shaun). Spacey does a hugely watered down version of his Glengary character. Jon Bernthal's more interesting character only pops up for a brief pointless cameo to make 'retard' jokes, never to be seen again. The cinematography feels dull like a TV pilot, its just not inventive in the way that it feels like it should be. Visually, its the weakest Wright film by far. The plot is clichéd. For a heist film, there is nothing inventive or memorable about the writing or story whatsoever.The music is obviously great, and there are some nice amusing moments. But it didn't live up to the film I imagined from the hype, or Edgar's other movies, at all. I feel like people are just being suggestible to the idea of ""cool music"" and marketing.",Baby Driver

296,Hawkensian,Little more than a mix tape with dull characters and clichés attached to it,5,15 July 2017,"I read an early tweet that described Baby Driver as 'a mix-tape with a film attached to it' and that proved to be an accurate comment. The tweeter may have thought this was a good thing, but I certainly don't.Yes, there are some good tracks and the action sequences are elaborate and frenetic (a little too frenetic, actually), but the characters are dull, unlikeable and bear very little relation to the real world. I simply did not believe in them, especially Darling, the sassy, kick ass stock character that only a fool would consider to be a strong female character.Then there's Baby, whose laconic, boyish demeanour makes him a rather uninspiring protagonist. His romance with Debbie, a cute little waitress, is yawn-inducingly clichéd, too.If you want a stylish heist film that isn't so bloody try-hard, then watch Drive. It's an exercise of style over substance much like this film, but it has suspense, atmosphere and characters that could actually exist rather than blaring music, mind-numbing action and flat, hateful comic book characters.",Baby Driver

Baby is teamed up with Griff (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza González), and Bats ( Jamie Foxx) to steal from the postal office.Meanwhile, Baby develops a relationship with a waitress named Debora (Lily James). Both want to start a new life, but Baby gets thrown into this gig. He plans to run away with her, but the plan goes awry.Pros:
* The music.
* The scene in the beginning where Baby is dance/walking to a song, all the while with the graffiti syncing every now and then with the words in the song.
* Solid acting by everyone with Elgort and Foxx being standouts.
* good chemistry between Elgort and James.
* ""Who doesn't like hats""? Not sure why I found that line so funny, but I did.
* The playful ""Easter egg"" scenes like the song sync mentioned above, the dryer scene, the guns syncing with music,Cons:
* movie seemed to go a bit long near the end. The whole thing with Griff just got a bit unbelievable after a while.
* it was hard to believe, with all the things that happened, that they would still go forward with the post office heist.
* hard to believe Deborah would have left with Baby. She hardly knows him. Couple meetings in the diner, share a few songs, do laundry, have a dinner and she's ready to run away with him and potentially be an accomplice? Didn't seem believable.Solid 7. I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind watching it again to pick up on some of the things I missed, but I just wished they cut about 10 minutes near the end and that Debora choosing to run off with Baby was a bit more believable.",Baby Driver

Maybe With a beard he'll look different.2nd: min44. when doc didn't keep his word and threatened baby into another job, Baby could've countered Him by saying i'm your lucky charm card you will never do such thing to me. or something like that. I would've liked it at least.3rd: near the ending. he got deaf by getting shot closer to his ears.4th: the ending.
he surrendered and got 5 years in jail. The movie could've ended in him just running away from the law (like fast & Furous endings) with his girlfriend and the bag of money. living in a foreign country.",Baby Driver
300,mungflesh,Reasonably Neat Neat Neat,7,4 January 2018,"Baby Driver is a fun film with nothing too offensive, or unfortunately thrilling, to make any real waves. It has a few too many clichés in it to be taken seriously but they don't detract hugely from the viewing experience.Jamie Foxx is about the best thing, acting and character-wise but that's not saying a whole lot. However, nothing in the cast is so appauling that it spoils the film. Kevin Spacey's character comes close though, as the somewhat nerdy looking but oh so terribly tough gangster that seems to come for free with most movies of this kind nowadays.It's a good fun popcorn movie without being just a load of typical studio CGI garbage but don't expect a serious thriller. Think Pulp Fiction without the wit or originality.My review might sound a bit scathing but I did find it to be a good watch, if at times I had to grit my teeth silently.",Baby Driver
301,Harhaluulo54,"Edgar Wright manages to make another memorable work, but still far from impressive",5,12 September 2017,"Shaun of the Dead was something new, especially back then in 2004. Hot Fuzz made him see like a one movie miracle. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World showed that he does after all have a vision. The World's End was his clearest peak being the 5th best movie from 2013 (out of the 113 which I personally saw). And now for the first time he became the center of massive hype with Baby Driver. The movie rides a bit with character awe and badassery, something close to GAR even. It's been referred as simply ""cool/cool movie"", but that is true only for the first half. After that we have romance as the main genre and the movie starts to suffer from massive quality drop. The movie seems to be quite lost at this point, making it seem like there was never a purpose for making this. Wasted potential is a good word to use here. The level of unoriginal and cliché reaches its utter max. This is something one would not expect knowing how Wright has been fairly original with his other works regardless of how well the originality paid out. The characters turn out to be pretty much a mess. One of the strongest seems to have moral reasons, one simply goes evil because someone has to, another one simply goes fully out of character, main character and the love-dovey romance are protected by heavy plot armor because this needs to be a happy movie with a happy conclusion for some reason.I will recommend this movie for its entertainment value, but if you have an eye for quality, except average and your expectations will be met.",Baby Driver

However, in a underworld where doesn't belong, Baby tries to escape this life, especially as he meets waitress Deborah (Lilly James) Director: Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim) conjured this idea of a structure combination of music and action 2 decades ago with focus on the right soundtrack to match the driving action. He most certainly has demonstrated this in his quirky action-packed thriller.Delivering a new twist of action, correlated to the fantastic choices of music, Baby Driver becomes its own film setting the quirky, fun atmosphere through the immense soundtrack. Each song telling their own story and expressing the emotion and tone of each scene, but most importantly putting us in the driver seat of Baby, and the life he leads. With one most exhilarating opening credits scene.Driven with action packed sequences Baby Driver is full of fun and thrills, including the most impressive driving scene witness in a film for a long time. Well constructed sequences wonderfully put together consisting sensational shot tracking shots, and a non-stop thrill ride event occurring in the third act.What also Baby Driver is made of is, its foundation of classic drivers movies, including, Walter Hill's The Driver, Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive, and aspects of Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde, but very much standing on its own legs, as Empire Magazine called it ""One of the most utterly original films in years."" Although I don't completely agree with the majority of that statement, but Wrights creative use of the soundtrack spark the unique magic that sparks Baby Driver.Although I can most certainly appreciate Wright's work, I undoubtedly do scratch my head as I necessarily don't quite understand what exactly about the film that earned it massive critical and public applause on this level. I perfectly enjoy it but seem to be missing this wow factor that has caught many others viewers.One of the stand out features of the film is the great ensemble performances, such as Elgort's closed off Baby a perfectly executed character. Opposite Spacey's Doc who chews up scenes with his Underwood like authoritative speeches and heist plans, then Lilly James' sweet waitress Deborah, although with little background acts the perfect love interest for Baby. The stand out for me was Jamie Fox's Bats, intense when he needs to be and a scene stealing rough mouth.Baby Driver is a wonderful mixture of action and music and car chases unique to the action genre. Although arguable I didn't quite meet the reaction that most others have reached, this is most certainly a film to enjoy, if you appreciate Wright's other works, enjoy a fun thrill ride adventure, or love jamming to your tunes while cruising in your vehicle. 8.2/10",Baby Driver
304,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Very enjoyable,9,13 September 2020,"'Baby Driver' took a simple premise and executed it wonderfully. The movie possessed an exhilarating atmosphere with electric visuals, kinetic action scenes and refreshing characters, creating an extremely entertaining film. The cinematography was second to none, utilising Edgar Wright's classic fast paced editing and thunderous action shots, retaining a lively energy throughout. The screenplay was sharp and searing, adding the perfect balance of humour and drama. I loved all of the different characters involved, as the movie placed significance on each character and helped set up their different traits and personalities, creating an eccentric and unconventional group of criminals. The performances were good, especially from our lead Ansel Elgort, and co partner Jamie Foxx. 'Baby's' character was a breath of fresh air, due to his distinctive and rare personality. The film places great significance on his personal struggles with morality, his traumatic past, and how he has no place in the criminal world that he has come to know. He also has recognisable traits, including his love of classic music and lack of vocal communication, making him memorable as well as likeable. Usually in action movies, the male lead is boring and has no personality, so Ansel's character was really refreshing to see. I liked the films
emphasis on Baby's relationships, mainly his love interest 'Deborah' and his grandpa Joe, and how his reckless lifestyle affects each relationship, for better or for worse. Lastly, I loved the little plot twist at the end, as unexpectedly the true villain emerges, and we watch an incredibly exhilarating and suspenseful turn of events. 'Baby Driver' stands out as an action movie, as we watch a soft, kindhearted young man living in the villainous world of crime, and see him try to deal with his constant inner conflict, whilst trying to save the people he loves. Highly recommend!",Baby Driver

307,Brevin_Campbell,The funnest getaway movie ever,8,3 July 2017,"Baby Driver was one of the most joyful experiences I have had at a movie theater for quite some time. The main lead in Ansel Elgort brings a lot of energy to the role making him really fun and entertaining. The character is also just very well written. He is a very good and kind hearted person in the movie, but he is not so good that he lacks no edge. I mean the kid is in the getaway driver business so he has seen a lot of bad stuff happen. Lily James plays a amazing role as the love interested for Ansel . I will say that her character through could have been given a little bit more to do than what she got, but I did believe that her performance told a lot about why she was willing to do some of the things she did and why she never ran way. But the star of this film isn't Baby rather it is the music and Edgar Wright's amazing direction as the film's use of music adds a lot to the enjoyment of each scene along with the erratic action scenes that can go from calm and innocent to intense and scary. A very good balance that is pulled off by Edgar. And it only bolstered by how much you care about the characters in the film too. Your with them and want to succeed with them till the very end. Overall Baby Driver is a fun and fast paced film that will have you on the edge of your seats till its over.",Baby Driver
308,writenamehere,"Much better than it seems, and it sure looks pretty bad.",7,6 April 2021,"On the surface Baby Driver looks a live action film of GTAV, with all the impossible car tricks and barely articulate npcs anyone should need. Every girl's a stunner, every guy a tough guy, and the soundtrack never stops. Pretty yawnsom. Then they add in some politically correct moralising, and finally a bit of bad guy redemption, and by 7/8 done you begin to wonder if you weren't better off picking your nose for an hour and a half. But if, after the bridge scene where he throws the keys of the bridge, you listen really closely, look really really closely, think about what motivated all the events previous and put it all together, then there it is. Not that I want to suggest that people have trouble seeing what's in front of them, but it sure is well concealed behind all the flashy stuff.",Baby Driver
309,pinokiyo,A movie for Teenagers. Fast and the Furious dumb entertainment,5,10 November 2017,"Most of us enjoy the Fast and the Furious series knowing how stupid it is going to be; when you watch this expecting it to be on the same level, then it can be a dumb, fun movie rental to enjoy. From start to finish, it's a movie where you completely turn off your brain. However, when people start praising it to be anything more than that, you will be disappointed. It's super cliché with many stereotypical characters.While the plot has absolutely nothing to do with it, this movie reminds me of the 1998 Wes Anderson film ""Rushmore"" (EXTREMELY horrible movie that's overpraised) for its own pretentiousness ""art"" of itself; the movie is really dumb, but when directors put a collection of good soundtrack, making it more like a music video than a movie, then that gimmick starts to fool some audiences to enjoy the ""movie"" when it's really the music doing most of the work. I mean, how can you go wrong with Barry White... he got that sexy deep voice... I love that song. The movie is definitely geared towards the teenager audience with its A.D.D editing, the most cheesiest dialogues (the relationship between Baby and the waitress, especially the dialogue they have together is extremely cringe vomit-worthy) and super cheesy flashback/backstory of Baby with his mother. Everything is in-your-face, so even the most dumbest low-attention span viewer can understand, (they show all these cassette tapes and there's one labeled ""Mom"" clearly right in your face too; even the laundromat, they put matching colorful clothing spinning in the machines just because it looks cool, really throwing out any real sense of realism) The movie is extremely silly, not to mention so many outrageous moments (Don't even get me started on the double red cars with sunroof and super random cowboy 'agent' dude in a truck), where people conveniently appear and end up at the same time/place just for the sake of the movie, it seemed more like a major comedy. The movie is super straight forward that there really is no depth to the characters. Everything and everyone is just so plastic Hollywood production, like something you see out of a Michael Bay Transformers film. Without Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx, the movie would have been a lot worse. What's actually really funny or creepy or awkward, is after all the Kevin Spacey scandal, it just makes watching him talking to Baby, his lines in the movie, really ironic. For me, a more interesting, deep, intense robbery movie is something like ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (2012). Baby Driver is like a teenager wrote the script for the teenage audience with teenager editing.",Baby Driver

Actors: 6/10
Plot/script: 5/10
Photography/visual style: 8/10
Music/score: 8/10
Overall: 7/10Baby Driver is essentially a gimmick: heart-thumping action scenes set to music, and literally choreographed to fit the rhythm and tune of the music. Every other aspect of the film is either arrayed to support this, or deprioritized. The plot and characters are a jigsaw of cliches, even given tropey names like 'Baby' (Ansel Elgort), 'Buddy' (John Hamm) and 'Doc' (Kevin Spacey). It's a cookie-cutter heist-gone-wrong story that you have seen many times over.
That is all that's required though, because the chases and fights are fantastic. The energy, already high due to writer/director Edgar Wright's expert hand, is enhanced by the music, making it more immersive, and definitely more exciting.
I emerged from the cinema practically dancing to the sounds coming out of my MP3 player, just like Baby. I have no problem forgiving the film for what it (to be honest) wasn't even trying to do well, because what it was trying to do well it achieved magnificently!For my full review, see my independent film review weblog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno.",Baby Driver
313,ronfernandezsf,confused,3,20 November 2017,"OK movie, but a bit over the top. Seems impossible the 'bad guys' can get away so easily despite having dozens of cop cars after them. Not logical..Also confused about the time period. There are LP records and tapes but no DD's. Also no cell phones? There is a scene in a phone booth!! Where does one see phone booths anymore? The scenes with Jon Hamm in his car where is face is all red from what reflection? Seems very symbolic than real. And how in the hell did he possibly get out of the car that crashed over the railing and went down several floors. Just a few illogical matters. Am a little tired of all the car chases in movies of the last 20 or so years. A few exciting ones in this one, but still enough is enough.

314,M_Exchange,Really?,5,27 June 2017,"Yes, it starts strong and manages to carry a lot of that momentum forward even somewhat beyond the midway point. But the small flaws that I was willing to overlook up to that point become huge issues as its believability is getting stretched to the breaking point.I was raised for the first thirteen years of my life in the South, so the Southern accents were a major problem for me. Ansel Elgort seems to drop it whenever it's convenient for him. In a few scenes in which he converses with Lily James in a diner they are both using the accent surprisingly well, then it's just dropped out almost completely beyond that point. Throughout the movie it ranges from very deep to nonexistent. Annoying.Also, Jon Hamm's performance was usually quite painful. He could not portray a tough guy to save his life. I felt like he was in an SNL sketch and was going to burst into laughter at his own incompetence at trying to play a thug at any moment. I enjoyed seeing him only when he and his lady friend (Eiza González) were shooting up their rivals. In fact, I wish that González had far more screen time in this movie because she played her role in such a sexy-yet-convincing manner.There was a PAINFUL twist in which Kevin Spacey's ""Doc"" character does a complete 180 in his personality, which wasn't warranted by anything. And he does it with one of the most clichéd lines in cinematic history-- ""I was in love once."" It's like Edgar Wright just decided near the end that he didn't like his character anymore and wanted to flip his ways completely without any real justification. It took me out of it completely.Also, Lily James's Debora character seems as if she is willing to follow the ""Baby"" character through the depths of hell, which would be difficult to believe even if they had known each other for a few years. She knew him for *a few days.* Wholly unrealistic. Wholly unbelievable.Jamie Foxx was great. He does a great job of portraying an impossibly annoying, malicious jerk. He reminds me of so many Lyft passengers who I've picked up this year.It's mildly entertaining. It's mildly enjoyable.

316,fdbjr,Guns and Cars,5,23 October 2017,"'Baby Driver' is a terrific looking, terrific sounding movie. It's full of guns and cars, some really well done action scenes. (A small problem I have with all these movies is where the hero learned to drive like that. He's very young, there are no schools .. . . you get the idea).The one small problem with the movie is that there is not one, single recognizable human being in it. None of these characters, none of whom is given a back story, has any recognizable human reality. It is difficult to imagine any of them existing in real life. Their sole raison d'etre seems to be to provide plot points and challenges for the lead character.And this is the fatal law. Movies are supposed to be about actual people. Even far-out science fiction only works if it provides commentary on real issues. This movie doesn't have any people in it. It's more video game than drama.

I don't need to put any spoilers on this review, but I just think this is perfection in the world of entertainment. There is just so many surprises and things that caught me off guard. The acting was fantastic from everyone. Sure there's been thousands of heist movies before and this is certainly in the same genre as Oceans11 and movies like that but it just really seems different and original in a time where it feels like every movie being made is a remake. I could bring up certain plot points, but I think I'd be doing this movie a disservice. This writer and director deserves all the credit for taking us on the emotional rollercoaster!",Baby Driver

Ansel Elgort (weird last name, can't get over it) plays a younger getaway driver with a tragic past. Kevin Spacey plays the boss, Jon Hamm and the hot Eiza Gonzalez are a Bonnie and Clyde-type couple, Jamie Foxx a trigger-happy lowlife criminal with Jon Bernthal rounding up the bunch of criminals. Lily James is the main characters' love interest. Altogether, a very good cast.Adding Mr. Wright's directing skills and a great soundtrack and you got yourself a very entertaining heist movie. There are hardly any boring moments, which is very essential and the scenes involving cars and driving (a very big part of the movie) are terrific.

👨‍⚖️ Review :Baby Driver is a musical , action thriller which seems to hit right notes for its genre. The gradually increasing and well shot action scenes are a treat to watch. The Actors are brilliant be it Kevin Spacy's dialogue delivery or Jamie Foxx's homicidal image along with his accent the movie has all elements of an entertainer. The Unpredictable Music is the highlight of the movie which sets the tone of it.Ansel as Baby is the heart of the movie who is a victim of an accident during his childhood because of which he has developed acute tinnitus, which leaves a constant humming sound in his ears. He drowns out the noise with music, stored in a collection of vintage iPods, one for every mood. He is brilliant as a fearless driver , a romantic lover and a responsible son .All in all Baby Driver may seem like a old school action musical. Oh Wait for the final hour - a high-octane, tightly choreographed violence, action, drama and, yes, love. A heady, intoxicating combination that Wright, the Director manages to get just right.

👍Goods : Brilliant Action Set Pieces, Chemistry between Baby and Bats (Jamie Foxx), Thrilling Climax

But that's not what makes this film great. The music does that. Nearl everything that happens in this movie (from bullets, to raindrops to whatever you can think of) is edited to be perfectly in sinc with music and the soundtrack to this film is second to none. Sure the characters are compelling and the story is good, but you'll stay for the tunes",Baby Driver
324,ElliesWonder,Amazing long take in opening,7,27 September 2017,"The opening scene is very attracted with intense robbery and escaped racing. Very impressed with Baby's musical coffee purchase long take. Music is everywhere in this movie, although as a non-native English speaker, I don't understand many the meaning and the history behind those songs, yet the music rhyme was right there with me. The movie rhythm sensation is awesome, the director really mixing the music and the racing very well, unlike the Fabulous XX totally bummed me out.Illogical movie parts: 1)Baby almost wearing the same suit all over the time, and police have his photo capture, and no one ever tried to report him. 2)The inconsistency from the character, the bad big boss died by suddenly changed mind and tried to cover for Baby.Anyway, I like the movie because the ending is not drama at all, very glad to see a movie that criminal leading character ends under justice judge, a good logical end.A criminal is criminal, even he is innocent. Besides, Baby stole cars in young age already. This end is in line with my logic, unlike some Hollywood Criminals Happy Escape movie.",Baby Driver

328,hamidullahgenc,"Baby's sickness is love. Ehm, I meant law.",8,5 July 2017,"I was at the cinema the other day. I would enjoy a film not just based on reviews but also what I could catch that represent life truthfully as well as successfully in one way or the other. What I watched in the first hour was priceless. Because it showed cinematic executions with some solid and continuing beats of fine music without blurring the corpus with the unnecessary dialogue. The performance of Mr. Kevin Spacey, Mr. Jon Hamm, Mr. Jamie Foxx, Mr. Jon Bernthal was exceptional (even though I would not deem the character of Mr. Jon Bernthal so original nor necessary for the story), while those of Mr. Ansel Elgort, Ms. Eiza González and Ms. Lily James seemed really well. In the second hour of the movie, however, things turned to be pretty mediocre. Not only could we not see the character played by Mr. Ansel Elgort breaking his shell and the real effect of the illness that reveals itself when there is no music to listen to; the beats ultimately dropped off the dance with the scenes, too. At the end, even the villain played by Mr. Kevin Spacey called Doc would first endanger his business along with his reputation upon the stupid moves of the psychotic character played by Mr. Jamie Foxx called Bats (even though Doc stated previously that he would not work with the same crew) and even sacrifice his life when Baby shows his randomly-found-and-original-""love"" played by Ms. Lily James called Debora to him. So he drops everything like he is a sweet imam / pastor in a mosque / church. Well, I was not convinced of this. Eventually, Mr. Edgar Wright blew the opportunity to leave an artistic breeze over the world that would not cease in the middle of a hot summer.Okay, don't go away. I still liked it a lot.P.S.: Even if it carried its top quality to the end, I would still have problems with its praise of living in criminal styles. (Remember, Baby commits crimes involving blood and sweat of innocents; but he is ever happy at the end, in the arms of a beautiful, loyal and genic / future wife. No contemplation ever needed after all... And this is what we leave to our children.Here is a Verse of my culture:""Lo!

Baby driver is not just a film, it can easily be one of the best musical we have seen so far this year. Every scene, every action has a rhythm to it. Every dialogue, every expression attached to a musical note. This movie is a good example of how greatness can be achieved by efficiently scoring the movie.Baby driver is about a getaway driver who got mixed with the wrong crowd when he was young and is now forced to pull heiss with them. Everything goes 'Bananas' when he falls in love and starts finding a way out.I've always been a big fan of Edgar Wright. But I always thought it is because Simon Pegg is his lucky charm. I know 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' was good but it was nothing compared to 'Shaun of the Dead' or 'Hot Fuzz'. I even like 'At World's End' more. But at last, he has proved me wrong. Before going to watch Baby Driver, I also thought it could be that the movie may depend too much on the performances by the big names like Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx, but that was not the case. It was the amazing music and insane action sequences which are the actual star of the film.Some of the amazing scores of the movie are, 'Hocus Pocus' by Focus, 'Tequila' by The Champs and 'Brighton Rock' by Queen. Other worthwhile mentions are Egyptian Reggae, Bellbottoms, Smokey Joe's La La and B-A-B- Y Baby. I remember I was shaking my head in the theater on every one of these songs. It felt like every song just fits with the frame perfectly.There was this one scene which reminded me of another one from Shaun of the Dead, where Simon Pegg wakes up and goes to a shop to buy something. There is a similar one-shot scene here as well which resembles. I found out that such long one shots can be seen in other Edgar Wright movies as well.Ansel Elgort has done amazing in a movie which could be his big break into critically acclaimed mainstream cinema. Although he shared the screen with Kevin Spacey and others, he made sure that audience will remember who the movie is really about. His character is cool, stylish, mysterious but funny at the same time. Spacey and Hamm both looked badass. But Jamie Foxx was the one who I liked the most, after Elgort off course. His character was the usual type of villain you love to hate and Foxx played it exactly like that. Also, Eiza Gonzalez played this hot love interest of Jon Hamm's character. Lily James looked cute.So, in the end, I would like to say that Baby Driver is an awesome start for this season. After this, we have Spiderman – Homecoming, War of the Planet of the Apes (I am really excited about this one) and Dunkirk coming right after on another. So go watch it instead of going for Transformers and The Mummy.",Baby Driver
330,sujanfaster,Groovy Babyy,9,16 July 2017,"Director Edgar Wright is in a league of his own. I have always been a fan of his movies, especially the three flavors cornetto trilogy. With Baby Driver, Wright adds one more feather to his cap by directing this heist action comedy. Oh wait, it can also be categorized musical. Baby Driver is about a young driver named Baby who works for a criminal boss to help him and his team finish a job. Things take a sharp turn, when Baby finds the love of his life and decides to quit what he is doing. Things are not as easy as they seem, as he has to go against his evil boss, weird heist crew and the law. Of course, Baby Driver has car chase sequences and are superbly shot. But what makes the action better is the music paired along with that. Music Director Steven Price has put out some classics which play mainly as a part of Baby's iPod playlist. The gunfights and combat sequences are quite similar to the ones from previous Edgar Wright movies and it is total fun. This film is completely character driven. Each character is unique in its own way just like their names. Ansel Elgort as Baby has delivered his best without even having to say many dialogues. The current young generation can relate to his character so much as someone who just want to plug earphones and forget the rest of the world. Jon Hamm as buddy looks very stylish. Kevin Spacey as doc cakewalks through his cool antagonist role. Jamie Foxx is definitely a standout with his impromptu and crazy character called Bats.Baby driver is a clear example of how one can make a good movie with just well written characters and wicked film making. This will definitely go down as a classic in years to come.",Baby Driver
331,Chrimle,Creative sprinkles on a decent movie,7,12 August 2020,"Good and coherent story, but one that lacks depth. Pretty good acting though.While the concept of everything being perfectly timed with the music was unique and made generic shootouts a bit more bearable, the music took too much attention in the movie and the characters suffered, as none of them were really likeable.The cinematography was beautiful!",Baby Driver
332,jay-techie2007,"Good Story, Pretty Much Spot On Execution, Great Action, Almost Zero Melodrama",8,9 July 2017,"After reading great reviews of the movie, we thought to give it a shot and it was totally worth it. While the story is good, the execution by the director has been pretty much spot on. Great action, almost zero melodrama, and great music elevate the movie. Story (9/10): Baby (yes, it's a name) has a gift, a passion, and a dream. However, all the three are different which becomes the root cause of all the mess. He has a gift of amazing driving skills, a passion for music and a dream with his girlfriend. However, his gift makes him very much wanted by a crime lord, Doc, in the city, his passion lands him into trouble with the group but his dream is what drives him to constantly seek to leave the world of crime in spite of all the efforts of Doc to pull him back. However, it's not so easy as he gets into a mission with the criminals that is pretty much set for failure from the word go. Among all this, a couple of pages from his past unfolds as he opens up to his love interest. The story is good and the screenplay even better. Acting (7/10): Ansel Elgort is reasonably good and got the advantage of being a central character in presence of big guns like Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. He had his off times during the movie, especially in the intense scenes. His chemistry with Lily James was very good. Kevin Spacey had a rather very comforting role - something he has done multiple times in the past and executed it perfectly. Jamie Foxx with a persona that makes him very much noticeable in any kind of movie and any kind of role, was great in this one again. Jon Hamm is good with Eiza Gonzalez. Overall, the movie had some very good performances from the lead characters. Direction (8/10): A lot was riding on the direction and Edgar Wright did a good job there. There is hardly ever a boring patch in the movie. The low melodrama, high action, and quick sequences are well shot. The time spent on explaining Baby's music love and the history behind it was just right. His driving skills though weren't as amazingly projected as the created perception. The climax was a little bit of drag but otherwise, the movie has been very well directed. Overall (8/10): Overall, it's a good movie to give a shot.",Baby Driver
333,tyson-hunsaker,"An action packed, spunky, thrill ride for everyone!",8,27 June 2017,"Baby Driver is the latest action/crime flick from Edgar Wright starring a hefty and talented cast that boasts a huge breath of refreshing air in a summer filled with mostly underwhelming blockbusters. This is definitely a fun film anyone of any demographic can have a good time with seeing as how to juggles all these different genres in a balanced way. Where the film succeeds the most is style and tone. The ""feel"" of this movie is consistent throughout its runtime and never tries to be anything than it's not. Musical elements are utilized to its fullest capacity by creating an almost music video vibe that strangely never becomes annoying but rather helps tell the story and engage the audience. Every scene with every piece of music feels completely intentional and never feels misplaced which gives the script and the talented cast room to shine their brightest. Fans of well developed characters and solid plot writing will find little to complain about this as well. Despite this being a straightforward crime/action flick, characters are well flushed out and the story itself is gripping to the point where you can't take your eyes off the screen. With the exception of one character decision that didn't get enough set up or pay off, every character is believable and portrayed wonderfully. The only restraints one might have with this movie is its unoriginality in its main character arc. If the viewer has seen enough crime films they'll know (or at least can predict) how it'll go and turn out for our hero. It also lacked some character pay off as mentioned before which can take a few people out of the movie. That being said, its execution feels so fresh that it's easy to forget you're watching a film you've seen before. Even after viewing, it still feels fresh and deserving of another viewing because of how much fun and care went into making this picture.",Baby Driver
334,trevor-82944,Our Insanity Just Cranked Up to Eleven!,5,10 November 2017,"Texas, Las Vegas, Brussels, Sandy Hook, over 142 gun violence victims had no reason to go so soon, but it happened. With so many celebrations of violence killing it at the box office, why do we still wonder how these tragedies continue? Even for myself, the news coverage on a new shooting has become white noise to me, it no longer disturbs me in the appropriate manner. Many other young men love watching stylish massacres, yet supposedly join the public worry about gun violence. From my experience, you can learn a lot about someone based on their taste in movies, so Baby Driver's wide popularity says a lot about the level of care most young men have about gun violence.Sure enough, director and writer Edgar Wright (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Shaun of the Dead) attacks the law in his own fueled world void of any justifiable punishment.First, I want to cover the lack of setting: instead of letting relevant social problems indicate that it takes place in Atlanta Georgia, the stickers on the cop cars alone indicate that. Honestly, if the location was changed to anywhere else in the world, the story remains the same. Rather than a believable city with different people to learn more about, a role-playing clean slate lets you easily imagine yourself in Baby's position for the town you live in.Although Edgar Wright, as he's most famous for, still pulls it off with a modernized narrative style, this time popping in a fluent radio language. In the first scene, the main protagonist, known as Baby, rocks out to his music in a vibrant red car, his lips in sync to the lyrics, ready to drive some bank robbers away from their heist. The absence of real dialogue in the first two scenes puts you into Baby's 24/7 mentality—he never takes off his earbuds, as he uses the beats of his tunes to fill in the beats of his new criminal lifestyle. So sure enough, the audio style cuts past Baby's shades to meet him at eye level: the gun fires and windshield wipers match the music beats perfectly. To take you further into Baby's mental state, you watch him mix his own tunes together while ignoring sudden flashbacks about his rough childhood. He barely even speaks to anybody, as his roommate speaks only in American Sign Language. It keeps you wondering: What goes on between his ears? Here's where Debora comes in, the cute waitress he at last opens himself up to in many sweet, informative conversations about music.Film editors Jonathan Amos and Paul Machliss (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) use appropriate jump cuts alongside the exploitation of circle shapes packed with attitude to transition between scenes. Cinematographer Bill Pope (Clueless, The Matrix) keeps up the excitement with a single uninterrupted shot to show Baby's strut down the street, which later turns into spinning the camera around the actors throughout their heated conversations. Once the camera acrobatics take a breather for some spicy dialogue, Wright keeps his visual metaphors in mind, like Baby looking at his reflection in self- doubt.Then once the engine starts up again, each piece of stunt choreography hits you hard with its seamless special effects, turning into a wild third act revved high on octane. Edgar Wright really deserves better directing gigs under a greater studio, he's sure got the talent!However, the fantastic technical achievement pale in impact compared to its dreadful lack of redemption toward humanity. If you land outside the male millennial core audience, you may notice the negative stereotypes painted on every roadblock to Baby's freedom. Alongside the White male supremacy, any named Blacks are either a terrorist or a cripple, nothing positive; in the same way, Asians and Mexicans are seen solely as terrorists. To make it more typical, this screenplay fails the Bechdel Test, giving the sole two significant female roles to gorgeous women who never even make eye contact.Honestly, if you took away the stylish soundtrack and spicy editing, you got another hollow fantasy populated by shallow archetypes. Baby comes off here as a passive protagonist who expresses no personal fears about the gang members. The same goes to Debora, a submissive device thrown in to be a ""get the girl"" motivator, and the crime boss, an average pokerfaced motivator for the hero to improve. All else in Baby Driver matches the same sensical nature of Fast & Furious; just the villains run out of bullets when the plot demands it.I'm sorry if this offends you, but Edgar Wright's artistic strides in musical masturbation could benefit greater once he learns about the consequences of his work to live on in history, otherwise, his fans probably won't live long enough for it to happen.",Baby Driver
335,umimelectric,Tries Hard To Be Stylish With Its Unorganic Indulgence.,5,18 October 2017,"I hate to be the guy who gives 5/10 stars to everything that looks nice but lacks in substance, but it would be tough to rate it any better or any worse, so I'm truly stuck in the middle.I can certainly see why this movie has received praise from the audience it's meant for, but as some other reviews here have remarked, it's kind of a boring affair overall.I can't deny the soundtrack, though, which is more enjoyable to me than the way Guardians of the Galaxy pt 2 seems to force its soundtrack in our faces. The way the music is used is impressive and fits naturally with events on screen, regardless of many of those events not being engaging enough to keep me from daydreaming about my personal life while the film plays on before me. The music hitting at the right time was really the only thing ripping me out of my own thoughts and back into the narrative.Those who are excited by car chases, sunglasses, trendy styles & simple dialogue need apply. If you aren't into that stuff, then maybe the music will save you too.5/10; will expect multiple sequels.",Baby Driver
336,theenigma129,Eiza Gonzalez was the greatest!!!,4,9 October 2019,"Truthfully, honestly. I do not like the movie at all. I was expecting more from it. Instead, its the same predictable, cliched, typical, stereotypical stuff Hollywood makes every single day. EXCEPT: eiza Gonzalez, her character ""darling"" & some of the car stunts. Theyre are the only memorable, original and unpredictable ones in the whole thing. Though she's in it for 3-4 mins & had less screentime then anyone else (I don't like that, doesn't seem right or fair to me), still one of eiza's best performances & enjoyed she got to do some driving at the start. When darling got killed, I was beyond upset, mad and bored throughout the rest. Its not what I wanted to see, darling deserves better then that And it made my anxiety worse (ill explain that later). Oh please, please, please don't get me wrong. I love eiza with all my heart & soul she's my most favorite girl in the whole universe and my most favorite singer/actress ever. I support eiza no matter what. I still love darling very much as well. I'm so so happy that eiza had a fun time doing the movie, enjoyed playing as darling, got along with & learned from almost everybody on/off set. & got the oppurtunity to work with some of her favorite people. But I'm just sick and tired of seeing the same story and plotline being used over and over in different versions. And extremely fed up when special characters that stand out, add/bring more to a movie & have a more interesting background/story then anyone else (such as darling) barely have enough screen time or get killed off!. When both happened to darling, THATS where i finally DRAWED THE LINE!!! Hope eiza can forgive me, I can never able to watch darling's death scene and never watch baby driver at all ever again. Call me harsh, biased, simp, psycho,. Whatever. Not sorry for what I've said. just brutally honest of how I feel about eiza and the movie... And I love eiza so, so much. I love you eiza Gonzalez!!!Yours truly,

His weakest film.",7,4 July 2017,"I have enjoyed all of Edgar Wright's movies since Shaun of the Dead, and he has made one of my all time favourites (Scott Pilgrim), so I was pretty excited about this one. I went into it clean, without seeing any trailers, and was convinced purely by word of mouth and the director's track record. All I knew is that it as about some kind of heist and a great driver. I bought into the hype and was looking for another winner from Wright.It started off great, with engaging action and an intriguing story. It had some good potential, but it fell apart for me in the third act. The characters did things you wouldn't expect them to, and I was left wondering ""what was the point of all this?"". It had some of the feeling of Pulp Fiction to me (great visuals and style, and you're rooting for a guy trying to get out of a bad situation he's found himself in with criminals), but it fizzled out in the end.It wasn't a bad movie per se, but I expected more from Wright. In the end it was his weakest film to me, and I don't think it's one I'd recommend.",Baby Driver

341,dissident320,Borrows from other movies while still doing its own thing,8,5 July 2017,"I'm a pretty big Edgar Wright movie fan but didn't like The World's End that much. So I went into this movie hoping it would at least be better despite the mediocre trailers. I think it delivers a fantastic action movie.I had not seen Ansel Elgort in anything before but he was excellent as the quiet driver, Baby. Everyone else is pretty good and Kevin Spacey seems almost quaint in this role after seeing him chew so much scenery in House of Cards. Jon Hamm plays someone a little sleazier than usual and Jamie Foxx seems to want to be the villain from start. The weakest performance for me was Lily James, who I have also never seen before. She seemed to be playing up this innocent small town girl persona but it didn't really work for me.Whenever there's action in this movie though, it springs to life. Every car chase, shootout, footrace pulls you right into movie. One of the more inventive car chases I've seen in a movie as well.The music is what really drives this movie though. No song is accidental, it all wonderfully syncs up with what's happening. It really gives the film a wonderful flavour and makes it so unique.My only criticism is that when the movie slows down and has dialogue scenes they feel really dull the way the shots are composed. Perhaps this was deliberate to contrast with the action but they felt a bit mediocre in comparison. But still well worth seeing and I will definitely be re-watching it at some point.",Baby Driver
342,adeckofcards,More than style,8,20 August 2020,"If we pay attention to the most recognized contemporary directors and we look for one that has a considerably different style, original and marked, we should refer (among others) to Edgar Wright. In his most recent play, the director tells a story of robberies and chases in a way that only he could.
The plot centers on Baby, a young man who is trapped in the criminal world driving a vehicle and working for a mob boss. In this way, and after several jobs, the crime apprentice would win his freedom.
Edgar Wright takes ten minutes to introduce the viewer to his work. The first minutes of the film, which are the best from my point of view, manage to perfectly define the essence of the film. With an extremely accelerated montage for the chase and then with a masterful sequence shot to the beat of the music, Wright spreads tons of style, so much style, so perfect and well managed that it becomes rage.
Without a doubt 'Baby Driver', although it is not at all a perfect film and fails in more than one aspect, it comes to mark the style of its director and provide two hours of intrepid editing, endearing characters, a fluid narration and why not say too? An impeccable soundtrack.",Baby Driver
343,coex23,"far too ""pop"" to stomach",4,10 October 2017,"This is the glossiest, over-produced action film that I've seen in ages. So cringe-worthy are some of the ""music video"" style moments throughout the film, that I often came close to just giving up and turning it off. Once one removes all the catchy ear/eye candy music moments, the action film that's left is really nothing terribly entertaining or original. However, on the bright side of things, Jamie Foxx needs to build a career playing villains! He really stood out among a mostly tepid cast (even Kevin Spacey seemed bored to be involved). Really, save your precious time and go back and re-watch some 70s caper films. You'll be happier in the end.",Baby Driver
344,NDbportmanfan,"A Movie Actually Deserving of the Title ""Perfect Summer Movie""",8,29 June 2017,"I think mostly everyone can find something in this movie that they would enjoy. The chase scenes feel realistic and intense unlike many of the current car focused movies like the Fast and Furious franchise (apparently many of those scenes where shot with a stunt driver and very little CGI if any at all was actually used, which always is nice to see). The music in this movie blends well and never felt out of place. Is it Guardians of the Galaxy level amazing... debatable but Baby Driver will definitely have one of the better soundtracks this year. The comedy throughout was well timed and most of the characters showed off their own sense of humor. There was really no comic relief character although many of the movies funnier scenes would be attributed to Jamie Foxx. The high level of comedy in this movie should be no surprise as director Edgar Wright known for the Cornetto Trilogy always knows how to insert the right joke.All of the characters were great for the screen time they were given. My personal favorite was Buddy. When it comes to playing an intimidating character Hamm can do no wrong. He had the right level of charm with don't mess with me that made Baby feel safe and uneasy at the same time. Speaking of Baby, I wasn't too fond of the character right away. He seemed kind of dorky and trying to be cute with the street walking scene. Eventually though he became a rather interesting character, especially when he meets up with the waitress. You start feeling for him and you want those two to make it. James and Elgort had good chemistry and they will probably stand out as one of the better movie couples in 2017.Everything in this movie was just so well done. The only real hit this movie takes that I can think of after just watching it was that the story kind of dips in the interesting department in the middle. It starts strong and ends with an even bigger bang. I believe the climax and ending are worth the price of the theater ticket alone. This is a can't miss movie. I find myself debating if this is a movie that I have to see in the theaters twice which I rarely even consider. There however is no doubt in my mind that this will be a store purchase as I can see myself watching this movie over and over again.",Baby Driver
345,Lugo1989,Style over substance,5,5 October 2017,"I can't remember the last time I was so excited to see a new film. An entire film synchronised to music, Edgar Wtight behind the camera and all the initial hype showed a real promise. Unfortunately this film does not deliver. It is masterfully made when it comes to the technical aspects, everything else simply does not work.The story is not engaging enough, after about 45 minutes I was still waiting for Baby Driver to kick into higher gear and it did not. The relationships between all the characters do not seem realistic at all. You never really begin to care about them or root for anyone. Also the romance between Baby and Debora is not convincing from the very beginning when they meet in the diner. I also believe that casting Ansel Elgort for the lead role was a bit of a mistake since he does not possess enough charisma to carry an entire film. As far as the supporting cast is concerned, Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey were all great.The soundtrack is really good and the idea to synchronise songs to match what is going on in the scenes per beat is original but it's unfortunately not enough. See it if you like stylish action scenes and good music, if you are looking for anything more, you will not find it in Baby Driver.",Baby Driver

347,stroggos,"Stylish movie, sometimes too loud and fast for my taste",8,19 July 2017,"BABY DRIVER is an action packed tale of a quiet getaway driver for heists planned by Doc, a crime lord played by Kevin Spacey. Baby lives alone with his deaf foster father after his mother died in a car accident, and he falls in love with Debora, a waitress at a local diner. Wanting to stay away from the heists, Baby only finds himself sucked deeper into a crime-filled underworld.The story is filled with themes we know: The beautiful girl as symbol for a normal life outside of crime. The theme of not being able to stay away from crime, and the underworld harming the one's closest to you. And the theme of the fatherly yet dangerous crime boss who took a young boy under his wing. But while we've seen many of these ideas in other movies, BABY DRIVER manages to implement them with grandeur.Sometimes the originality of a movie lies not within its story, but its execution, and it is here where BABY DRIVER excels. The movie does some really new stuff with sound: Baby has tinnitus and always numbs his pain with loud rock music. This serves as the movie's excuse for a manic fusion of music and action. And as we come to expect from an Edgar Wright movie, this audiovisual collage is craftily edited.Despite the impressive style and the great acting (with criminals played by the likes of Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm), I found the movie too loud at times. What jarred my ears was less the music than the car noise and gunshots. Perhaps this was my local cinema amping things up too much... but oh did my ears hurt after some of the action scenes!On top of that... and this is only nagging at the very high level of an otherwise excellent movie, I felt that the pacing was a bit irregular. The movie starts and ends really fast but has a long stretched-out middle part. This is important for character building, but the macro-rhythm of the story arch felt a bit jagged...But again, only small concerns regarding an otherwise impressive piece of film that is definitely one of the must-sees this year!",Baby Driver

357,Abranth-d,A go home and Google soundtrack.,10,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of baby driver. So baby driver is directed by Edgar Wright , the genius behind the Scott pilgrim movie . Imagine the cop chase from grand theft auto with a little bit of drama , that's what this movie is. From start to finish , this movie is a joy ride . The dialogues are well written and there were some pretty solid one liners. Now , the soundtrack in this movie is really good , its one of those movies where you come back home and Google for the song in a particular scene . All characters in this movie were really good , there were no unwanted characters or subplots and it stuck to its story. In the end , baby driver is a unique movie with great action , likeable characters , no cliches and a go home and Google soundtrack.",Baby Driver
358,rachelgallit,A fun foray into a music video,8,7 November 2018,"While the plot of this movie falls apart and wanders quite dangerously in the middle of the film, the characters are compelling and the music sweeps the audience along on the many, many car chases. Young Baby (named thus for the sake of dramatic intrigue) is a car thief and getaway driver prodigy, working for a crime boss. A childhood injury has left him mostly deaf, and his reliance on loud rhythmic music propels his life and his driving in a fantastically devil-may-care fashion. The musical soundtrack of this film features many pop culture songs, as well as several pre-21st-century tunes, and provides a sense of momentum to otherwise stagnating dialogue or over-long chase scenes. Ansel Elgorts well-timed movements, and the rapid cuts and suddenly changing camera angles are well done, if repetitive. Overall, the film feels more like an hour-long music video than a movie with music attached but is nevertheless rather enjoyable.",Baby Driver
359,cyberknight,"Never done before, except too many times...",1,12 September 2017,"I really don't know if this is a spoiler, as the way I get it, everybody is going to watch this film because of this ""device"": action on screen is synchronised with the soundtrack songs... And nobody have done that before... Oh, except they have, they even call it a name: ""musical"" (and not only the ones in which people stop talking to start singing, like ""Singing in The Rain"", but also those in which the music is a fundamental part of the story, like ""Saturday Night Fever""...) And before that, there was something called ""dance"", but that's not the subject here. Of course, some could argue that it's a non-musical film with synchronised action to music... Once again, it's been done before, like the Diva's on-stage performance matching Leeloo's fight in a hotel room in ""The Fifth Element"", or the EVE and WALL-E open-space maneuvers in Pixar's ""WALL-E""...There are no twists (worth it, I mean), there is a granted happy ending (but then again, everybody could tell that from the trailer alone, that's no spoiler, really), and a bad guy (with a stupid name) to whom people should sympathise, except that he's too dumb for that.The car chases are better than those from any of ""The TransFormers"" franchise, but I'm not sure it's a fair comparison (choreographed lame chases versus computer generated physical-laws-ignoring graphics...)I have to say, I was really surprised to see such high rating on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Either they developed a much better voting bot, or people are getting way dumber than the films they are watching...",Baby Driver

The movie is also one of the best choreographed films I've ever seen.Every single move of the characters is combined with music and after a point I understood that without the music,this heist movie wouldn't work.An example of perfect connection of the music with the scenes is when Baddie,Darling and Bats shoot at some people and all this shooting coming form their guns creates..music. Edgar Wright's direction was phenomenal because, in my opinion, he found a perfect balance of style and substance.The car chase scenes,especially the first one,are perfectly directed and show that without a doubt Edgar Wright is one of the best director's working today. All in all,Baby Driver is a fun,cool and ambitious ride with lots of twists and turns and a perfect combination of what we love most: Cars and Music After Baby Driver my mind is only thinking of one thing Just me,music and the road",Baby Driver

362,RLTerry1,Exhilarating! Wildly entertaining!,10,29 June 2017,"Exhilarating! Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is an accelerated non-stop action-thriller that will have you in high-gear the entire drive time. Wildly entertaining! It offers up the best car chases, excellent characters, and displays solid writing in this subgenre of action films. During the golden age of Hollywood cinema, grand getaways, robberies, and car chase movies were a staple. Sony/Tristar, et al, demonstrate that one of the foundational plot types that provided audiences with thrills back then can be effectively resurrected today to embody the engine that drove those motion pictures and install it into a new, sleek body design to mesmerize and impress audiences of today. Certainly, Baby drives to the beat of his own mixtape in this movie, but the film itself goes further and integrates the rhythm of action into the sound design of the motion picture. Not to be left behind on the 80s throwback movies and TV shows bandwagon featuring hipsters and mixtapes, Wright crafts a summer film that rises above the all too cliché CGI robots taking to the sky and pirates swashbuckling across the seas to remind us that little can compare to the squeal of the wheel, love, and the witty turning of phrase. In short, Baby Driver is a self-aware pop-culture film but has the soul of a James Dean motion picture.Meet Baby (Elgort). Yes, that's B-A-B-Y Baby. He's the unparalleled talented getaway driver for Doc's (Spacey) Atlanta crime ring. With earbuds in place, playing classic rock or his own mixtapes, Baby drives, speeds, and maneuvers to the beat of his tunes. No police force is a match for his ability to evade his would-be captors in order to return Doc's henchman (and woman) to the secret lair. As chance would have it, Baby meets Debora (James), the girl of his dreams, at his usual diner. All that stands in his way is one more job for Doc, or so he thinks. With payment in full of his debt to Doc on the horizon, Baby seen this as his opportunity to make a clean break and to ditch his shady lifestyle of crime. But when Doc approaches Baby with yet another job, Baby must decide to whom his allegiances lie and protect those he loves.Any veteran filmmaker will tell you that it's vitally important to hook the audience within the first three to five minutes of a film. Fail to hook producers at the beginning of the screenplay, and it's file-thirteen for those 120 pages. As a director, it's encumbered upon him or her to grab hold of the audience's attention, creating the urge to want more, to know more. The first scene of Baby Driver is an incredible display of excellence in writing, directing, and the technical elements of motion picture creation. The magic of this scene lies in the ability for Wright to wow the audience without leaving anyone ""out there in the dark"" (Sunset Blvd) overly stimulated or left with the feeling of utter exhaustion. The scene is perfectly stimulating. It sets the bar high for the film, and continues to keep it up there for the entire runtime. Just like the pace of Baby's driving, the pacing of the film is exquisitely handled and couldn't be better! The biggest difference between this robbery/getaway film and similar films such as The Fast and the Furious is substance. In addition to the incredible cinematography and sound design paired with out of the world car chases, the film provides heart, soul, and qualitative substance that forms the foundation upon which the more superficial elements are laid.The cast couldn't have been more brilliantly selected. One of the hallmarks of an Edgar Wright film is the charismatic leads that display solid chemistry on screen. Just who are our heroes in this film? You'll just have to watch it and decide for yourself. I love it when films take the more conventional concept of heroes and villains and turns it on its head. For whomever you decide are the heroes, you'll certainly find yourself actively rooting for their survival and rooting for the villains to meet their demise in shockingly creative ways. When Kevin Spacey isn't busy being the President of the United States, or more recently, an ex-President, he is the king pin of an Atlanta- based crime syndicate that stages fantastically wild robberies. And Baby is indebted to him and must reluctantly aid and abet as the best getaway driver ever to hit the screens in recent years-- think a modern-day James Dean. Jaime Foxx plays the veteran head henchman extremely well and adds his own repulsive, yet comedic charm to his role. It would have been far too easy to play off Spacey and Foxx's conventional talents to steel focus away from the central plot, but Wright strikes a perfect balance between his leads and the story. Elgort and Spacey's on-screen chemistry was crafted with strategic precision in order to quickly solidify the frien-emy relationship between the two characters. With Elgot increasing in popularity, Wright could have deflated to playing up the attractive bad boy tropes but instead allows Elgot's Baby to develop organically throughout the film.If you are seeking a summer film that clearly demonstrates a movie in which all the creative elements work seamlessly together in the manner in which they were respectively intended, then don't miss Baby Driver while it's in theatres. The energy you will feel in this film is nearly unparalleled by any in recent times, and that's because both the major and minor components work together like a well-oiled machine. You will be at full throttle as you are instantly transported from your auditorium seat to the passenger seat in Baby's car.",Baby Driver
363,mailes22,Surprisingly good,8,13 July 2017,"We were the oldest people in the audience by far, and didn't have particularly high hopes for what looks like a version of a Fast and Furious movie from the preview. But the cast includes Kevin Spacey and we figured that he doesn't normally sign up for rubbishy films.We ended up thoroughly enjoying Baby Driver. From the opening scene with Baby walking to get coffees, listening to music and with key words from the lyrics 'hidden' in plain sight on signs and graffiti along the way, the design of the movie is just a little bit stylized. The music throughout the movie is thankfully a mix of all sorts of genres, since the soundtrack is an important part of the film. There was something for everyone.The plot starts fairly predictably, but halfway through it takes a sudden dark turn. The second half is really very well done.One word of warning: if you're a guy, get someone else to drive you home afterwards. The impulse to drive like Baby might be too much for you.",Baby Driver
364,scottingram,Baby Driver Film Review,9,2 July 2017,"The new action thriller film Baby Driver starring Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Lily James, Eiza González, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx.In Baby Driver a talented, young getaway driver called Baby (American actor Ansel Elgort - Divergent films, The Fault In Our Stars) relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack from his own iPod to be the best in the game. When he meets the girl of his dreams Debora (English actress Lily James - UK TV Series Downton Abbey, Cinderella 2015), Baby sees a chance to ditch his criminal life and make a clean getaway. But after being coerced into working for a crime boss Doc (American actor Kevin Spacey - The Usual Suspects, Seven), he must face the music when a doomed heist threatens his life, love and freedom.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Baby Driver includes American actor Jon Bernthal (Sicario, The Wolf Of Wall Street) as Griff, American actor Jon Hamm (US TV Series Mad Men, Keeping Up With The Joneses) as Buddy, Mexican actress Eiza González (US TV Series From Dusk Till Dawn) as Darling Buddy's girlfriend, American actor Micah Howard as Barista, CJ Jones as Joseph a deaf man who Baby lives with and looks after, American actress Sky Ferreira (Elvis & Nixon, The Green Inferno) as Baby's Mom, American actor Lance Palmer as Baby's Dad, Hudson Meek (90 Minutes In Heaven) as Young Baby, American actor Hal Whiteside (Misfortune) as Cook, Australian actor and Red Hot Chili Peppers Bassist Flea (Back To The Future films, My Own Private Idaho) as Eddie, Lanny Joon (Black Gold, Black November) as JD, American actor Jamie Foxx (Ray, Django Unchained) as Bats, Brogan Hall (Cold In July) as Samm Doc's little nephew, R.

Overall Baby Driver is a great action thriller film filled with action, shooting, violence, car chases, chases on foot, guns, cool cars, explosions, robberies, criminals, cool catchy music, flashbacks, lots of money, highway roads, some funny moments, tongue and cheek stuff, team work, togetherness, loyalty, betrayal, friendship, family, on the edge of your seat stuff, some close shaves, some near misses, love, fall outs, arguments, sign language, cops, banks, postal offices, swearing and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Baby Driver an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars and Baby Driver is worth seeing if you like action thriller films like the Bad Boys films, Gone In 60 Seconds, Face/Off, Spy, The Fast And The Furious films, The Mechanic films, The Transporter films, Ronin, Drive, Deathproof, Bullitt amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Baby Driver in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Baby Driver

366,CinePendejo,Pure cinema!,9,30 June 2017,"Calling BABY DRIVER a feature length car chase music video seems like it's not doing it justice. Here is a film that painstakingly syncs each scene with each appropriate needledrop song to make it look like the most audacious musical ever, but it offers so much more than that. Offering the same, shameless glee of earnest romance, over-the-top car chases, and effective gun-to-gun thrillers of decades past, BABY DRIVER is simply everything. It's top down genre mix taping, courtesy of an inspired and precise auteur of Edgar Wright who did the same idea with video games back with SCOTT PILGRIM. Taken as a music video compilation though, it's pretty much next level. Each minute action and lip-synching is precisely matched to each 70-80s song that actually complements the circumstances of the plot. It's at times funny, foreshadowing, and at times grim, rewarding a lot of repeated viewings without being obscure.Taken as a homage to old, sleazy action movies, it's as much inspired. Rather than being full-on parody like the Kornetto trilogy, it embraces its genre inconography, reminding us why we like it in the first place. That's why each car chase, running, and gunfight sequence looks almost as great as early Walter Hill flicks or this years JOHN WICK. Heck, there's a shootout warehouses scene that's so awesome it puts the entirety of FREE FIRE to shame!Admits all of that though the movie is never oblivious to any genuine character moments and ace performances. Wright manages to accomplish specific character twists that both retorts their standard traits while also adding depth to them. For example, both John Hamm and Kevin Spacey might just be the breakout performances of this movie based solely on how they subvert our impressions of them. Ansel Egort does wonders in a role that seems too much like a clichéd wonder boy role, but comes aces as his own complex character. Baby's relationship with Debra feels like it's ripped wholesale from a Nick Sparks movie, but the execution feels honest and vacant of any BS contrivances. BABY DRIVER is not only a testament to Edgar Wrights craftsmanship, but also a testament to how any genre film far from Hollywood dreck can still be as successful as this. The action is amazing, the music rocks, the performances are great, the cinematography and editing are pitch-perfect, and it all offers a bravura of thrills without sacrificing a true artists vision. It is pure cinema and one of the best films of the year.",Baby Driver

The film clearly shows the 5 story points(Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, Resolution)real noticeable and provides a track the urges it an extra 1/10.

Hey, didn't Ryan Gosling do that? (spoiler: masks were used, too)And if I'm continuing to be honest, I'm not feeling the geek-love for Edgar Wright. Yeah, ""Shaun of the Dead"" was fun, and ""Hot Fuzz"" had moments, but the rest has been just...meh. I'm glad Peyton Reed directed ""AntMan."" He's a far more interesting and less mannered director.Time to be brutally honest. I'm so un-engaged with how hard Edgar Wright is trying, I'm ready to switch over to the newest ""Transformers."" Sure, Micheal Bay directs like a hyperactive Chautauqua that just snarfed your meth stash, but he knows what he's doing. He's making a flipping ""Transformers Movie."" The man has no delusions he's gifting us with ""Return to the French New Wave, 2017."" Sadly Edgar Wright does seem to in the grip of that particular delusion.",Baby Driver

He did not fill the role well in any sense. The snarky dialogue cam across as forced and awkward, for example.Awful film.

371,javi-y-se-acabo,One of the Best Blockbusters of the Year,10,17 July 2017,"I think this is what the people should think when they talk about a summer blockbuster. An entertaining movie but also a good movie, not just some CGI creatures destroying a random city and nothing more. This movie offers a very good entertainment and a very good story and for me it will probably be one of the best blockbusters of the year, along with Dunkirk and the third planet of the apes movie.It tells us the story of Baby (Ansel Elgort), a boy who suffered an accident when he was young and because of that he is always listening to music that helps him relax and so. He is the driver of Doc (Kevin Spacey) who gets him to drive some bank robberies. Well, maybe it's not very well explained but I'm sure it's worth the watch. The story it's not just car chases and bank robberies. It also has time for developing the human side of the characters, at least of some of them, because the other are merciless and cruel. It reminded me to the movie Drive starring Ryan Gosling in the sense that the main character is a driver who does not speak much and the things he does are trying to do the right thing.The cast was wonderful. Ansel Elgort as the main character, Baby, was perfect. He has this shy even emotionless face in some parts but he also has the human side in his relationship with the old man, Joseph, and with Debora, Lily James. She was also very good in the role as the love interest of Baby. The love story, I thought would be just an excuse to get more people to the cinema but it's very well introduced and developed. They have a great chemistry and at many times you really feel the same they feel. The secondary characters were also great, from Jaime Foxx as Bats, to Kevin Spacey as Doc, they all have little moments to shine, to make you hate them or love them.And now I have to talk about the visuals. This is one of the best things of this movie. How the action sequences were filmed. Edgar Wright was able to give this movie the feeling he wanted. To make you feel tense, in danger, until the very end of the movie. There are many car chases and a chase running by the street and they all are filmed amazingly. And with this you have the soundtrack. Steven Price has a small score but here the important things are the songs. It's not a cheap excuse to introduce the songs. You have Baby's backstory as an explanation and the songs are just like another character in the movie. I have to mention not only Edgar Wright but also the music and film editors who managed to synchronize the music with the action sequences, with the gunshots, with the car chases, and gave a special feeling to the film.I totally recommend you this if you like heist movies, action movies, thriller movies, and even musical movies, because this is some kind of action-thriller musical movie that should be the kind of movies that we should have every summer, not just Transformers or Fast & Furious movies. Just watch it and see it for yourself but I'm sure you will probably enjoy it as well as I did.",Baby Driver

375,littleging12,Shows Fast and Furious how it's done,8,9 July 2017,"Edgar Wright's super stylistic pseudo-musical, Baby Driver, puts the Fast and Furious franchise to shame, proving that action-fueled car chasing movies can still be smart, practical, and ball-tinglingly thrilling. Not to say that the Fast and Furious movies don't have their moments, it's just they deter future filmmakers from creating smartly written, practical action films that don't overlie on CGI and over-the-top shenanigans. Baby Driver isn't without its over-the-top shenanigans but its sharp writing, crisp editing and direction, thrilling car chases, delightful humor, and soundtrack help it rise above its over-the-top moments and disengaging romance. Baby Driver (mostly) hits the mark. The action scenes are directed with so much flair and swift camera movements it's like directors' heaven. Everything in the film is choreographed to the beat of the songs like a carefully rehearsed dance routine. The soundtrack scores and really helps capture the emotion, however, I just wish they could have had one or two songs devoted to classical music (given Kevin Spacey's trailer line ""young Mozart in a go kart""). The cast flourishes and really delivers what they are known for: Kevin Spacey's no-nonsense badassery, Jamie Foxx's bad guy antics, Jon Hamm's suave demeanor (for the first two acts at least), and Ansel Elgort's, well he was quite an unknown heading into this but now has surely made a name for himself. And of course the cast was able to flourish with Edgar Wright's cheeky clever dialogue. With all these qualities it seems as if Baby Driver should be a near masterpiece and one of the better action films in years, yet, somethings took me out of it. For instance, I felt as if the romance happened rather quickly and didn't leave a whole lot of room for any real depth. Debora (Lily James) impulsively jumps into this dangerous relationship with Baby and the whole thing just seemed like an only-in-the-movies romance. Also Jon Hamm might have been playing the Terminator. He survives a gun shot wound to the chest while evading cops TWICE, then he is somehow able to jump out of a falling car before impact, and comes out unscathed from the jump. Don't be going Fast and Furious on us Edgar Wright! Baby Driver has enough pros to overcome a few distracting cons. It's definitely one of the best films of the year so far and adds another benchmark to Edgar Wright's portfolio of quirky entertaining action comedies. 7.5/10",Baby Driver

The car stunts are great but the story is ridiculous and lot's of the events are hard to believe or just stupid. For instance when Baby pushes the car of his opponent into an elevator shaft, the guy miraculously escapes from the car. yeah, right... Or when Baby shoots him from 1 meter distance in the chest he survives and is able to fight etc as if nothing has happened. A good movie as a lot of people state at IMDb? No, absolutely not.

378,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,Edgar Wright at full speed.,8,29 June 2017,"When Edgar Wright left Ant-man, I was really bummed that we would never to get to see his vision of the film. Luckily he makes up for with Baby Driver.Baby Driver's story is a fairly simple and familiar premise. Young getaway driver who works for a mob boss wishes to escape his life of crime and falls in love but is pulled into one last job. The angle that makes this story different from other action films is the tinnitus aspect giving Baby the need to listen to the rhythm of music to stay focused. And from there the film analyzes how music is a reflection on Baby's emotion and past. The tension builds as we get into Baby's head and he is forced to work even closer then usual with the criminal cohorts he is familiar. There he learns just how truly messed up and dangerous they really are. The layers and twist continue build up the depth of the story.This is sharpest I have seen Edgar Wright with his directing, and editing. Scenes that could feel tiring or repetitive in less capable hands are constantly injected with fresh and unique ways to marvel at. They're a lot of visual cues that any Edgar Wright fan will recall from his previous films. Things like long tracking shots, the editing being in sync with sound effects and music, background visuals reflecting the character's mood and story all exist in this film but they feel like Wright has taken them to a new level with his artistic style.This is probably one of the few movies where both characters and actors are a perfect match. Ansel Elgort is the true standout. At 23-years old, he is known mostly for teen dramas but now proves that he is more then capable to play a character as cool and complex as Baby. Elgort does not rely on too much dialogue to show the emotion that Baby feels through the movement of his body when listening to music. Jamie Foxx as Bats nearly steals the show, as a guy who is crazily unpredictable but yet knows how to under people's skin. John Hamm as Buddy really shows an amazing character transformation starting out as an ally to Baby but is then turned into terrifying antagonist. Kevin Spacey's quick line delivery is a perfect match to Wright's sharp screenplay, and has probably the best comic timing in the film. Lilly James's charm as Deborah helps to sell of what could be seen as a typical romantic plot device and really make you feel invested in her and Baby's relationship.Baby Driver is great but now a 100% perfect all the way through. There are certain plot holes that seem to come out of the blue and a certain character's motivation in the 3rd act felt like it wasn't properly set up. The ending was pretty uplifting but I felt could have shaven 5 to 10 minutes off because I felt like it became unnecessary.While it may be only second to my favourite Edgar Wright film Hot Fuzz, Baby Driver is the film where Edgar Wright as an artist is having the most creative fun that any director would dream of having. And Edgar Wright having the creative freedom that he needs is definitely something always worth taking the time to see.",Baby Driver
379,ChristianLeFeuvre,Brilliant action film,9,25 March 2019,"'Baby Driver' is an excellent action movie directed by Edgar Wright, who's directing credits also include 'Shaun Of The Dead and 'Hot Fuzz'.
Ansel Elgort plays 'Baby', a young man who is a car-jacker turned getaway driver, following a car accident when he was young, suffers from tinnitus and listens to music through headphones to drown out the sound of the humming. He is pressured into working for crime kingpin 'Doc', played by Kevin Spacey, as the driver for a crew in a number of robberies. However, when he meets and falls in love with a beautiful young waitress, his life takes a drastic turn.
This is an extremely fast-paced, exciting movie with some of the best car chase action sequences I have seen on film. The direction is superb and the first act of this film just grabs you and takes you along for the ride with stunning cinematography. The writing, acting and direction of this film really make the story come alive and it feels genuinely believable. 'Baby' is a good person who is a great driver and he is drawn into something he'd rather not be in and is desperate to get out of. The criminals are seriously nasty as a major contrast to Baby's character.
The movie could be classed as an action-drama as there is real depth to the characters, it's personal but also very dark. There, of course, some really gripping action scenes, with incredible stunts.
The soundtrack of this movie utilises songs and music to perfection, and they all serve a purpose. They are so incorporated and integrated by the editing that they flow in perfect sync with the action your seeing.
The dialogue in the movie is witty at times, but you also get invested in the characters and their situation.
The casting is magnificent. Ansel Elgort is remarkable. He has a minimal amount of lines and so much of his performance relies on facial expressions, and you can read so much in his eyes. There are stellar performances from Jamie Foxx and John Hamm too. Kevin Spacey is on form yet again, delivering so much emotion without too much expression. This is something Spacey does so well, he can deliver a lot of dialogue very fast and in a deadpan manner so well, take a look at the film '21' as a great example.
Lily James plays 'Debora', the love interest for Baby, who appears halfway through the film.
But this is, for me, the weakest part of the film. From the intensity and speed of the first act, the second act is considerably slower. There is still some action happening but it's slowed down by the fact that it's difficult to invest in the romance. It was set up so quickly and there was no real character development or depth to it, and she makes life-changing decisions for both Baby and herself in a split second without much thought, and the relationship didn't feel strong enough to warrant or justify them, and the believability of the romance didn't really work for me
The third act picks it all back up again when Baby making choices about how he wants his future to be, and we get some more amazing action sequences and terrific performances.
It's down to the brilliance of the direction and the captivating performances given by the amazing actors that kept the film interesting, even when the romance fell flat.
As I said, the direction in this film is outstanding, there is barely a boring shot, everything looks so slick, the cinematography and camera work is excellent.
Aside from the romance which felt hurried, 'Baby Driver' is an entertaining and exciting movie with a great cast, great action and a fantastic soundtrack.",Baby Driver

Ensemble was well cast and, surprisingly, was able to see past Jon Hamm's 'Mad Men' typecasting in his portrayal of a convincing bad guy. Unfortunately, the Jamie Fox role was written with a little too much anger and didn't allow us to see at least a little bit of what he's best at.",Baby Driver
381,yourfavoritecritic,One of 2017's Brightest Films (So Far...),8,12 July 2017,"Baby Driver, stars Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey and is the latest film written and directed by Edgar Wright. Baby Driver, tells the story of, Baby, a getaway driver who finds himself taking part in a heist that is doomed to fail. Now I have been a huge Edgar Wright fan for years now, he brings such a unique flavour to Hollywood with his creative storytelling, and distinctive editing. All of his films feel fresh and it's easy to tell a lot of heart gets poured into them and Baby Driver is no exception. I had not seen anything for the film prior to seeing to it, apart from a few T.V. spots here and there, so I was walking into theatre with a fresh pair of eyes and I left with such a giddy feeling. Baby Driver is a real good film, it has tight editing, a good story and rich characters, I could really see this movie standing the test of time and becoming a ""classic"" in the years to follow. The film meticulously crafted, with many scenes in time with the rhythm of the music to go along with the theme of the film and the protagonist's love for music. All the leads give good performances, especially Ansel Elgort who I really bought into as someone who is a hermit and doesn't speak much, and Jamie Foxx who was super menacing. There came a point halfway through the film where Foxx's character really got under my skin, and that wasn't solely due to the great writing but also the intensity he brought to his role. Now the only minor complaint I have is from Jon Hamm, although the role was legitimately written for him, there was something about his performance that just felt off. I'm not sure whether he just felt old for the role, or if it had something to due with how he portrayed his character or if it was my preconceived notion of Jon Hamm always being a good charismatic guy, he was still good nonetheless, I think I had just expected more. Now although I really enjoyed this film from start-to-finish, I did find the first half of the movie to be pretty by-the-numbers, I understand it was meant to set up for a crazy third act, I just felt a little underwhelmed by the first forty-five minutes. Also I found the very end of the climax to be a little hokey, it seemed to have went a little too over-the-top, but the rest of the movie makes up for these small complaints. Overall Baby Driver, was a really solid film. I've been impressed with the amount of big budget original films we've gotten so far this year and I am happy to say that this film ranks up there with some of the best released in 2017. I do highly recommend going out to see this film, especially in theatres, as it is a unique film that isn't solely made for the purpose of the studio cashing in. I cannot wait to watch this movie again and really tear into the easter eggs scattered throughout. Baby Driver was a solid outing from Edgar Wright and I am eagerly looking forward to seeing what else he has up his sleeve and for that reason, Baby Driver gets a 8.5/10.",Baby Driver
382,FandomFanatic21,All you need is one killer track...,9,22 May 2018,"Baby Driver, follows misunderstood Baby who is a getaway driver for those who live for the life of crime. Baby Driver is one heck of a movie with awesome car chases, crazy characters, a great love story, and one great music playlist. The movie is great for times when you just want to watch something. The movie does have lessons and meanings though most of the movie is just for fun and just to tell a story. The ending is shocking and the film is just a ride of epic proportions. I would highly recommend the movie for those looking for a good action film and for anybody looking for good music. Also, props to Ansel Elgort who must have had a tough time getting into Baby's character and hands down the cast was great! It is appropriate for most teens depending on the kid, just has a lot of violence and language. Highly recommend!""Sometimes all I want is to head West on 20 in a car I can't afford, with a plan I don't have, just me, my music, and the road.""- Deborah, Baby Driver",Baby Driver
383,n-m-bertin,Tries too hard to be cool,4,20 September 2017,"During the first quarter, the movie is quite fun and entertaining. But you still feel the main character does a bit too much, it's clearly trying to be a Tarantino movie from the 90's. A cool score, short blasts of action, likable baddies. The rest is basically taken from Drive. It also suffers from the ""where is the supposedly second star of the film ?"" Jon Bernthal is credited second, but you see him only for a few minutes... What happened there ? Jamie Foxx's character is also pretty weak, and Spacey's... just feels weird.It is fun yes, but as far as car chases go I've seen better, and you never really care for Baby. His backstory is too easy, too short, the love story too cliché. The 90s used to be riddled with Tarantino ripoffs like this one, especially after Pulp Fiction. There hasn't been one in a long time, so I guess that's why people think it's great again... But this movie will be forgotten pretty soon. I can rewatch Drive or Pulp Fiction any day, but this ? No thanks.",Baby Driver
384,o-31546,A blast of pure pop energy,8,2 July 2017,"Baby Driver is an absolutely brilliant film from Edgar Wright. The performances in this film are all top notch. There are a lot of twists and turns that worked perfectly. I cared about the plot and was invested in the story. The car chase scenes were amazing. They were all in tune with the soundtrack, which was really fun to watch. While the film isn't a full on comedy, it provides some great laughs. The soundtrack felt like its own character. The music fits perfectly and fit very well with the story. From the directing, acting, the soundtrack, and everything in between, the film is a unique and one of a kind experience that cannot be missed.It's a fun genre mashup that's also rather disposable, offering quick surges of pleasure akin to the cavalcade of tasty pop, rock and R&B songs that litter the soundtrack and provide the film's heartbeat. Action lovers will be impressed by the film's choreography and live stunts, one driver entering and exiting a narrow alley with 180 degree spins. ---Yidioo",Baby Driver
385,ReelLifeReviews,"Bad title, great film",8,28 June 2017,"Baby Driver - While it sounds like a follow up to The Boss Baby or Baby's Day Out, it's far from it. This is a fast-paced, engaging gangster flick with music and moves to spare.The title character, played by Ansel Elgort, is the protagonist, but also the resident DJ for your movie going experience. Songs are synced up with the action perfectly, making it all the more immersive. Having the songs be something the character was experiencing as well was a unique way to provide the soundtrack.Paired with the music are the crazy car chase/get away scenes. While there are quite a few of these, they never get stale. Each has it's own song and unique flare, so it's a new experience each time.There are no weak links with the actors either. It's hard to pick favorites out of such a strong crew, but Jamie Foxx and John Hamm really pull it out here. Each of their characters have more than a few screws loose, perhaps allowing them to bring something more to the table than the other members of the cast.Edgar Wright wrote and directed all of the characters exceptionally well. I cared about what each of them were saying with every line. Too often in other films there are scenes of sloppy exposition or flat dialogue to progress the story. Here, there is no filler to be found.The movie of course doesn't do itself any favors with a name like Baby Driver. The target audience likely will skim past it on the marquee, while a family that missed the most recent showing of Cars 3 might be in for a rude awakening four minutes in. While it definitely has the worst title of 2017 so far, it also has the distinction of being one of the funnest experiences of the year as well. If you get the chance, it's a ride worth taking. 8.5/10",Baby Driver
386,DJKwa,Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is a pulsating drive through the mind of a virtuoso talent,8,18 July 2017,"It's been four years between drinks for fans of Edgar Wright. While remnants of his involvement remain in 2015's Ant Man, they ultimately underline the overall disappointment of what could have been. Luckily he's back and firing on all cylinders with his action/music hybrid Baby Driver, a stylish update of the old-school heist flick. It's Wright's most commercial film to date and coincidentally his first to film in the US. Using the streets of Atlanta, Georgia as his own personal racecourse, Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is a pulsating drive through the mind of a virtuoso talent, whose impeccable track record speaks for itself.In his first headlining role, Ansel Elgort is Baby Driver, the baby-faced getaway driver who times his chases to the beat of a specifically curated soundtrack. Baby suffers from Tinnitus, the result of a childhood car crash that killed both his parents. The music allows him to block out the ringing in his ears, helping him to focus and heightening his driving ability. His talent catches the interest of criminal mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey), who organises bank robberies across the Atlanta metropolitan area. In dire financial straits, Baby agrees to work heists for him but after meeting Debora (Lily James), a waitress in a local diner, he becomes eager to get out of a life of crime and start a new life with her. However, deep in debt with Doc, Baby realises that finding a fresh start may be harder than just speeding away.Perhaps the only disappointing thing about the film is that it plays on the familiar heist trope of a ""one last job"" without offering much to subvert expectations. It's a cliché that Michael Mann has worked many times over in films such Thief and Heat, and fans of those sorts of films will be able to guess the general arc of Baby Driver's story from beginning to end. The biggest deviation is that, while those films typically feature older career-criminals looking for a comfy retirement, Baby Driver features a younger, fresh-faced protagonist whose strings are being pulled from higher up. As a result, it's hard not to root for Baby as he tries to regain control over his life and put it back on track. He's a likable enough character and after losing both of his parents at a very young age, he is just trying his best to make something of his life, even if that means veering off into crime. Besides, while the narrative may play it a little safe, it's the skill and flair in which the familiar story is told that stands out. A kick-ass soundtrack and kinetic action sequences pave Baby's road to redemption, and they work symbiotically to produce a sort of action poetry that will have you hanging on to every word.From the opening scene played to the rocking rhythm of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's ""Bellbottoms"", the film lets the audience know early on that the music is an integral part of the film's diegesis. In the scene, Baby is sitting in his car waiting for his accomplices as they rob a nearby bank. However, instead of idling around, the camera follows him as he grooves and sings along to the music. With the fast cutting and sweeping camera, Wright manages to elicit more excitement from the inside of the car than from the action occurring just outside. It's impressively put together and Wright stages it similarly to his 2003 music video Mint Royale's ""Blue Song', except with over a decade more of filmmaking experience allowing him to hone his talent. This is most evident in the precision in which the scene plays out as, on cue with the music, his accomplices jump into the car and Baby puts the pedal to the metal, roaring down the highway cops in tow. The shift to full-blown action is facilitated by the beat of the music, and it's this type of pinpoint precision that puts Baby Driver a cut above standard action fare.The film is filled with these types of stylistic flourishes, and they never feel superfluous even when they are indulgent. In one scene Baby goes on a morning coffee run listening to 'Harlem Shuffle' by Bob & Earl and the lyrics become part of the mise-en-scène, appearing as graffiti on street murals. The scene is so stylishly pulled off that it feels essential despite not adding much to the overall narrative. Then, in the last 20 or so minutes of the film, Baby Driver hits high gear with a slew of exhilarating chase sequences that will make your head spin as the film races towards the checkered flag with lightning speed.There is, however, a (ever so slight) disappointing feeling that the film lacks the belly-busting humour of Wright's previous works, in particular Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Given how effectively Wright has married action and comedy before, it would have been good to see a bit more of his trademark humour peppered throughout the film, such as the hilarious Mike Myers/ Michael Myers mask mix up scene. Although the decision to focus largely on the action may have been a purposeful one by Wright whose British comedies haven't exactly brought in box office gold stateside. Despite amassing a loyal fan base over the years, the cult filmmaker has yet to have a bona fide box office hit, but he seems determined to change that with Baby Driver. Overall, Baby Driver is a triumph of style over substance. It turns the chase film into high-art without challenging the viewers' expectations of the genre. While the story lacks surprises, the film's inventive chase sequences and perfectly tuned soundtrack make it irresistibly entertaining. After all it's not the destination but the ride that makes Baby Driver worth jumping on board for. And it's a ride worth taking over and over. Now when can we get a Baby Driver sing along version?",Baby Driver
387,Wwmbrd,"Music, Movement, and Manic",8,20 September 2021,"Very well crafted caper film, excellent music choice, but that goes without saying. A movie scored with all licensed music like this can be difficult to pull off, but Wright does it with flying colors and flashy cars. How everything is on beat and cued by music and a mix of wink wink moments with rewinding songs, or signifying confusion and stunned moments with a lack of music is a great touch.The action is also excellent- gripping when it needs to be, but never gratuitous. Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in, but the rest of the cast also brought their A game in a vibrant, fun, action packed movie with just a little bit of cheese. 8.5/10.",Baby Driver
388,paulmcuomo,"Confident, swaggering heist jukebox comedy thriller that will blow you away",10,12 July 2017,"Title not enough to go on for my thoughts on this movie? That's OK; I'm cool to go deeper.This movie is the latest film to be directed by Edgar Wright, the same hyperactive auteur behind the Cornetto trilogy - Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End - and also Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. All of these films are fantastic and very much some of the best movies of the modern century, let alone some of the best comedies. His films do feature very whip sharp dialogue and editing, along with very faithful homages to the genre he's satirising/straight up directing for. This film is no different.Principally, this movie is in a genre that's hard to pin down: it could very much fit into any one of those that I listed in the title of this review, because it inhabits each of them equally. The way it utilises the comedy and thriller elements are typically brilliant of an Edgar Wright project, but even still, the editing is on top form here. This is really apparent during the action scenes, where the action is cut to the music i.e. gunshots that play to drum beats, or the actual timing of the beginning and ends of the action scenes being on point. It extends beyond into how Baby interacts with Debora at the launderette, and builds a really, REALLY infectious kineticism with the movie that its exceptional.The filmmaking is solid, but also the writing is great as well. Everything that is set up within the film comes into play at some point, and in very unexpected ways that are genius - even the spelling of Debora's name comes into play, or a particular song being used in a way that you wouldn't expect it to be. There's also the inclusion of a kind-of Antagonist switch at the final act of the movie; I haven't seen that in a long time. This originality, and not patronising the audience with stuff they've seen before is totally refreshing.And then we have the acting. Ansel Elgort, who's best known for The Fault in our Stars, is really giving a new start to his career as this charming, cool, but also quietly powerful performance as Baby, who is aware that he's playing alongside dangerous criminals but also has standards that come into play throughout the film. Additionally, his chemistry with Lily James is quite endearing and sweet, and realistic for a pair of 17 year olds. Kevin Spacey is in this film, giving his best film performance in a long time, as the mob boss Doc who is both a parental figure to Baby but also is very demanding of him in a deep kind of way. His presence in the film is a welcome one to keep the thriller and comedic elements afloat. However, the two best performances in the film - and I WILL state that they are Oscar worthy here - are by Jamie Foxx as 'Bats' and Jon Hamm as 'Buddy'. Both are the subject of that Antagonist switch I mentioned earlier, and the way they are utilised as direct threats to Baby and everything he has are genius. These characters are both individually fantastic: they are in equal measures terrifying and hilarious at the same time, and get some great lines. There's also supporting performances by Jon Bernthal at the beginning very briefly as a gangster, Eiza Gonzalez as Buddy's wife Darling who is equally awesome, and a heart warming performance by deaf actor CJ Jones as Baby's foster father.In short, see this movie. I predict it'll get no awards attention even though it sorely deserves it, and I would love it if it did. Just make sure you see it in a cinema and get the best experience you can with it.",Baby Driver
389,Deathstryke,"A film so in love with itself, it needs its own cinema seat",5,2 July 2017,"""Baby Driver"" is showy, cliché-ridden and irritatingly self-aware. It's like that yappy drama society kid at college who is so consciously trying to act cool by breaking into song, dancing around chairs, drumming on desks and spitting jokey one-liners with a hand pistol flourish....the kind of person a cynical SOB like me just wants to punch in the throat.The central premise is about a young, good-at-heart kid forced into a life of crime in order to pay off a debt. The annoyingly slick, Abercrombie-faced ""Baby"" is not only the fastest getaway driver in Atlanta, we later find out he's also a self-taught music producer, dancer and talented free-runner...are you rolling your eyes yet?The main mechanic, so lauded by critics, is that everything in the film revolves around music, from the editing to the dialogue. Since Baby is constantly plugged into his i-pod (so, we are told, to drown out tinnitus from a car accident which killed his parents), the film essentially plays like one giant music video, with nearly every gunshot, tire screech and sassy put down edited meticulously with the beats or riffs of whatever track is playing during the sequence.Unfortunately the songs didn't make the hackneyed screenplay that much more interesting. While there are some splendid car chase sequences (too few in my book), one must endure cringey moments of Baby miming and dancing to James Brown, dull characters waxing poetic about song lyrics and saying cliché bull$hit like ""Sometimes all I want to do is head west on the 20 in a car I can't afford with a plan I don't have"". Everyone in the film is pretty, none of the gangsters really look like gangsters, least of all the Latina 'Darling', who can't even hold a gun convincingly and is just there to show cleavage and lick her lips at camera.Imagine the most indulgent ideas from Guy Ritchie and Tarantino's trash bin channeled through a Justin Bieber video. Less style and even less substance.There are no doubt people who will love it for being a showy piece of nonsense, and there is some entertaining, high impact action, but it's far from the genius some critics are praising it as. I saw it with a group of youngish people who all agreed it wasn't as good as they'd hoped and that some bits were just plain daft.Leave your brain at home and perhaps you'll be rewarded...",Baby Driver
390,fletcherc21,A Fun Ride,7,30 June 2017,"Baby Driver is a lot of fun, the first half is probably one the most enjoyable movie I have seen this year. The action and car chases are crisp, well shot, and exciting, with great comedy and visual flair in between. It manages to go from intense car chases that feel like the Italian Job to fun strolls across town that come straight out of La La Land in consecutive scenes, and it feel natural. Ansel Elgort brings charm to the driver, Baby, and Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal, and Eiza Gonzalez bring a lot of personality to their criminal underworld. Unfortunately, Edgar Wright can't quite maintain the fast paced joy ride for the whole film and rather than building up to the final heist and its hectic aftermath, it feels like Edgar Wright ran out of steam and the wit and visual style that elevated the first half are replaced with action movie clichés.Despite that, Baby Driver is still a good movie, packed with fun and it looks like it will have tons of rewatchability.

I waited months to see it as it was the first time I saw Ansel Elgort in an action flick.And also because in general, the whole cast not only looked awesome at trailer and the poster, but everyone actually did a great job at the movie: Ansel was just perfect and irresistibly funny at his leading role; I freaking fell in love with the character of Lily James, and with how perfect Ansel and her looked together; Mr. Spacey was excellent too; Mr Foxx and Mr. Hamm were simply hateful, which was a good thing. And it was good to me to see Eiza González in a more serious role than in all the things she did before.And the music, oh my God the music was just excellent. Every song was very well selected and perfectly fit in every single minute of the movie. It gave to it the whole atmosphere it had to have. This will probably make you doubt about the time context of the story, which you will totally enjoy.10/10. As an action movie is simply perfect and exciting, I totally recommend it to you. I already saw it three times at the cinema, and believe me, even if you don't like action movies, this one is going to impress you. In a few years it will be probably considered an action classic.Thanks for reading!P.S.

392,Parks,Slight and Insubstantial,5,3 July 2017,"I'm a bit perplexed by the ecstatic reviews. Perhaps it's just that ""Baby Driver"" is different compared to Marvel Movie #21 or Generic CGI Robot Saga #5.Either way, the strengths of the film seem to be summarised as follows:Cool soundtrack. Great editing. Some mildly funny lines. Some great car chases. Kevin Spacey is always great in everything. Except maybe ""Nine Lives"".I'm struggling to say more about it than that. It was pleasant, it passed the time. I didn't get bored. But I'm struggling to understand the 10 star reviews which bypass the spit-through characterisation and the repetitive story (it's essentially just three car-chases interspersed with a very flimsy plot). The romance between the two leads is pleasant enough, but it is pretty by-the-numbers teen stuff.In the last third of the film it falls apart completely. The motivations of certain characters start to make no sense other than they move the plot to where it needs to go for the next set-piece. I'm honestly still trying to figure out why Kevin Spacey's character acted as he did at the end. So you see what I mean? It's a decent film. I'd buy the soundtrack, and watch it on DVD. But I suspect if it didn't have the name Edgar Wright on the credits you could probably reduce its IMDb rating by about a third.And now that I think about it... Marvel Sequel #21 probably had more depth to it. And Guardians of the Galaxy probably had the better soundtrack too.",Baby Driver

397,TheJediWay9,"A simplistic Plot With Killer Soundtrack Makes ""Baby Driver"" A Delight",10,22 June 2017,"""Baby Driver"" the new film from Edgar Wright is about a getaway driver named Baby who is forced to work for a criminal mastermind who hires different teams to rob banks. When Baby meets the girl of his dreams, he wants out, but not before being double crossed and forced to work on an other job.Edgar Wright's films are brilliant. I will say that first. They are all funny, original, and relatable. ""Baby Driver"" is no different. This may actually be the best Edgar Wright film I have seen (excluding The World's End, which I have NOT seen). This is up there for as one of the best and could be in the running for my favorite movie of the year when all is said and done at the end of the year. First off, the cast is phenomenal and perfectly cast. I have not seen Ansel Elgort in anything else, but he was really good in the movie. Everyone in this movie really gave it their all. Jon Hamm in this movie, HOLY SMOKES. Even Eiza Gonzalez, thought not great, did a very good job and gave it their all.This movie is very original, something there isn't much of these days. It is so well written and you are able to get sucked into this world very easily. The script is very witty, funny, original, and relatable. The characters are not overly developed, but not underdeveloped either. It's just the right amount of characterization.This movie goes in many ways I did not expect. This movie sets up a character to be the main villain and he doesn't end up being the main villain, which I would usually have a problem with but I felt it worked very well for this movie. It wasn't predictable, and usually movies like this are. This one wasn't. it kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat for the entirety of it. Th action is really cool too, and yes there is some shaky cam, but I feel as if it is shaky cam done right. You can still make out what is going on in each scene even when the camera is shaking. the action is just so inventive and cool, as unrealistic as it may be, and it made these scenes really entertaining and fun to watch.This movie also has a killer soundtrack. The soundtrack for this movie is the perfect driving music. It was fun to listen to, and added a little extra to the action scenes. This was by far one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard for a movie. Please do yourselves a favor and see this film next weekend when it comes out. this is what Hollywood needs right now, original films that aren't afraid to push the envelope. This movie was a whole lotta fun. I had a blast with it at my screening, and is definitely up there for best of the year so far.I'm giving ""Baby Driver"" the almighty perfect score of an A+Check out my review of ""Baby Driver"" on YouTube in the link provided, and please, go and support this movie.

398,TheNameBrand,One of my favorite films in years,9,1 June 2018,"That was a fun ride. HIGHLY Original and with good filmography to boot, it's not only what I believe is Edgar Wrights best pieces of work, but it's just overall an absolutely incredible film. You should be watching it.",Baby Driver
399,yellowtail_tuna,Stylish car chase action film,8,23 June 2020,"It was the first time for me to watch an Edgar Wright film. Above all, I was very impressed by his style, the meticulous direction and editing. The use of bright colors distinguishes this from many crime films which tend to be dark and dim.The sound and music have a significant role in the film, because they represent Baby's hearing. You will notice how delicately each sound is arranged. And it's kind of ambiguous that the songs played in the film are soundtrack songs chosen by the directer, and also songs chosen by Baby on his iPod, either way to express his emotions.Story is about Baby's wish to get out from the illegal job, and the criminal organization that does not let him to go. But it seems to me Baby is not just a victim of the exploitation of the criminals, because the reason he has gotton into the world is partly that he has talent as a getaway driver. He seems to fight more against his own nature than against the threat by the criminals. It makes this film an introverted one.Similarly the criminal organization is not really an organization. It's just a bunch of indivisuals. Doc, Buddy, Darling and Bats, each of them has their own strong character, interesting backgound, and internal conflict.Car chase scenes are the most exciting ones that I've ever seen. They are cheerful too, because the bright colors and uptempo songs give them some comical touch. And they are not just exciting as action, but also many important plot twists and dialogues are taken place in the cars.",Baby Driver
400,fbmike,Dope and not in a good way.,2,5 October 2017,"This movie simply put was pretty much a piece of junk. The first 10 minutes of the movie showing this punk kid trying to be a white boy version of James Brown and drive a getaway car at the same time was rather nauseous to watch and just didn't cut the mustard. I had much trouble watching this movie, already a bit shook up (not in a good way) from watching this dude with his ear buds on looking like a dope. Dunno man, have I said I didn't like this movie yet? Another good example (lots of them lately) of some good actor's talents completely wasted. Shallow-add some good actors-make a standard Hollywood-movie with no substance, crappy storyline and actors that were not believable. It's pretty bad watching good actors not act good. Kids might dig this flick (maybe) but after watching it, I felt cheated and mad at myself that I actually sat through it. Jamie ""I do it for the money"" Fox, I don't know what to say about you lately dude. And damn Kevin, what were you thinking being a part of this? It was very clear you were not into the part you played.",Baby Driver
401,curiousgeorgiapeach,Blinded by love's truest embrace,9,1 June 2021,"I found myself in the theater (please pronounce pretentiously) about to attend a showing of Infant Child Driver. I was greeted with a warm film filled with complex emotions and ""feels"" which were all very new to me. A budding romance and a dark past collide and only one can win. Very Small Person Driver is a story that highlights the fact that you can't change the past... but you can certainly jack up your future if you aren't careful.Overall, Infant Driver was an enjoyable film which I'm happy to recommend.",Baby Driver
402,jonathanmark-77048,Easily my favorite Edgar Wright Film,8,30 June 2017,"Plot: After being coerced into working for a crime boss, a young getaway driver finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail.I was so happy walking out of this film, I was worried that this would be a case like Mad Max Fury Road where everyone praised it and it turned out to be not that good, but this is not the case. This film combined music and action in a very original and interesting way, which was nice to see in a crime film. The story managed to be engaging, exciting and even tense towards the last half.The cast all did a really good with their characters, the standouts being Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Kevin Spacey who all put effort into their characters and made them interesting. I was especially happy with Lily James being given a proper character unlike in Pride Prejudice and Zombies, she was very likable, and had really good chemistry with Ansel throughout the film. The action is also really good, especially the car chases which are some of the best that I've seen in a while.This is the kind of summer film that Hollywood should be doing now, not all the reboots, remakes, or even sequels that come out now. I've liked most of Edgar Wright's films throughout, but this one stood out to me more than those. This film is a definite to see in the theater, you won't regret it.",Baby Driver
403,patomartinezfgo,A masterpiece in editing,9,23 August 2017,"Baby Driver is a very unconventional movie in today's world. It is very rare to see a fully original script with a great director and a beautiful style.I loved Baby Driver, it is such a good time and everything about it is almost perfect. The ""Gimmick"" (It is not really a gimmick) of the movie is that everything in the movie is in beat with a song that ""Baby"" (main character) is playing in his iPod. This creates some excellent scenes were a lot is happening, yet everything is perfectly on beat.Production wise, this movie is a 10/10. Every aspect of the production of this movie is great. Actually, I believe this movie should win an Oscar for ""Best Editing"", it would be a crime not to. This movie has the challenge of keeping everything on beat, and that is primarily done through editing, it is amazing to see how almost everything is following a song, and you don't even notice.The Cinematography is also outstanding. Edgar Wright uses some very cool shots to film the action scenes, in which you can see everything. There are also some very good one-shot scenes that have a lot of hidden messages waiting for you to find.I must give credit to Edgar Wright for using actual cars and stunt-men rather than CGI for the car chases, they feel so real and everything is shut perfectly for you to see what is happening.Of course, the soundtrack is amazing. It contains a lot of great Rock and Blues songs.Story wise, this movie is also great. The characters are very interesting and well rounded. All the supporting cast was super fun to see on screen and the main character was very interesting by himself. I specially like the character of ""Buddy"" and all the things he does at the end. Kevin Spacey is remarkably hilarious in his role and gives some great one-liners.There is some comedy sprinkled through the movie (typical for Edgar Wright), and it almost always lands, he has a lot of experience doing comedy (When I say sprinkled I don't mean that it is very few, I am saying that you shouldn't expect something like Hot Fuzz or World's End where every scene has a joke in it).The only problem I had with the movie was the love interest. The story was pretty interesting and there was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I just feel that there was not enough time devoted to them and when they have to make important decisions for each other, it just seems like we skipped some scenes were they bonded a lot more. My theory is that there were some scenes that were cut out that provided the romance with more screen time.It is rare for me to say it, but I actually recommend you to watch this movie twice, because there are a lot of hidden secrets that you will not find in the first one, but will find in the second viewing. I certainly enjoyed the movie more the second time I saw it.",Baby Driver

406,BabySharkDoDoDie,Overrated AF,3,21 October 2021,"Why this movie rated so high!? This is just another style-over-substance film. The music was too loud (i guess maybe it was supposed to?), the characters make dumb decisions & this was far from reality (our guy met this one girl at a restaurant one day & the next day they became love birds & decides to run away--- i mean wtf!?).The things i like is the direction & it's pacing. The things i didn't like is the absurd & illogical plot, repeated dialogues, dumb characters & decisions.This movie is at best 5 out of10 !",Baby Driver
407,surjan,Passable but over-stylised,6,28 May 2019,"Had me watching til the end but ultimately I was disappointed. Unnecessary violence, over stylised, ropey story. Only saving grace is the romance between ""Baby"" and Deborah.",Baby Driver
408,AdultAudienceMember,Engaging from start to finish.,10,29 June 2017,"Heck, I'm old. Been watching movies for well over a half century. Seen hundreds of which most have stunk, some were entertaining, and some few were engrossing.This is not a romcom. It is not some stupid Fast & Furious movie.....all of which are monumentally and stupidly awful. This is well beyond any of the Transporter movies.Baby Driver is one of the most engrossing and entertaining movies I have seen in many years. It is taut, fast, surprising, unpredictable, and ultimately a very satisfying movie experience.I won't give you the plot as that can be found anywhere. But you have great acting, great action, characters that are both likable and absolutely void of any human qualities.....and a few nice folks.It is well worth your time and money.",Baby Driver
409,wackywhovian11,Was He Slow....No!,8,19 November 2017,"Oh my God this film was really good. I love the soundtrack the best of 2017, well second behind Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. The movie is about a driver played by Ansel Elgort who plays Baby who has a medical condition where he hears a ringing in his ears due to an accident when he was a kid so he listens to music to drawn out the noise and concentrate on his driving for Kevin Spacey character who basically blackmailing himself into being the getaway driver for bank robbers or heist jobs. Lily James plays the love interest of Baby and helps him bring out of his comfort zone and learn how to cope with his handicap. Oh yeah Jamie Foxx is in here as a wise cracking heister who thinks Baby is dumb and a waste of space and doesn't think he deserve a cut of the money because all he does it drive. Excuse me Mr Foxx but if you are going to rob a place you want a great getaway driver right? And Baby can drive his butt off in this film and he does it all to music. And really great music. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good action film and great music to go along with it. Should you watch this film? Yes, go out there and rent this film or buy it, trust me you'll love it.",Baby Driver

412,yannigk,Best movie of the year,10,25 August 2017,"I haven't felt this good coming out of a movie screening in a long time.This movie spells F-U-N.Fun characters, sure most of them are cliché, and it is deliberate! Just look at their nicknames: Doc (the mastermind), Buddy (the friendly muscle), Darling (the bubblegum-popping fierce gal), Baby (literally babyface kid), and Bats (the crazy one).This is played so perfectly to a point.Fun chase scenes. Familiar? Maybe, we've seen enough Furious movies. Smart? Most of the time. Fun? Absolutely.Fun romance. Ain't nothing more fun than an innocent teenage first date with a flirtatious (on both sides) counterpart in a laundromat. And they didn't even have to cheapen it with a sex scene. What a breath of fresh air there. Fun heist plot. It's almost like a different version of Ocean's eleven.Fun banter. A lot of pop cultural references. That Mike Myers joke is gold.Fun choreography. If you liked the opening sequence, it is followed by a fun MTV style of a character lip syncing and dancing timed perfectly to the lyrics of song - playing in Baby's headphones - literally written on the walls.Fun style. I am a sucker for 50s stuff - classic diner, classic mix tapes (well.. more 80s in that sense), classic cars, and a long drive to the west.Fun music. All I want to do now is to download the whole OST album. They stretched the final showdown a little bit but they nailed the ending. I leave the room a satisfied customer.Don't know if this is an actual easter egg: The disguise outfit that Baby took from the shop, ie. blue baseball cap and denim jacket, is the same outfit that Ryan Gosling's driver (in ""Drive"") wears when escaping police pursuit.",Baby Driver
413,brainsmasher-66,Never a dull moment,10,2 July 2017,I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. At first I thought it was going to be another run of the mill cliché teen movie with teenagers outsmarting the grownups. That is not the case at all. It's about a teen messing around with grownups and realizing he is out of his league and trying to GTFOH.This movie has star power with Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm; and they deliver the goods. The supporting cast also knocks it out of the park; but the real star is the soundtrack. I was jamming in my seat.,Baby Driver
414,leaugebrett,Best Heist Film of 2017,8,14 October 2017,"Wright's latest film is both highly original and a distinct homage to heist-gone-wrong flicks. Elgort, Foxx, and Hamm nail their roles, the soundtrack's used to it's fullest potential as a great cinematography technique, and the action scenes will entice anyone itching for a standout crime movie.",Baby Driver
415,FrankHonest,Forget the plot for a second ...,9,7 November 2018,"I want to focus on production. Lots had been said about plot and that's fair. But this movie is a production masterpiece.It's focal dedication to music is refreshingly original. It's never done in a non-musical and is instantly engaging. The movie feels built around the songs instead of them being added later. It's odd and wouldn't fit with many films. But it works here. It's captivating and gripping. There's something exciting about the characters syncing and interacting with the song.The screenplay is a masterpiece. It's ballsy. The director for and actors do a great job given the task. We need more films like this, that push the rules and conventions of what a blockbuster Hollywood movie actually is.",Baby Driver
416,benkitching13,"Original, stylish and intelligently crafted.",8,27 December 2017,"8.5/10 for clarification. Baby Driver's opening sequence, and a number of scenes that supersede it, present the film as being an aggressively stylish, intelligently crafted and highly engaging work.Though Driver's magic never fully dissolves, it's aggressive style and engagement slightly diminishes which sadly impacts the overall experience.The incredible and varied performances and the personas they encompass never cease to massively impress throughout the runtime. The relationship between Baby and Debora is commendably original and one of the least contrived I have ever observed. Some of the dialogue is excellently crafted, and this extends to the admirable use of humour. To some extent, the violent fight sequences impress, however they fail to thrill and feel somewhat lacklustre. Overall, Baby Driver is a stylish experience that's complemented further by the incredible performances.",Baby Driver
417,lawrenceconwayvulcan,Speed to the music,10,30 June 2017,"Baby Driver is by far the most mature film Edgar Wright has ever made, that is not to say it is not with out it's moments of humour (the Myers mask mix up)but for the most part is a film made up of suspense. action and even pathos.Music is at the heart of the film as Baby (Ansel Elgort) uses it as a way to get through his life even when on getaway driver duties. There even scenes where the dialogue is in synced with the music soundtrack in particular one scene Kevin Spacey's character Boss lays out plans for the latest robbery. Baby Driver features some of the best car chases that the cinema has seen in yearsWith it's sense of style Baby Driver is one of the most unique experiences that you can get in the cinema.",Baby Driver

419,patrick-91640,"Only style, no substance",4,27 May 2021,"I really don't understand why baby driver has so many positive reviews.Yes, the music fits perfectly and even many visuals sync to it. For example gun shots add to the beat. That is a nice idea and well-crafted. Also the car chases and shootings are done properly when you view them isolated.But let's be honest: all of that is pure style. And a good style is just good style. An extra which makes an already good movie great but doesn't make a mediocre movie good.Unfortunately baby driver is a mediocre movie at best. It doesn't know what kind of Genre it wants to be, the acting is overdone, the story is ridiculous, plot holes are out of control, and the pacing is really bad.Don't believe the hype. A good Soundtrack and a prominent cast don't always promise a decent movie.",Baby Driver
420,svorva,First Remarkable Film of 2017,8,10 July 2017,"So Baby Driver is great and if you have not already seen it you should.We'll expand on that thought in a moment, but first your critic is going to whine about tangentially related personal problems. I just snuck this bit of actual substance in first so you would not justifiably skip the remainder of the review after reading the next paragraph.Undergoing a bit of an existential crisis. 2017 seems unremarkable thus far, full of 5/10 movies that with spin I could justify a point one way or another. Sure, there are the annually under-appreciated foreign and art-house releases, but nothing hype in the mainstream, nothing worth sharing with friends. So all my reviews just seemed to rain on people's parades. Where is the nobility in criticism? Is Wonder Woman really a disaster? Am I just completely out of touch?So the Wonder Woman draft got tossed (This kid has drafts? If he felt good enough to share this, imagine what he scrapped). An opinion no one was waiting for or wanted to hear. The greater loss was of spirit. I had just polished a 30,000 word essay and was eyeing the recycle bin like deranged writers of decades past, glowering at their roaring fireplace. My toil was narcissistic expressionism and I was ready to surrender. Scene set, enter salvation. Baby Driver is the first movie of 2017 that I am going to remember come 2018. A genre picture, but auteur Edgar Wright subverts tropes and our expectations more subtly than in any of his past efforts. If there were any qualms that Wrights direction was geared toward niche fanboys, this is the proof otherwise. So please, don't let Baby Driver just be my personal deliverance. I don't think a plot synopsis is going to be useful. Time better spent figuring what exactly is Baby Driver. Comparison is the standard method, but this only works so well. Baby Driver is a heist film. A car chase film. Draws influence from those 90's L.A. crime films. And the 70's classic The Driver, well Baby Driver borrows far more than just a cameo. Baby Driver feels familiar, but easily proved distinct from any film it feels linked to. Obviously the archetype for the cold dominating mastermind Doc (Spacey) can be seen past films. So can the child in denial Buddy (Hamm), his enabler Darling (Gonzalez), and the cunning, furious, dangerous Bat (Foxx). Of course there is One Last Job. But this is a heist film where we are not permitted to watch a single heist. A car film where the music is just as important as the chase. A L.A. crime thriller set in Atlanta. So what do we have here? We have Baby (Elgort). A getaway driver that does not seem to belong in the criminal world, or maybe any world. Baby is withdrawn, sunglasses and earbuds are constant fixtures. Watch how he bumps into every pedestrian as he dances through the streets (in one long shot). His compatriots question if he even hears the plan, but Baby is just trying to cope, a vulnerable soul in a brutal line of work. His favorite tool is his omnipresent assorted music. More than just a soundtrack, Edgar Wright described Baby Driver as a ""car musical."" It's a cute description, although more a quip for critics to regurgitate than accurate observation, but does emphasize how sequences are defined by their music. It is impossible to describe the first chase without mentioning the song ""Bellbottoms."" However, unlike in your typical musicals, the world does not start and stop for a song. It's all naturally integrated. Baby uses music to smother his surroundings, logically it would play a major role in our perspective. Almost any sound track this loud and in your face would be overkill, a blunder, but just like Baby, Edgar Wright has style while remaining utterly unpretentious. Wright utilizes cinematic technique that in other films would be called distracting or unnecessary, but when everything is in place and the flow is unquestionable. With music like this, the setting cannot be L.A., it absolutely has to be Atlanta. All the musician cameos, justified. The name on Baby's birth certificate? I won't spoil, but there is only one perfect answer.Baby Driver just kills. The critics love it, my friends love it, I love it, and I love talking about it. I shouldn't hope, but I pray a film so zany, so early in the year, so not set in L.A. can steal an Oscar or at least a nom. Academy approval of Baby Driver or not, you can be sure six months down the road I will be writing about the decision.",Baby Driver
421,avraham_tal,Action-Comedy of escapism,7,4 August 2017,"At first, this seems like a banal action-comedy film. The acting is quite good, and some of the jokes will even make you laugh.But, underneath lays well-directed escapism stories of all characters.Baby escapes his past trauma and hearing disability with music. Debora also escapes her boring-routine with music. Bats escape his conscience with violence. Buddy and Darling escape their past with hedonism and lust. Doc escapes his broken heart with greed.Having that been said, this is not an ""8+"" movie.",Baby Driver
422,alihandemiral,The whole film is an action-packed music-clip!,10,10 October 2017,"Before ""Baby Driver"", I've never thought much of Wright's filmography, but he has done it this time! With a great cast for unique characters and with songs that are spot on, Wright created a two-hour,action packed music clip that is both enchanting and uplifting. As a character, Baby might be one of the most original in film history and this concept of mixing music with action sequences pays off big time thanks to the many other movie references - those that shine being Death Proof(2007) and Heat(1995) for me. Can't wait to see something similar from Wright in the future. I hope he leaves behind his Simon Pegg funny pictures and does more films like this.",Baby Driver
423,m-maru,Excellent movie,10,30 July 2017,"From the first minute this movie catches you, those first few minutes are wonderful. Excellent and original action scenes, from the best soundtracks that go perfectly with each scene, has several moments of humor that are quite good. The performance of Ansel Elgort is brilliant and dazzles on the screen and the chemistry with Lily James is beautiful, the rest of the great cast is excellent. The film is exciting, incredible and if they are fans of the genre, they will enjoy it. He has a very good picture, Edgar Wright's address is very good. This movie is one of my favorites of the year and I think it's going to be nominated for many awards and honestly deserves it, it's epic.",Baby Driver
424,ChrisinDesMoines,A rewatchable movie,10,1 May 2021,"I have no idea how this movie slipped passed me, just about anything regarding car chases and racing shows up on my radar. That doesn't mean that I find an interest in watching it, it just means that it shows up on my radar.This movie caught my attention about two weeks ago when someone reviewed the first five minutes of it on YouTube and it showed up on my ""suggested video's list"" and so I decided to watch it (I enjoy watching ""Reaction"" videos to songs or movies that I know or watched as well as watching movie reviews to see what might be good.If you make it through the first five minutes of this movie, you're going to be hooked until the final credits.Period.So a few random thoughts. This is totally a flashback to 80's MTV in that its almost like watching a two hour long music video. While not quite as literal as I make it sound, its not quite as hyperbolic as it may seem. Baby (Ansel Elgort) suffers from tinnitus so he uses his iPod/loud music to drown out the ringing in his ears (Not so far fetched as it seems, I sleep with the TV/radio on for the very same reason). His job is a getaway driver for an organized crime ring in Atlanta and he plays fast paced music in his iPod to ""keep him moving"". In some ways he reminds me of a young Steve McQueen. Cool, observant and not easily intimidated. He works for Doc (Keven Spacey) and ends up meeting a cute waitress Debora (Lily James). As far as plot and storyline goes, I could easily see this as a 30s or 40s gangster movie using the aforementioned Steve McQueen as Baby, Possibly James Cagney as Doc and any number of glamorous young Hollywood women from the 30's or 40's. Shirley Temple, Fay Wray, Ann Sheridan or Ingrid Bergman. Lily James manages to convey that classic Hollywood beauty from the era in modern times and it all fits together so well.But music is vital to this movie. When someone is shooting or explosion's are taking place it's all keeping in tune to the music that Baby is listening too giving it that MTV Music Video feel from the 80's. I don't care what era or style of music you're into, you'll find something in this video that you'll enjoy. 60's Motown, New Wave Blues, Hard Rock, 70's glam rock and it all works so well.Of course you need to ""suspend belief"" while watching this movie, if you're going to expect it to be realistic, there's some parts that simply isn't going to, especially if you're familiar with Downtown Atlanta and you know that he cant get from point A to point B, even at those breakneck speeds he's driving at, but you won't care because you'll be entertained and those little details won't stand out.It's a great movie with a fantastic ending and if you make it become a franchise you'll only ruin it... but... if Edgar Write EVER decides to make another movie using this style? I'm totally down for it.",Baby Driver
425,ChocOrange_,Above average slick action movie,9,12 September 2017,"Very nicely made action flick with superbly slick camera work from Bill Pope elevating this action flick well above the norm. A few very long takes integrated perfectly with the soundtrack.It actually gets better on repeated viewings as you realise just how clever it is. Some great car chases; Edgar Wright has done his homework on the movies to homage and he's created some very exiting moments which is usually difficult to pull off in chases. A chase scene with Hocus Pocus by Focus gets my vote any day.Wildly entertaining for the most part. As many have commentated, the eclectic mix of songs plays a very integral part in the film.It's definitely on the side of slick eye-candy rather than clever plot, even if the script is intelligent in places.Well worth adding to your watch list.",Baby Driver

428,charbelelaro,Enjoyable with so much more potential,6,11 August 2017,"Before seeing 'Baby driver' I was very excited due to the fact that the director, Edgar Wright is known to make unique movies which really work. For me this movie was bitter sweet. This is because it contained some of the best action scenes, and car chases I've ever scene. The editing, cinematography and integration with music was extraordinary. Kevin Spacey and John Hamm, were perfect in their roles, and for the most part I felt that Ansel Elgort was best suited for his role also. Although this film has major problems. I feel as though other movie reviewers are addressing the main issue with the film, and are really overlooking the importance of it, as they are distracted by the elaborate and breathtaking action sequences. This film does not delve deep into its characters enough to make you really care about them, and their relationships. Ansel Elgort's character ""Baby"", is rushed into a two dimensional relationship with Lily James' character ""Debora"". The genuine love between these characters is not apparent due to the lack of substance as a couple. There are situations where this relationship is threatened to create suspense and I couldn't help but think about how much more intense and gripping it would be if the audience really felt for these two characters. I have seen it been done in other films, where the viewer is emotionally attached to characters and their relationships. When it is done right, it truly takes you other places in terms of tension and genuine worry. I was deeply disappointed by this, as all the stunning action scenes would have enhanced even further if the audience had felt a real care for these characters. It reached a point where the limits of their relationships were unrealistic. Debora would make life threatening decisions, which could either kill her or make her a criminal, for a boy she had only gone on a single date with. The occurrence of this really took me out of the scenes, as her motivations were insanely unrealistic for an average human. Furthermore, my other main issue with 'Baby Driver' was Jamie Fox. Countless movie critics are praising his performance, and to a certain extent he was great. His personality as a character was done well. It was his unclear line delivery which really interrupted intense scenes that were intended to really build in tension. On countless occasions I felt that the ruthless and terrifying persona of his character was lost due to my inability to understand him. Also the acting by Eiza González as ""Darling"" was quite terrible, especially in a certain scene where she was attempting to be threatening, which only left me cringing. Overall, 'Baby Driver' is a really enjoyable movie, which was lots of fun to watch. The reason as to why I am grading it a 7/10, is due to all the potential I see in it. It was so close to being a masterpiece, and I can't wait to see the film which can tackle this style perfectly. I know that when that happens, that film will be a modern day classic.",Baby Driver
429,miinty,Honest review,8,11 March 2020,"I was intoxicated on edibles when I watched this movie and I think it made it so much better! I am a fan of Edgar Wright, so I would've probably liked it anyway, but I was trippin' so much that this strange, all music movie just seemed like the the most, exciting, perfect thing for me to be doing at that moment.Ansel/Baby, every scene with that kid I loved, especially the Dave Brubeck explanation scene.As stoned as I was, I was able to see through the horribly unbelievable and sometimes painful dialogue - so, all of the talking parts of this movie was a no-no for me... luckily there wasn't much.The part where Baby loses is timing - oh my god, that's why I love Edgar Wright!!
Loved the Michael Myers scene.
Loved the Joe Loya scene.
Loved - strictly in a clever, way how they blocked all the action of the robberies - I would love for Edgar Wright to do a slick robbery movie.. I think I wish that that's what this movie was - just a good ol' heist movie with this crazy getaway driving - But I did like it, because there's just something that Edgar Wright does with music that I agree with all of the time!Everyone except baby annoyed me.
I feel like Kevin Space was playing this too much like Frank Underwood.
Jamie Foxx was just an annoying robber, and Hamm and the girl were too meh, cliche - Still though, Baby, the music, the driving, made me rate this high... because all in all, I was entertained.",Baby Driver
430,Marthian80,Entertaining car chase movie with excellent soundtrack,7,10 November 2017,"I'm a fan of the 'Cornetto trilogy' so i was exited to see what Edgar Wright would do with his first American movie. It apparently has a lot of music in it so that should be a good start! The movie opens with three gangsters and a getaway driver about to do an armed robbery in Atlanta, Georgia. The young getaway driver employed by the gangsters boss is named 'Baby' (Ansel Elgort), who suffers from tinnitus but listens to his Ipod all day to block it out. With the right track playing, Baby is able to perform amazing driving skills. The gangsters successfully escape the police, thanks to Baby and they meet up with the boss, named Doc (played by Kevin Spacey) to distribute the loot. Apparently Baby is not really working for Doc , he's actually paying of a debt because he tried to steal a car from Doc in the past. But Baby has almost paid off the debt with Doc and he meets a lovely girl named Debora (Lily James) so things are starting to get better for him. But on his last job he has to work with a very dangerous gangster named Bats (Jamie Foxx) who really dislikes Baby. On top of that Doc forces Baby to continue to work for him, threatening to hurt Debora if Baby refuses. So far his love for music kept Baby going but now that his new love interest is threatened, the gangsters get more dangerous, will he still get through it all? Overall this was a very entertaining movie, the action is fast paced and exciting, the car chase scenes are sublime and the acting is decent. Some characters are a little over the top. Jamie Foxx goes a bit overboard playing a dark gangster and Jon Hamm, who plays a more relaxes gangster, get's a bit 'larger then life' later on in the movie. I liked the performance of the young cast, Ansel Elgort and Lily James. I was not a fan of Ansel's previous work but I think he's getting better. Sadly his character is the only one given a decent background but it's done well, especially how they use music to describe his moods. The movie is not without problems though. The romance between Baby and Debora is a bit forced and feels like it came out of a fairy tale. But perhaps this was intended? And it suffers from the usual action movie tropes like people treating point blank shot-wounds like it's noting but a scratch, the police is nowhere to be seen and some characters are just evil for evil's sake. (I just want to make lot's of money and that's all!) I expected more jokes in this movie as well and felt the movie could use it, but perhaps Wright didn't want to make another 'cornetto' style movie. The best part of the movie is the amazing soundtrack. Every track feels like it belongs there and it brings the movie to a higher level, especially during the car chase scenes. Baby Driver is a very entertaining movie with an excellent soundtrack. Worthy of watching for the soundtrack alone, especially if you like car chases.",Baby Driver

432,nizzambaharuddin,MUSIC FOR YOUR EYES,8,14 January 2020,"SPOILER-FREEIf you like music, action, crime, heist, car chases, and classic love story then this movie is for you. The movie has it all. It's the perfect mashup of all that component. That first 6 minutes of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion soundtrack mesh with the action alone is worth the price of admission.As soon as I heard that this is an Edgar Wright's directed movie, I was immediately drawn to it. I admit, I had my doubts though. I wasn't a fan of the newly-replaced Robert Pattinson's throne of teenage heartthrob, Ansel Elgort. But he does his job good enough as Baby, a young man with a hum in the drums as Doc (Kevin Spacey) put it. He portrays the character well in my opinion. Nothing out of the ordinary though.Maybe some wouldn't notice, but the movie is like a musical in some kind of way. Well, almost. It's very well choreographed to the sountrack. 2 scenes that stood out for me was the opening 6 minutes scene, and the Tequila song in the warehouse scene. All that effort should always be commended.Now, for the technical point, First, the cinematography. It's the usual of what you would se in an Edgar Wright's movie. A few scenes even consists of some long shots. Secondly, the car chases scene sequence. That's definitely the highlight of the movie. If you've watched Edgar Wright's previous movies, you can already imagine all the action in it. Mind you, they're all real. Well, at least most of it. Edgar Wright has confirmed that the movie only uses 10% CGI for the stunts, which means most of the stunts are done on set. Which in today's standard is a highly unusual choice but you can see why. It makes the scenes more authentic and an absolute guarantee will make the movie timeless in a few decades.The only negatives from the movie for me is the antagonist and the climax. To me, the choice for the main antagonist isn't strong enough for me. They presented a good choice for them, but the final reveal is just not to my liking. Also, the climax action scene aren't as strong as other Edgar Wright's movie. It feels a bit anti-climactic in a way. I feel like the movie could do a little better for the conclusion.But, all in all a pretty good movie. It's what you would expect in an Edgar Wright movie, action, comedy, good choreography, awesome cinematography and scene transitions, a simple settings, good storytelling and a bit of a romantic subplot. If you love The John Spencer Blues Explosion, Simon & Garfunkel, The Foundations, The Beach Boys, Queen, Beck, REM, Barry White or Danger Mouse, then this is movie for you. I dare you to not be entertained by this movie. Cause it's very hard not to be.END OF REVIEW.",Baby Driver
433,roblesar99,Wright Delivers Another Winner,10,22 June 2017,"Wow. Baby Driver might just be the best film director Edgar Wright has ever crafted. An exhilarating ride, Baby Driver serves as a showcase for Wright to combine everything he's learned in the director's chair up to this point, from quick-witted humor to high-octane action sequences and everything in between. Over twenty years in the making, from the first frame to the last, Wright's film fires on all cylinders in a glorious exercise of style.The film follows Baby (Ansel Elgort), a young getaway driver with tinnitus who constantly plays music to drown out the sound. To be fair, I wasn't quite sold on the film when I first heard about it. While I was intrigued by the premise, I didn't know quite how Wright would pull it off. But after the fantastic Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy and the criminally underrated Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Wright has knocked it out of the park for a fifth straight time, something I should have never doubted was possible. While I've heard other compare the film to 2011's Drive (but funnier) or 2016's La La Land (but with car chases), I actually think they're doing the film a disservice. Only Wright, a unique talent who continues to solidify himself as one of today's best directors, could have conceived of the spectacle featured in the film.Gone are the quirky British settings of Wright's previous films, with the whole of Baby Driver set in Atlanta. While I was a bit skeptical about this change, seeing as how a major part of my love for the films of the Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy had been their setting in England, Wright immediately sets the tone from the get-go, opening with a thrilling bank robbery sequence that includes a well-executed long take. The pressure just builds from there, as Wright crafts chases and shootouts with technical flair and superb skill. Bill Pope, who previously collaborated with Wright on The World's End and Scott Pilgrim, captures the proceedings beautifully, his superb camera-work showing through every scene. Visually stunning, Baby Driver is a wonder to behold on the big screen.Perhaps the most impressive of the film's many technical aspects is the editing, handled expertly by the duo of Jonathan Amoss and Paul Machliss. Wright's carefully curated soundtrack works perfectly in conjunction with whatever's on screen, allowing for the film to develop a unique, energetic rhythm unlike anything I've seen. And as for the soundtrack itself, it's one of the film's many assets, with Wright mixing songs both new and old to great sonic effect. Additionally, Wright makes sure that every song serves a purpose, allowing each one of them to shine.Baby Driver, however, isn't a conventional action film by any means. Remember, this an Edgar Wright film after all. The way the story unfolds allows for more than a few twists and turns that managed to keep me enthralled. Additionally, I was surprised that a supporting character's presence was entirely left out of the trailers. Considering marketing's propensity to leave no stone unturned when it comes to a film's trailers, it was refreshing to see that was not the case here. While I won't spoil who that character is, I will say that they help ground the story by providing an emotional tether for both Elgort and the audience that becomes indispensable the more I think about it.While the film undoubtedly belongs to Elgort in the lead role, who does a tremendous job acting opposite so many established stars, I was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed Jon Hamm's role. Hamm simply owns it as Buddy. While Jamie Foxx might be more of a scene- stealer as the unpredictable Bats, it's Buddy that truly kept me on the edge of my seat. However, Foxx shines as well, delivering a performance entirely unhinged and yet, wholly believable. As for the rest of the cast, Lily James shines as well, bringing a lightness to the proceedings that provides a nice balance to the hardened criminals that make up the rest of the cast. Kevin Spacey atones for the sins of Nine Lives here, as the leader of the criminal outfit that Baby drives for. Spacey makes for a great criminal leader, delivering another electric performance in a career full of them. And Eiza González, who plays Buddy's wife Darling, turns in a solid turn as well, fierce and sensual in equal measure. While a slight part of me wishes that certain cast members had received more screen time, I do commend Wright for presenting a straightforward story that does not stumble over its own excess.As for the story itself, some might be surprised to find that Wright's focus here isn't so much on the humor, with the film having perhaps the darkest tone of all of his films. Whereas in his previous films, the death of a character was usually treated with humor and levity, the stakes here are definitely higher. However, make no mistake, the clever writing that has shaped each of Wright's previous films remains intact. While Wright's emphasis does shift a bit more towards delivering genuine thrills than I was expecting, he succeeds graciously. But both the thrills and humor are all in service of one thing: Wright's script. And with his script, Wright accomplishes his goal of delivering an entertaining, rollicking crime romp complete with a fantastic soundtrack and well-rounded characters.Wright is simply at the top of his directorial game here. His directorial trademarks, from the way he handles transitions to the sublime usage of visual storytelling, are all here and put to splendid use. But above all, Baby Driver is kinetic entertainment, a bright spot in an otherwise mediocre summer movie season. I walked out of the theater feeling electrified, eager for another opportunity to see the film again. Simply put, Baby Driver is the most fun I've had at the theater in a long, long time.Rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",Baby Driver

435,Mohican15,"Action-packed, Cool, Funny & Totally Brilliant!",10,24 November 2017,"Whatever the plot, whether it's a zombie or robot invasion, a action-comedy cop spoof, or a crime drama about a getaway driver called BABY. One thing's for sure, since it's Edgar Wright, it's gonna be a fun ride (pardon puns!) and with BABY DRIVER, it certainly is a both fun and brilliant ride! BABY DRIVER is quite simply one of the best films I've seen in 2017 if not the best! It's gripping, exciting, romantic and really FUN. In my opinion it's Wright's best work, period. Everything about it is pure genius: the script, the plot, the scenes, the characters, the action and of course the soundtrack! Baby Driver does owes some of its greatness to it's killer sound track which really kicks the film on wards and combined with the amazing script, creates scenes which are a little similar to something out of La la Land (only with more guns and shooting). I would've liked some Bowie or Hendrix but that's just me! Like I've said, the script is AMAZING and transforms the film not into your average heist movie but into a much cooler animal! It's a romance, comedy, musical (only without singing, but dancing instead) and, it's a thriller too! There was serious tension in this movie and I was gripped from the beginning and held at the edge of my seat! Wright really excels with this movie in both his writing and directing. Each scene is laced with killer dialogue, often brilliant music and great performances too! It's a heist thriller like no other and was a real joy to watch. Wright directs such a BRILLIANT cast too and combined with the story and script I ended up hooked but also REALLY caring about the characters. The cast in this film is on FIRE and every single member is on top-form! The two main leads, Elgort and James are simply wonderful to watch and share REAL screen chemistry! Their musical romance is simply enchanting to watch. Elgort is Baby and he delivers a strong, authentic and really enjoyable performance. He cares so much for Deborah (James) and his Foster-Father and is the typical lovable rogue who wants to get out of ""the game"" but is too far in. He drives like a legend and dances like Ryan Gosling (only better!). Lilly James is the movie's heroine Deborah and before I saw this movie, I was NOT a Lilly James fan, but after her first few minutes on screen, I have to admit that I was smitten. She's adorably charismatic, authentic and yes, sexy. She plays a sort of Juliet but more tough and is really a heroine that you can fall in love with. The rest of the cast really delivers too. The great Jon Hamm delivers a brilliant, strong and charismatic performance as Buddy but his character's certainly no Don Draper. His gangster wife (Darling), Eliza González also delivers a charismatic performance and her and Hamm share a dark and passionate chemistry as well. Jamie Foxx as always delivers a VERY charismatic performance as the violent thug Bats and is another gripping presence in this movie. Finally, Kevin Spacey reminds us that he is still a very fine actor and delivers a very strong performance as the brains behind the operation: Doc. He plays someone who is a hard criminal mastermind but he also has a softer side and cares for Baby almost like a son or nephew. All of these FANTASTIC factors push the film along it's tense and exciting path to the finale and I must say I LOVE the way Wright pulls it all together. He ties up all the loose ends and at the end you feel happy and satisfied and feels like the film has ended perfectly. I REALLY LOVED this movie and would seriously recommend to anyone. Wright has once again shown us that he is a very fine director and can make a darn good movie!",Baby Driver

437,EephusPitch,"Brilliant, but ho-hum.",7,6 July 2017,"Okay, so I watched Series One of Spaced last week. I watched Hot Fuzz last night. I pretty much have Shaun of the Dead memorized, word for word, camera angle to camera angle. I got myself fully into the Edgar Wright Zone. Tonight, I saw this film on the big screen, my first Edgar Wright big screen experience since seeing World's End for the second time. And it was fun. Lots of chases, lots of gunplay., lots and lots of Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Hamm chewing up the scenery (although, it must be said, not enough of Flea with his prosthetic nose). The soundtrack was brilliant, and warranted by the plot. So why do I feel let down?The problem, I think, is that on some level I expected Edgar Wright to do something more with the form. All of the actors do very well performing their roles, but all of them are playing basic stock characters: the Innocent Kid who has been coerced into a life of crime, his crippled Foster-father trying to keep him on the straight-and-narrow, his naive, wholesome Love Interest, the sinister Mastermind, the psychopathic street wise Gangsta, the sociopathic Whiteboy thrill seeker with his sultry Moll, etc, etc. All well and good, but all something we've seen before.With Baby Driver, Edgar Wright proves that he can make a heist/car chase/shoot 'em up movie as well or better than any other director.

439,gimili3979,Baby Driver is a heist movie about being conflicted,8,16 September 2017,"What is the movie Baby Driver about in one sentence? A young man who becomes a criminal and does not want to be a criminal any longer. Baby Driver is a movie about being conflicted. It is worth seeing, but might leave you questioning the meaning of the story. It is a great movie that I thought had a very good moral lesson. The problem is that in order to get to the moral of the story you have to first get through the film with its many plot holes, questions, and cartoonish criminal characters.What makes the movie unique is that the main character Baby has a constant ring in his ears. To drown it out he plays music off his iPod and throughout the film we are treated to his song choices. The viewer is literally listening to whatever Baby is listening to at an given moment. The way the scenes are linked up to the music is one of the best aspects of this film. The best chase seen in this film does not even require a car. The trailer really hypes this film up with the cars. This is NOT a car movie. It is NOT a driver movie either. It is a crime/heist movie.The viewer is never really given much more than a small sentence about how Baby became a part of his criminal group. He owes the leader Doc. That is it. And because of that it is hard to understand the aspect of confliction with the main character in this movie. This is unlike the heist classic Heat, where the criminals make no apologies for who they are. In the movie Heat the criminals are professionals in their minds and what they do is what they do. It is their job. In Baby Driver, the criminals are idiots and you are constantly wondering why Baby ever agrees to work with any of them. He has to work with them but he does not have to work with them?? This is actually a question you will come away with while watching this film. There is a quote that comes up in this film that I guess was supposed to be the moral of the story? But I really could not understand what the moral of the story was supposed to be because I had never been shown how Baby ended up where he was now at his age. I liked the ending because at least it was somewhat real life. Baby's words to Debora are what this film was about in my opinion. Director Edgar Wright said everyone will have their opinion of the ending and its meaning. Many viewers will end up debating the meaning of how the movie Baby Driver ends.The film is unique because you see the world through Baby Driver's music. But that is through his ears and not his eyes, and after seeing the movie, there were parts of it that left me feeling very confused. Or was that the point?",Baby Driver

Either the street talk is Jamie or he found a role that was made for him but he was ""Bats"" who got what he deserved. But to add on the music was phenomenal and was place just right for the scenes. This is a movie I didn't want to end. Or I wanted it end with Baby and Debora to ride off in the Mercedes BUT on the other hand he did commit a crime so he should be punished and the movie ending really delivered.

The marrying of sound, songs and visuals is of an outstanding beauty and originality!If like me you enjoy the unrelenting excitement of the recent batch of Fast And Furious films then you will love this film too. And this sprinkles a bit more viciousness on top from its characters as well. This film is just cool as F@$%!The music chosen works brilliantly throughout.The car action is jaw dropping. The performances from all the cast are great, the only change i would have made was having Griff(Jon Bernthal) play the Bats character instead of Jamie Foxx. I found Jon Bernthal to be way more menacing and threatening like the Bats role demanded, but thats not taking anything away from J.Foxx, he made it work too.I highly recommend this film for people in search of adrenaline pumping car action sequences, some pumping gun battles, some badass criminal characters in that pulp style and for people who don't mind a hint of romance in the vein of films like True Romance, The Getaway, etc, as it works brilliantly in this too.Highly original, never been done before and unless they do a sequel will never be done again i reckon, so do yourself a favour and go watch it.10/10",Baby Driver
447,LaLaLandSucks,A Rather Mediocre Flick,4,1 July 2017,"This movie is a mess. The action was hamfisted and mediocre. While the stunts are okay on a professional standard, they're horribly shot and edited. There were so many quick cuts in this film. I understand they are trying to sync with music, but action scenes are nothing when YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. The tequila scene gave me Tak3n syndrome and it was god awful. The story is very simple/mediocre typical story. All characters are archetypes of 70s - 80s action flicks. They're very one dimensional and it's just not original. The film takes a lot of influence (both narrative and visuals) from 1978 thriller The Driver. Lots of shots of vehicles closing in, drifting, pov shots, rear views, inside shots, etc. The main character is even a mute, but he's autistic and has tinnitus for the sake of being an annoying plot device. The music was the most annoying part of them all. They just put in some crappy pop and rock old music and try to be all hipster. This film starts with one of the most autistic and cancerous scenes I've seen all year. It was worse than the entirety of La La Land. It was cringeworthy bad. There is a bait and switch in the film that ruins the rest of the 3rd act. Jamie Foxx is basically killed off and Jon Hamm's stupid booboo starts playing Rambo at a point blank range. It's stupid stuff characters do like that that gets themselves killed. Then, Mr. Buddy blames Baby for the reasoning why his stupid wife died. From that course, we get an over the top performance from Mr. Hamm as the main villain. Baby of course kills him. The ending is your typical cliché happy ending.4/10.",Baby Driver
448,bonsai-superstar,Unwatchable Dreck,4,30 July 2017,"Horrendous. Incredibly cheesy opening scene (hmm, bank robbers dressed in black suits walking in slow motion at the same time - never seen that before!). Then we're treated to what passes for cinema these days: a ridiculous, CGI-based Crank/Fast and Tedious clone car chase. But the most insulting of all to the audience is the main character: a bland, autistic dolt constantly prancing around like an idiot, wearing stupid-looking Ray Bans: ""Hey, I've got an idea! Let's take Tom Cruise's ""Risky Business"" dancing, Ray Ban-wearing fool and put him behind the wheel! He doesn't need to have any character or really personality - audiences today will lap this crap up because every other movie is a cartoon or comic-book CGI fest! Those characters don't have any personality, and audiences flock to the theater in droves to see Avengers 17 or this year's Spiderman ""reboot""!"". I guess they expect the audience to identify with this clown ""Baby"" because the creators of this film assumes today's audience members are just that: children.

449,Kazombie,Not too bad a film but a huge let down due to false IMDb ratings,5,24 July 2017,"Heist movies seem to be the rage these days. Well, heist and superhero movies. Whilst Free Fire was an entertaining and somewhat funny film, Baby Drivers fails at that. The plot is predictable, the story has bigger plot holes than the tire rims used in the souped up cars during car chase scenes. John Hamm's character turns swiftly from a suave and smooth bank robber in to the Terminator that makes little sense. He fails to achieve his purpose.Jamie Foxx on the other hand did justice to his role albeit it was lukewarm due to how his character has been written in the script.Soapy romance that tries to make heroes out of Bonnnie & Clyde and makes a martyr out of Kevin Spacey for no good cause other than to give the film a happy ending.By far, this is Edgar Wright's weakest. I was expecting Hot Fuzz's quirkiness and dark tone, Shaun of the Dead's hilarity and The World's End's absurdness. I got none of that from this film. Fanboys will give it a 10 while I shake my head in disbelief.5.5/10 at best.",Baby Driver
450,rs403404,Style Over Substance,10,29 July 2017,"Style over substance. It's a term thrown around when defending a film that has artistic merit in visuals but lack a strong story. The films of Michael Bay and Zack Snyder frequently get this defense. The reason why that defense fails is because those movies are actually style with no substance. Baby Driver is an example of a style over substance movie.I can literally break down the entire plot for you in this review without fear of spoiling the movie. A young man (Ansel Elgort) finds himself indebted to a criminal (Kevin Spacey) and has to commit crimes to pay off the debt. Eventually he's clear but he quickly finds that getting out from under the criminal's control isn't that easy. Of course, the young man meets and falls for a girl (Lily James) who reciprocates and becomes involved in the chaos. Not only did I not spoil anything, it's the same plot as about fifty other movies.That's where the style comes into play. Director Edgar Wright fills this world with characters that are more than just one-dimensional plot contrivances. The young man, called Baby, listens to music almost none-stop to drown out a hum in his hearing he got as a child. That music is the film's soundtrack and frequently leads to scenes playing out like music videos but it always feels natural. Flowing from story to music video seamlessly. That's style.Added to this, is the fact that Wright also throws a lot of curveballs into the standard plot of the movie including some skillful bait and switch with the person who ends up as Baby's main antagonist. The cast all embody their characters. Elgort holds his own, but the supporting cast still shine. And when that support includes Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Jamie Foxx it's easy to see why.Despite this impressive star power bringing their sizable skills to play, the real talent that shines here is Edgar Wright's sharp script and clever direction. I wonder how much of this was brought over from his work on Ant-Man. I do find it interesting his first film after leaving a superhero heist film is a heist film.And even though the film's origin may be an interesting tale, it ends up being a moot point. All the matters is the final product, and the final product is something really special that stands with some of Wright's best work (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and Hot Fuzz). That is exceptionally fine company with which to stand.",Baby Driver
451,reoroy,Edgar Wright has reinvented himself with this marvelous piece of work,9,2 August 2017,"I saw Baby Driver last night and I can assure you that my love for Edgar Wright has gone up a few notches. Edgar Wright never ceases to have fun with his experimental film-making technique. Until this film had released, he had made brilliantly funny films. So from that perspective, this movie is a slight departure from the kind of cinema we've been expecting from Mr. Wright. Baby Driver is in fact a relatively serious film but at the same time the elements of fun and excitement are not missing. Edgar Wright has skillfully concocted an interesting plot which is centered in the cut-throat world of robberies.The central character is that of a wheel man who is obsessed with music. The music assists him while he drives robbers to and away from the scenes of the crimes. You might have seen Ryan Gosling play a wheel man in the film Drive. What makes Baby Driver different from the Ryan Gosling film is that music plays a crucial role in this film. It complements Baby in more ways than one. I admired Baby's chutzpah and his daredevilry. The escape sequences are so beautifully choreographed that I thought I was sitting in front of a giant computer screen and playing an extremely sophisticated and realistic version of Grand Theft Auto. And all the action happens in Atlanta, United States of America. So I guess this is the first time Edgar Wright has made a feature film on American soil. He has also partnered with Sony instead of Universal.This movie is certainly one of the best heist films I've seen this year and Edgar Wright has reinvented himself by resorting to a story-line that is unlike the ones he has dealt with before. As far as the actors are concerned, everybody was great but I liked Jon Hamm's character the most. And the soundtrack of this film is a character in itself. Seldom has a robbery film felt so poetic. My ardent advice to you would be to watch this movie on the big screen as soon as possible. Make watching Baby Driver your utmost priority. It will liberate you in unimaginable ways",Baby Driver

454,eden-rabatsch,Best fun film of 2017,8,17 July 2017,"Edgar Wright is a modern alchemist. He is able to use all of his great technique to confect these cinematic sensations from hybridising horror and working class comedy in ""Shaun of the Dead"" to mashing a rom com with a video action film in ""Scott Pilgrim"" and finally with his latest chimaera, a musical, yes you read that right, with a top notch heist thriller. That unholy mixture is breathtakingly arrogant and he just about pulls it off. The plot is the stuff of a million genre flicks. Good guy criminal is forced to do jobs and work with people he doesn't like but he will soon be out. Sure, the focus is on the getaway driver but even that we have seen from Ryan O'Neal in ""The Driver"" all the way to a few years ago and Ryan Gosling in ""Drive"". The twist it is not about the plot. Wright's genius is the prism through which he tells that story and it will come as a shock that much of this film is closer to ""Singing in the Rain"" then ""Heat"". So we must talk about his cast because if anyone can put an ensemble together it is Edgar Wright. If you look at all his earlier films there are breakout performances scattered everywhere. It is easy to forget that he selected Brie Larson to play Envy Adams who five years later would be receiving an Oscar for Best Actress. In this film he has plucked out Ansel Elgort as the eponymous driver and what a find. I recognised Elgort from the Divergent films but in this he is a charisma explosion and moves so silkily that I would be surprised if he hadn't trained as a dancer. Elgort is paired with Lily James who I thought was underwhelming in the BBC production of ""War and Peace"" but here she is great concoction of innocence and hometown sex appeal. And what a voice! The rest of the cast is a who's who of fantastic actors: Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Bernthal. Jon Hamm and newcomer Eiza Gonzales do a twist on Bonny and Clyde and steal all their screen time. This is easily Hamm's best film role of his career and shows he has some post Mad Men life in him. In the end, it all comes back to Wright. The film is, especially at the beginning, too postured and not as organic as ""Scott Pilgrim"" but I think like ""LaLa Land"", Wright had to establish what type of world we are entering. It might explain that a lot of people are saying they are enjoying the second viewing more than the first. In my experience, it took almost the first act for the film to find its feet and then it exploded as a mixture of music, great editing and clever amalgams on known film tropes. This is one of those films that cannot be analysed: see it and experience the wall of sound and action that is Edgar Wright and ""Baby Driver"".",Baby Driver
455,NormanCroucher,Bland and generic heist film with nice visual tics,3,30 October 2017,"Edgar Wright riffs on Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' but packages it for teenage audiences who like things to happen faster and with less logic. Once you scratch beneath the shiny surface of 'Baby Driver', what you are likely to find is a totally unremarkable (sometimes nonsensical) story elevated by its director's hyper-energetic visuals and an all-star cast.It was probably a mistake to throw the young (and rather charisma- free) Ansel Elgort up against such a strong ensemble of far more experienced and talented veterans like Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. These guys are all on their A-game here, even if their characters have walked straight out of the storage warehouse for Heist Crew Members For Hire. Elgort is, frankly, a bore to watch on screen which is made worse by the fact that he is playing a man of few words. Lily James, as his love interest, is equally as dull. In that respect, they are a match made in dreary young actor heaven. Almost all of their scenes together are a slog, not to mention that their romance is totally unconvincing, and that is a fundamental problem because their love story should be the emotional throughline of the piece, helping to raise the stakes and anchor our sympathies. It is a failure of both the bland lead casting and unimaginative writing.The soundtrack choices and Wright's trademark visual tics help to boost the momentum of individual scenes and set-pieces, but Wright cannot disguise the lack of invention elsewhere in his storytelling, no matter how convoluted and haphazard the plotting gets. This is so generic and familiar at almost every stage that nothing comes as a surprise and only minor quirks in character behaviour and dialogue set it apart. Haunted hero with a tragic past? Check. One last job? Check. Heist goes wrong? Check. Macho bravado creates conflict within the crew? Check. Hero's helpless love interest threatened? Check. It is a smorgasbord of crime film clichés and tropes, without much attempts at subversion. Even the car chases look pretty standard in a time when franchises like 'Fast & Furious' have already cranked things up to Spinal Tap-levels of 11.This is the very definition of style over substance and its complete lack of originality and reliance on the oldest clichés in the book make it an overall disappointment. One could argue that 'Baby Driver' is a celebration of cinematic crime stories, from 'The Driver' to 'Point Break', and if that is indeed the case, then I'm sorry to say that Edgar's party sucks.",Baby Driver

457,gonzallanca,Dynamic,9,19 August 2017,"Baby Driver or Baby: The Apprentice of the Crime A talented driver, Baby (Ansel Elgort), a criminal gang, headed by Doc (Kevin Spacey), want to get out of this criminal life to have a normal life with Deborah (Lily James). Let's start with the actors. Ansel Elgort falls like ring to the finger to this movie, I couldn't imagine anyone else doing this role. As with Kevin Spacey, because the character she plays... is Kevin Spacey. Is the interpreting itself. Is this wrong? No... is the best part of the movie. Like Jon Hamm, the best of the film. The film is super hyper dynamic, you cannot close the eyes at any moment in the film. Or if you do not have to re-read it. A great direction, under the command of Edgar Wright, which forces you to look at all the time the screen. The action is dynamic with a very moving story, and funny sometimes. What makes a movie many enjoyable. The music in impeccable. Impeccable With the protagonist. With the action. But in some moments of the movie I drowned the music. But I think that was the idea. But to me it bothered me. If you are going to see a movie that I have a very deep meaning in a movie, this is not such a film. With this comes to see how to kill Kevin Spacey a bunch of times, not to win the Oscar for best film. Dynamic 9/10",Baby Driver
458,Danielpotato,A mixture of a film that sometimes works and sometimes don't,4,16 August 2017,"I recently watched the new Edgar Wright movie - Baby Driver. And I can say Edgar Wright's great passion for cinema by placing so many references into this movie with ""parts"" of his favorite films. But when the references become the film itself, the film loses identity and becomes just a collage without personality, being thus a inferior movie to the films that inspired it. There are so many references to other movies that this ends up getting annoying to watch the movie itself. References to Heat, Goodfellas, Bonnie and Clyde, Ronin and many other movies. Stuck in your face almost all the time. A hassle.Yet, there are good times here, especially stylized action. But the characters were written in a stupid and chiché way, who in the third act, apart from Baby and Debora, the audience loses interest in the characters (it is irrelevant if the characters die or live) .Especially the character of Eiza González - Darling, who in one scene, throws herself forward into an entire police squadron just to get shot stupidly and just to give the script a reason for her boyfriend, Buddy to go after Baby and Debora and want revenge for the death of his stupid girlfriend. A cheap motive to start the third and final act of the film (which only has violence and zero intelligence in the script of the film). Yes the movie is loaded with stupid moments, like the personality change of Kevin Spacey's character. That character throughout the movie has a cold relationship with Baby and when the script needs him to help Baby escape from Buddy, magically he changes his personality and he decides to help Baby. Just for the plot convenience.Yet the chemistry between Baby and Debora and the good acting of Jon Hamm, Ansel Elgort and Lily James helps to keep the interest in the film until the ending (and give me a reason not to only give 1 for this movie). Even counting the stupid moments of the characters, the exchanges of personalities of these same characters, the badly applied clichés, unnecessary violence and the excess of references to other films on the part of Edgar Wright. Interesting to see once, but I will hardly ever see this movie again for the film itself and not for the countless and unnecessary references.",Baby Driver

The style is what brought it out. Substance honestly didn't matter in this movie, since it's meant to have a central ""musical car race"" theme to it. It may be getting a bunch of terrible weight under it for it's non-substance just like I said. Average story, average crime stuff. But the editing and music. That's the thing this tried to reach as the ""emotion.""Making a great story isn't supposed to be integrated into every single movie. This brought theme and ultimate driving. The driving scenes were perfect, accompanied with the music to show the perspective of how the main protagonist deals with his criminal world. And when he rejects it, more hardcore and tough situations and music lights up to show more struggle. So in technical cinematic terms, this is basically a masterpiece. Acting was great. And the ending wasn't really good, but it's still worth a watch from the legendary Edgar Wright.",Baby Driver

465,TomTomH,"So what happens when you mix a music video with a mediocre action movie? You get a strangely fresh, audacious and sassy crime musical from the director of Shaun of the Dead",7,6 July 2017,"As I watched Edgar Wright's Baby Driver, another movie came to my mind in comparison: Nicholas Winding Refn's Drive. These movies are in many ways different but are both about getaway drivers with strange names. Despite its visual style and all the talent involved, Drive disappointed me personally due to all the over-hyped acclaim from critics and its excruciatingly slow pace all the way through. Baby Driver makes Drive look like Battlefield Earth. This is a movie with enough fun and originality to tick the boxes off to becoming one of the better summer blockbusters of 2017. After his clashing involvement with Ant-Man, Edgar Wright is back on track again, even though this isn't his best work.Here we have Baby, a getaway driver working for a mob boss with a gang of rivals, but he has a special trick up his sleeve he has compared to the others: he can listen to music for 24 hours straight and while he drives, playing different songs that demonstrate the mood that he feels at every moment. He comes across a waitress named Debora (played nicely by Lily James) who he starts to date, but then a final job pops up in the pipeline that causes everything going for him to be sacrificed. Some plot points feel familiar here, but it is the superpower-like idea of music that gives them a shakeup. Had it not been present, the movie would feel unoriginal obviously, but the cast may have saved it from becoming a disaster. Who knows and who cares? What we have here is good enough.This is writer/director Wright's first film to be shot in the United States, which feels like a risky detour for his filmmaking roots, but the end result is, after his four-year directorial absence since The World's End, he luckily hasn't skipped a beat. This is his most unlikely film since Scott Pilgrim vs. the World but is thankfully and once again a very good, if not quite great, feature. You see and feel his love for music and cars, but his trademark style is often hard to find. There are no comedic scene transitions (probably as this isn't billed as a comedy) in the editing and his frantic camera movements have dialled down slightly, which makes his latest feature all the more interesting and experimental.The other thing that makes this a different Wright movie is the use of an all American cast: Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Lily James, you name it, a bit of a Tarantino-like collaboration going on. Elgort is flat-out amazing as Baby, conducting an often expressionless character but with a confident brain. He has the heart of an old school heartthrob in the music scenes and is engagingly subtle in the more intense scenes. Spacey is as good playing an average mob boss as he can ever be, while Foxx is on fine form and Hamm is what you can expect from a cut-throat mob rival as he pulls off rough facial expressions.To call this a Mamma Mia! for people who didn't like the 2008 hit would be an understatement. Car chases and shootouts are present, but songs in the background give the crime genre a layer of soul, creative juice that has been thrown off so often by bleak atmosphere and bloody violence. There are a few long takes of singing that try to compete with the musical numbers from La La Land but with already published lyrics. Whenever the songs are absent, the film descends into action thriller territory and leaves you yearning for the next cue. When they're rolling, the film is a music video stretched to feature length.While starting well and ending with hope, it drags slightly midway through as it bogs down telling the story in a serious manner, and the final showdown feels a tad formulaic, forgetting to be original like the rest of the movie. But they are saved by a jazzy atmosphere and nicely chosen songs (look out for Queen). It isn't as wacky as Scott Pilgrim nor as funny and iconic as the Cornetto trilogy, and the cinematography and costume design are nothing special, but what you can safely say about Baby Driver is that it is not a noisy and soulless migraine like the rest of modern action flicks. It has a brain, confidence at influencing pop culture and, finally, a bit of pride for writing and directing in the action genre. Now that's really saying something.",Baby Driver
466,mtrburrows,"It's good, but not Edgar Wright good",9,31 July 2019,"Baby Driver turns out to be Edgar Wright's blandest, most forgettable film yet, as much of his directing flare is pushed aside with the main gimmick of the film placed primarily on the notion that the action is edited in time with the music. This is a fun gimmick for sure, but is it enough to keep me invested? Am I going to remember it 10 years from now? Definitely not.Edgar's normal talent of visual storytelling and progression is nearly gone from this film, as is the memorable, witty, relatable main character, as Baby, apart from having tenitits, and being a remixer, is by far his blandest protagonist yet. In fact, the rest of the characters are bland too, with a cliche group of crooks, with Jamie Foxx's character being the most over the top, predictable, and least interesting of the bunch, and Kevin Spacey being another typical stern mob boss character, who takes a complete 180 in the climax for the sake of the narrative, which there really isn't anything to - the story feels empty. Nothing of note happens here, and that'd be okay if the characters were memorable, but they just aren't. Not to mention the completely undeveloped love story embedded in here.While I could contently watch it again due to the well edited action, and John Ham's performance, Baby Driver is definitely Edgar Wright's least interesting project yet, and really doesn't have a lot to offer in terms of character or plot.",Baby Driver

Baby Driver has outstanding acting, great direction, stunts that are terrific, and a story that glues one to the screen, but I did not find this movie fun. Why Baby Driver absorbs the viewer into a world of crime that is quiet disturbing to me.Since this film makes the story come alive, it is very believable. We get to know the characters and have a feel for them. Baby is the driver in this crime outfit, and he is clearly the only sympathetic person in the crime group. Baby is a good person who is a great driver.. The criminals are evil, plain and simple. That evil is shown in many ways that we understand. Those outside the crime group are not evil Those people are normal and have the characteristics of normal people. There is the girl friend a truly likable person. There is the older man that Baby lives with who has a disability that Baby learns to accept and further he learns to help with. There are people that baby meets on the street who are also normal. And these people are contrasted with the evil group in a way which is extraordinary. This is a drama, a deep and personal drama that is portrayed as an action picture. While it does have great action and stunts, it is first a drama. Deep and personal and in some ways very dark.I was under the impression that this film was going to be total ""fun"" but it was not in my opinion. This is a film that contrast good and evil in a special way. The cars move through Atlanta fast and glorious. There is this stunt and that stunt, but to me this is not about cars and stunts. (although that is what it seems on the surface)This film is about people and its main character, Baby, who is a driver for this crime group. While the crime group is clearly evil, Baby is not. Baby is basically good. How Baby deals with this contrast and the consequences of it in his life, is the essence of this film.",Baby Driver

And if you read my review of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (10/10), I said that the movie was everything I wanted out of a movie. Well, Baby Driver surpasses that. Cause Baby Driver is, with no doubt, the best movie I've ever seen.Everything in this movie is perfect. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is wrong with this movie. It succeeds at absolutely everything. It is a masterpiece from start to finish.The action is great. Some of the action scenes is better than the others, especially the first and last. The last action scene is the highlight in the movie.The music is perfect. The way the music combines with the sound effects is just complete gold. This is another thing I would do with a movie, if Edgar Wright had not done it first.The soundtrack is good. I actually love the soundtrack. It's everything from Queen to Focus to Egyptic Reggae. It's perfect.The casting is amazing. Ansel Elgort plays Baby with perfection, the boy who likes to listen to music 24/7, he sometimes combine the music with the actions to the others at the team, he doesn't like to talk, he likes to record conversations, and he's traumatized of an accident he had when he was little. Everything, except the last one, sounds exactly like me. He's also fast in his feet, and likes action, and always thinks about others before him. He's a very cool guy. He also falls in love with the waitress from the movie Waitress (a movie I haven't seen or heard of), played by Lily James. And then you have Bonnie and Clyde, played by Eiza Gonzalez and Jon Hamm. The loving couple who tries to protect each other and hurt everyone else. And then you have Jamie Foxx playing Jamie Foxx, a violent team member who isn't quite like the others. Kevin Spacey plays the boss who has faith in Baby, until the end. You'll see what happens. Other roles is played by Flea, Paul Williams, and Jon Bernthal (who probably died).But then again, nothing wrong with this movie.

I feel that despite the also craftily executed car and foot chases, the true sentiment of this film is that of musical premise, a grand salute to the soundtracks of our lives and how it will always be the underlying spark behind each of our underlying under-estimated and under-utilized personal motor controls. Effectively and romantically, Baby Driver achieves what it sets out to. Rest assured rev heads and action lovers, this is not some Glee Club fantasy film.. in my opinion its roots are far more grounded.",Baby Driver

Despite being a good driver, he gets into plenty of trouble due to his disability of being a stupid person.I've seen heist movies before, and there is more than fast car chase scenes. There is smarts. You don't change cars and then drive like an idiot and blow your cover once again. You don't drive around in a car full of bullet holes. You don't go full stupid.I mean all the issues aside this was pretty good, would been rated higher if it didn't have this much stupidity in it.",Baby Driver

483,summerinertia,The Emo Generation,2,19 November 2017,"One of the worst of the '2010's cop movies exploiting the successes of Dirty Harry, French Connection, Freebie and the Bean and Bullitt, as Edgar Wright's Modus Operandi seems to be too rip off various genres and present a generic version of it with some stale jokes thrown in. These were probably role models for the commercial formulaic productions of Wright's rampant ripoff machine, as I like call it, in which a meaningless, contrived plot is disguised by interminable car chases and a loud abrasive soundtrack. And without Simon Pegg anywhere to be seen, all that's left is the unoriginality. One of the chases was probably staged to show off Ansel Elgort's Emo attitude, which were admittedly quite Emo. What little chemistry there was between him and the rest was swamped by gross overacting, meaningless banter and over-the-top yelling. The filmmakers couldn't decide whether to make a comedy or a police action drama, and failed miserably on both counts.One to be avoided.",Baby Driver
484,Miasmakoala,A bit too long ending doesn't ruin this awesome movie,8,28 May 2019,"Edgar Wright's sense of style is just excellent. I loved the movie from start to the near end. All the scenes are audiovisual candy and the character interaction is so much fun. The cast is great and they dedicated themselves to their characters very well. I burst out laughing several times through the movie. The soundtrack is one of the better ones I've ever heard.My only complaint is just that the movie really should've ended with Jon Hamm falling into the flames. Jon Hamm endlessly coming back was a bit comical in the wrong sense. I don't think that Baby would be so stupid that he'd turn himself in after killing people and doing several armed robberies. Five year prison sentence was very generous on him ""just because he was nice"". It'd been perfect if Baby and Debora would've just driven into the sunset and roll credits. It'd fit the personal style of Baby Driver perfectly.Nevertheless, this was really one of the better movies I've ever seen, I'll give this a very solid 8/10, maybe even 9/10 on rewatch.",Baby Driver

The acting and actors are very good. To many movies waste to much time trying to make you care for the love interest the way the the main character does when really it's an obvious movie troupe , it's one of the big reasons i like this movie. That being said the movie still has heartThe last 3rd of the movie does take you out of a joy ride of a movie this is but not enough to dislike it. Also i'm pretty sure every heist movie either ends with everyone getting away or ending where most (including) the main character dies. This movie gives you both and is the reason the last 3rd is a bit messy but keeps the action going at a fast pace that it doesn't really give you time till after the movie to think about the short falls of the movie.Overall it's just a fun movie.",Baby Driver
486,ddangtruong23,Not a single human being was identified,4,20 March 2021,"Despite a full cast of human actors, there is not a single character in this movie that acts like an actual human being.It says a lot that despite my hatred for the actor in real life, Kevin Spacey's character is the only one I can stand watching in this movie. Because his character is the only one that at least makes a little bit of sense and expresses himself like a human being, and not a walking cliché.The two lead actors Ansel Elgort and Lily James are the biggest offenders. Everything comes out of their mouths either sounds extremely fake or is completely void of emotions. You could have told me that they weren't English speakers and that they didn't understand anything in the script, and I would believe you.Baby Driver is a typical case of a film having too much love for itself, to the point that its style becomes a gimmick and the movie loses all charms. The first 10 minutes or so were cool, and I was into it, but then I kept hoping for something more to happen, I was waiting for it to make me care about something, but it never got there. It just keeps playing off the same tropes and bores you out of your mind.Compare this to Edgar Wright's Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy and its flaws are even more apparent. Hot Fuzz and Shaun of The Dead also employ the same tropes and styles, but they also feature characters with stories that you care about and feelings that you can relate to. This has none. Everyone in this movie is just quirky for the sake of being quirky. I wouldn't even describe them as weird or insane because then at least they'll be interesting. No, this whole movie and its characters are just quirky.",Baby Driver
487,good-decision,Good but definitely not amazing,6,5 July 2017,"I found this movie to be very entertaining although lacking in brains. I wouldn't pay to watch it again or buy the DVD but for a one time watch it was more than alright.. just don't take it seriously and don't expect much in terms of depth, the Pianist, Ocean's Eleven or even Fightclub it is not! The movie builds up Baby's character to make you feel a huge and massive twist in coming to prove Baby is actually smarter than he looks. Bummer. Doesn't happen. The last third of the movie falls flat with the typical predictable stuff you already knew was going to happen. The love story was a bit too naive for me with no substance and a bit boring. The relationship between Doc (Kevin Spacey) and Baby is the most stupid Hollywood cliché shifting for no reason at all from a logical extreme to an illogical different extreme. Now that I think about it, not a single relationship in this movie seemed real apart from the disabled foster dad with Baby. Those were the scenes that gave the movie depth and beauty. Other than that, take the car chases away and you got a road traffic of a movie to watch. The dialogue and writing in general was below bar especially for Jamie Fox's character. As to why Kevin Spacey chose that mediocre role, I'll never find out. I think the writers of this movie set out writing the coolest getaway scenes with the coolest getaway driver in town then towards the end ran out of ideas.",Baby Driver

489,bryno92,Was expecting more,6,14 September 2017,"I went in this movie not knowing anything about it other than the fact that it was probably going to be a bank robbery type of movie. Now it had that, but it was simplified. The action scenes had a comedic aspect to them that just didn't feel right to me along with a lot of action happening behind closed doors. It does make sense since he is a driver and can't see what's going on, but there was one scene where the camera purposefully gets out of the way so we can't see. It really takes out the suspense in everything, which would've added a whole lot more to the movie.This movie could've been so much more had they not gone the comedic route. Unfortunately though, nothing was believable because of that. You have cops coming out of nowhere and action scenes that are unrealistic. I guess a big mistake of mine is comparing it to the movie Heat, because that's what I was expecting from what little I knew. It was still a decent movie with an interesting story, but it falls short because it resorted to comedy for the action sequences. If you go in not expecting Heat or A Dog Day Afternoon, you may enjoy it slightly more than me.",Baby Driver
490,Mackiatoe,"Slick, witty and immensely enjoyable",9,29 June 2017,"I left the movie theatre wanting to drive like Elgort, aka ""Baby"", drives in this film, listening to the music that he listens to while driving in this film. If that isn't what any great car movie makes you want to do, then it isn't good enough.Baby Driver is the best automobile based movie flick in years, seamlessly combining stunning action with a great story and a stellar range of characters. Every part of this film was fun to watch, every character had their moment; the whole film was like a buzz.Like many other films in Edgar Wright's excellent back catalogue, Baby Driver takes its influences from all sorts of places. At its core, it's a classic ""one last job"" action movie, mixed with a teenage romance and set against an urban crime back drop. It's like a GTA-themed rom- com, only with a GTA style soundtrack and none of the luvvy-duvvy stuff you'll find in a romance film (save for the single best use of Barry White I've ever seen in the diner shootout scene).Speaking of the soundtrack, the song choices are inventive, smart and used impeccably well. Whether it's Baby's dancing, the songs used to characterise his affections for Debora, the way the gun shots are edited with the music or how they're used both by the characters and the film to make the action sequences more thrilling, it is nothing short of a stroke of genius. I had to stop myself from singing along to Radar Love, while the choice of 60s soul classics felt like a subtle nod to the musical choices of many-a Tarantino film, and it felt very appropriate in setting the ""this is cool"" vibe needed to complete the film.I was particularly impressed with the style of characters. Baby is a really original idea, and the perfect excuse to fill the film with so many brilliant songs. Plus, his character development is well handled and well paced, and ultimately satisfying. Lilly James's Debora turned out to be far more interesting than I expected, much to the film's benefit, and plays an important role both as a possibility of escape for Baby and as the mandatory love interest, especially in the latter half of the film. Kevin Spacey's Doc was a perfect neutral character - the story kept you guessing who's side he was really on, and he was always enjoyable to watch, sporting some of the best lines and a black Mercedes S-Class which really suited his character. The rest of the criminals were also well written and well used, especially with how the antagonist of the film was essentially the lack of trust you could have in your fellow heisters, giving the plot plenty of freedom to make all of them equally dangerous to our antagonist. The slick writing really shines in the quieter scenes, but its the action scenes that stand out most of all. I'm sure every other reviewer has said something along the same lines as this, but it is so refreshing to see a car chase film that doesn't rely on CGI. It's even better to see chases that are shot and executed so well. The editing was absolutely masterful and easily some of Wright's best. The speed and tension was conveyed with utter dexterity, and it's a delight to watch.As a car enthusiast, the choice of vehicles in the film was particularly pleasing. Perhaps best of all was how each chase featured a different getaway car, which helped to characterise each scene far better. The Subaru in the first chase suited the narrow and confined spaces of the city centre, while the bigger, tougher looking Chevvy Avalanche reflected the grittier nature of the second chase. While it doesn't mean that any of the cars become characters in themselves, such as in the F&F movies, it makes the film feel very diverse and varied, something which I really liked.The one criticism I have is a stupid one. Baby got an original iPod for his birthday when he was still just a kid. I didn't believe that for a second!Save for that minor and completely subjective problem, Baby Driver is an outright success. Big screen thrills with an equally big heart, tasetful and beautifully filmed action and an outstanding soundtrack that is used to supreme effect. It's one hell of a good film for sure, easily one of (perhaps even THE) best Edgar Wright films ever and a new benchmark for car movies. I'm sure I'll be referring to it as one of my favourite films of the decade in years to come, and will no doubt be singing its praises in the meantime.",Baby Driver
491,breheneyjames,"Kinetic, thrilling and funny. Edgar Wright's best movie since Hot Fuzz.",10,7 July 2017,"Edgar Wright does it again with one of the best movies of the year thus far, Baby Driver, which concerns a getaway driver named Baby(Ansel Elgort) who is trying to get out of his life of crime working for a crime boss named Doc(Kevin Spacey) so he can move on with a girl that he meets at a diner named Debora(Lily James). The problem is there always seems to be 'one last job' and when the last one goes horribly wrong Baby has to rely on his skills to get out unscathed with Debora.The cast in this movie is stellar with the likes of Kevin Spacey as Doc, Jamie Foxx as Batts, Jon Hamm as Buddy, Eiza Gonzalez as Darling, Lily James as Debora and of course Ansel Elgort as Baby who all give fine performances. The script and direction are signature Edgar Wright with witty dialogue and fast paced, exhilarating action sequences.The car chase scenes really put you in the front seat and are set to a 'killer' soundtrack which features many great classic songs. The way Wright uses music in this film is unprecedented in that nearly every scene is set to the beat or flow of the soundtrack and it fits perfectly. There's only a small handful of scenes where there isn't any music and those are when Baby himself is not listening to music as we essentially hear exactly what he hears throughout the whole movie. As Wright himself put it, he wanted the audience to be both 'Baby's eyes and ears' and he succeeded wildly in doing that.To wrap up, Baby Driver is one of if not the best movie of the year so far and will likely feature in a lot of people's top 10 of the year lists. It's also Edgar Wright's best movie since Hot Fuzz.",Baby Driver
492,Tkbn3812,Kinda overrated; what really makes this film stand out as an action film?,6,4 January 2018,"Baby Driver has been remember as one the best action movies of 2017. And yet, once the hour and half had passed and the film had finished, the only word I had for the movie was disappointment. I had high hopes for the film; it's a standard car action film, centring around a driver nicknamed 'Baby' who works in a crime heist ring, helping to pull off jobs as the getaway driver after each heist. It's a typical premise, and yet it's made quite fresh by the music, with each scene choreographed stunningly to each song, and each song chosen to suit the scenes perfectly. And yet, I found myself quite disappointed on the whole by the film. First of all, it's not quite like a movie has never centred around music, especially older music as in this film, before. Guardians of the Galaxy is the first example that immediately comes to mind. This idea that Baby Driver is so 'original' because of its emphasis on music choreographed to the action scenes seems somewhat rubbish to me; I agree that it is done very well, and that it makes the film 'fresh', but I hardly think it makes the film unique in any way.This is the point I am trying to get at. Yes, Baby Driver is still a passable action movie. But by no means is it notably more original than other action films. The music, something that has been lauded by critics, is admittedly impressive, but what action film doesn't have music in it? And this is where I finally get to the plot of the movie; there's really nothing particularly unique about it, either. On the whole it's rather predictable; Baby gets essentially blackmailed back into the crime business for 'one last job', Baby has a tragic backstory, Baby falls for a girl, Baby begins to have second thoughts about everything...it's employing quite a decent amount of cliches.Okay, so a movie that isn't unique doesn't necessarily make it bad. All I'm trying to say is Baby Driver is just not as impressive as critics have made it out to be. Moreover, I think the bigger issue of the film is the plot rather than the originality.Without spoiling the plot of the movie, the payoff for one and a half hours leads to a rather dull climax and concluding scene. The whole climax is just such a disappointment for me, and it's kinda hard to say why without ruining the movie. Still, I feel like the plot's two main problems are its predictability and ultimate disappointment.I don't mean to focus on the negatives of the film. Don't get me wrong, the movie is good. Great acting is coupled with the brilliant music and amazing chase choreography. But the film just doesn't stand-out in any way for me. It deserves praise, because it definitely is a good action movie. It's just not 93% on Rotten Tomatoes good. Watch the film if you want a film filled with action. But don't expect a flawless work of art; as good as Baby Driver is, it's not perfect.",Baby Driver

Having spent a lot of time in Atlanta, this film acts as a love letter to the city. It's incredibly well shot and directed, with so many Easter eggs (including a Pierce Brosnan cameo) It has a very warming story, yet series and dark themes sprinkled all the way through, creating a well balanced, enjoyable action film. It truly is on of the better films I've seen in recent years, if not this decade. Only thing that pulls it down is the 2nd act.

494,nadeeshantennage,Great action packed wholesome entertainer with a problematic climax,7,18 April 2018,"The best thing about 'Baby driver' is that the flow of the plot manages to keep the viewer invested in the main character 'Baby' .
By which I mean that the scenes work out so good that it makes us feel Baby's insecurities and the struggle he has to go through in order to make the decisions he makes.
The action sequences are greatly directed.
There was no moment in the action scenes that felt illogical or unrealistic.
Combined with all of the above assets the film also gets benefited by its talented star cast including Ansel Elgort (The most compassionate character)and Jamie Foxx ( The most unlikable character) with their convincing performances.
The film also would serve strains of dark comedy.
The only negative aspect of the film in my opinion is its problematic climax

Pure fun!Baby Driver is a romp. The opening car chase scene is worth the price of admission in and of itself. It's one of the coolest chase scenes ever!! The best thing about this movie, other than the chases, is the Baby character. I'm a sucker for an understated hero and this really hits the mark. Baby is an introvert who loses himself in music. But he is also a savant of perception and has a quiet power that really makes him appealing. I could quibble about some points where the character writing was poor, but I'll forgive those points because the broad character is so strong.I had real problems with the casting of Kevin Spacey as the crime boss. The casting is so stereotypical and cliché. Spacey behaves exactly as you would expect such a cliché character to do. It would have been a much more interesting choice to have the crime boss be cast as A 22 year old rapper, a 15 year old gaming nerd, a foreigner from a developing country, or a heavy suburban female with kids type anything but the tired trope of Kevin Spacey the crime boss.This movie would have had a much higher rating for me with a couple EASY changes.SPOILER ALERT**********************1) The Baby's love interest is too much, too fast without them really having enough relationship development screen time together prior to them devoting their lives to each other.2) The movie has a double ending that is confusing and annoying. The movie ends when the couple drives down a country road. The credits should have rolled at that point. I would have given this film a way higher rating.

Where Drive succeeded in telling a mysterious, deep story involving romance and action at the same time as having a unique auteur style, Baby Driver falls short in every respect.

509,yaseenfawzi,"""Baby Driver"" Review",10,20 September 2021,"""Baby Driver"" is the latest directorial effort from acclaimed British director Edgar Wright. A getaway driver named Baby relies on his servitude to crime boss Doc for survival by participating in highly-planned robberies. Just when it seems like he is able to escape Doc's hold on him, Baby is coerced into joining one last job. This leaves him at odds with his girlfriend Debora and trying to deal with the highly aggressive gang members, putting everything Baby knows and loves at great risk.Wright's screenplay is filled with such snappy and witty dialogue, while also turning many of the cliches of the heist movie genre on their head. Early on, the scene where the robbers dress in Austin Powers masks because of a confusion between Mike Myers and Michael Myers from ""Halloween"" is a clear enough indication of how subversive and wildly off-kilter the humor is throughout ""Baby Driver."" Part of the appeal in Wright's movies, especially his Three Flavors Cornetto trilogy and ""Scott Pilgrim,"" has been to put a fresh spin on a well-worn genre, whether it be survival horror, science fiction, or even video games, while never losing sight of character development. Wright also makes effective use of scene transitions, especially with fading in on a record player and during a chase scene. He and cinematographer Bill Pope implement lighting that displays a hint of '70s flair and give the world these characters inhabit a sense of geography and familiarity that is neatly crafted within every plot point.The rock/R&B soundtrack, featuring the Damned, the Commodores, T. Rex, Carla Thomas, and Beck, among many fairly obscure others, along with the titular character's namesake as performed by Simon & Garfunkel, is nicely built to heighten the action set pieces, develop the characters, and advance the story. One of the finest examples of this is in a gunfight set to the tune ""Tequila."" The editing in this sequence, and the rest of the film, is tightly packed and has such a fluid flow that there's never a sense of plot or characters being glossed over. Ansel Elgort, in the lead role of Baby, masterfully underplays most of the heavy emotions, keeping in line with his conflicted life-goals between participating in the crimes with the gang, meeting up with his girlfriend, and tending to his elderly, deaf caretaker Joseph. There is also chemistry between Elgort and Lily James as Debora. The supporting cast, including Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, Eiza González, and Jamie Foxx all bring a great deal of passionate energy to the table, with Spacey and Foxx easily being the stand-outs.

511,The-MacMahonian,You Spin Me Round (Like a Record),8,5 July 2020,"Old DC and Marvel superheroes, you may recall, used to have space age/cold war sci fi explanations for their powers. Superman fell from another planet and Earth atmosphere gave him superpowers, Spiderman was bitten by a radioactive spider, and so on. There was one exception: Batman. No radioactivity, no alien forces, no nothing. His excuse was childhood trauma. Baby Driver is not a superhero, except when behind the wheel, but in that respect he follows the Batman school.Baby Driver is the 5th feature film directed by Edgar Wright, he of the famous, entertaining but otherwise unremarkable Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy (2004-2013), here revealing unsuspected talent.Baby Driver tells the story of Baby (Ansel Elgort, showing promise as heartthrob) ace (understatement of the decade) driver who suffers from tinnitus since childhood, when a car accident killed his quarrelling-when-driving parents and left him as sole survivor. He exercises his near-superhuman driving skills whilst listening to an impressively comprehensive pop/hip-hop soundtrack, since he also developed lip-reading skills, so one could say he is at all times both aware and aloof. For vague but dramatically sufficient reasons, he is being blackmailed by bank-robbery mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey, par for the course) into being the getaway driver in a series of jobs, which he performs half-reluctantly till he finds, guess what, True Love, in the person of diner waitress Debora (Lilly James, adequately endearing), compounding on his reluctance and ensuing that (spoiler alert) the expected obvious happy end doesn't quite materialize.Baby Driver may not be the first attempt of film language at visual dub/R&B/rap/hip hop, but it is surely one of the more seamlessly accomplished, pace here or there superfluous twirling camera movements. More relevantly, both as drama and as thriller, its heart is in the right place, namely, all over the place. Baby´s tinnitus is an obvious metaphor for the way he interacts with the world, obvious but nonetheless unobtrusive as it devolves us the way we interact with the moving image.David Bowie, I might have quoted in the past, famously wrote: ""do you wonder sometimes about sound and vision?"". Yes, sometimes.",Baby Driver
512,esthercross,Edgar got this one 100% wright (dya see what I did there),10,24 July 2017,"There was an infectious energy about the film the moment it started. SO many films have opening scenes which have my mind peddling hard to try and become absorbed by the story but with Baby Driver, I didn't have to put any effort into getting completely and utterly sucked in!It was definitely like watching a musical without singing numbers and the beat and theatrical choreography of the film felt like something I hadn't experienced before. I think whilst the film has a cracking script I thought that what the film explored most was ulternate forms of communication outside of scripted dialogue. There were poignant and humorous moments with sign language and often the lyrics in the songs would say something of a scene the actor wouldn't have to.It is a familiar feature of Edgar Wrights work to max out on visual communication and it was great to see Baby Driver upholding this trade mark. As an audience member who is not a natural fan of the car chase genre, I was actually very taken with the action in this movie it was very exhilarating and creative. The characters are so well written and watchable, it makes the stakes and tension much higher when experiencing them engage in an intense car chase. This film has many experimental uses of music and it's truly refreshing to see this kind of innovation with film making.Kevin spacey has great presence as usual, his characterisation was deliciously layered and has a suave atmosphere about him. I also enjoyed the energy of Lily James' performance it had a buoyant innocence about it and she was great to watch. I've often heard it said that Edgar wright has a presence in his films almost like an extra character and it is very true in the case of Baby Driver. You can almost feel him conducting the film as it flows and cracking jokes from the back seat.",Baby Driver

Certainly worth watching.",Baby Driver
515,SmashandNasty,"Fast Cars, with less fast cars and more plot",9,23 May 2017,"It's Fast Cars, with less fast cars and more plot; the movie cares more about the soundtrack than it does the cars on screen and more about the plot than it does stringing together driving sequences. The film is an absolute trip from start to finish, with all the action and sometimes over-the-top violence you might expect, toned down considerably by the character-driven plot. Elgort is a truly delightful male lead who —with a touch of charm, innocence— brought the humor needed to temper the less-than-savory company he keeps.The supporting cast is also no disappointment. Jon Hamm (Buddy) found the perfect follow up film to Mad Men playing an angry criminal, head-over- heels in love with his wife, Darling (Eiza González). Jamie Foxx embodies bat-sh** crazy as Bats and Spacey plays a very familiar type of criminal mastermind (he's basically a chubbier version of Frank Underwood). Jon Bernthal (Griff) is more of a cameo than an actual cast supporting cast member, which is surprising and a bit disappointing.Silly name aside, if you like any of the cast members, heist movies, good music, fast cars, quick plot turns or Edgar Wright's brand of action this is certainly a film worth seeing.Featuring: Brogan Hall as Samm, reminding us all that it is, in fact, the #YearOfTheChildActor and notable allusions to some of the greatest films of all time: Monsters Inc. and Little Rascals.",Baby Driver

518,hatsunemiku-27340,An Instant Cult Classic,8,11 September 2017,"The summer blockbuster season is upon us which means it's the perfect time for studios to release loud, overproduced, underdeveloped action films to the waiting masses. Sitting in the theater as Baby Driver was screened I could hear the bass thump of Transformers in the theater next door, sounding as if World War III had broken out as a natural disaster took place. And I couldn't help but think if it's that annoying on our side of the dividing wall, how annoying is it inside? And then I stuffed that thought because I was watching Baby Driver and enjoying the hell out of myself.Baby Driver is Edgar Wright's (director of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) latest film starring Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx. In it we follow a twenty-something year old getaway driver named Baby as he tackles his final jobs and begins to adjust to a normal life only to be pulled back.I call Baby Driver a gem in a sea of turds and opened with a complaint about summer blockbusters because Baby Driver may be overlooked by the general movie-going crowd in lieu of Transformers or the upcoming Spider-Man film. It's had a relatively modest ad campaign, word-of-mouth discussion of the trailer and advanced screenings has garnered interest. But aside from perhaps being overlooked, it's also an action movie that isn't loud or full of CG, it has a competent script and involves you in a way that the vast majority of action films do not.Case in point: The very opening scene. The scene tells us everything about the style of Baby Driver. First of all: the music. Baby Driver could arguably be considered a musical. Nearly every scene has background music and most of the action whether it is gun play, driving, or just mundane tasks matches the music. The sound of money being stacked on a table coincides with the beats of the song being played. Gunshots do the same in another sequence. It's a level of technical prowess that is jaw-dropping and left a smile on my face throughout.Secondly: the action. The opening sequence bank getaway had me at the edge of my seat with adrenaline pumping. I haven't sat in a theater and felt that way since The Raid 2 three years ago. The direction is wonderful, the cuts are perfect, and the stunt work is stupendous. Add to that a good amount of humor and some intelligent situations and solutions and you have a short but sweet sequence that would make a James Bond film jealous.The movie continues to have fantastic practical stunt work throughout, though after the initial robbery, things slow down. There is another robbery but otherwise you spend about sixty minutes watching Baby's life normalize. He meets a girl at a diner and they hook up, he lives with a mute elderly man and you see their relationship strengthen, he begins work as a pizza delivery guy. It's a very typical character arc and you know from the moment we get into the mundane that it's a precursor to things hitting the fan.The unevenness of the middle portion might turn off some viewers. There's humor and good music but the promise of gripping car chase sequences is dashed by a human element that is somewhat unexpected given the over-the-top nature of the first twenty or thirty minutes. The romance is compelling if only because Baby is a tragic man who you can identify with and want to see escape the criminal life.Once Baby is pulled back into criminality and the big job is planned, the film goes back to being fast-paced and action packed. The adrenaline is there, but so is a very dark dread and suspense. A lot of pretty obvious things happen that intermingle Baby's attempt at normal life with his criminal life and though a trope seen multiple times before, Edgar Wright manages to make it fresh and leave us at the edge of our seats. Will Baby escape this life? I won't spoil what happens but it's a hell of a ride through those final thirty minutes. Just when you think its over, it keeps going, ratcheting up the tension. It's immaculate execution.And as the credits rolled and I stood up, a smile on my face, I watched the old people file out of the theater, frowning or talking about how bad the film was. I guess they expected Baby Driver to be like Baby's Day Out or something.This Fourth of July weekend, go see Baby Driver. It's one of the tightest films I've seen in recent years with a great script, amazing action, a kick-ass soundtrack, interesting characters, and a director at the helm who knows how to make a beautiful and powerful piece of cinema. A definite action masterpiece and I'm sure an instant cult classic.",Baby Driver

The newcomer who plays Baby holds his own with all the veteran actors and the music is subtle but so prevalent, it's like it's a character all its own. The stunt driving was really great.

520,admcdonough,Best Car Chase Scenes Ever,8,3 July 2017,"This film brought me back to memories of some of the great car chase scenes from films like Bullitt, the French Connection and the Seven- Ups. Really awesome car scenes here and there are many of them, not just the one great scene we got in those films. And the score had some great songs in it to (really loved hearing Carla Thomas's B-A-B-Y). The performances were top notch with Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey having a lot of fun as bad guys (Jamie was particularly menacing) as did Jon Bernthal and Paul Williams in briefer roles. Ansel Elgort in the lead and Lily James as his romantic interest delivered solid performances. Eliza Gonzalez steals every scene she is in and we'll hopefully be seeing a lot more of her. The ending was the one part of the film that to me fell short and why I can't rate this even higher. But this is action packed exciting entertainment. The car scenes are worth the price of admission just by themselves.",Baby Driver

Baby Driver is Edgar Wright's latest film and folks it could be one of his best. ""Baby"" is a wheel man and he is the best bar none! Ansel Elgort steals this film as Baby. Sporting his shades and donning ear buds to play his personal theme song(s) that drives him to be the best. The film has an incredible cast. Jamie Foxx,Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzalez are a crew of thieves and leading this dysfunctional family is the great Kevin Spacey. These characters are nothing short of ""monsters"" and the smallest insight to there backstory that has shaped them into what they have become. This film is based on rhythm as in sound from music to gun shots to dialogue and the mannerisms of the cast are exceptional and Edgar Wright directs this gem with style and flavor. The romance angle while in most heist films are totally irrelevant and hard to pull off Ansel and Lily James could carry the film on there romance.

So i don't know if there was a lot of hype cause i see a lot of Ratings and Reviews here so it must have been very popular. Anyway i had it on my watchlist and when i watched it, it came as a nice surprise to me!Where to start? The cas is very rich to the point Bernthal is not even secondary role-and he could because he has very little screentime-. Baby's relationship with his step dad is adorable. I liked his hearing gimmick and the music added a lot of points to the movie, especially the late chase song choice was on point. The weird stuff with the mixtapes were also good.The romance was nice, kind of cliche but in a good way. Fox's crazy character acted as a secondary villain next to Spacey and Elgort carried his weight nicely as a protagonist. The heist sequences were well executed, as were the chases and the drive scenes.In a suprising twist, Spacey's character held up his end of the deal in the end and then some more, as he sacrificed himself for a good cause, something you don't see very often from these type of people! And Karma can be a b*itch but it can also be rewarding and it was very satisfying that in the end the good deeds that Baby did and kept his good character made a difference in court.It was a fun and entertaining movie in various ways, the action was there, you have a few laughs along the way and overall i think it's very enjoyable for its specific kind. 9/10",Baby Driver

530,fast-giga,artistic value for the sole purpose of artistry is of no use,2,14 September 2017,"The movie is one of the most hyped movies of 2017. It promises interesting characters, driving action, and most importantly something new compared to the average AAA Hollywood productions. While it is definitively true that the movie is different...that in itself is not enough to make it good, or even to be interesting. And truth be told, it is neither. Edgar Wright tries soooo hard to be unique for the purpose of being unique that he forgets that other things like Story are important too. It feels like Edgar Wright believes he is above the need for such petty things as a coherent story, logical behaviors or, god forbid, unpredictable twists.Music: Yes, the soundtrack of the movie is good, really good. It's like a two hour long mix-tape. But that's something you can find on spotify. Having moving pictures only as a background for good music sees rather unnecessary.Driving/action: Well, the driving is slightly more realistic than Fast&Furious franchise. But it is also quite boring. I would recommend the first 2 Transporter movies instead. In fact, the driving feels too artificial. Like, after the director started shooting the movie he found out that it NEEDs to include driving scenes because the name of the movie says so. And then he just put them into the movie without any concept to them. On the one hand Baby is supposed to be a really good driver...on the other hand most things look like plain luck. Acting: OK, THAT is one plus point of the movie. The acting is really good, from all actors.===Spoiler=== Story: Basically the movie changes direction when the group of thugs enters the dinner of Baby's girlfriend. He wants to stop them, but fails. The reason for his failure to stop them is a plot whole. Which is especially annoying since it is the ONE important decision. He wants to separate his personal from his thug life, so when they ask him why they shouldn't go into the dinner he doesn't want to tell them that is girlfriend works there. Which is obviously smart, but they don't accept his 'excuse' of the food tastes terrible there. The simple solution to this problem would be to simple tell them that he has been there before, and he doesn't want to be seen there during a job. That's it. No additional explanation needed. He could just keep on driving and that's it. Crises averted. Story failed. ===Spoiler end ===The movie just offers nothing of worth except its uniqueness and artistic value for the use of music. Quite often are the scenes perfectly aligned with the beat of the music. Great, get the guy who did the editing a price for his craftsmanship. Buts that's it.

All the characters were obviously conceived to be just types and, when they stick to their simplicity, they're great, but there's nothing more to them, they haven't got any real structure to stand up.

I'm a huge fan of car racing type shows and even though this isn't technically one, Baby does car race against the cops. I loved Baby's character and how he was portrayed and his little music making quirks. In terms of cute couples, I feel like part of me want to give the trophy to Baby and Deborah but there was just something so passionate about Buddy and Darling (I mean, that guy went nuts when she went down)The story was really nice. Nothing complex, no surprising plot twist at the end, or original, but there was something about the atmosphere of it that really made it feel unique. Extra points for the soundtrack. I'm not a huge oldies person but I really liked the songs that were picked out for this movie and how they were integrated into the story.

Truth to be told, 'Baby Driver' is a no-brainer for a die-hard car junkie, it's no better than a random Fast & Furious episode...which is bad. It's bad in terms of showing anything else than the usual stereotypes about driving & action and how they work together, contains little new or unique elements. But at about halfway to the runtime I realized the director probably didn't wanted to show anything like that to the audience. The characters are so ridiculously simple that they practically play no part in the movie - they are merely just tools for showing off mighty pop culture icons like an iPod, a Subaru Impreza, a cassette recorder or the waitress at a 60s style American restaurant. The list could go on for pages. And the music choices - well, they are brave, but I can say they worked out amazingly well - soundtrack is definitely the strongest point of 'Baby Driver'. So all in all this movie is a mirror to the societies of the last ~50 years. If you realize this, and that in fact it's still a pop-corn movie, not the nominee of an art film gala, you may be able to enjoy it - just don't concentrate on the story. What you want to watch out here are the items the characters use, wear, how they talk and the archetypes the actors play. It's about the details, not the big picture.",Baby Driver

If you like the adrenaline rushing through your body and lots of action, this is a movie for you. Having previously watched Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, I knew what to expect from Edgar Wright. Yet the movie really surprised me and my expectations were met, or even surpassed. Despite the movie itself being rather entertaining and not too deep, it consists of some memorable characters and quotes. Another element that makes this movie perfect is the background music, which unobtrusively matches with the atmosphere and pace in every scene.

I've only seen Hot Fuzz and wasn't a big fan, but the trailers for Baby Driver were really good and I just went in with an open mind.This movie is only as good as the lead character called Baby. I haven't seen Ansel Elgort in any movies but he gave a great performance as Baby and the character was great and relatable.He's a getaway driver for heists and always listens to music because of an accident that happened when he was young. The reason for him to listen to music is explained and a great reason and I love that he listens to a classic IPod. I had an IPod like that so that made it relatable and just Baby is a great character, so that really made the movie for me.Other than Baby, the rest of the movie is also great, I absolutely loved it, there really are no issues I have with it.So besides the main character, what else makes the movie great? Well, the side characters are really good as well. Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Lily James and so on, they're all really great. I totally believed the love story between Baby and the girl Debora. I honestly was afraid of that but they made it work perfectly.Another thing I loved was the soundtrack, throughout almost the entirety of the movie the score and the soundtrack is used and it works perfectly. They made it another character in the movie.Of course this is also an action movie, so the question is how the action is shot. Well, if you saw the trailers you could see some really cool shots there, the movie is no different. The style is great and luckily most of the action is shot with long takes and all in frame. I was so into the action because it was so well shot and it was practical. I have to admit that I don't know if they used CGI but that's the great thing, if there was CGI, I didn't see that it was CGI, so that's great.They also make the action line up with the music, and not in a way that it's stupid and doesn't work but in a very clever way that it only makes the movie better.So essentially everything this movie needed to do for me, it delivered, great action, great characters, great soundtrack. It's an extremely fun movie, I had a blast with it, it's my favourite movie of the year so far and I hope that there are movies to top it because that means this year will be awesome.

The whole film feels so natural and there's little added extras like the lyrics of the songs being on sign posts, the pavement and walls when Baby goes to get coffee after the first job.It's even got a small twist where the film makes the audience believe that Bats is going to be the main protagonist in the movie but it turns out Buddy is. The film is so well made, Edgar Wright is known for being style over substance but this was a perfect film for him, the use of the music throughout is so clever as you can feel every emotion that Baby is feeling and the songs contribute loads to that. The driving sequences are flawless and not cut to pieces like most action films nowadays! For instance, when Baby just through the back of an open mini van, it's one clean cut shot where the cameraman comes out of the mini van. In films like the Fast series, that would be cut about 50 times!!The casting as well is perfection, John Hamm as Buddy is just played to a T and it's nice to see him in more of a darker role than what he is used to playing, Jamie Foxx as Bats is the kind of role that suits him well, just a crazier version of him in Horrible Bosses. Kevin Spacey as Doc is just typical Spacey, commands the screen every minute he is on it. Ansel Elgort as Baby is fantastic, you feel for him and the mistake he made as a kid and that he is being taken advantaged of massively, he just wants to take care of Joe and run away with Debbie. Every emotion on his face you feel and sympathise with. They all looked like they just had a lot of fun with the roles which is great to see on screen!",Baby Driver
542,Astrid_523,"If you are a music lover, it's your action film.",8,15 May 2019,"A perfectly done combination of music and action, Baby Driver it's Edgar Wright's baby, as it was on the works for about two decades. I like his camera work and the long sequences are my favorite. Second act is a bit slower than the first and it kinda tones down the effect of the first act which is ka-boom! Still, a good, enjoyable movie with many well executed, fast paced action scenes. Bonus, it's full of good, really good music.
Don's miss it! 8/10",Baby Driver
543,Wizinator,I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE,10,7 January 2018,"When I saw this in theaters, I did not know what to expect. After it was over, my friend and I were amazed!! We were absolutely BLOWN AWAY by the acting, directing and cinematography. The opening scene is one of the best openings I've ever seen for a film. The soundtrack beautifully compliments the story. The more I see of Baby Driver, the more I love it!!",Baby Driver

545,FilmFanJordan,Thank You Edgar,9,22 April 2018,Edgar Wright's style has always been right on target. His unique and challenging approach to making films creates gems that are destined to become classics.I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the high-speed storyline.,Baby Driver
546,olivercase-83355,Simply Edgar Wright at his average level.,9,28 October 2018,"This film is great, I love the witty humor at times, I adore the characters and their interactions, the dialogue is very good and really well written. This film is exactly what you should expect from Wright. Every single actor and actress are great, even Kevin spacey acts quite well here (don't like Kevin, just his acting). Jon Hamm's role was exceptional and he was great in the role of criminal with a good heart. Ansel Elgort was the perfect choice for Baby and of course the soundtrack was perfectly fitting for this movies tone. Overall 10 BATS out of 10.",Baby Driver

549,greggs_nbacon,Wow Wow...wow,10,28 June 2017,"(Originally posted from confessionsofasavagemind.blogspot.com)The summer blockbuster season has become somewhat of a bore for me. The major films released this summer have been generic, bland, and unexciting as they can be. To prove my point, the fifth Transformers film was just released to audiences' and critics' dismay everywhere. During the summer, I rarely even find myself at the theater due to the little variety of choice and depth of whatever hundred million dollar tentpole film is currently plaguing every theater around me. I had even stopped watching movies almost entirely due to this fatigue. I am happy to say that Baby Driver is the film that rejuvenated my love for movies.Preemptively, I will tell you that I will give you no plot description of the film. I knew next to nothing about the film besides the fact it was a heist film. I highly recommend going into the theater with a blind eye to reading or looking up anything about the film besides the showtimes. (Yes, that means no trailers too!) I cannot possibly describe this film. Yes, it is a basic crime and heist film. However, it breaks so many genre conventions that it is unacceptable to disrespectful tot he film to refine it to one genre. The best comparison I could give is if Heat, Bonnie and Clyde, An American in Paris, Reservoir Dogs, and Drive had a cinematic orgy and produced this child. The film is so fast-paced that you can hardly breathe. The suspension of disbelief, or how much you actually believe the story that is taking place on the screen, is flawless within the film. I came into the theater with about a million and a half different thoughts running through my head, and every one of them was silenced when the lights were dimmed. In all of the quick action on the screen, the film makes time for a real heart and story in its pseudo-musical style. This is executed by some of the sharpest and effortless editing and cinematography that this film critic has ever seen.The casting in Baby Driver was absolutely divine. I cannot think of one character or actor who was misplaced or a weak link within the film. Writer-Director Edgar Wright delivers the sharpest dialogue and story of his illustrious career. That is saying something incredibly large coming from the director of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and The World's End. Wright cements himself as one of the best minds in cinema. I mourn for his version of Ant-Man that Marvel canned after the studio would not allow him the creative control he was used to. Wright has been working on Baby Driver as an entire project since 1995, aka the entirety of my life. To see his uncompromised vision come to the screen as a real joy. It is also a real message to producers to stay the hell out of visionary directors' way (I'm looking at you, Disney) Edgar Wright can not only direct any genre but spawn entirely new ones as he does with this movie.There are very rare occasions where a film can take me from cinematic nihilism to enjoying the true art that goes into these incredible pictures. I haven't felt a true joy from a film till the two or three times I saw La La Land. There are absolutely no faults with this film. It wins not only a perfect score from me but the (tenative) rank of the best film of the year.Score: (10/10)",Baby Driver
550,tandrasmiklos,When they want to make a cult movie,5,2 September 2017,"You can't make a cult movie just because you want to. Or can you. Well, for some reason this movies is just overvalued to be one - but at the same time it's actual value is a really meager average. I guess you could call it an anti-cult movie. Or a mainstream cult? WTFThis movie gives you really bad bad people who are good deep down. When they act crazy you can feel that the actors are just acting. They are not half as bad as they try to act as. Doc seems like he forces Baby to do the job but we never actually see much force. Bats seems bats crazy but keeps leaving huge blind spots to get killed. And although Buddy seems good he wants to get revenge for his love in the end. This movie just plays on stereotypes, bringing in cool narratives from our lives to give something familiar and reinforce our beliefs. The ""strong silent type"" kid that is a ""genius"" driver. An old stereotype (western hero) mixed with a new one - myth of the genius . The narrative that ""love redeems us"" or that ""love gives meaning"". The characters seem to be chasing money, but when Baby finds ""true love"" (again, a stereotypical narrative) suddenly opposition disappears - except for Buddy that wants to get revenge for his love. Even the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" love is a narrative. It's like this movie has no story just a bunch of cool narratives glued together for a barely coherent movie. Not to mention as a result, the dialogues are really bad, in my mother language's translation at least, haven't watched in English yet. Not sure if it's better in English, but I don't look forward to watching this again.",Baby Driver
551,jerzbouy-427-23672,So enjoyable,10,14 April 2020,"OK, so it was over the top and completely unrealistic, however it was completely entertaining and over way too soon. Top of my re-watch list. Before watching a movie I have to rent I always check out how it is rated. Seeing 8 stars with the highest percentage I was pretty sure I would like it and rate it about the same. I never thought I would end up rating it ten stars. Movies like this are for escaping and I was total lost in it.",Baby Driver
552,carlj12,"oh its an Edgar wright, so straight away we have to call it a great movie",7,23 July 2017,"Sorry, some spoilers in this.Look, I liked this movie, really I did. It probably wins best sound track of the year over Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. I enjoyed watching it, seeing the little Edgar Wright shots we have all come to expect from him (kind of like Sam Raimi) and I had a fun time watching it.... Then I started to think about it about 20 minutes afterwards and found a lot of plot holes, especially in the second half. A lot of flash, not as much substance.A lot of where the movie goes in the second half is kind of lazy writing to set up for scenes later in the movie and really, just a lot of non common sense going on. Best example is with the diner scene. Bats wants to go there and Baby is afraid of him hurting Deborah. All he needed to say was ""I got there a fair bit, they know me there. They could ID us if something goes wrong"" and simply drive on down to the next diner down the road. Just little things like that. Not to mention, also the reason they had to do that job that next day and the whole picking up the guns really didn't make a great load of sense to me.As I said, I did really like this movie, a lot of fun, well acted and well put together. But its not the be all and end all of movies or anything cutting edge or ground braking. Anyone who says it is, well, they need to take their fan boy/girl Edgar Wright glasses off. He is a good director, with a growing decent track record, but to lather his movies with praise as soon as they come out just because he directed them seems a bit much",Baby Driver
553,erinkay641,Fun Movie - Style Over Substance,7,17 July 2017,"I saw Baby Driver twice. The first time, I really left feeling ambiguous about it. I overwhelmingly felt like the lack of plot detracted from the quality of them movie. The second time I watched it, I actually enjoyed it. This is Edgar Wright doing what he does best. The movie is highly stylistic and almost the entire movie is set to music. The action, the dialogue, nearly everything is in time with a song or a drum solo or a guitar riff. The acting is good, for the most part. Kevin Spacey is always exceptional - he seems to excel at playing somewhat devious characters. Ansel is very charismatic, and though he doesn't actually speak much during this film, he still commands attention and you develop an affection for his character. My only issue is with his love interest. Debora is, as female characters tend to be, only there to further Baby's plot line. Their chemistry makes sense, but her complete willingness to run away with a person entrenched in a world of crime that she barely knows really bothered me. I still left feeling as though the plot was substandard, but it didn't really matter. This movie is not about the plot, it is about the experience. There are breathtaking car chase scenes and just generally excellent cinematography. The color schemes are poignant and deliberate, and the consistent music supplies the tone and pace for every scene. Overall, I would say this movie is worth a watch. Just don't go in expecting a heavily plot driven movie or a ton of character development.",Baby Driver
554,jonathan-harris17,All Style,4,29 January 2018,"Very much an Edgar Wright film - blazing eclectic soundtrack, wham-bam zippy high-def superhero-style cartoon action scenes and yet zero substance with the predilections of a bored teenager.The introduction, with their shticky choreographed-to-the-music with CGI overlays fascination, and Baby's ultra slick driving getaway for a bank heist, is entertaining enough as a distraction but not something that especially engaged me.And this remains it's problem as it attempt to deliver some kind of build up to the expectedly hyper 3rd act.The music-sync thing rather forgotten and Baby, whom it is implied is happy to drive getaway and has been for a while before the start of the film, moves on his conscious.The reasonable cast of actors have little to work with however when they are called upon. Space is vaguely threatening in his few scenes, Hamm a psycho in love (a la Clyde), Foxx annoying and Gonzalez a gun-toting Bonnie for a couple of scenes - in all, a set of barely two-dimensional characters.The denouement, where Baby forgets the cars and suddenly opts for the gun, a little bit the desperado (but hey, he's a good kid), is utterly ludicrous and like something out of a DC film.Stylish yes but utterly forgettable and not remotely engaging or well written.",Baby Driver
555,kygian,Good movie,7,15 November 2019,"The movie has a brilliant beginning and great music selection. Some scenes are very spectacular, the plot could be better in the second part.",Baby Driver
556,harinia,Why is this movie so over rated!,4,27 May 2020,Such a time waste. Wrong casting. Car stunts are just basic. It stay well but midway lost it's track.,Baby Driver
557,Holland_March,That music and style!,10,12 April 2019,"This film is just amazing. There is so much stuff in it. The style is unique in the best possible way. Take the HARLEM SHUFFLE scene for example, with lyrics plastered all over the set and the environment, in a way, following the music. Also THE MUSIC. It's outstanding. The music was perfectly chosen.
Okay, so what about everything else? Well... the actor who played Baby had such a style and coolness no one else bring. Jamie Foxx plays the insane Bats perfectly. Darling and Buddy were a good couple. And Buddy's turn once Darling dies is really well done. And for the little she is in the film, ""Debbie"" is pretty good. All in all... WATCH THIS FILM ALREADY!",Baby Driver
558,EugeneOL,Was he slow?(No),8,10 April 2020,"This is yet another classic example I would point to when I say that a film is defined by its achievements and not by its flaws.What Edgar Wright was able to pull off in ""Baby Driver"" was beyond impressive. I couldn't help but notice the amount of work he put in to sync everything in the film's universe to the music; the use of the soundtrack is super original and unique. You know generally which direction the story is going, but things happen in unexpected ways which keeps you on your toes. The film maintains a breakneck pace throughout as his films tend to do, and it never lets up from the opening chase scene. The cinematography, stuntwork and screenplay are all amazing and help distinguish the film's personality even more.The performances were all stellar; I only had a couple of issues, one being Jamie Foxx. His character was presented as a hard and crazy criminal, yet his performance seemed far too tame for this to be convincing. I don't exactly understand what the intent behind this was, perhaps it is something I can think about more on a second watch.My other issue was with Lily James as Debora. At times, it felt like she was reduced to this unbearably bland sidekick girlfriend character. Plus, she was given some of the most cheesy lines ever. This has way more to do with the writing than the actual acting, though.Another minor criticism I have, the last 15 minutes felt quite underwhelming. It seemed as though Edgar Wright had no idea how to resolve the story he had built up in a memorable way, and the end of the movie was just for the sake of ending the movie. Somewhat disappointing.Overall, though, this film is pretty amazing throughout.",Baby Driver
559,Bilse85,Really good movie especially if you like your music to go with it.,7,4 August 2020,"I really liked this movie. It has a special aura and I think the director captures that feeling very well when a song with a rhythm appropriate to the situation or the feeling comes up, all of a sudden you start to act like you are in your own musical or sometimes move or dance with it not necessarily thinking about others around you or include them in the experience. That exhilarating feeling of sharing a song with someone who appreciates it is also well portrayed. And not just among lovers or friends, but with strangers too.
I think the people who thought that the movie is just a video clip or all style and little substance were not getting these things. Fast and furious it is not. It is something that offers much more in my opinion.
I very much appreciated all the effort put into selecting the music and creating the accompanying scenes .
The main plot should not be taken too seriously but it is as entertaining as it could be. And I found the backstories of the characters more or less interesting. No fault there. The main irritating factor was the Doc and the way Spacey played it. But I will not dwell on it.
The other actors were enjoyable to watch. Lead actor was a discovery for me. Although a bit stiff I can see that he is multi talented. I really adored the little Samm played by Hall. He is going to be a big star I hope. Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx were absolutely stunning I wanted to watch them endlessly. Unfortunately Lily James was just a pretty face. I think she should have given more depth. I would've liked to see more scenes with Jon Bernthal as well. On the other hand Flea was a nice surprise.
To sum up, I think the movie is successful and refreshing, although not a masterpiece, a unique and cool directorial achievement which should be seen and enjoyed without prejudice. I can watch it again tonight! (And definitely discover all of the soundtrack )",Baby Driver
560,EuricSanti,The best Da** movie I have seen on 2017,10,12 August 2017,"The story is so well adjusted that any second counts. Since it's start to ... sorry no spoiler. The characters are awesome, the connection and development of each one of them really thrives the emotions to its peak. The most you are gonna enjoy is the last 40 minutes. Edgar Wright really got back from the dead with this one. The music selection to each one of the tracks is even more amazing. Thematic, emotional, intense but sweet. Each character is taken to its lower point but them taken to its higher point. The unexpected ending is what took me to the skies. Fully recommend it to everyone even for folks whom their kids has gotten a little rebels so they understand somethings about live.",Baby Driver

562,TwentyWasHere,A playlist doesn't make a movie...,4,2 November 2017,"The movies runs on the playlist of songs and nothing more. It lives on the selection of songs and creates short scenes accompanying them. But there is nothing that holds it together.Edgar Wright desperately tries to be Tarantino with this but he isn't close to being as talented as Tarantino is. All in all the movie wants to be edgy and cool, which makes it just uncool. The movie is like the annoying friend of your teens you don't wanna hang out with, but he keeps calling you and you give in now and then because he has all the cool new music and a car.The soundtrack in the end is better than the movie. Beside that this is a fluffy little crime thriller centered and edited around a playlist. And this is what people mostly rate: the soundtrack and not the movie.I give this movie 2 out of 10. Two more points for the song selection making it a 4 in the end. You are better advised to get the playlist on Spotify and listening to it while doing something else instead of watching this movie.",Baby Driver
563,cmpatterson-86493,Baby Driver (@cmp_moviereviews),8,17 August 2017,"Inspiration comes in many forms. Whether it be from a good quote, a page-turning book, or in my case, a classic movie. Edgar Wright has shown what it means to draw inspiration from films of the past to create something that is genuinely nonstop fun. ""Baby Driver"" is a film that demands and deserves multiple viewings, not only because of its technical brilliance, but also due to its commanding desire to make viewers smile at what's unfolding in front of them. From an editorial perspective, the soundtrack elevates and is very much a member of the story, the stunts are jaw dropping, and the attention to detail is masterful. We're likely to see the status of legend attached to the name Wright if this type of filmmaking continues to be a part of his already impressive filmography. #babydriver",Baby Driver

565,chestern-80136,"Highly stylish and great fun, Baby Driver lacks very little.",9,9 January 2018,"Going into this film, despite the good reviews I'd heard, I expected it to be a relatively generic action movie. Perhaps something similar to the 'Fast and Furious' franchise, with an interesting soundtrack. Upon seeing that Edgar Wright was directing it, however, I knew that wouldn't be the case. As the director of some of my favourite comedy films, I knew he would bring something special to the movie.To go back to my comparison to Fast and Furious briefly, Baby Driver's budget sits at 34 million dollars. Certainly a lot of money, but as far as modern action film budgets go, surprisingly low. In comparison, the first Fast and Furious's budget, released in 2001, is 38 million dollars. Since that, the budget has steadily increased until the most recent, F8. With a humble budget of 250 million dollars (making it the eighth most expensive film ever made) it's quite clear to see that Baby Driver is going back to basics regarding it's action. No more outrageous set pieces, instead simply a boy, his car, and his antagonists. Despite this, on Rotten Tomatoes, Baby Driver was the highest reviewed action film of the year.I wouldn't actually consider this film a comedy. That isn't to say it isn't funny; it is. The comedy wasn't invasive, and was never the sole purpose of a scene, unlike in many other big-budget movies this past year. Instead of derailing the plot, comedy is used effectively and sparingly, never showing up during tense moments. The film allows you to feel nervous when you're supposed to, and laugh when out of harm's way.The action in this film is fantastic, though I feel the chases are really the highlight. The car chases are not only thrilling, but smart. While Baby (Ansel Elgort) drives, you can actually see him working out what to do next, and how to go about losing his pursuers. At one point, there is a foot chase, which is also rather brilliant. Again, you can see the character actively thinking as he moves, and there is some impressive action exhibited throughout. The gun-play is, in my opinion, the weakest of the action elements. With that said, it isn't bad, simply without much originality or style. The characters act brashly, which is enjoyable, but I rarely felt tension when a gun was involved.Ordinarily, I might ignore focusing on such an element, but as it's integral to the plot, I shall briefly discuss the romance between Baby and Deborah (Lily James). As much as it pains me to say this, I feel it was probably one of the weakest elements. Much of it happens rather suddenly. For myself, however, it was saved by Elgort and James's chemistry together; their conversations were rather sweet, despite Baby's seeming difficulty to converse with the girl.Following this trend, I'll move on to the characters. While none of them are ever boring, they are all arguably one-note and rather simple. There's rarely much depth to them. Adding the depth needed to make them perfect, however, may have led to the film dragging and becoming boring. As it stands, I never found myself checking my watch. With that said, I still enjoyed each and every one of them; the actors all did a fantastic job bringing them to life. Funny characters can go on to be intimidating, then back to comedic seamlessly, and vice-versa. Discussing the actors, however, brings up an unfortunately unavoidable controversy.Kevin Spacey has recently been accused of many accounts of sexual misconduct. Regardless of whether or not these accusations are true, this may well ruin his portrayal in the film for you. If you are able to separate art from the artist, this shouldn't be an issue. For those who feel these allegations are too serious, however, I shall let you know his character isn't too prominent in the film. He also plays a sort of semi-antagonist throughout the earlier portions of the film. And if you hate his guts, *Spoilers until the next paragraph* you get to see him die towards the end, too! Rather brutally, at that.Finally, I have to talk about the music. Like many films recently, Baby Driver makes use of an unconventional soundtrack. Many of the songs featured are classics from decades past, and much like Guardians of the Galaxy, there's an actual reason for it. Edgar Wright even checked with James Gunn to be sure they wouldn't use the same songs in the then-unreleased Guardians of the Galaxy 2! Unlike the aforementioned marvel movies, however, the music is more than a novelty. The entire film revolves around Baby's music. Much of the action happens to the beat of songs, and many times the lyrics of a specific tune will match the scene in which it's featured. It also features a wide variety of genres, including, but not limited to, Rock, Soul, Jazz and some classic Pop. Baby (or Edgar Wright) has great taste.To conclude, I legitimately loved this movie. While it had a few issues, it was one of the most stylised and fun movies I've seen from the year, while also succeeding at being an effective action thriller. If you either don't believe or can ignore the accusations made against Mr. Spacey, I feel this movie is a solid 9/10, held back only by a few minor issues in writing. In fact, while there are certainly better films, this one has quickly earned a place amongst some of my favourite.",Baby Driver

If you either don't believe or can ignore the accusations made against Mr. Spacey, I feel this movie is a solid 9/10, held back only by a few minor issues in writing. In fact, while there are certainly better films, this one has quickly earned a place amongst some of my favourites.",Baby Driver

568,Shred_Master,One of the best movies of 2017,10,22 February 2018,"This movie didn't really get a whole lot of hype. I think I remember seeing the trailer maybe once in the movies and I'm a frequent movie goer. Thankfully though, it was a success, financially and critically.The story is of Baby, an expert car driver, who is paying his debt to a shrewd businessman (Spacey), who overseas a heist operation. Baby doesn't talk much but he carries one helluva stick, his driving skills. The movie is also all about the music. Just about every scene is shot in a sort of music video style, with all the action and movements of the characters going to the beat of the particular song that's playing. Baby was in a car accident as a child and got permanent tinnitus, so he always has music in his ear to drown out the ringing, which is why we as the audience hear a lot of music. The song selections are absolutely perfect and eclectic.The chase scenes are shot really well and manage to capture the intensity of being in a car that's moving fast, without the use of shaky cam or edits ad nauseam.The cast of characters is well put together. The lead is relatively unknown but he does a good job nonetheless. Then, you've got Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, Jamie Foxx and yes Spacey (yeah, I know it's cool to hate him now but you can't deny his acting chops).Every time I watch this movie, it gets better.

It is SO boring and pointless! The main character has tinnitis, but so what? Was that supposed to make him sympathetic? Newsflash to Edgar Wright, that didn't make him remotely sympathetic. This is a film about murderous criminals, but there is no clever Tarantino-esque dialogue or quirky characters here. I actually found myself become angry at the lame, utterly derivative plot. One scene that stood out as particularly unbelievable was the foot chase, when Baby is running from the police. He runs like lightening for blocks, through a crowded park, through multiple levels of a shopping mall, leaping from escalator to escalator, even stopping briefly to change his jacket. In real life, only someone running equally as fast, never losing sight of him, would be able to follow a run like that. Yet somehow, despite their heavy gear and guns, despite they're also chasing the two accomplices who took a different escape route, and despite the distinct impression that Baby has outrun them by at least a block or two, every time he turns around, throngs of police magically appear and spot him. Really poor, contrived staging!",Baby Driver

That this at least excels in some aspects. The chase sequences were pretty cool, and I would say a lot more plausible/realistic than many movies. Where you could see if someone was that good in reality they might actually get away. On a technical level it had a lot going for it. So I will give it that.The biggest disbelief in this film is the story. It's a bit silly. The main actor while he could dance, had good looks, and do a parkour move over the car. The whole time. I thought was a pretty terrible actor. Made me wonder who chose this kid for the role? When the love story rolled around, I could not wait for it to get back to the action. I suppose he would make for a good dj too. But not an actor.It was like Baby was trying to do a bad ass hip Napoleon Dynamite? The girl at the diner instantly became the most supportive girlfriend ever with very little history or investment to risk her whole life. But OK.The acting by the supporting cast was very good. But again the story is just silly. If the director would make an action edit, without the whole love story. Limited to just the kid driving the heist, not trying to act.Just the supporting actors, it would be good, maybe even a 7.4 How this kid got the leading role is beyond me.

578,dwgmartin-33760,Edgar Wright musical car chase movie,9,19 December 2017,"Baby Driver: an action comedy almost musical from Edgar Wright. Baby Driver is about Baby (Ansel Elgort) who is a gateway driver for some high end gangster (Keven Spacey) but wants to get out of the business to be with his lady love, but needs to do one last job in order to make a break for freedom and love- all to a kick ass sound track. 
Baby Driver hits the road and it's gone- this is a fast paced stylish action movie which unlike others is still smartly written and isn't so over the top that it's unbelievable.The music is at the heart of this movie though, and all of the action and driving sequences are choreographed to the music. It is a perfect blend of music and film that shows of the beauty of both. It even makes the simple action of getting coffee a joy to witness. Baby Driver is certainly not a pedestrian of a movie, it is an immensely enjoyable thrill ride from beginning to end; some movies are just meant to be enjoyed and this is definitely one of them, it also ends on a nice ambiguous ending leaving the audience to decide which is always much appreciated.I give Baby Driver an A.",Baby Driver

Your guy is younger and more innocent, and you picture Brad Pitt, who you have been watching on TV's Dallas, as your star.Along side Brad, you see Jennifer Jason Leigh, after seeing her in The Hitcher and Sister, Sister. She is the young heroine, a waitress. For the sinister mastermind, you envision Gene Hackman. And for the heavy, ruthless hard-ass, you picture Samuel L. Jackson, fresh from Spenser: For Hire. Throw in Mel Gibson as another heavy and a cocky ingenue Marisa Tomei (from the World Turns) as his moll.

582,ConallMcCormick,Does not reach its full potential.,6,13 July 2017,"I was looking forward to watching ""Baby Driver"" due to the fact it was directed by Edgar Wright; the man behind such great action comedies like ""Hot Fuzz"". He is a very technically astute director and some of the scenes in the film are quite impressive and action scenes are all exceptional. However, for the most part, I felt that a lot of the scenes were made to show how good a director he is rather than to the benefit of the story. In other words, there is great style but less substance; not to say that the film is devoid of anything substantial but simply that it is not up to Wright's usual standard. The film feels more of a stylistic action movie which has comedic elements rather than an action comedy. It doesn't have equal emphasis on comedy and action in ""Baby Driver"" whereas ""Hot Fuzz"" does. It's a slight change from Wright's usual work which perhaps explains why it didn't work as well.I found the music gimmick for Elgort's character Baby quite interesting. People will draw parallels to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", due to the use of music by the main character and connection with his mother, but I feel it stands on its own merits. I don't think the soundtrack is to the same standard as ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (yet music is subjective of course) but the application is fine and there are a few songs which I feel enhance certain scenes and definitely adds to the character and the story.The cast is fairly strong and does a decent job of creating some interesting unique characters. Jamie Foxx's character Bats is the standout and he is the driving force in the film. Lily James was great as Debora, Buddy's girlfriend, and it is her performance which makes me able to appreciate her character so well considering that I found her narrative evolution was a bit confusing and that she needed to be explored in more depth. The romance story-line needed to be fleshed out more- maybe show more of Debora's life (which I understand is quite mundane) to understand who she is and why she is attracted to Baby. It would also allow the audience to understand her decisions at the end of the film.
CJ Jones plays the foster father of Baby and carries the emotional weight of the film very well- he is definitely the heart of the film.I felt that Elgort's performance as Baby a bit lacking and he lacked energy and charisma. It was serviceable but not at the same level as the people around him. Kevin Spacey is Doc, Baby's boss, and it is a typical Spacey role that does not stand out in respect to his other characters of this ""type"" but works well in the context of the movie.SPOILERS IN FOLLOWING TWO PARAGRAPHSThe ending feels completely rushed and lacks real credibility. Baby has intentionally ruined the final heist of the film and put his teammates in jeopardy. He returns to Doc and there is an expectation that there will be conflict between the two. Doc has told Baby before that he essentially owns him and forces him to drive in the heists claiming that he will break his legs and kill his loved ones if he disobeys him. He also knows by the time that they meet that Baby intentionally ruined the heist by crashing into the truck (which is entirely uncharacteristic of him). The expectation is that there will be a standoff but Doc inexplicably decides to help Baby at great cost. Then there is an overzealous climax with Buddy who is seeking revenge. The motivation is fine but it was a bit drawn out- I think it would have been better if Baby had killed him at the diner. Baby's romance with Debora is just slightly off as we don't fully understand her motivation to go with Baby when he is on the run and having just killed a man.I think it would have made for a better ending if Baby had killed Buddy at the diner and we had better reason to believe that Debora would follow Baby. Then Baby has a final showdown with Doc and retrieves his cassette tapes which would perhaps exempt him from his role in the heists he took part in as it would be clear that he was being extorted. It could also have been interesting to see Debora choose not to follow Baby and see how the relationship would progress after everything has settled. How would they both come to terms with the fact that Baby killed a man and took part in those heists? Would she wait on Baby if he went to prison? Would Baby still love her after she chose to take no part?Overall, I think I should end this review by praising the film more as it might seem I have quite a negative perception of it. General audience members will really enjoy this film. The idea behind the film had the makings of a great film but I don't think that it lived up to its potential.",Baby Driver

The plot line and action were decent enough. The characters were ""bad"" enough. Jamie's character was overdone though, really irritating. I'd have shot him if I had been in their group.For some reason the whole thing felt two dimensional. We got zero background on the bad guys, including Spacey's king bad guy. We got flashback background on Baby but no background on the black guy who turns out to be very important in Baby's life until well past mid point.The cast was well chosen for 'the look' and did a fair job with the script and directing.

Some may say it's so obvious of a plot, but going past that, technical aspects are simply beautiful. Especially when you have insight how it was made.I demand that they grab at least one Oscar. This film is worth watching at least for the editing if not the plot. The director known for his visionary behaviour, made it a small enterntainment masterpiece. I am really sad he had too many differences to do Ant-man with Marvel Studios, but I can't disagree that a lot of his ideas were in the film anyway. Here he shows everything he's got and created a film perfected in every way.Ansel is slowly becoming a star. I wish him very much luck, he's growing to be more than just a romantic interest.

587,jamheigei,"Great Entertainment, a Little Dull Towards the End",7,20 December 2017,"The trailers to this movie looked very promising, so I did have somewhat of a high expectation.
In the first half, maybe even two thirds of Baby Driver, my expectations were definitely met. Not exceeded, but met. A particular strength of Baby Driver is the unusual style of creating action scenes. Through the music - which is the key element in the movie - everything is in tact. Gears changed, guns shot, everything happens on a beat, which makes the movie very fast-paced at times, though always comprehensible. I enjoyed that. The camera work is good like in any other decent action movie and apart from some rare one-takes or tricky movements, it's nothing jaw-dropping.
The characters were a thing I enjoyed too in the first part of the movie. I had the feeling that the cast was well put-together. Ansel Elgort plays a great protagonist with his quiet, almost shy aura; when things tend to get serious, though, he becomes very confident, all while remaining incredibly sly. The scenes with his crush Debora are very entertaining as well. While it may seem a little over the top-mysterious at times, it's all done with the right amount of decency.
Then of course, there are the gangsters. Kevin Spacey makes an awesome boss, feeling very authentic and on point. Sure, what we found out lately about him is terrible, but he was and is a great actor. The rest of the gangster squad relies a little too much on clichees maybe (The overly erotic couple, the black dude with the hood accent and the guy who dies and whose role is changed with every new coup), yet is still entertaining.
All those largely positive things I've now listed become kind of irrelevant towards the end of the film. While experiencing a very long police/gangster/free for all kind of hide-and-seek-game where we quickly lose track of who's dead, who's the bad guy and the good guy, the plot which unfolded quite nicely in the beginning become more twisted, not necessarily in a good way though. We don't know what Baby and his girl are up to anymore, to the point where I just kind of stopped caring about them. The movie wants to present a ""different"" ending, but it fails at realizing this in a good way. Eventually, the happy ending we've all been hoping for does happen, just with a 20 minute delay full of things we've either seen before or didn't want to see at all in the movie.All in all: The movie has a great entertainment factor. You're drawn into the story, the action scenes are nicely crafted and everything seems in place. The ending makes you wish you weren't drawn into the story that much though.
If Baby Driver was 20 minutes shorter and didn't have the wannabe twisted ending, I would have given it a 9 or even a 10",Baby Driver

There are so many hidden things that you may not catch, and you really have to pay attention. Let's talk about the first scene.The first scene is one of the best starters to a movie I have ever seen. It takes you on a rollercoaster and keeps you watching till the end. But, well, it still keeps going after that. The first scene comprises of a crew that robbed the Bank of Atlanta, and thanks to their getaway driver, they got away. But how? You may think through just not drawing the attention from the cops and just hiding in dark alleyways, but that's hard to do with a loud, bright red Subaru. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Baby uses the traffic to his advantage. He outruns them by letting them chase him till either a car hits them, or a camper that blocks off where he just went. I also love the use of practical effects, it makes it seem more real. Especially the scene with the drift and the two reversing vehicles, I am amazed that they actually did this.I won't go too in depth on all of the main action scenes in this movie, but I'll just say this, please.

Sort of felt like a less serious ""drive"" with more daylight and classical us blockbuster aesthetics. I identified with the low testosterone protagonist trying to fit in a criminal environment, a fun and light tone to the characters. The story does not go terribly deep, but still has a touching edge.
Our person of attention is out in a rather corned situation, which made me wonder myself what the right thing would be to do. There is something especially beautiful about good people in dark places, and combining this with a love story makes for a romantic escape. The lady and our protagonist have a very smooth connection and inspiring vibe, which makes this a very hot film, in a like abstract sense, it's not like ""love"" by Gaspar.

596,criticadelcinema,"A stylish, technical marvel that is remarkably entertaining.",9,19 July 2017,"Baby Driver is a stylish, technical marvel that is remarkably entertaining. From the opening sequence, director Edgar Wright stamps his work with his signature uniqueness. Wright puts the spotlight on getaway driver Baby, portrayed by The Fault in Our Star's Ansel Elgort, as he rocks out in his car, while Elgort's co-stars conduct a well-rehearsed bank heist off screen. Immediately, from this one direction choice, you know this won't be a run-of-the-mill heist film.What follows is anything but your run-of-the-mill heist film. Music is beautifully integrated into nearly every scene, adding to the unconventionality of Wright's approach to action. The sound editing perfectly blends the actions scenes with the accompanying music. There have been plenty of getaway car chases in film, most notably in the Fast and Furious franchise, but the flair that Wright adds with his own personal touch make Baby Driver's car sequences some of the best put to film.The colors in this film are consistently bright and vibrant, matching the similarly colorful performances by the cast. Jamie Foxx is a standout here, playing the borderline cartoonish gangster, Bats. Jon Hamm and and Eiza Gonzalez portray a similarly over-the-top Bonnie and Clyde duo. Kevin Spacey is (naturally) excellent as the boss that pulls this mishmash of stereotypes together with his cold efficiency. Though most of these characters are written to be caricatures of familiar character archetypes, each and every member of this star- studded cast is able to pull it off.  The charisma that each of these actors bring to the film are one of Baby Driver's greatest assets.It's easy to heap praise upon this film's supporting cast, but Elgort is truly commendable in his first proper leading role. He is given a lot to do in his film, as his character Baby's personality differs greatly depending on who is present in the scene. Elgort's performance ranges from stoic in the presence of his heist crew, slickly charismatic around his love interest, and energetic to an almost child-like level when he is by himself.When it comes to the script, there is a perfect synergy with every other the aspect of the film. The dialogue is often over the top, the characters are exaggerated, the plot is almost fantasy-like. The 80s action movie esque direction taken by writer/director Edgar Wright excuses some of the film's flaws. This isn't a hyper realistic, super serious action film. This is borderline fantasy at points.The flaws of this film are largely based on personal preference. The second act of the film slows down a bit to focus on Baby's relationship with his love interest, Debbie. If you were expecting non-stop action throughout the film, this may bother you. These scenes are well done however, and just as unique and stylized as the action scenes. Also, if you don't take well to the over-the-top, fantasy-like characters and plot, you might see it as a flaw, instead of an asset of the film.While a movie that I love, 2011's Drive, starring Ryan Gosling, was criticized for being largely style over substance. There are definitely similarities between Drive and Baby Driver; especially with both film's emphasis on style. While I don't think Baby Driver will be quite as polarizing, if Drive is a movie that you did not enjoy, you will find similar flaws here.Baby Driver is loud, over-the-top, and unrealistic. But these aren't necessarily flaws, as all of these aspects add to the charm of this film. This is my favorite work from Edgar Wright so far, and one of my favorite films of the year.",Baby Driver

There is no way on earth Baby Driver deserves more than 6.something out of 10. Generally it is okay, but holly Moses there are some very juvenile parts, especially at the beginning. And for some reason, seeing people lip-syncing makes me uncomfortable. Baby Driver would have been much better if they kept it serious, and skipped the goofy music-video crap.",Baby Driver

Foxx' comedy didn't fit. Hamm's a pretty boy who's unconvincing as a murderous thug. Bernthal was scary-creepy, which he's great at, but this movie isn't supposed to be dark, it's part comedy.Also, the ridiculous neck tattoos on looked juvenile.Baby's girlfriend was nothing but a waitress barbie doll.Oh, and Eliza González character is simply too good looking to be hanging around with a bunch of violent nitwits that everyone knows will get imprisoned or shot. What she really looks like is a fangirl of Jon Hamm that wondered in the set and was hired because the casting director was experiencing a cocaine hangover and couldn't think straight.Get the soundtrack, forget the movie.",Baby Driver

Working behind the wheel to pay off a debt to a crime boss, Baby is a young man of few words, but very sweet. Due to unfortunately events in his life, he ends up working for a criminal. What I did find quite interesting was the fact that the good boy, by staying next to a criminal, by the end of the movie, he does not find it so difficult to press the trigger, and the ""crime boss"" becomes a carrying friend. It is not as colorful as I taught it will be and the story line is not the best I saw, but it is something about this movie, because I really want to go back in cinema to see it again.",Baby Driver
606,vrajabhumi,Cops must have read the script since they magically appear so quickly.,1,13 September 2017,"Edgar Wright yeah? Edgar Wrong. I love Edgar Wright movies, but I thought this script was truly amateur hour. So I wondered what happened? Then I read this is the first screenplay he wrote by himself. And so I beg, please do NOT do that again. It is one mistake after another. Nothing really makes any sense, which I guess is fine if you're going for the surreal world of Scott Pilgrim or his other films, which was which were true masterpieces, not this junker. I saw some professional critic say (can you trust those guys anymore?) that this was ""his masterpiece."" I hope he got paid well. This movie is amateurish on every level, and it isn't just the script, the story is hackneyed as well. But back to the script, you know what I hate in crime movies more than anything? Magic cops. Magic cops is what I call it when police show up within a time frame that in real life is much too fast. If you commit a crime and within seconds or less than a minute there are multiple cop cars and helicopters on you-- those are magic cops. If every time you turn around, there are cops, those are magic cops. That may give the director a quick way to get into a chase scene, or move the plot where you want to go quickly, but it is cheating the laws of reality. The ability of the cops to always find the criminal very quickly regardless of what they do or where they go or how little info the cops should have, is cheating the viewer of a realistic story. Which is fine for a surreal movie like Wright is known for, but this is played straight. This is a straight up crime romance. It is lazy writing and nothing more to blame. Another thing I hate is when supposed seasoned criminals do very dumb things in order to make it easier for cops to catch them. For instance if you are stealing cars to make a get away and also switching cars to aid in your escape, why would you then park right in front of where you live or where you are doing stuff? And since you changed cars why are the cops there within a minute or two? The writing is lazy, that's why. The criminal all of a sudden conveniently acts like a foolish amateur at the worst possible time and the cops magically appear everywhere--that sums up this movie. This happens over and over and over.The acting is fine for what they are asked to do, but what they are asked to do is either mawkish or hackneyed tough criminal types. I get the feeling that Wright was trying to create a Guy Ritchie movie (failed at that Edgar, completely) because he wanted to be seen as more than the guy who makes funny wacky weird movies. He wants to be seen as street. He fails bigly. The amount of hype this movie gets is sadly so typical these days for bad movies, and I think a lot of it has to do with people who are maybe drinking or other things, maybe out partying before seeing these types of movies that appeal to young guys, because if you are sober and not very young, you should cringe at this type of stuff. Imagine Fast and the Furious without anything but sitting around talking like idiots with a few driving scenes without any of the wild and big production stuff they do. What you get is dumb and tiresome dialogue, mawkishness, hackneyed machismo, and a forced romance that doesn't seem real just to give the movie a romantic motive for the lead.",Baby Driver
607,cpowchuk,"Great heist movie, good ending",9,10 May 2018,"I wasn't sure I would like this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The story is good, I liked all the actors and the soundtrack is amazing. The ending was excellent, so happy that Baby did his time rather than the usual which would be either gunned down by police or on the run for the rest of his life. The one thing that I notice being done alot in movies, is when innocent people stand around watching instead of running from certain evil. Towards the end of the movie Doc, Baby & Debora are all standing in the garage, when Doc tells Baby & Debora to run as Buddy charges towards them in a stolen police car. But instead of running, Baby & Debora both just stand there watching while Doc is mowed down by Buddy. Even after Doc tells them a second time to ""run!"" they stand and watch. I suppose it makes for a more suspenseful movie if our hero is almost killed instead of simply running to safety? Overall an excellent movie which I've watched several times.",Baby Driver

A look through the user reviews on this movie will reveal many reviews with a score ranging from 1-6 and then the occasional ""10/10 Perfected action movie! A must watch masterpiece!"" It is my opinion that this page has been seeded with fake reviews to inflate the score of this movie well beyond an accurate reflection of its quality. I have noticed some other reviews addressing this same thing and after you've watched the film yourself its painfully obvious. The quality of this movie in no way reflects its current rating of 7.6 and I have read from other comments that it used to be at an 8.3. BLASPHEMY! Please watch this movie for yourself if you do not believe me(or don't and save yourself two hours).PROS:
-Decent soundtrack
-Good driving action scenes
-Eiza Gonzalez's outfit in the second part of the movie
-Suspenseful and intense action climaxCONS:
Stylistic failings:
-Musical aspects feels like a knock off of Guardians of the Galaxy and is not executed nearly as well
-Graphic scenes/gore felt forcedMuddled character motivations:
-Large and relatively unexplained/unjustified motivational 180's
-Some not believable/convincing motivations(especially with romance narrative)Extremely frustrating to watch:
-Characters make stupid decisions in action scenes
-Annoying plot holes
-Orders 4 coffees at one point and gets them in literally ten seconds(I know this is kind of petty and dumb, but it completely took me out of my immersion in the movie because I was thinking ""What?! There is literally no way in hell you could get your coffees that fast."")Overall disjunct and poor quality writing:
-Corny dialogue(maybe poor acting too sometimes?)
-No character, not even the main, was that compelling
-Many cliche feeling character archetypes

It's a film bolstered by an amazing soundtrack that goes in step with the action. It comes full circle in its repertoire, and all of the encompassing genres the film touches upon are done great justice.The romance between leads Ansel Elgort and Lily James is executed as well as it could've been. It helped to provide some tension during the film, as their budding relationship struggled due to the the life of crime Elgort's character was unwillingly thrown into.It's not perfect, as there was some predictability to come with the film. This was unexpected, seeing as the movie came from acclaimed director Edgar Wright. However, the coolness factor that the movie exuded overshadowed most of my minor criticisms.",Baby Driver

617,Wikingking,"Has more merits than faults, but certainly not Top250 material",6,9 July 2017,"I know...I know. Booo me as much as you desire, but I just can't love this movie, although I wanted to believe the hype badly. Here's what I think: The movie has many merits both acting wise, writing wise and from a technical approach. The editing, the soundtrack and how it works, the sound editing, cinematography all top-class. There are not many actors in the movie but as you can see, the line-up is pretty strong and everyone of them does a great job - Spacey and Foxx are especially good. It was a delight to see Jon Bernthal, too bad he only has a minor role in the movie.So we have a nice idea, a great and cool setting, some interesting or menacing but certainly fun-to-watch characters so almost everything is ready to make up one of the greatest heist-movies in recent memory. What can go wrong? Well, only a few things, and I must state that these things won't bother most people (sadly or thankfully, you decide).As I mentioned, the writers did a great job with the setting and characters - or should I say they had some great ideas, but generally did a lazy work with it? Because I believe this is the case here. Baby Driver is yet again another movie where the premise is extremely promising but execution is decent at best. I had the feeling that the movie is made up of a series of individual takes or clips rather than a well-written flow of events. When you have ideas like ""that would be cool"" but don't know how to make a story around it. The ending is absolute chaos or mess with some totally random character ""development"" which was so upsetting to see.This movie unfortunately can't make up it's mind and I could feel this all way long: it wants to be a romantic movie, a heist movie, but there are so many things that build on characters and dialogue, and unfortunately none of these are top-class or even good job, and as I mentioned it just won't work, the movie makers couldn't mix them into a working piece.Too bad, because they've had a great recipe and some outstanding ingredients.If you read this I'd still suggest to go to the cinema and watch it. Chances are that you'll like it much more than I did, but even I didn't regret buying the ticket because the movie was entertaining. I laughed, I was excited, nervous and of course upset.

The story is quite simple - A good guy is unfortunately stuck in a world of crime as a getaway driver. He needs to pull one last job before he elopes with his girlfriend. But the story is never the most important thing in an Edgar Wright movie. The razor sharp humour, the amazing soundtrack, and the gorgeous visuals bear his signature. This Edgar Wright-ness is the film's USP. And, the stunts, OMG !! The stunt/chase sequences in this movie put all the 8 Fast and Furious movies to shame (I wasn't a fan to begin with).I can't give you a single reason to NOT watch this movie. IT IS phenomenal.

619,sourpussss,"Bland, Loud, Adolescent - you're gonna love it",2,7 July 2017,"Velveeta filmmaking to its warm, gooey fantasy finish, this two hour time-waster seems to be provoking about as much adoration as that excremental insult, Mad Max-Fury Road. It'd be entirely forgivable/forgettable, if only this weren't the probable end of Edgar Wright's signature dish - mysteriously perfect balancing of action and comedy sunken in plots that you can't see the end of from their opening credits. At the outset, the miscasting of Baby seems the main obstacle to endure. Ansel Elgort, perfectly believable as a coffee delivery boy, never convinces as a getaway driver badass, and his lip synching and street scampering are Mentos commercial ready. Minutes later, it's clear that posturing-as-performance is all we're going to get from anyone on screen. With the exception of Jamie Foxx, the actors make so little impact they could have been played by anyone. Spacey snores through his lines and looks vaguely relieved to be run over. Jon Hamm seems ever more like a one-character wonder and Eiza González plays hot and dangerous like her character notes were ""be HOT, and DANGEROUS."" This is fantasy, right? That's why every improbable moment is tolerated, right? So what's with the flavor-free, tight-assedness? I guess I should just be grateful that they didn't include Block-O-Wax Theron as one of these ho-hum maniacs.The lineage here is at least a little interesting. Taken as a triptych - The Driver/Drive/Baby Driver - this edition loses in nearly every category save whiplash editing. Ryan O'Neal appeared equally miscast in Walter Hill's gloomy, preposterous original, but both he and the film began to exert centrifugal force around the halfway mark that made the whole haunting, if lacking the exhilaration that most seek in a wreck-em-up flick. The second coming of Ryan (Gosling) solved that with a silence (the flow through character trait of the three films) that suggested vitality in reserve, rather than living death (O'Neal) or sad puppy (Elgort). If you found Drive boring, you probably don't find much of interest in reality either. I suspect this Baby was made especially for you.It isn't such a surprise that elders like George Miller and Ridley Scott risk tampering with their legacies to stay in the game (have a look at Hitchcock's last release). But Wright seemed in his prime, making deals that didn't sacrifice style, advancing the proper scale and focus of B movies, understanding that they needed the ridiculous as well as moments of genuine outrage. With the success of his big Baby, how likely is it that he'll turn away from a seat at the Blandmakers table? Not too. Another genre specialist sucked into the hotdog factory. Sigh.",Baby Driver

I was upset to see some of the actors in such a bad movie. I actually walked away from this movie within the first 20 minutes, the cinematography seemed really annoying to watch, and the acting was just as bad, it seemed like a joke to movies, and at first I thought perhaps one of those movies that is awkward on purpose as a form of comedy, it seems too serious to take that quirky approach and just comes off as low quality instead. Id say they would have done better with a better production team... like okay it has that same Edgar Wright style I guess, but honestly I thought all his movies were just bad, like I read a book to get involved into the story and immersed, and this movie is similar to reading a book that lets you know every few minutes you are reading a book, its really off putting. After clicking Edgar Wright's name on IMDb I realized that I didn't like any of the movies he's directed in the past, and understand now why I didn't like this one either, mostly for all the same reason's I stated above, are the same reasons that make his other movies bad as well. I think I did like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World but that was only because the actors fit that awkward style of the movie. The emotions of Baby Driver seem so out of touch with what a movie should be. The actors seem like random friends of the director, mixed in with high paid extras, who happen to be kind of well known. It's just really a bad movie, and it's sad to see movies like this made, when there is just so much better quality directors and stories the production value could have been spent on.",Baby Driver

623,saintgermain-83925,I joined IMDb just to write this review,1,9 July 2017,"Someone else also used this summary and gave a glowing positive review so it just goes to show that two people can see the same movie and experience completely different emotions. Having read several pages of IMDb reviews I can see that I am in a massive minority of those who have posted .But as with everything in life.. that doesn't make the majority right and the minority wrong ....I mean look at Trump ...oh sorry he lost the popular vote as well so even the ""majority "" was wrong ... Anyway this movie is complete drivel and one of the worst of the last decade . I deeply resent the waste of expenditure on two movie tickets and the two hours torn from my life . The script must have been less than 4 pages of A4 if the directions were left out as there was almost no communication worthy of the name and no subtlety in character development whatsoever . The ""plot"" is ludicrous so that would be OK if it was supposed to be a farce or a fantasy but I fear it was intended to be neither of those two genres . And of course I should have anticipated that to be the case in view of the Director's puerile previous work .I somehow thought he might have grown up . Towards the end a car containing one of the villains Buddy , John Hamm ,who has already been shot, is pushed through a barrier in a multistorey car park and falls at least 4 stories to the ground outside landing on its roof .Less than a minute later Buddy ..completely uninjured by this catastrophic incident ..has emerged from the car and somehow regained the fourth floor to attack the sort of hero ""Baby"" . So I suppose I am the idiot for believing that excitement ,thrills ,tension needs some element of credibility. With literally dozens slaughtered by gunshot and farcical car stunt chases ...yawn yawn ..oh surely the movie goer cannot get a thrill from such action...?..seen it all before a hundred times ..boring boring . The only remaining content of the movie was the music : good but anyone can phone up to license the use of the creativity and skill of real artists so it doesn't exactly count as some sort of creative worth and a nice performance from Ansel Elgort as Baby.

I one of the best things about this movie was the way they weren't afraid to start killing off people in the second half of the film.
Another, is the really entertaining car stunts and chases. That should not be overlooked, as that is the main point of this movie, and they do that excellently.
Now, one thing that really bothered me in this movie, is the way the romance between baby and debora just came out of nowhere. Wasn't developed at all just came to be, and that kind of pissed me off.

IMDb rating of 8.6 at the time of writing this here... how...?My gripe with this one. The love story overall felt flat and emotionless and awkwardly cheesy with matching dialogue. The shots fired in the shooting scenes were actually synchronised with the soundtrack playing, with that giving the movie a corny / cheesy feeling. Awkward and clichéd one liners, acting from teeny main leads wasn't believable at times. Car scenes were OK, hence 2 stars, the ending was drawn out, felt rushed and discombobulated. I didn't really care for any of the characters tbh, apart from Jamie Fox. Overall this movie felt like watching a teenagers room.

Sillyness like using word Rhymes and lines straight out of a Dr Seus book. I really thought this film was going to be innocent film and Baby will get away with his GF to mexico but maybe Baby has brain damage from the inital accident that killed his parents and is addicted to stay in the criminal life. Baby turns into a shoplifter and physco and the movie becomes the Terminator movie the ""Good"" trying to kill the bad guy, and uncessary comicial violence happens i haven't seen since a Die Hard film. The movie wanted to be commedic in parts i didn't understand the foster father bit of the movie and I guess the money that Baby was saving up was to put his foster father in a home, but he kinda was leaving it to the last minute there.

But when I saw it, I was unfortunately disappointed. There aren't too many memorable things about this movie, and it's predictable. It's moderately funny, and the chase scenes aren't as astonishingly mind-blowing as I was led to believe. The characters are decent and the story is OK, which puts it at a 5/10, but the editing is a tier above average so I'll give it a 6/10. I think the 10/10s are coming from car buffs who never watch actual 10/10 movies, or from people who like purely ""realistic,"" typical action movies. I would really have liked to see something new and unpredictable, or to have some absurd humor or something, but it just wasn't there.

His attempt to mix a thrilling crime flick choreographed to music doesn't entirely hit its mark in that regard, and made me afraid during the film that it would turn out to be more musical than crime movie (I really hate musicals). However, the moments where the lead isn't floating around the scene in Singing in the Rain-esque music numbers are extremely fun and thrilling to the point that it's easy to forgive its shortcomings.",Baby Driver
637,bobhelms,"Sold As A ""Driver"" Movie, Not Much Driving",3,14 October 2017,"The trailer for this movie sells it as a driver movie, with lots of action and car chases. Well, for about 1/4 of the movie, this is correct. The beginning scenes in the Subaru WRX are pretty impressive, but it starts to lose steam quickly. ""Baby"" himself and Kevin Spacey do a great job in their roles for the most part, but Jamie Foxx is a head scratcher. He plays an antagonist role but it doesn't really fit in, and to make matters worse, his role is written in with a bunch of goofy long winded philosophical garbage. It appears as though it is meant to be witty but it comes off as though the writers were trying way too hard and in the end couldn't get the product to work and they said ""screw it"" and went with it anyway. In a lot of ways, Foxx's character ruined the entire movie. But the blame isn't all on him. The plot is really weak, and continues to get worse towards the end of the movie. As I look at some of the other reviews, I have to ask myself ""What movie where they watching?"" I give this one 3/10, 1 star for Spacey, and 2 stars for the driving in the first 1/4 of the movie.

Sub-machine guns blazing everywhere, a death toll of around 20 people in a relatively small American city...it just doesn't really happen anymore, at least not since the days of Bonnie & Clyde. In fact, the entire film from Baby's character to the personalities of the various gang members and the forced dialogue (sorry, people don't really talk like these characters) had little connection with reality, which is a shame because there were a couple of good ideas in there, like Baby's tragic back story and his need for music. And the cliches abounded, from the bog standard car chases to Baby's on-foot escapes.

An easy 15 minutes could have been trimmed from the theatrical run time, but that's really a nitpick on an otherwise solid film.One more problem I have that bothered me more than it probably should've, was the camera work during some scenes. Wright traded in on steady cam for a hand-held approach in many scenes that, especially action scenes, really put a damper on many sequences.This is my least favorite of Edgar Wright's directed works, yes including A Fist Full of Fingers, but that's not a bad thing.

643,wogsurfer,"Oh Baby, what a movie.",9,19 July 2017,"Baby (Elgort) is a quiet, unassuming young man, who looks after his ailing foster parent, listens to music both out of his love for it, and a need to block out the tinnitus ringing in his ears that he was afflicted with due to a tragic accident that also took his parents. Baby also has a specific skill set, one that has him doing the bidding of a crime boss Doc (Spacey) to pay back a debt.Baby's skill is driving, but not just any driving, the kind of skilled driving that gets Doc's crew of armed bandits away from the scene of bank hold-ups very fast, and then leads crews of police cars on a merry dance, and dodges every trick up their sleeves with a few of his own set to a killer music soundtrack from his iPod.With light at the end of the tunnel, Baby has a chance encounter with cute diner waitress Debora (James), where the chemistry between the two is instant. He sees this as his road to freedom, and a bright new future. This new future is brought to rude halt by Doc who was not yet done with Baby.This film is all about the music soundtrack, and what a soundtrack indeed. With songs like Nowhere to Run by Martha and the Vandellas, to the quintessential driving song Radar Love by Golden Earring, you'll be tapping your toes as well as being thrilled by the action, plus the classy, and slick driving by Baby.The performances in this film are all stand out, relative new comers Elgort, James, and González do really well in their respective roles. The scene stealing performances by Spacey, Hamm, and Foxx are great in support to Elgort. While Spacey, as he generally does, plays cool, and mellow. Hamm, and Foxx do it with charm, and evil menace as Buddy, and Bats. Jon Bernthal's cameo as the suspicious, and hot-headed Griff was also a delight to watch.Written, and directed by cult favourite Edgar Wright, this film has all the elements that make this a great addition to the tradition of other heist films like Drive, The Getaway, and Heat.Baby Driver is probably the most fun I had at the cinemas this year along with Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man Homecoming.",Baby Driver

651,emartin-1,A really good movie that fizzles badly in the end (some spoilers),7,3 July 2017,"After seeing Baby Driver, one thought kept going through my mind over and over again: Boy, oh boy, what if Quentin Tarantino had directed it? This kind of movie was made for him. In some ways it feels like a modern-day Reservoir Dogs. Put a bunch of criminals together and at some point there will be betrayal, and bloodshed. Director Edgar Wright did a commendable job, but had Tarantino gotten a hold of this project, I know the character development, writing and directing would have been much crisper. The characters are interesting: Kevin Spacey as the level-headed leader of a gang of thieves, with Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal and a grizzled-looking Jon Hamm among the thieves. Hamm is about as far-removed from Don Draper as can be and proves he shouldn't be typecast. But the focus is on the baby-faced Ansel Elgort as Baby, who is a helluva getaway driver. He is still tormented by a childhood tragedy and listens to music through his headphones all day, even when he's driving. The other important star of the movie is the soundtrack. It drives the entire narrative, an idea that seems borrowed from Guardians of the Galaxy. But the music is great. From the Commodores, to Queen, to Barry White, songs are used effectively. The plot revolves around Baby's quest to do ""one final job"" and then get out of the crime business. We've seen this before many times. It never ends well. Along the way, Baby meets Debora, a bubbly waitress played by Lily James, who looks like a young Jessica Lange. She also is obsessed with music, just like Baby, and they fall hard for each other in what seems like five minutes. However, their ultimate plan to ride off into the sunset together and listen to music will be easier said than done. The first hour of Baby Driver is strong. But the final half-hour devolves into a cliché-ridden mess, with supposedly dead characters suddenly reappearing and bad guys failing to kill good guys despite having them in their cross-hairs several times. It's almost as if the producers ran out of money and decided to call it a day. Baby Driver is the second movie in a row, following All Eyez on Me, that disappointed me. Not because they were bad, but because they could have been so much better in the hands of a different director. So to sum up, Baby Driver is interesting for a while, but eventually wraps up like just about every other caper. Well, at least there's great music along the way.",Baby Driver
652,mubeen710,Definitely the top action movie of the year on my list!,9,15 August 2017,"From Shaun of the Dead to Scott Pilgrimage, I've always found Edgar Wright's movies entertaining. However, baby Driver was a step above that. Take Whiplash or La La Land, combine it with heist & Ronin or Fast & Furious elements to it and you have Baby Driver.There's no shortage of action movies in Hollywood, but there's definitely a shortage of good action movies and a movie like Baby Driver definitely delivers it! I must say, Edgar Wright, did a fantastic job with this film, especially when he had synced the 80's classic hits to the complete movie that gave this movie the extra coating that made it so unique.If you are a car lover, an action movie lover or a person who has a gig for 80's music or ever turned up the volume of your stereo and drove down the town super reckless, then Baby Driver is a movie for you!",Baby Driver

655,dbcint,"I'm in, Baby",10,20 July 2017,"Baby Driver might just be the coolest movie of the year. Now, whether or not that translates into being the best movie of the year well, we'll just have to wait and see. At the moment, it's certainly top five, but there's still five months of movies to come. Still, Baby Driver is a hell of a ride, and just has an undeniable ""cool"" factor about it.From director Edgar Wright, whose previous movies have been largely overlooked at the box office but become cult classics on home video, Baby Driver is the story of Baby (Ansel Elgort), who made a mistake in his youth that got him in deep with Doc (Kevin Spacey), a criminal mastermind. To pay off his debt, Baby now drives the getaway car for all of Doc's heists. Baby's debt is nearly paid off, and isn't that just great timing? Baby has just met Debora (Lily James), a waitress who Baby quickly finds himself falling for. But when Doc hires a dangerous new crew and recruits Baby for one last job, Baby's chance for freedom and happiness is put in jeopardy.The twist to all this is that when he was a kid, Baby was in a car accident that killed his parents, and has left him with constant tinnitus. To combat the tinnitus, Baby is always listening to music to drown out the ringing in his ears and help him focus better on the world around him. And this kid needs an extraordinary amount of focus, as he's one of the most reckless drivers you'll ever see. Although ""reckless"" might not be the right word. Aggressive? He knows the moves he's making are dangerous and that one wrong move or slight misjudgement could end disastrously, but he also knows exactly what to do to avoid this. Honestly, there are going to be people who watch this on the edge of their seats every time Baby gets behind the wheel, because they're going to be constantly thinking that he's going to kill someone. Then there are those of us who will watch the opening scene – which establishes exactly what Baby can do – and we'll be completely relaxed throughout the movie because we know we can trust Baby's driving. A huge part of that is down to Elgort's performance, Wright's direction, the music choices, and the camera-work. Everything in this movie just ties together perfectly, and that opening scene is not only one of the best establishing character moments I've seen in a long time, it's also the best opening to a movie in recent memory (the only thing I can think of at the moment that comes close would be The Dark Knight), the best car chase scene since Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and the best action scene since Captain America: Civil War's airport scene.Of course, not everyone has such faith in Baby. When Doc brings in a new crew for his latest heist, Bats (Jamie Foxx) and Buddy (Jon Hamm) are particularly perturbed by Baby's behaviour, which leads to their utter distrust of him throughout the movie. These two essentially serve as the villains, with Doc as the Big Bad, and all give fantastic performances. All are psychotically evil in their own way, with Foxx showing how dangerous he can be right from the start, and Hamm snapping after suffering a loss. Spacey, on the other hand, is more of a calm threat. I don't think he even raises his voice once, but whenever he says something sinister, you know without doubt that this is a guy who will back up his threats and will have no compunctions about doing so.Then there's Lily James as Debora. This girl is fantastic. One look at her, and you know exactly what kind of character she's going to be, and James plays it up on every level. By all rights, the result should be a total caricature and stereotype, but James sells the hell out of it (in large part thanks to that voice), and almost gave the most engaging performance of the movie – that honour does indeed go to Ansel Elgort as Baby. However, what makes their performances so great is the way they bounce off each other. These two have fantastic chemistry, and it's this relationship that really makes the movie something special.If I had to pick out a flaw in this movie, it would be that the ending was somewhat predictable. It was written in such a way that there was really only one way out. But it was so much fun getting there, and actually such a satisfying ending, that it doesn't matter how predictable it was. Baby Driver has plenty of other surprises throughout.Baby Driver is, as I said, perhaps the coolest movie I've seen all year, and I'm just glad it seems to have been a success at the box office. Some of those stunts do not look like they were cheap to film, so I have to imagine this cost a fair bit of money to make, and reports say that Edgar Wright has already been approached about making a sequel. Whether or not that happens we'll see. For now, just go and see Baby Driver. It's a wild ride with what should be star-making performances from Ansel Elgort and Lily James. Just don't drive like Baby.For more movie and entertainment reviews, visit my website at www.theblogfather.co.nz",Baby Driver

This is the first time Wright has worked with this much star power, specifically American star power. The actors played well off of each other, especially in scenes involving comedy where they nailed the punchlines.The music was good, not all of it recognizable by the average viewer, but effective nonetheless. Supposedly Edgar Wright based the whole movie idea around the Baby Driver song by Simon & Garfunkel, which is an accomplishment all on it's own.

It was a hodge-podge of style over substance. The dialogue was embarrassing, the characters generic and un-engaging, and the plot strictly by the numbers.This film was trying to be brave putting music to action, and this was hyped up in some interviews, but this 'innervation' was done in black and white films 80+ years ago and seemed just as clunky and forced back then. In this film it ruined another meh action set piece.This was ultimately a very average film with numerous failings that borrowed from earlier and better films such as Heat, La La Land, the films of John Waters/Tarantino, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Wild At Heart. This film borrowed from all these films to produce a mess that left me in bewilderment at numerous times, making it (for me at least) the Showgirls of action films. Just WTF was the director thinking? Why does everything have to be set in the 50's/80's/whenever - some mythical past where beatnicks listen to ipods, sing in the streets, and get out of prison in 1955 when they went in in 2017...The Baby Driver gimmick was ultimately the least of the film's problems which I think 90% of the audience weren't even aware of.",Baby Driver

662,micahbundy,The Most Unique Film of 2017,8,27 March 2018,"2018 Iowa All-State Individual Competition Nominated Review: Baby Driver is written and directed by Edgar Wright. The film follows a young getaway driver named Baby. He is sucked into a life of crime by a mob boss, who is played by Kevin Spacey. Spacey's character uses different crews for each heist, but he always uses Baby as his driver, because Baby, played by Ansel Elgort, is the best getaway driver there is, and the film establishes this in the very first scene. Baby meets a waitress played by Lily James and romance comes into play. They both want to get away from their day to day lives and just drive, but Baby is trapped in this life of crime and can't seem to get out. However, this is where the film takes off. At its core, this movie is about style, action sequences, characters, and story. In the film, Baby gets into a car accident as a kid, this causes him to have Tinnitus in his ears. Tinnitus is the constant ringing and buzzing in the ears. However, he does drown this out by plugging the headphones in and listening to music all of the time. The music he listens to is actually found in the form of a thirty-five song soundtrack. Director Edgar Wright takes this soundtrack and lets each song dictate an individual scene. He does this by matching each sound effect and action in the film to each beat of the song. Wright does this extremely well and the music puts the viewer in Baby's position, causing the viewer to understand his character better and connect with him on a deeper level. Baby Driver is all about its getaway sequences and these are simply some of the best getaway sequences ever done. Wright uses little CGI, but when he does it's never obvious due to how practical the sequences are.These sequences are fluent and feel real. This is due to Weight using the actual actors when filming, as well as shooting on the Atlanta freeway. All of this makes for some of the most high octane driving sequences ever seen on film. What makes the characters great in this film is the chemistry between them. Lily James´s character and Ansel Elgort's character have excellent chemistry, making for a very believable romance throughout the course of the film. This is a reflective image of an actual married couple in the film. The married couple, played by Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzalez is a picture of what Baby and his girlfriend could´ve been. Kevin Spacey plays a very commanding figure and the respect that each crew has for him is very clear during the film. Another great aspect is the anti-chemistry between each crew. It is very obvious that each of the characters within the crew is driven by their own individual goals, leading to lots of arguments and bad blood between the crews. Jamie Foxx´s character is a prime example of this, as he is always causing mischief within the crews. 
 The story of Baby Driver never takes itself too seriously. Wright does a great job of taking a certain event in the film and throwing it in the opposite direction of where the viewer might think the film is going. This is demonstrated when Baby and his girlfriend receive help from an unlikely character. The film does this a lot, keeping the viewer invested and constantly on the edge of their seat. Wright also manages to brilliantly tell the story through driving sequences with little to no dialogue. He does this by utilizing their actions, facial expressions, and the soundtrack itself. This is a nice touch from Wright and one that most modern filmmakers simply don't possess. The movie is engaging enough that the viewer will care about the characters, but at the same time, it is light-hearted enough, making for easy viewing and an enjoyable film. This film does have negatives, but they are mostly nitpick and minor takeaways. While the chemistry between Ansel Elgort and Lily James is great and they have a believable romance, their romance feels shoved aside for the sake of the plot. This film would have benefited from a longer running time to expand upon their relationship. There were minor things that stood out early on in the film, but as the film progressed they were explained and ended up canceling themselves out. For instance, during the first scene, Baby drives a red Subaru for a heist in broad daylight, which doesn't seem logical, but this is remedied when Baby puts himself between two other red cars and loses the police when he switches his position, while under a bridge. The film keeps the viewer invested because of how it is not as predictable as one might think. The film has high octane action sequences that feel real and intense. The film is stylish when the soundtrack comes on and the acting in this film is excellent.The chemistry between the characters is great. This great chemistry is on display from the main and supporting characters alike. The film has very few negatives and they're all minor things and some even tend to cancel themselves out as the film progresses. Overall, Baby Driver is an amazing and unique film that feels refreshing amongst a generation of reboots and sequels. Because of this, the film requires multiple viewings and that is why I gave it a: 9.2/10.",Baby Driver

679,thegoldfishpool,High Octane Ballet,10,3 July 2017,"From the opening sequence of Baby Driver you realize you are about to see something different. Edgar Wright has tricked you into watching a musical and loving every second of it. One where the dance numbers are performed by fast cars and the beat of the music is pounded out by the gunfire. You thought John Wick's choreography was amazing? Every step, movement, shot, cup of coffee, and chalkboard drawing is perfectly timed to the music of the scene, every line of dialogue was a song. It is a ballet, a Broadway dance, and a brutal massacre without a single missed beat. This is a huge undertaking as a director, making sure all the pieces are moving in time from the camera and talent to the background performers and traffic, and Edgar Wright nails it every time. It may not be the type of film that the Academy usually notices but Edgar deserves a Best Director nod for the opening title sequence alone. It stands next to Goodfellas and Touch of Evil as one of the best long takes of all time.",Baby Driver
680,greenlanternspacesector2814,Don't believe the hype,4,10 June 2017,"Saw it and, aside from a fun pre-title chase scene, this movie is wildly overpraised. Ansel Elgort is not the next big thing and the story, which revolves around three heists, is a real nothing burger. Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx are both fine acting like bad ass tough guys, but their characters aren't original enough or interesting enough and the dialogue isn't consistently clever/cool enough to sustain the movie (there's only a handful of funny lines; Kevin Spacey gets the best one). The Usual Suspects, The Town, and Heat did it all MUCH better. The romance between Elgort and Lily James aims for sweet and mostly misses, but she's awfully cute and manages to make her time on screen pleasant. If you're expecting a lot of great car chase scenes you will definitely be disappointed. There's really only a couple and, as I said, only the first is impressive. Honestly, while watching it I was wondering what all the fuss was about. This is yet another example of people being swayed by movie critic peer pressure to praise a movie just so they can be part of the in-crowd, a member of the cool club.

It contains impressive performances by Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, and Lily James. And Kevin Spacey brought a gravitas that was a little more than OK, but nothing like his Verbal from Usual Suspects; more like Hopper from A Bugs Life (and that isn't a poke). Nonetheless, Elgort's take on the young getaway driver indebted to Spacey's crime boss ""Doc"" didn't go deep enough for me to really feel for the character's plight. Wright does many things right in setting up the story and conflict. No scene is wasted; there are no Chekov's guns; there isn't one line of dialogue that comes across as completely unnecessary. Yet, I couldn't get attached to the characters enough to either enjoy the ride or care for the outcomes. While leaving the theater with my 19yo son, I was reminded of how much I liked Mad Max Fury Road and for what? It was a hell of an action flick with colorful and bold characters but without a compelling story arc. At least Edgar Wright fleshed out a story that carries the film more. But, though my 19yo son really dug this one (he was ""eh"" on Fury Road though understood my love of it), I just didn't enjoy this cup of tea...or rather cup of coffee. Still B+ for good editing, action and acting.",Baby Driver

Young star Ansel Elgort proves he is not just a child actor looking to go pro, he delivers! Kevin Spacey is also solid, as usual. The real treat of this film is the beautiful aesthetics that bring everything together, from hints on background TV's to GRAFFITTI that helps you sing-a-long. My personal favorite aspect of this masterful 112 minutes is Jon Hamm who delivers the performance of his life. Hamm achieves this through polarizing his character and ebbing out of his comfort zone.

In all my years i have never heard anything like it. What a piece of art. It takes, what our society has generated, synchronzises it with basically everything and elevates it to a new level. There is such a beautiful merge of different styles in there, if you have ever felt anything in your hearth, you will enjoy this.Go and listen to this movie",Baby Driver
691,Emma-M-V,Torn between a 6 and a 7,6,21 October 2017,"Baby Driver is a pretty fun movie to watch and you will definitely not be bored by it. The music choices are great and the fact that everything in the movie lines up with the music makes for a very entertaining watch. It is also very impressive and makes you wonder how much work must have gone into getting the action to match up with the beats.Sadly it seems that the effort that that took eroded Edgar Wright's focus and when it comes to other aspects of the film, mainly the story, the characters and the comedy the movie falls far short of his previous films.(Now, obviously I won't rank it down because it isn't funny, since it's not listed as a comedy, but an action musical, but if you wish to watch it you'll probably want to know beforehand) This is in no way a Transformers or Fast and the Furious level of action schlock, but there are some strange choices and some straight up bullsh*t in it.For example, Baby's living situation. I'm not saying it's impossible that a single deaf black man would want to foster a kid and be seen by the CPS as a good fit, but it's the kind of thing that makes you wonder how in the world it happened and takes you out of the story a bit as you ponder the possibilities.Kevin Spacey's character was the worst part for me personally, both because of Spacey's lifeless line delivery and because of a breach of character which happens late in the film and appears so illogical and unexplainable that it almost seems an ex machina.For a fan of House of Cards it was just hugely disappointing and slightly embarrassing to see him perform so badly. He hardly performed a sigh better than he did in that sh*t show Nine Lives! There is more I could go into, but for fear of spoiling anything for you I'll keep from saying anything further than that there are some other plot turns that just do not make much sense. If you would like more info I'm sure it's not too hard to find.So, to conclude; Baby Driver is far from a bad movie and is highly entertaining, but it's hardly great and it is far from the hilariously beautiful genius that is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World or Hot Fuzz.",Baby Driver
692,jtsemple,The Most Fun I've Had in a Long Time,10,5 August 2017,"This movie is DOPE. I wasn't sure about Ansel Elgort, as I'd only previously seen him in Divergent, and I abhor those movies. But he was absolutely spectacular as Baby. He stole my heart within the first five minutes of the film, and did not give it back. Baby Driver is poignant, thrilling, enthralling and fun, fun, fun, fun, fun. I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through and could not stop grinning. I loved Jon Hamm; he did a standout job. Kevin Spacey was, as expected, excellent. Lily James was charming. Jamie Foxx's character was incredibly annoying, but he played him well, so I can't complain. Oh, and the soundtrack is even better than the Guardians films (and that's coming from someone who loves those movies to death). If I have any complaints, it's that there wasn't enough of Jon Bernthal. I've heard several critics make the comment that this movie was more ""style over substance"", but I didn't really think so. Yes, it's highly stylized and brilliantly edited and shot, but it gives us enough substance to tell a great, engaging, original story without bogging the action down. Honestly, if there was another show after the one I went to, I would've stayed at the cinema and watched Baby Driver a second time. It's going onto my Top 10 favorites list.",Baby Driver
693,Deb-ABQ,Unbelievably Lame,1,20 October 2017,This movie was utterly disappointing. I can't understand why it is rated so highly.

Fine performances all around, archetypal without being clichéd. It's comparable to a Tarantino film, but more optimistic, less indulgent, and more polished.

I went to this movie right after seeing the new Spider-Man and actually enjoyed Baby Driver so much more.I am a huge fan of music and the only people who will not like this movie are the people who do not like music all too much. The whole movie is basically a music video and they show that in multiple ways by having Baby stop his crew so he could start the song at the right time or subtly having lyrics appear on the scene as he is walking.The greatest part about this movie was that the chase scenes were not choppy and hard to watch, which is typical in a car movie. They are actually really smooth and easy to follow. Characters are lovable and there is almost nothing wrong with this movie. ALMOST. There is one or two things that bothered me and this wouldn't be a good review if I didn't address them. #1- The Love aspect: The movie has a waitress that Baby falls for. That OK, but she falls for him way too fast and barely blinks an eye when he kills someone. Most people would not fall for somebody so hard, and that quick, that they would watch someone kill a guy and then run away with them. #2- Jamie Foxx's character sucked. He played it well but overall, the character was really overplayed and a cliché to say the best. Still a great movie. Watch ASAP.Gavin Johns, wanna-be critic, sk8teboard11@gmail.com",Baby Driver
697,michaelmcdonald-20730,"Fast, Exciting, Fun.",8,30 June 2017,"This is a movie about car chases, and Edgar Wright's script and direction expertly keeps this movie's pedal to the metal. It is relentless and never lets up, due in large part to the clever idea of playing a soundtrack of fun and exciting songs continuously throughout the movie with only the briefest of interruptions.The story is simple and unoriginal as can be: a young guy owes one last debt to a criminal boss, only to be sucked back into the world of crime while seeking a way out. But while lesser movies would bore us with a dozen redundant cliché backstories, melodramatic romances and enough self-serious dialogue to make the Fast and the Furious series seem like Shakespeare, Wright avoids it all and focuses the attention on the thrills. Think ""Whiplash"" meets ""True Romance"" meets ""21"" and you've got a general idea of the movie. Wright's direction is as originally compelling as ever, and he's probably one of the only directors who can make pressing an elevator button seem cool. There is one particular scene in which the main character (""Baby"") is asked to survey the location of the next heist that has such a small yet smart twist that serves as a perfect microcosm for the elevation Wright brings to this genre. The acting is superb, with Jon Hamm's charismatically dangerous performance being the biggest standout, and Kevin Spacey's acting somehow manages not to chew up his scenes like one would expect. The film is not without its flaws – there isn't a strong antagonist, the plot isn't smooth and some characters are in need of better payoffs – but there's enough here for repeat viewings, or at the very least, a fun time at the movies.",Baby Driver

From the opening scene with driving that would make Vin Diesel's stunt man stop and stare, to the one continuous shot of baby going to buy coffee, absolutely incredible. Accompanied by the best soundtrack since Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, Baby Driver is one of those movies that will never go out of style, and for me has joined the small list of classic movies that will always be welcomed viewing on my television screen.",Baby Driver

It's not nearly as bad as some people say but at the same time it's no masterpiece so I give it a low 7. The reason behind this is that it's no doubt a fun movie with a decent soundtrack but it's flawed in many places. Particularily the entire last part of the movie should've been something else entirely since that is where it falls apart - even the music.

I am writing a short review as I feel compelled to set the record straight after reading some unusually positive comments that do not reflect the opinions of myself or several friends who have seen the film. The mark of a good piece of cinema is the vibe and reactions of the entire cinema at the end of a movie. And at the end of Baby Driver there was like one big collective sigh, instead of that excited chatter or frozen moment at the end of an extremely good thriller or hard hitting true story. None of that at the end of this one - only sighs and a few overhead comments like ""really"", ""hmm"" and ""well that happened quickly"" etc.*Spoilers from here inBaby Driver is a very entertaining movie until the final heist scene where the director decides to ditch the very concept of an exciting, octane filled getaway that had the whole cinema on edge in previous scenes for an early bail out and completely laughable set of circumstances that follow. How many times does John Hamms character come back to life? I mean come on... the ending sequences are a complete joke that take the movie from 'Tarantino-esque' to comical and silly. IF the movie had taken us on another wild ride with Baby working out a way to frame the bad guys in the process then we could have had a good ending. The one we did get felt rushed, comical and stupid. Would love to have seen justice paid to a good start to a movie.",Baby Driver
713,mastersparky,"Balls out, creative and utterly original!",9,21 June 2017,"I've felt starved of originality so far this year and this film promised to be a little different. Different it most certainly is.I caught a late night showing of the film some 7 days before it's official release and I drove home quicker than I ever should have, (especially with the dodgy tyre that's hanging off the back of my car), I was in such a rush to throw these words together because the film is just simply THAT BLOODY GOOD! Edgar Wright hasn't just created a film, he's created a piece of art. This is picture and sound working absolutely perfectly with each other, a master class of editing. Gun shots and window wipers sync perfectly with the beats of the music, the volume of the soundtrack dictated by how the main character 'Baby' is experiencing it at the time. In fact, there's only a couple of times throughout the whole feature where the music actually stops, (when the headphones are ripped from his ears) timed so brilliantly with the serious moments of the film. It's a unique and creative effect, the likes I've never seen done before.Ansel Elgort plays the young get away driver 'Baby' and does a fine job of portraying a cool, if somewhat purposely awkward character. Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm & Lily James all perform brilliantly and there's a number of scenes that feature them on screen all together which are genuinely electric. I'm a big fan of Jon Bernthal, especially since his Punisher role in Marvel's DAREDEVIL however I was disappointed to find his role is more of a cameo than anything else. The romance between Baby and Debora (played by Lily James) works well and the chemistry between them shines.The lack of CGI was a breath of fresh air in a world where every film seems to be rammed with it no matter how effective. Prior to the screening, Edgar Wright had recorded a short message for us and he made it very clear that he shot this film using almost entirely practical effects and it shows. Not one bit of poor CGI to ruin the magic, just balls out, car chasing porn.As touched on earlier, the soundtrack is immense. A perfect blend of some well known tracks and some less recognizable, all very effective and match the on screen action beautifully.A couple of small gripes that pop up and ruin an almost perfect get away can be found in the closing chapters. A particular scene in a car park features a few too many cuts for my liking and for a time I struggled to see what was actually happening on screen. The pacing also drops off rather quickly in the final scenes. A more sudden climax would have perhaps worked better to what had been a racey/fast paced film up to that point. It dampened my enthusiasm for the film a touch, which is a shame because the motor was running beautifully until then.Baby Driver doesn't waste any time in pulling you into its world and the camera work in one of the opening scenes is outstanding: A long shot timed perfectly with the music and crammed with brilliantly timed on screen moments, it was superb. The cinematography is exceptional and the plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The amount of attention to detail found in here is something to behold and it's clear Edgar Wright put his absolute all into creating this masterpiece. Finally, the dialogue is some of the wittiest I have heard in a film in a long time, it had the whole cinema laughing out loud numerous times and features some great real world references that are bound to make you smirk.The best way to describe Baby Driver is that it's La La Land being overrun by speeding cars and bank robbers. Throw in some Kingsman style humour and, at times, pretty graphic violence and you've got yourself one hell of a good heist movie! Go see this Baby!

714,LordMaxentius,"A very solid, engaging and entertaining film with a great soundtrack",8,25 October 2017,"Baby Driver is the newest film by director Edgar Wright, who is famous for making some of the arguably best British comedies of all time with the Three Flavours of Cornetto Trilogy. After a four-year break from directing following the conclusion to the trilogy in the World's End, Wright resurfaces with 'Baby Driver', a worthy addition to his filmography. The film follows the story of 'Baby', a young man who works as a getaway driver for a mob boss to whom he owes a debt. Music is a huge part of Baby's life and this is used as a central plot point: a lot of the time the music he listens to is used as the soundtrack and the scenes are filmed accordingly. This is a very ambitious and arguably unique concept which Wright pulls off well and which helps to keep the film moving throughout. Wright went with a cast of mostly small-scale actors but with the addition of the two stars Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. This combination works very well and all of them, especially Ansel Elgort (Baby), deliver very convincing performances.There is a good blend of tension and humour in the film and coupled with Wright's unique and captivating cinematography it makes the film a very fun but at the same time engaging ride. Both the scripting and the pacing are good and the film does not get particularly boring at any point. However, the thing that undoubtedly stands out the most is the soundtrack. Wright uses a kaleidoscope of different genres yet all the songs seem to blend together seamlessly. From Egyptian reggae to Queen, from Hans Zimmer to Simon & Garfunkel, each song has its place and fits perfectly into its respective scene. Baby's dancing performances, especially in the brilliant one-take shot at the beginning, only manage to add to the already great atmosphere created by the soundtrack.Overall, Baby Driver is one of Edgar Wright's best films to date and through a combination of great cinematography, good acting, humour and a unique, well applied soundtrack, it is most certainly a film worth seeing.",Baby Driver
715,AndyMahooney,That's my Baby.,10,5 July 2017,"A red Subaru rolls into frame. Vivacious guitar riffs and drumbeats dictate camera cuts, alternating between the four characters within the vehicle. The three that exit are bank robbers, about to perform their rightful duty. The driver stays with the car. With sunglasses and earbuds intact, he begins to lip-sync coolly to the track that blares with immense energy. Soon, that sweet engine revs and we do not stop drifting, baby. During a movie, it is easy to disconnect and greet the monologue inside your own head. Baby Driver does not give you time to do this. It is so well paced that its two- hour run time breezes by. Upon my second viewing, I could not believe how fast one scene fell into the other. A cool rhythm propels the film (not just the rhythm from the expertly selected soundtrack). The quirky undertone and blending genre elements feel fresh and inventive. For example, when you're nicely tucked into the tender romance- BAM- uncomfortable anxiety-consuming situation ensues. Conversely, feeling overwhelmed by too much suspense? SHAZAM: very funny joke pulled from thin air. Edgar does not want you to be bored, not for a moment; he cares about us- it is very nice. Let us talk technicality. The camera is always moving; fluidity moves a scene along. Whether intensifying a car chase, or adding sincere style to the creation of a sandwich, Edgar Wright knows a camera. Pay close attention to the scene after the title screen- feels like a continuous shot. (His idiosyncratic close-up quick zooms are also present, albeit restrained compared to his other films.)It is not often an action movie- let alone any movie- has this much to offer. A car chase heist thriller wrapped in a comedy with romance on top. All clichés are steered clear of. It is fun, engaging, unpredictable and purely thrilling. Not one to miss. When to go to the bathroom: The driver enters a room and bubbles are being blown. You have around a minute and a half until important information is revealed.",Baby Driver
716,shihanyu,"A brilliant display of music, editing, and action",10,1 July 2017,"Director Edgar Wright did not fail to meet expectations. In fact, he exceeded them to deliver a wonderfully soundtracked, very enjoyable film, well rounded with action and comedy.The film Baby Driver follows the story of Baby (Elgort), a robbery getaway driver who listens to music to drown out the ringing in his ears. He meets and falls in love with a diner waitress (James). Despite the couple's wish to leave the world of unenjoyable jobs behind them as they drive off to nowhere in particular, Baby's life of crime doesn't let him to do so as his boss (Spacey) and the muscle (Hamm, Foxx) continue to put him in difficult situations. The film is full of stunning car chase scenes, foot- tapping and head-bobbing soundtracks, and spectacular editing work.The acting is praise-worthy, especially with an all-star cast. Ansel Elgort plays Baby wonderfully, fully embodying the character and drawing the audience's attention. Kevin Spacey plays Doc and gives a good supporting performance as the callous mastermind behind each big heist. Hamm and Foxx play the callous and ruthless robbers and undoubtedly succeed in giving Baby a hard time. Lily James also gives a great breakout performance in the film.ON TO THE EDITING. Edgar Wright's past works (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, etc) all show his action/comedic genius with on-point sound editing and scene cuts. Personally, I believe Baby Driver may be Wright's best work because the intense, fast paced driving action allows for quick cuts that align with the rhythm and beat of whatever great song is playing on Baby's iPod. Even the characters interact with the music -- whether it is a character mimicking the loud blast of a grenade, cocking a shotgun, playing a make-shift piano, or shifting the car into reverse -- each interaction is a perfect note that makes the audience enjoy the film and song that much more. Overall, I believe Wright managed to succeed in what he sought out to achieve -- a comedic action film that is unique in film and sound editing.In my opinion, Baby Driver is a highly recommended movie that will be sure to attract and appeal to a large audience. Wright makes the viewer appreciate editing, so take note and enjoy the brilliance and the fun.",Baby Driver
717,colin_hewson,Didn't make it all the way through,6,20 March 2018,"To be honest, this film lost my interest in the first 10 minutes. I really don't know how these scripts get accepted through all the levels of Hollywood bureaucracy before being made into a movie. Millions of dollars spent on something so dumb and mediocre.The opening bank heist where he is meant to be some super getaway driver makes absolutely no sense. If he is that good why does he go screeching off backwards, drawing massive attention to himself with no clear plan of escape relying on pure luck to get away (the almost identical red cars on the highway that just sit there while a maniac driver races around them!!) Who would do that? Who would hire him again? Yes, I realise that it is for cinematic effect but it just makes no sense, and I have no time for movies that make no sense.The good points. The soundtrack is great. The action sequences are well done and very entertaining but this cannot make up for a flawed screenplay.",Baby Driver
718,chrisecasey,Kid with lots of potential has accident and goes into business as a getaway driver,3,11 October 2017,"Baby is his name. But the real hook is how Spacey's iconic ringleader character can present Baby to other losers in the gang as a flawed yet brilliant individual. His flaw, the ""Hum in the drum,"" ""makes him the best,"" line is delivered with perfection, and I had to sit on my hands to keep from applauding it. So, you might guess that the flaw becomes a gimmick. Baby's music provides the background sound track to the movie, and it's excellent. Motown gets much representation. The Damned, a band I once tried to copy, is also there. So, watch it just for the music. The nuances are what makes this pretty good. Fifties style diner, fifties style dream sequence, and the beginning of a love affair that will carry Baby through to the end of the movie has us believe that America is about working class values, even if they are slinging hash, and scoring ""easy money."" That last part, the scoring money, makes this a real seventies and eighties style story, recall shows like ""It Takes a Thief,"" movies like ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,"" and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" Well, for Baby Driver's similarities to those nightmares, I change my recommendation, anti-hero's are just plain passe, even if they dream of their girlfriends as bobby soxers next to gleaming yellow land yachts. There are better movies to see.",Baby Driver
719,tomreidsemail,Get-away heist movie with an awesome soundtrack,8,10 January 2018,"I gave this film a high 8 rating for a number of reasons - the opening car chase scene was the best I'd seen; the sound track; good plot and all the supporting actors were interesting in different ways. In fact all performances were captivating - even Baby's grandfather who doesn't actually say anything at all.I ""Sound Hounded"" the tracks while watching the movie - I don't usually do that - but it was that good and that relevant to what was going on on the screen that I had to. Anyway, I wasted my time because I immediately bought the OST after the movie finished.",Baby Driver
720,quickquirk,"Didn't quite kill it, but fun ride nonetheless",7,11 August 2017,"Baby Driver is an aptly named movie. Its cartoony, strange name sounds as incongruous as the life that the reticent but kind protagonist Baby is leading, or rather, has been forced to lead.A deft blend of humour, action, violence and fabulous music, Baby Driver doesn't burden itself with complicated motives or deep-seated psychological impulses. It merely gives you a wink and nod, invites you to hop on for a fun ride – then sucks you into Baby's closed-in, yet music-filled world from the get go.The characters of Buddy, Monica and Bats are quite obviously caricatures – little or no explanations are given as to why they opted for a life of crime, or how they met the big boss Doc, who commissions them for various jobs with different teams (with the exception of Baby), depending on the nature of the job and his whims.Quite frankly, as the movie unfolds to the joyful sounds emanating from Baby's iPod, neither would you care even if you had known their back stories. Everything is quite plainly, as it seems. Or is it? A skilled getaway driver who is an absolute maniac at the wheel, Baby, who suffers from tinnitus, is finally given the option of leading another life when he finishes a last deal for Doc, which will pay off his debt to the former.Even better – he finds a good reason to pluck the earphones from his ears and engage in some real conversation with a real person aside from a few mumbled phrases to Doc and his motley crew – he meets Debora, a music-loving, sparkly and spirited lass who someday dreams of hitting the road ""in a car she can't afford with a plan she doesn't have"".But madness and mayhem ensue with the appearance of the crazed Bats, well played by Jamie Foxx, down to the almost twitching suspicion lurking behind his every move. Suddenly, the game has turned dangerous, even menacing. Doc demands that Baby get back into the game, or risk the safety of Debora.What must Baby do – resign himself to a life of crime and violence – or risk everything he has to free himself? Credit must be given to Ansel Elgort, who plays Baby with a charming mix of pouty, silent rebellion, cockiness, confusion and pained suffering pooling in his eyes – caught in a game he never wanted to be in. As frightening as he is hilarious, Kevin Spacey plays Doc with gleeful abandon. His clearly enunciated threats offer a stark contrast to Baby's silent yet painful submission and affirmatives uttered through gritted teeth. Likewise, the pedestrian life that bright-as-a-button Lily James' Debora leads highlights the money-driven, hedonistic backdrop of Baby's world.When this world and Debora's reality meet head-on, Baby is forced to make his choice.Don't expect intricate plot lines – the storyline is straightforward and almost predictable. The moral message at the end is clear – all deeds must be accounted for, yet with a hint of hope at the end, it leaves you to come to your own conclusion.",Baby Driver

The movie started off on nice note but then somehow slows down and eventually picks up too much pace in second half. It's pretty hard to keep the interest alive all the time. I really loved the song selection and even noticed me nodding to few beats as well. The car action sequence were well shot too. But then the second half of the movie was so fast that it feels like they just wanted to end this but still wanted to keep it alive. Don't think if there was any need of few gruesome sequences.The story had so much potential and having some good cast along, it could have gone to great heights. But it disappoints in this area and turns out to be just another mindless action drama for light viewing.",Baby Driver
724,melissainoa,Ehhh,7,4 August 2021,It's the 3rd Act of this movie that ruins it for me. The concept was amazing and production was too but the insta-love and the last act were not it.,Baby Driver
725,g-unit1111,Edgar Wright's Best Movie Yet,10,6 July 2017,"Edgar Wright can really do no wrong. Hot Fuzz was a hit. The World's End was a hit. Shaun Of The Dead was a hit. But Baby Driver is a grand slam home run. Really, this movie is amazing and there's so much good about it that there's not much to say about anything bad in this movie.First, Edgar Wright has managed to create an awesome original movie that is not a sequel, remake, or reboot. And he has also managed to create a movie that is 100x cooler than anything Quentin Tarantino has made in the last 10 years. Really, this movie is cool on multiple levels. Baby is an intriguing character in his own right. As is his love interest, Debora the waitress. But when you add such veteran actors as Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm to the mix along with an eccentric cast of newcomers and veterans to the mix (like Red Hot Chili Peppers' bassist Flea), the film becomes something much more than a simple action flick.Second, the soundtrack. This is a movie set in modern times so it needs a modern soundtrack. Edgar Wright could have gone the 70's nostalgia route like so many before him. But this one is way different. It's like visiting your vintage record store. There's 30 songs on the soundtrack, all from various decades of music from the 1950s to the present modern era of music. Each track was meticulously chosen, and is more than just mere background noise. The songs often take on a life of their own and during the scenes, you can actually see the songs become a part of the scene. While most movies put the soundtrack in the background and try to burn as much music as they can, Baby Driver actually weaves the music into each scene and it becomes almost organic. Like the soundtrack is a secondary character in the movie.The songs in the movie are as brilliant as the movie itself. This isn't just some collection of nostalgia tunes slapped together for background effect, this is the real deal. You have such diverse and eccentric music as Queen, Beck, The Damned, Sam & Dave, Blur, Simon & Garfunkel, Barry White, Dave Brubeck, Focus, and more. After watching the movie, go buy the soundtrack. Preferably on vinyl, really, any other format kind of defeats the purpose. Although Baby himself prefers an iPod. So you can buy it on iTunes.Third, the action sequences. While it's best to go into the movie spoiler-free, the action sequences aren't just mere action sequences. They really make you want to go rent a Mustang or a Camaro and burn some serious rubber. This movie has some of the best action and driving sequences that have not been seen in a movie for a very long time. This is more in tune with some of the all time classic action films like Goldfinger or Bullit. Amazing action sequences combined with serious character development makes Baby Driver a really intriguing film.So in short go see this movie. Then crank up the tunes and burn some rubber. Then go watch all of Edgar Wright's other movies. Support originality in Hollywood.",Baby Driver

The music is a nice change and the driving scenes were entertaining, but every character was so over the top it was just corny. Even the old deaf guy who didn't speak somehow overacted.

728,rdoliva,"Mish mash of successful movies, formulaic and predictable",1,9 November 2017,"This is the film version of staring at a bowl of plain oatmeal. Even before the spoon is in you can taste the blandness in your mouth. Yes, it will fill you belly but there's no fun anywhere to be had.Baby Driver runs down the clichés like a fast food bathroom inspector with a check list. Troubled, idealistic young man runs afoul of local crime boss and is cornered into driving for his crews, something at which he excels. The crews consider him mentally-challenged, and he finds himself constantly challenged for this. Suddenly, young man meets young, dumb woman who works as a waitress at this cool-looking diner, with a fat, greasy strict boss (how unexpected). During a heist, things start spiraling out of control (wow, can you believe it?) and he must quickly figure out his exit strategy, which is so obvious he might as well have posted it to the local criminal bulletin board. Cops are portrayed as slow, incompetent buffoons, incapable of apprehending or stopping criminals even when they got them cornered (Rosco P. Coltrane level police work). Fellow criminal turns on Baby on a poorly-copied Terminator style hunt, but ruthless crime boss turned mushy bleeding heart shields the young couple and buys them some time to set up the ambush (which goes poorly, by the way). I could keep going, but I'm sure you get the picture.Baby driver delivers no dramatic plot twists, and from the start you know what will happen and when will it happen.I feel sorry for Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey, for this is not their finest work. Quite the opposite, in fact. But then again, we all gotta eat.The photography is nicely done, though.Two hours down and a few bucks the drain, if you can and are willing to spare them.",Baby Driver

It't too conventional, and it looks like a pretext to expose all the cool atributes mentioned before.It seems to me a movie very aware of itself, pure exhibition about Wright's skills.

From the get go the movie has the feel of a dream rather than a sound logical thought out story. The violence is senseless and the planning of the heists even more.

It's rare for me to write a review but having read some of the negative ones on here, I nearly missed a cracking film and didn't want anyone else to. The direction is superb, subtle, slick and reminded both me and my husband of a Guy Richie / Tarantino movie. Yes, the characters are a little stereotypical but they need to be. Everything kind of fits. Found myself uncomfortably laughing out loud at some points and really impressed by the cleverness of it all.

However, there are a lot of characters in the movie that are overdeveloped, underdeveloped, or just otherwise unnecessary. Eiza Gonzalez's character did not contribute much to the movie for me, and Jamie Foxx's character just got WAY too much screen time. Other than that, I would say that the action sequences are so incredibly good that you feel a bit bored during many of the dialogues. Also, there is a certain scene that kind of contradicts one of Spacey's superstitions that felt a bit contrived, stemming from an entire 10 minute aside that the movie could've just done without in my opinion.",Baby Driver
738,fb123,"Starts out great, falls apart halfway through",5,7 July 2017,"This movie had a lot of potential. It started out great, but it began to fall apart rapidly just after the halfway mark. A more complicated plot could have developed, but the second half just seems rushed. The movie could have gone in several different and more fulfilling directions, but it went full cheese instead. Disappointing. It ends up being just a variation of ""The Last Ride"" (2004). SPOILER ALERT It's a given that being in debt to a crime boss means your debt will never really be cleared, so that's okay for a movie.And you can suspend disbelief for driving physics and non-deploying airbags...But...Doc sending the third crew to meet with arms dealers was totally unnecessary for the job they had the next day, because they already had all the equipment they needed, so that whole scene was forced just for a plot device.Bats proved he was willing to kill for no reason, so there's really no reason he would have left Joe alive.There is no way Buddy would have been able to escape all those cops swarming him downtown. Then Buddy shows up again later after getting shot in the chest. Superhuman villains in a non-superhero movie tend to ruin the whole thing.Doc remaining in the place from where the heist was launched at risk of being caught for no reason (even though he knew it was botched) made no sense, just like his sudden change of heart in ""helping"" Baby made no sense.Oh and Jon Bernthal is only in the movie for about 10 minutes, so not sure why he was given top billing, when he's pretty much just an extra with a couple of lines.

741,jetlu,"It is very good, but still flawed",7,6 July 2018,"Baby driverI will say this first, baby driver is very good, but it is flawed. 
The characters in these movie are not really fleshed out, the back story of baby are shown with flash backs, and the consequences plays a major role in the movie, it is what makes baby special as an character. But the rest of the cast are pretty weak, and I'm not saying that baby's character is great, because it's not, all I'm saying is, everyone is serviceable, it's good enough.Now I will start talk about the stuff I like and then i will talk about the things I don't like. The movie looks beautiful, it's full of color, the lighting is great, characters have their own color, visually look spectacular. Edgar Wright's other films such as Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, both amazing films, but the color palette aren't that impressive to me. 
And you just can't not talk about the music in the movie, the choice of music is absolutely amazing, Edgar wright didn't just throw all these great musics into his movie, every song he picks fits with what is gong on, and it doesn't fee; cheap at all, because he in sinks the action with music. When I rematched the movie, I just can't help to think, how did he do it, every movement is apart of the music. When you pat attention to the sound design, noises on the street, bells ring when you walk in, every thing is apart of the music, as long it is part of baby's character. It is absolutely crazy, it is so creative and impressive, that every time I watch it, it's just jaw dropping. And the car scenes, it is probably the best I've ever seen. It's not like Fast and Furious, people just drive really fast and crash into each other, it looks fancy, every stunt they pull of looks absolutely unreal, it looks like something only happens when kids play around with Hot Wheels cars, it's so cool!
When I say the characters are serviceable, I don't mean they are bad acted, I think it is very well acted. I really can't name any character that is bad acted, I think this is the best I have ever seen Jamie Foxx performed, he is a very good villain, he is really threatening.Now I'm done with the good stuff, now it is time to start with the bad stuff. I really don't like the love story in this movie, I just don't buy it at all. I think all the story that doesn't do anything with the girl is great, but when she is on screen, the story just drops for me. I do understand they fall in love, but it happens so fast, they don't have enough screen time together, every thing just feel so rushed. I can see that they are in love, but I can't understand why would she give up her life for Baby!? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I am not convinced at all on this relation ship, the second she say she will go with baby, I feel like this is full of rubbish. And the last part of the movie, is not good as the rest of the film, the quality dropped a little in my opinion, there are some cheese lines, but I will let it pass.Everyone can tell that they put in a lot of effort in to the movie, and it definitely paid off, there are certain elements in this movie are just way too good, but this is not a perfect movie, there are flaws, but it is over shadowed by all the good stuff in this movie. I feel like we will never get a film like this, ever, because it is so unique, the action and music combine is so hard to top, that I really don't see people will try to do the same thing. It is good, and I defiantly recommend this movie.",Baby Driver

The cinematography and action are good as there are exciting car-chasing sense in the film. Acting is not great but acceptable thanks to Kevin Spacey.
On the other hand, the charecters are basic and unlikable and as I mentioned, they won't stay in your mind after the movie. For me the story was also very unclear and aimless.

The car chases especially feel fresh, new and exciting and when you throw the music that I mentioned earlier into the mix you will feel a real part of it. More than just cool moves to pumping tracks though, the action is actually choreographed to the music and the effect is amazing. Every gunshot, tire screech, car horn and movement works with the beat to give you an exciting scene experience that leaves you breathless and wanting more.Telling the story of a young man named Baby, who is a professional getaway driver (who needs music in order to complete his jobs), as he navigates through the criminal underworld he is caught up in. you may immediately start to make comparisons with the 2011 film ""Drive"" but let me stop you straight away, this is a very different film playing a lot less serious and dark. That is not to say that ""Baby Driver"" does not have its own dark moments but you are going to leave the theatre in a much better mood than you likely did with ""Drive""!The film is not without its flaws of course, you could say the base story seems a little cliché in places and some of the characters are a tad underdeveloped so their motives do not always seem clear and their actions seem to be purely there to move the story to the next scene. To be honest though, these minor issues fade away as soon as you notice them as frankly, you just don't care because the flow of the movie is just so good.""Baby Driver"" may not be a masterpiece in the traditional sense, but for me, and I am sure anyone that appreciates a film that is not just immensely enjoyable, but a film that has clearly had a lot of care and attention put into it. It is right up there.",Baby Driver

The acting is great and the film is shot and edited extremely well. The car chase/getaways are fun to watch and creative. The heist characters are well written. The music being synced to whats happening is fun and was done beautifully. The movie has re-play value and many memorable scenes. Baby's flashback scenes are done well and help make you feel for the character. It is a bit odd how Debora runs away with Baby even after he acts strangly around her and shots a man infront of her but, you could agree ""they were in love"" or something.TLDR: Good movie, fun and engaging, well made.",Baby Driver

The movie is visually and audibly beautiful with his killer soundtrack that fits perfectly with the action of the movie.But, in the middle of the movie, when he meets the girl, the movie becomes pointless and it gets really going. Like, there's no need for the movie to continue. Because of that, I'll give it a 6 even if the beginning and even the end is amazing. I feel that they stole a lot of time from me that I can't get back and that's bad because it could've been a really great movie without those empty, boring, pointless, useless moments between the beginning and the explosive and cute end.",Baby Driver

754,krissaddy,All you need is one killer director and lots of great songs!!!,10,30 June 2017,"There are no standards for a guy like Edgar Wright, he keeps making unique and original movies and sets his own standards. This is his most realistic movie to date and a little darker in tone than his earlier works. Nevertheless, I absolutely enjoyed the technical aspects of the movie especially the whole rhythm of the movie. How many movies have gun shots synced with the BGM or cars' gears shifting to the tempo of a song? This movie has so much rhythm in every aspect, be it the quiet moments or the insane chase sequences, the editing as usual in an Edgar Wright movie is captivating. It was as if Edgar Wright was conducting a choir... It was super stylish. I'm sure it will take another viewing to grasp some of the minor things that I may have missed in this fast paced piece of brilliance. Everybody knows by now that the movie's greatest feature is its killer soundtrack and I absolutely loved the way songs are used in this movie, they don't play passively in the background but are an extension of Baby himself. Everything in this film feels deliberate and carefully planned. I think Baby Driver will go down as one of the most original action/romance movies made in recent years. This is the third movie this year after Logan and John Wick 2 that I thought is a contender for future classic status. Baby Driver is a meticulously crafted masterpiece from a director who just can't make bad movies. Highly Recommended.",Baby Driver

Plot, this movie start with so brilliant way, i love how they introduce Ansel as Baby here, so fit for his character, and the second half of the movie too, maybe a little plot hole here and there and this second half that's why i gives it 9.. but i promise you that still many twist you would enjoy.2. Music, this is one of biggest part of movie, and i watch it because of this too, if you can, please watch this movie with your favorite headphones, thanks God i watch it on my PS4 and the music literally made me shake my head and hand even though so many new song for me from this.

Character motivations are non-existent. It's just a random mess of  pointless violence in the universe where every police officer has an IQ  of a carrot. The main protagonist is mix of typical ""my mommy died"" and  ""save the girl"" motivations.   Please - do everyone a favor. Don't watch this movie. Let Hollywood  starve themselves to death.

I'm more a fan of dark 'who done it' crime dramas but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it... maybe it just caught me in the right mood?This is one of those films that gets either fantastic or really lousy reviews & I always find myself drawn to those.I find a lot of the reviewers who gave it low scores may have missed the point of the movie. Someone stated that it takes itself too seriously & as far as I'm concerned it's not doing that at all. It's more a spoof than anything else. Some of the sound editing was very well done in the way that the sfx synced with the music. Sure that's been done before but it was very effective & besides, what hasn't been done before.The best way to observe this is to turn off your brain's analytical mode, grab some popcorn & just enjoy it for what it is; a fun rollick about a group of people who aren't very well suited to each other out on a crime spree.",Baby Driver

From acting to action to music to driving sequences it has it all. Except for the chemistry which I think it lacked between both Baby and Deborah. Coming to acting, we've got Kevin Spacey the cold ring leader, as expressionless as he can be in the role. Jamie Fox delivers' some dialogues like he was born for them. Some short witty ones and the long one and a half minute or more ones which is amazing to pull off. Reminded a lot of him from Horrible Bosses. Jon Hamm you beauty, from a sweet hearted criminal to a mad killing villain that's some great, to the core, acting. Angel Elgort as Baby has ruthlessness in his eyes while driving and acts top notch. Lily James was alright in her acting, the accent lit me off a little bit but otherwise it was okay from her.There are three main driving sequences and all three of them are excellently choreographed. I really liked the one with the SUV. If you got time and want to have some fun time, this movie is worth watching and especially in cinema for developing the right proximity with it.",Baby Driver

Yes, It could get a bit cheesy and yes, Lily James' character is slightly stupid, but all of the flaws could be cleared up by saying that Edgar Wright knows this. He made this film was such style. Just watch the opening scene of this movie and tell me that Edgar Wright is not a master in what he does. Watch the tequila Scene and tell me that isn't awesome. Ansel Elgort is amazing, as well as all the other performances. There isn't much else to say. This movie is simply awesome and one of the best!Baby Driver - 10/10",Baby Driver
766,ml70,Impressive review spamming,1,10 January 2018,"The biggest feat of this movie is how many paid spam reviews they managed to stuff in so that it'd look a must see. But they overdid it and the effect is rather comical. One would have to be blind not to see it, nothing we wouldn't have seen before, but this time they went full retard and twisted the spam knobs all the way up to 11. Still at 7.7, whereas it'd actually belong somewhere around 3.7.The actual movie has nothing going on for it, strictly made for an early teens audience. Trying to make everything look cool but overdoing it, amplifying the spam review effect until it looks like a pile of dung being propped up by makeup, samba costumes and antique audio tech. And the music, the overpowering music everywhere.

At first I thought the whole thing was just going to be 2 hour Subaru WRX commercial but it certainly was not, as the vehicle changes on each op and Baby's skills are exceptional in any 4-wheel vehicle. This is not a happy movie, there is a dark sense of humor and some moments of hope.

772,mistermclazo,"""Baby Driver"" - A Thrilling Film with Charisma and Charm",9,4 June 2018,"Baby Driver is the perfect film for a casual moviegoer with a thirst for action, romance, and heart. It perfectly portrays the world in shades of grey, unlike the majority of blockbusters, showing only our world in black and white, good versus evil. A story of love and loss is just one of the numerous appealing parts of this film. Baby, as played by Ansel Elgort, is our lovable and heartfelt protagonist, who meets a waitress named Debora, and falls in love with her, all while experiencing a life of action and peril as a getaway driver.Now many will tell this off as 'another action movie', which it is not. It has a deep message about the world and what we perceive as evil and bad, and about love and relationships. This film is also now famous for its incredible use of nostalgic music, like The Champs' ""Tequila"" and The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's ""Bellbottoms"". It has well-coordinated action scenes, that have subtle timing and clever hints at the plot slipped in. This was Edgar Wright's near-perfect film, and it was as beautifully crafted as it was plain old action and car racing. Another plus is that the visual and practical effects are very impressive. I really can get immersed in Baby's world and not get seriously pulled out by anything.Kevin Spacey's character, Doc, is a well-written tough guy with a soft spot for Baby and Debora, who really gives the movie a humorous and lighter-hearted feel. A great antagonistic performance was given by Jon Hamm, who knocks it out of the park as Buddy, as well as Jamie Foxx and Eiza González as Bats and Darling respectively. Lily James depicts Debora, Baby's love interest, and acts very well, and is as entertaining as Baby in almost every department. She really steals every scene she's in. Last, but certainly not least, is CJ Jones as Joseph, Baby's deaf foster father. He possibly gives the most convincing and great performance in the entire film. Other notables include Jon Bernthal, Flea, Lanny Loon, Sky Ferreira, Lance Palmer, and Hudson Meek.The only major problem I have with this film is that Edgar Wright occasionally makes it painfully obvious what he wants to do. The message usually gets across very well, but the way it's presented can get a little forced. But like I said, only occasionally.This film is a great action movie, filled with a true passion for what's being filmed, and complete with memorable performances by Ansel Elgort and others. I very much recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a fun movie with a message to tell. 9 out of 10!",Baby Driver
773,filups,"Shallow characters, but great music and entertaining action",6,22 April 2018,"First off, given that the movie is centered around a completely ridiculous premise (that driving really fast is the way to get away with crime), I came in with low expectations, which is good, because you won't find much here in terms of character depth or development. The plot is Hollywood at its ""finest"" (good guy beats bad guy and gets/saves helpless girl). But the action is very entertaining, the dialog is mildly funny (again, don't over-analyze it (and by ""over"", I mean ""at all"")), and the soundtrack is fantastic (thank you Guardians of the Galaxy for inspiring this). So if you're looking for a bit of brainless entertainment, consider Baby Driver.",Baby Driver

It felt like a made for T.V. movie and a bad one at that.Total waste of time and money.",Baby Driver
775,nctracksquirrel,"Entertaining, Styled, and Fun Movie!!",8,19 October 2017,"This movie will want to make you go out creating your own playlist of songs and listen to it while driving!! I'll give you the PROS, CONS, AND VERDICT.PROS: If you are really passionate about music or you're just a plain music geek (in a good way) you will love the soundtrack to this Edgar Wright film. One thing that Edgar Wright does so well in his films are making them brilliantly fast paced. Which I enjoy. All the driving/chase scenes in Baby Driver are directed and shot extremely well. A fresh take of something that is done differently is how the movement of the movie goes along with the music in the background. It feels like a subtle action musical.Another thing that's pretty subtle in this movie as well is most scenes are from Baby's point of view of everything that he sees and hears. So it kind of puts you in the shoes of Baby in a way. Examples would be when he listens to music (of course), during the second heist when he drives forward a little to not watch the violence and backs back up, in his car crash flashback, and near the end when Buddy shoots near his ears then the ringing sound starts. The acting and dialogue in this film is entertainingly a job well-done. The last thing is the love interest Debora. Now this is a topic of the movie that some people have a problem with. People say that they don't believe someone would go through all of what Baby did by the third act of the movie for a girl he literally just met days ago. My explanation for that is there's a bunch of evidence throughout the film that Debora reminds Baby of his own mother and Baby loved his mother very much, before and after she died. That's why Baby has a strong bond with her and of course for other obvious reasons.CONS: At the beginning of the movie when the crew was switching cars in the parking garage. A tad nit picky but Baby wasn't wearing any gloves, which means his finger prints were all over the steering wheel in the previous Red Subaru. I know I explained earlier in the ""PROS"" on why Baby did all of what he did for Debora, but I SOMEWHAT don't understand why Debora waited for Baby for 5 years to get out of jail. For some people that's not long. But I look at it in a way that it is a long time. I just wish they could have gone in more depth with their relationship just a bit more.VERDICT: Some reviews I read tried comparing this film to the movie ""Drive"" starring: Ryan Gosling. I won't lie, yes I can definitely see how people would compare it to that movie. But don't go making bad reviews for movies just because it was like something else or you're expecting it to be better or just like a similar film you have seen your past. Overall I went into this with a mindset of ""Baby Driver"" being its own film (like I do for every film) and I had a blast watch it. Rating 8/10!!!",Baby Driver

A baby-face driver has an instant crush with a blondie, a good-looking guy with a hot Mexican chick, a black guy who appear to be a pain in the ass and can't stop bragging, and the only spotlight of the movie: a calm mastermind who decided to be good guy in the end with a can't-be-more-dumb reason.

Characters are well developed and well performed by the performers while some of them didn't like for the character ""Bats"" played by Jamie Foxx performance was underwhelming that feels like he is playing a wrong character while Kevin Spacey(sigh) didn't do much but at least he embodies the character and he does look good wearing a suit .

The standout facet of this movie is the soundtrack that plays like a very long mixtape. The songs are placed accordingly and once again pushes the limits of an action movie,aside from all that there happens to be one quibble that I have...the language, to me language use is obnoxious, disconcerting and is an excuse from writing additional dialog.

Second I felt that the character buildup for all the characters was really bad like at the end I still dont know why each one of the thiefs is at the point that they are in. Third alot of unexplainable plot holes and descions throught the movie, like why does Doc suddenly change his mind and help Baby & Debora at the end.Overall I would call this a popcorn movie ( just for fun ) like dont watch this movie expecting much or something new its a typical action movie.",Baby Driver
791,dr_pookenstein,Baby needs changing,6,28 June 2017,"So wanted to like this. I'm a massive fan of Wright's previous work and he can make good films that don't star Pegg and Frost (see Scott Pilgrim) but Baby Driver just didn't work for me. I think it has to do with expectations. Baby Driver just doesn't have the winning goofiness of Wright's other work and just came over as loud and obnoxious. The characters, bar Baby and Debora are totally unlikable and the 'music' concept is stretched way too thin. Wright seems to abandon it too as the film devolves into a shouty, sweary, shooty denouement that we've seen a million times before. I can't understand the critical praise heaped on this film. I think it has maybe presented something of a palette cleanser for critics who've been CGI'd to death this summer, but personally I was really disappointed.",Baby Driver
792,Capybara29,"Completely silly waste of time -- for teens and under ONLY, if that",1,3 July 2017,"With all the hype over this movie, I had to come in here and try and be one little island of reason amidst the ocean of insanity. For the life of me, I cannot understand how it's getting any praise at all, let alone heaps of it. The premise/plot is colossally stupid, so it's check-your-brain-at-the-door stuff from the get-go. But even within those cartoonish parameters, there is not one interesting story element nor compelling character to be found. The movie is cliché after cliché. It has this one parlor trick, which surely you've heard about, where it often syncopates the (ridiculous) action with the music track. To which I reply, okay, fine. In no way do I see how this somehow elevates the terrible script and two-dimensional characters. At no point did I care about what happened to anyone. I hate to overuse simple descriptors like ""dumb"" or ""pointless,"" but honestly, I can't use them enough about this movie. If I can save one over-13 person the waste of time, I will feel like a hero. Please save your money!",Baby Driver

794,TobBec210,"A great musical experience, but a film full of clichés",7,24 July 2021,"This film is a wonderful example of how music can be used in films, also the depiction starting from a getaway driver is a wonderful idea. Basically there are many action films in this direction, yet there is a good reason to prefer this other one. Not only because the action and the jokes fit and fit well into the film. But also because of the unusual design of the film and the unexpected ending.",Baby Driver
795,ediesimpkins,A Stunning Spectacle that speaks for Wright's ability to Direct engaging films.,7,16 August 2021,"First and foremost, this film has a precision that is faultless. With its music and pace, it flows so effortlessly from scene to scene in such a clever way, you can grasp how much thought went into every single shot. This is what makes Edgar Wright such a good director. It is sort of his auteur in a sense, using visual and audio language in a way that is symbolic to convey meaning - which is refreshing to watch. Watching this film, it can be enjoyed as a performance as well as a story. The music speaks for how we follow Baby's narrative, as we, like him, are consumed by the music.The only part of this film that wore on me was the slight cliché of the actual plot itself. It relied a lot on its style and aesthetics rather than a story that kept you on your toes. Casting majorly attractive stars such as Ansel Elgort and Lily James to fall in love in this romanticised, quirky retro world seemed to constantly propel me back into awareness and ruining my immersion. It reminded me I was watching an unrealistic spectacle to appeal to younger audiences. Baby is just a 'good' bad guy who went the wrong path and just wants to run away to live his 'happily, ever, after' with Debora. I think the plot could've improved by including some back story into:-Baby going down the wrong path and 'joyriding cars' as it was mentioned. This would've provided more gravitas to how he may have been a troubled kid, how he regrets his choices, how he's a changed guy which would ultimately let the audience empathise with his character more.-Why Debora was interested in Baby, other than his good-looks. I personally don't enjoy the stereotypical female love interest who fawns over the main character in classic 'Lynx bodyspray' advertisement fashion (if you know what I mean).-The relationship he had with his mother as it seemed to play such a key role in his character.Saying that, it has a refreshing originality with Baby's character having tinnitus and his obsession with music. I'm not certain, but this could be relating to his character possibly having autistic traits, and if so, is an interesting element to explore in film.Overall, I would recommend watching this film if you want a classic action/romance with a quirky modern edge to it. A very cool film.",Baby Driver

Franchise flicks struggle with pacing because you have to think about what's to come. It's not a complete work of fiction so you have to compromise. Not so with original flicks. Wright doesn't sequel bait in the slightest, and it's refreshing.He reminds you why you're sitting in a cinema watching a film instead of sitting in the cinema watching some CGI team hog the PS4 controller. He does intelligent visual and auditory comedy which cannot be done in video games, in books or on radio. His previous films have had mostly visual comedy, but Baby Driver goes all in on the auditory alternative.Action scenes sync to Baby's music, creating what feels a bit like an action-musical in some scenes. He gets the ratio right - the characters aren't dancing around in the action scenes, they're still fighting. Gunshots match to beats, that sort of thing. If you like a healthy dose of soul, blues dripping rock, Motown, even heavy metal, then you'll love the soundtrack.One moment you're in mindless action, the next you're suddenly in a romance, then the musicals break out. It's a bit all over the place but comes together convincingly enough for me to recommend it to all audiences. An A-list cast doesn't hurt.See it in the cinemas or on a home cinema with good surround sound.9/10",Baby Driver
799,Jay73271,Like one long ipod commercial,5,4 November 2018,"While it certainly had its moments, at its core this is a getaway movie heavily focused on its soundtrack. The music itself seems to come from a specific period of maybe 1960s r&b, and its all decent enough but personally i think it makes a poor substitute for dialogue, since i signed up for a movie and not a music video.Some of the characters were okay, but mostly everyone was puzzled as to why our protagonist spoke very little. I was too. Ironically they couldve cut out some dialogue that just seemed repetitive in like of his character. Its like the dialogue thats used in other dramas to tell the viewer what to expect from a character, and then that same pattern keeps continuing throughout the entirety of the film.Overall, decent but nothing too exceptional.

When I saw it I thought it was going to be my new favorite film. But after that it took a nosedive into boyish nothingness. I hoped to see more of that genius I glimpsed in Scot Pilgrim in Wrights work. Or at least to see him progress, and I guess he has, a little. But please, the teenage diner dialogue, between Baby and Deborah? And even the story itself. If you're gonna play with cliche's you've got to do something with them, it's not enough to use them. I kept consoling myself with the idea that Edgar is still a boy, he's a young writer, director, but alas. Wright would be better at adaptions.

806,alistairpmcduffie47,Edgar Wright in Master Class form,8,31 July 2017,"When it comes to the art, there are few filmmakers who create and perfect their own signature brand. Tarantino, Scorsese, Kuebrick and many others all share distinct characteristics that make there films recognizable to those serious about cinema. The men listed above are all Master Class in my opinion and dare I say Edgar Wright is on his way to joining them?SummaryBaby Driver follows a young man who goes by the name ""Baby"" (Elgort) who is what the title suggests, a Driver and a damn good one. His talents led him to becoming the prized getaway driver for a group of criminals. With his heart not aligned with the lifestyle and actions of his co workers he seeks a new start, especially after becoming interested in a girl. It is until he finds himself ready to abandon the life he finds out how intertwined he really is. ReviewPros Referencing back to the intro, the first 6 minutes of this film shows why Wright is in a class only a few are in. The scene uses its soundtrack to act as choreography, every snare hit and kick means something and are perfectly timed to the world our characters are in. We the audience soon realize that music is more than just a soundtrack in this film, but provides an arc for our characters, especially Baby. We learn a lot about him based solely off of the music being played, which is unlike anything I have seen at this level. We then proceed to a long tracking shot of Baby navigating to a coffee shop, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful shots of 2017. I never thought Watching someone get coffee would be this entertaining. Wright does a good job from the start of putting us into this kids world while simultaneously showing us why he doesn't belong in it. The casting choices were all good and added different elements to the story. Baby was the only one tied to music physically through his iPod, but each character was choreographed as if they were listening too. The action was shot really well especially the getaway scenes, both on foot and in the car. The car chase scenes are pure brilliance making The Fast and The Furious movies look 2nd tier. Edgar truly kept me engaged and I never felt cheated in any scene. ConsMuch of the film focused on visuals to the point where I felt some characters were a tad bit flat. Subtracting Baby and Doc (Kevin Spacy), I felt the others could have had a little more substance. Some of their decisions and actions felt somewhat robotic in my opinion. With that being said Buddy (Hamm) and Batts (Foxx) did shine in a couple of scenes due to them being quality actors. With this being said please understand that even this didn't ruin this movie due to them still being entertaining characters. Lastly the only other minor issue I had was the romance. Although there was nothing wrong with the acting or chemistry between the characters, it was just a little difficult to believe or get invested in.Conclusion/GradeWhat makes Baby Driver great is that it is a unique experience and is visually stunning. Edgar Wright does a great job of blending action, suspense, romance and comedy making it one of the most enjoyable films of 2017. 8.1/10",Baby Driver

Spacey as the brains and boss of the operations added nothing unique to his all too familiar ""Man Who Knows All Essentially Monotone"" style of portraying characters over the years, another Big Yawn.

Because logic?Bad guys are unprofessional, lunatic criminals and unnecessarily bad, Jamie Foxx is bad for the sake of being bad, the couple are annoying, and Jon Bernthal was the same character as Jamie Foxx, only ion the film for a few minutes then just replaced him for some reason. Because Kevin Spacey never uses the same crew twice, why not? Who knows..Baby was hired because Kevin Spacey saw him stealing his car and thought ""This guy can steal a car, therefore he's perfectly qualified to be a getaway driver."" Okay..Then the girl who has like one date with Baby and is prepared to give up her life for him and even waits for him 5 years to come out of prison. Oh dear.The chase scenes become ridiculous as the couple constantly escape drones of police, and Jon Hamm then becomes the terminator, then absurdly hunts Baby.The gun exchange was silly and had nothing to do with the heist, only to show off how insane and recklessly erratic Jamie Foxx is, why would you hire such an unprofessional nutjob..I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea of the mess of a film this is.Disappointing.",Baby Driver
809,kevindehulsters,This is why I love movies,9,28 June 2017,"I was able to watch Baby Driver during an advanced screening last week and and yes it's as amazing as the critics say it is. The way it uses the music is just so great. It's so different from all the other movies, but it isn't artsy in a way that only the critics will like it: this is a movie for everyone. I went with a friend who is really hard to please when it comes to movies, but I just knew he would love this. And I was right, I never saw him as excited about a movie as he was about this one. It's just so much fun to watch, but it's also serious when it needs to be and it has very intriguing characters. But I'll be honest, the core of the movie is its music. I think this is the second time I say it, but the music works so well. If I wasn't in the theaters I would sing with the songs. Even though it's completely different, it reminds me a bit of Fury Road in the way that it makes you want to punch your fist and the air and cheer during the movie. In reality I think it's more a mixture of La La Land and Grand Theft Auto (it's definitely not a musical by the way). Go see this movie. I don't want to overhype anyone, but I'll make a bold statement and say this is my favorite Edgar Wright movie. I'll be shocked if this doesn't appear on many 'Best of the Year' lists in December, at least I already know it'll be on mine.",Baby Driver

And this is my pet peeve about current Hollywood industry - your dumb as f**** chase scenes: - guys does stunts with traction controls on, and then lock up wheel showing no abs - WTF ?! grow up ! - stop showing a driver changing gears in manual box, it's not exiting, whole f*** word can drive manual boxes beside of you ... it's not fascinating, it's not smart that the guy holds the shifter like a penis either. - stop showing this blazing speeds approaching 80mph ... it's not back to the future and he will not travel in time when he crosses 85 !!! c'mon whole world drives faster than that without being chased by police ... your approach is laughable ! - if you want to be responsible, rather than showing this stupidly low speeds, show that passengers fasten a f*** seat belt, guy does stunts and everybody in the car seem mildly inconvenienced - guy slams the anchor at speed to point of locking the wheels (again no abs) and everybody just seem to look around trying to figure out what he's trying to accomplish ...

Although the ideas behind the characters were interesting, most of them turned out flat with little or no development.

The action and driving scenes are amazing and well thought out. They keep you on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is perfectly timed with the action and the music itself is awesome as well.

If you're going in expecting a classic Edgar Wright movie, I would be a little careful. While it does retain plenty of what makes him so awesome, it is also clearly a departure from the styles of the Cornetto trilogy or Scott Pilgrim. The way the action is choreographed and yet so real is so instantly satisfying, you'll wish you could watch it again and again. Now, it's not a comedy so it's much less funny than the rest of Wright's films but the moments of humor are definitely big laughs. The acting, particularly of the supporting cast, is flawless. Lastly, and this is a spoiler, this movie is not afraid to kill off major characters. They have real consequences to their actions and that's a very interesting quality in a movie with such a mainstream audience. Highly recommend, going to see it again on opening night.",Baby Driver

Kevin Spacey was great as always (sure, that's a little biased since he's one of my favorite actors), although I wish he had a little bit more screen time. Jon Hamm really nailed the bad-ass bank robber role. Lily James was amazing. I've never seen her in anything until this movie, but I thought she did very well. Eiza Gonzalez fit her role like a glove and did very well, especially with her Oscar-worthy diner speech. There was definitely some things that can be questioned in this movie like some of the decisions made by some characters as well as scenes that seemed rather pointless and had no contribution to the overall plot, but those things can be overlooked, especially by me. I also thought the second half or final third of the film was sped up a little just for the sake of making this film under 2 hours, which made things a little confusing, but still, I had little trouble overlooking this.

I was expecting a bit more out of this, now don't get me wrong I thought it was a very good film but I don't believe it deserves as much praise as it has being getting.The soundtrack was disappointing to say the least it had good songs but not great songs, it felt like it was limited by the budget. These songs didn't hype me up, however the action scenes were tailored for the songs and this worked really well it made the action scenes exciting even if the songs alone weren't very exciting.The story in this movie was pretty weak, it felt very generic and uninteresting. Usually this would be a massive flaw but it didn't affect the movie at all, the movie wasn't story based it was all about the dialogue and the choreography in the action sequences.Saying that the action in this movie was very good and I can't count the number of times in the movie that I was more than impressed by an intelligent camera movement or choice in the action scene.The dialogue was also very intelligent, it wasn't that it was hilarious but it had a very fun attitude to it. None of the comedy in this movie was completely hilarious but it was all intelligent even if it didn't make me laugh out loud often it was still very funny.If you're looking for a really good movie you won't be disappointed by this movie but if you're looking for something equal to hot fuzz or Sean of the dead you will most likely be disappointed.",Baby Driver

824,caitlinmarieangelo,It's such a fun movie!,10,2 January 2018,"I've been a fan of Edgar Wright since I first saw Shaun of the Dead around 2009. Since the release of The World's End, I've been eagerly awaiting whatever he had in store for us next. The result was Baby Driver, and though I had a few doubts at first that it might not live up to the hype I had for it, it proved itself as one of the best movies of the year. There were no truly perfect movies this summer, and Baby Driver was no exception. There were a few problems with the characters, none of them having a distinct traits that would make them memorable to everyone, not just fans of Wright, and the only character who has any sort of development is Baby, however I still enjoyed this movie. Wright wasn't trying to create an Oscar worthy storyline, he just wanted to create a fun movie, and he exceeded my expectations. So, while not an especially good movie, it is filled with exhilarating stunts, perfect soundtrack, directing that resembles Tarantino standards and an action packed third act, all of which should keep the viewer entertained. Edgar Wright has most certainly shown us what he is capable of!",Baby Driver

826,Lebesgue,Movie for teenagers - full of clichés,2,23 July 2017,"I went to a movie theater with open mind. Was looking for a movie to watch and then I noticed that Baby Driver has really high scores everywhere. I quickly checked the synopsis and it looked promising, especially the bit about matching scenes with music and about music being the driver of the movie. So without doing any further due diligence I decided to give it a shot. It was one massive disappointment. As other reviewers who gave this movie low ratings, I cannot understand why would anyone hype this movie. The main problem if the movie are ridiculous plot full of clichés. I mean, I have seen it all countless of times. Awkward teenager meeting a cute girl and having awkward conversation with her and then starting to date her? Check. A teenager who is involved in the crime but who has a good heart and hates hurting people? Check. Villain who likes to kill everyone around and who uses violence even when buying a pack of chewing gums, just before a heist? Check. A villain that refuses to die? Check. Etc. The list goes forever. Not to mention that the movie is as cheesy as it gets. Now, what about the music you may ask? Wasn't that one of the selling points of the movie. In all seriousness, I was less than impressed. The music is OK, but nothing special and rather forgettable. At no point I thought it was exceptionally good and it seems to me that this talk about music driving the movie is simply marketing trick and there is little truth in it.Let me just add that there were two teenagers sitting next to me during the movie. When the movie finished I overheard one of them saying ""My brother told me that the movie was s*** but I think it was really good"" and the other one agreeing. Well, I bet 10 bucks that her brother is a few years older than her because the only audience that can enjoy this movie are teenagers. If you are not, do yourself a favor and skip it.",Baby Driver
827,hazeleng,Tries too hard to be cool,6,7 August 2018,"Even though it was an enjoyable movie, I was mostly bothered with how hard it tries to fit in with the cinematic cliches. The whole movie is so bothered with aesthetics and so in your face that it gets annoying, Its classic ""hollywood"" type movie even though they try so hard to hide fact by using all the ""cinematically aesthetic cliches"". Aside from that enjoyable if you're looking for an average car robbery movie.",Baby Driver
828,archersasuke,An action-packed music-induced funride!,9,7 October 2017,"*Just to note, ""Do You Find This Review Helpful?"" doesn't mean if you agree with the reviewer's opinion or not, but rather, it means if the review actually describes the film, and what are its pros and cons. So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Also, minor and unnecessary spoilers are here!Baby Driver is one of the best films I've seen so far this year. A great addition to Edgar Wright's filmography, though it's not his best film.There are lots of pros than cons in this one. But I mean, we're talking about Edgar Wright so... First of all, the sound editing is Oscar-worthy. Seriously! The way the music syncs with the action, or even small tidbits of the characters' movements, it's so refreshing to see in an action film. I think not much people have done this fully in feature length films like this, which is quite an achievement, if you ask me. The cinematography is top notch, too. Since it's an action film, you, of course, need to watch the action and the stunts/choreography of each scene in films. And thank heavens this movie isn't a cut-to-cutfest. And when it does use cuts, it actually shows what the characters are doing! Learn from this guy, Hollywood!And another thing is, though the story isn't original, the plot isn't as predictable as you'd think it'd be. Sure, you would know what things would happen as the film goes on, but the thing is that you wouldn't really guess HOW these things would happen. Especially the ending, which disappointed some people, but really, I think it fits the film, only if you'd understand the motivations between the two leads (Ansel Elgort and Lily James).Speaking of the two leads, a major con for the film is that the romance between the two is under-developed. Knowing crap about music, and driving to different places isn't enough to make a believable romantic chemistry. I know this is an action film, but their chemistry is a major plot point for the film, meaning it has to be developed. Another thing is that Jon Bernthal is kind of wasted here. Literally, he's only in the film for, like two scenes or more. It's a shame, since Bernthal is a really good actor in films such as The Accountant, Fury, and this year's Wind River. This is a minor flaw, though. It's nothing personal.Other than the two flaws I have mentioned, this movie is amazing! It's action-packed, music-inducing fun ride 'til the end of the road! It's one of the best movies of 2017 so far! It's up there with Logan, The Big Sick, and Blade Runner 2049.Final Rating: A | 9/10",Baby Driver
829,MonsieurClaude,"Not memorable, but definitely enjoyable",6,22 October 2017,"I had little expectations about this movie, besides the decent ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb (a rating which has gone down the drain for multiples 1...clearly a harsh judgment by any means)Will this movie be remembered? I doubt. Its mainly thrills (if not purely), with no specific statements, important plot holes indeed, characters are indeed full of clichés (although the character of Jon Hamm is more contrasted than most of them) or without things that will make this movie unforgettable. Despite all these flaws, the movies has its positives and, for a Saturday / Sunday night movie, clearly pass the test: Picture is of good quality, acting was decent (the fact that the characters are clichés does not necessarily mean that the acting is bad - maybe easier to do, but not bad by any means...the roster of actors is quite a plus), the action scenes are not realistic but well produced and enjoyable...and obviously the soundtrack is strong, very strong, with very few ""easy cheesy"" tracks used. Without forgetting that the ending of the movie, if not astonishing, clearly hits the mark. A decent movie, for a decent chill at home watching an entertaining movie on a quiet weekend night",Baby Driver
830,allisonkooyman,Baby Driver,10,17 October 2017,"""Baby Driver"" is the modern car chase that people of all generations would enjoy. There is action, comedy, love, family and tragedy. Also, if you are someone who loves music, all types. Then this movie is a must-see. The movie is about 2 hours and about 20 minutes of the film consists on no music. Due to Baby, played by Ansel Egort, always having earbuds in, the story is told from his point-of-view. If he has headphones in, the the audience will hear the same song he is listening to. In one scene, Baby and his fellow criminal associates, played by Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Eiza Gonzalez are sent to pick up weapons from a friend of Doc, played by Kevin Spacey. Jamie Foxx's character Bats, goes crazy and starts shooting all of Doc's weapons traders. Baby avoids and hides although he listening to the song ""Tequila"" and the movement of the fight, the sound of the guns and the overall movement is matched and choreographed perfectly to the sounds of the song. In the scene, there were tons of shots in the about 1-2 minutes scene because of all the action and noise going on and the fast paced song. Although, Baby is disappointed because he meets a young woman, Deborah played by Lily James. Baby now realizes that he wants out of the life of crime and being the get-away driver for Doc and live a white- picket fence family life with Deborah. Unfortunately, Baby has to find a way out to keep the love of his life. Baby is almost a mute. He rarely speaks and even mentions in the movie that he has talked to Deborah more in one night than anyone else all year. To see his how Deborah has changed him into the better person and allows him to become more vocal about getting out of crime and loving her and do whats good for society rather than steal. He changes for the better and it happens at a good pace. Baby does everything to protect Deborah from getting involved with these people. That is why some people have died, so Baby can protect Deborah. Whenever Deborah is around, a song filled with happiness and love is there. When Baby is driving and getting away, the song is fast paced and when he is just walking around, it is a calm and unemotional song. The whole movie is a 2 hour soundtrack. Once again, for anyone who loves music, this is an amazing movie. It is one of my top 10.",Baby Driver
831,fredericeeckman,I didn't get it...,5,27 September 2017,"I'm still trying to wrap my head around the high score for this movie. I wouldn't say it's bad, but it's certainly not flawless either. It feels like it was just highly ranked because there is a ""new"" concept (all that fuss with the music...), but it lacks a LOT of things ! The characters development is non-existent, the story in itself doesn't make a lot of sense, the ""boss"" has no spine, and the love story is kind of forced inside our throat. I was bored, to be honest. Not a bad movie, but if you remove the music, what's left ?",Baby Driver
832,bramacolijn,"Decent heistelling movie, to bad the female roles where weak",6,23 April 2019,I really liked the build up in the intensity of the heist. Bought baby as a person and the gangsters where fine. But to believe Debora would follow him to the end after 3 meetings and 1 date I just cant buy. She didnt get enough depth and therefore she felt like the classic 'reward for the man' instead of an actual person in an actual relationship with baby. Thus the whole end felt very unsatisfying,Baby Driver
833,sebrahimi-06370,Baby Driver Wins With Audiences,9,29 March 2018,"Baby Driver is a clever, fast-paced, crime/thriller film. It is directed by Edgar Wright, and stars Ansel Elgort, Lily James, and Jamie Foxx. Baby Driver has a perfect mix of everything: action, comedy, a love story, and a bit of a tragedy. 
 The combination of up and coming with established Hollywood stars gives the movie a perfect balance. Baby (Ansel Elgort) and Deborah (Lily James) share an unconventional romance that captivates the audience from the start. 
 Baby Driver has an outstanding soundtrack. Somehow, the mixture of The Beach Boys, Queen, and the Commodores creates a confused, tense mood. The music is often out of sync with the plot line, being more upbeat than the actual mood of the scene. The use of music mesmerizes the audience.",Baby Driver

You can actually feel the struggle of the charaxtert, his pain, his dreams. Of course we all love the couple he and debora made. Plus it doesn't end like a fairytale, it actually gives us a happy ending, without unfinished cases, getting rid of his past legally and leaving his dream.

Everything down to gear changes, glances and the closing of doors is on beat with the music in these scenes.Don't worry if you think this is a musical. The BRILLIANT soundtrack is just played on key in the backround. What makes this movie special, is that the songs were chosen in advance and the scenes were made surrounding the music.I've got almost every song in my playlist, have watched it over 8 times and notice new things every time.

853,babygdav,"Trailer showcases high potential, wasted in the actual film",7,1 July 2017,"SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSThe trailer held great potential for this movie - smartly timed moves to energetic music, explosive car chase scenes, a budding romance.The actual movie - worth one discounted movie ticket for viewing at the theaters at most.Why?You start off with a catchy title 'Baby DRIVER' - so you'd think you'll be seeing Fast & Furious-style chases and such throughout, just like the trailer teases. Yet, the latter 1/2 of the movie is filled with long, long scenes of Baby.... RUNNING?!?Then, add on all the lost potential - You can easily sing away to the ending song of FF7, but here in Baby Driver, you can barely put together a La La Land-like soundtrack. It's a total scramble of odd songs from across genres that don't really fit together - more like the ramblings of the director's mind - and what you get is nothing that reaches as high as the very first bank robbery scene, which setup lots of anticipation for it's timed wipers, etc.Tack on paper-thin characterization - the assembled 'team' is barely interesting versus the FF team. Unmotivated and silly scenes.eg. Right, you go into a building to get weapons, hear a super long blab about port cuts, and only get offered 9 weapons?! And instead of picking the 'best', Jamie starts a shootout, picks up random weapons, and blows the rest up?!? So -stupid- versus FF, where the team is offered the best, and they build and take the best to offer the audience a truly awesome race/fight scene later on. In Baby, it's an aborted effort. Why offer the goods if you're just going to waste it all?eg. So many scenes are merely Talk, Talk, Talk, Talk.... all in the MIDDLE of an exciting fight/chase/etc. scene. Why, oh, why wasn't all this cut?? And you end up with a miserable ending versus the 'enemy' at the end. Baby steals one car, crashes it into the bad guy's car. Then, Baby gets out, steals another in the parking lot, crashes it again into the bad guy's car. Then, gets out.... you get the idea. Just how fast can one kid get out of a car, break into another, jack it, and drive it into the bad guy?! So unbelievable.... not only for the changing of cars, but now it's become ""Baby Car Crash"" rather than ""Baby Driver"".Spacey dies in an equally lame way in the end - simply shot dead. Not even uses the full potential of Baby here at all, who stands with his girl looking all stupid at the men coming to shoot him dead instead of 'Running' so well like he did earlier in the movie. Why, Baby, Why don't you RUN???? Because it's not a Driver movie anymore and you're facing death. The movie does stick with you afterwards and you do wonder, what if the fullest potential of the idea had been written into the movie? Imagine if it had Top 10 hits, rocking cameos by top singers, FF-style car chases, an amazing team fighting to escape the cops, etc. Yes, it would have broken Wonder Woman records and become a cult legend. Instead, Baby Driver slowly deflates after the first bank robbery and leaves everyone with a yawn at the end for the immature ending. (It's also unbelievable how the the girl is characterized - every girl I've talked to who watched it rolls her eyes at the unbelievable way she 'falls in love' all so suddenly.)You're also left with the tapes. Such unbelievable potential, wasted. It could have had Spacey listen to the 'Mom' tape, setting up the reason he protects Baby in the end and his life changes, realizing the 'love' he once had, but nope. Nothing done with it that would have moved the viewers. 7/10 because it's unique enough to stick in your brain for a day or two after. Otherwise, I'd rank it lower for the fragmented plot, weak characterization of most of the characters, poor pacing, etc.",Baby Driver

871,collin-sandoe,"Shiny and cool, but kind of obnoxious",6,10 January 2018,"After seeing this movie a week ago and talking to friends and family, I began to truly get a sense of how polarizing this movie is. To start though, I want to note what is remarkable about this movie: the soundtrack of Baby Driver is thrilling and executed with special attention timing. The main character, Baby has a special attachment to his ipod - a plot device that turns what would normally be non-diegetic music (not audible to characters) into diegetic music and thus a way for us to hear to everything Baby is hearing.
What this should have provided is a window into the character and a way for us to relate to Baby. However, where this movie falters and what I believe is its critical failure is how unremarkable but still cocky Baby is. We know that we are supposed to care for this guy (evidenced by the contrived heartfelt, yet superficial backstory that the writer threw in), yet I couldn't care about him less.
None of the characters are that interesting and the story completely lacks emotional depth.

The end was kinda bland for my taste but I overall enjoyed this film and I would recommend it to any film lover.The way the movie was shot was magnificent , the camera movement itself made it worth watching.If you're a casual movie goer this movie might be a bit strange but if you study or love the art of filmography...you will enjoy this movie more than most.the score is well deserved.",Baby Driver

The film is in perfect harmony, everything works like a big orchestra: the actors with the script and the camera and the colors, and the music. The soundtrack of the film is a tribute to music itself..wonderful, you sing and dance in every scene.The movie is not predictable, it surprises you! Also every aspect of the film is measured , not too much romance, not that much action: the perfect amount. Ansel Elgort has so much swag!!!! He is the perfect fit, a marvelous round character. Eiza Gonzales looks beautiful and really makes a great part, you believe her, unlike in every movie and soap she's ever acted. Kevin Spacey does an exceptional job playing ""Doc"", he really does a good job playing bad guys. Go watch this movie.. right now!!!!!!!!!!!",Baby Driver

876,WilliamOlympia17,The gorgeous flower among the desert of 'musclar' cars racing action films,10,30 June 2017,"It isn't embarrassing to say that Baby Driver is the most amazing movie about cars, music, love, crime,... that separated from the others movies of this kind. It is not only funny, crazy but also significant, meaningful and touching. 113 minutes I watched the film, I laughed, I cried, I be afraid, I felt the beat of those songs, and after that I clapped for such a wonderful action film. There are several reasons which makes it becomes the best movie of excitement, love, music, action... First, this is the movie directed by Edgar Wright. Absolutely, the talented director has lead the movie with the way that nobody can. There are always his passion, love and a little crazy which makes it be his own film. The 22-year- project is successful, which doesn't surprise me! Second, the casts are incredible, beautiful without any super stars. Ansel Elgort, who is my favorite since ""the faults in our stars"", returned to act the distinct play. Two Oscar winners are Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx. Lily James is impressive with classical beauty. Finally, the music is wonderful, the scenes are maleficent and some action scenes make my heart stop beating. Those features are Baby Driver, a perfect movie. I watched it and definitely I want to watch it again...",Baby Driver
877,apostolossioufas-06189,"Fresh, Fun and Original",10,11 July 2017,"*Plot*Without spoiling anything, the movie is about a young getaway driver, Baby (Ansel Elgort) who's parents were killed in a car accident. As a result of this event, he damaged his hearing and therefore, constantly listens to music to drown the humming noise in his ear. He is pressured into working for this kingpin (Kevin Spacey) and works as the driver of a crew in a series of robberies. Baby meets this waitress named Debora (Lily James) and falls in love with her. Arguably, this was the weakest aspect of the movie. This is because there could have been more emphasis on character development and the relationship between the two. Their relationship simply did not feel strong enough to justify the life changing and threatening decisions Debora made in the final third of the movie. However, despite this the plot was exciting and the pacing was spot on. 8.5/10*Cinematography* Baby Driver was a beautifully executed movie and it was a fresh breath of originality. This film has Edgar Wright written all over it. The action sequences are smooth and easy to follow and the colorful cinematography is gorgeous. Baby driver has the perfect blend of fast cuts and long shots which make the movie visually stunning. 10/10*Music*Baby Driver is an action musical. The music plays a huge role in the film and it is in perfect sync with all the shots and events that occur before us. One of the things that Baby Driver made me do is leave the movie theater desperate to listen to the entire music score and it is indeed a combination of a variety of different songs which perfectly suit the style and plot of the movie itself. 10/10*Performances*Baby Driver employed a greatly talented cast in Kevin Spacey, Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Lily James and Eiza Gonzalez. As one would expect the acting was fantastic from all of the cast members. 10/10It is definitely worth the watch. Edgar Wright does not disappoint!",Baby Driver

It was rated 8.0 I think when I watched it, which is typically really high, but this movie was a disappointment. Honestly the other 5 star reviews sum it up best. It's a fancy soundtrack with a very original way of approaching a narrative. In this case, trying very very hard to be original and not as hard to be actually entertaining to watch. My husband couldn't get over the non-sports cars that could amazingly outrun everything. If I had come in with no expectations, or streamed for free, I probably would have liked it more.

The sound track was gorgeous i listen to the soundtrack nearly everyday on spotify .The movie has great emotional elements, and great action aspects.

884,erinharringtonmobile,The Best of Edgar Wright,10,29 June 2017,"Immediately after seeing this movie the first thing I said was ""this is my second favorite Wright movie"". However after letting it sink in for a day, I now realize how much craft, technique and talent this movie took to pull off. As for craft, the editing in this film is clean, seamless and more than impressive. Unlike many quick cut action sequences, these feel continuous and you can actually map out the locations in your head, the audience is able to see the entirety of the stunts (which are all done practically). The gimmick of ""the movie is set to music"" does not feel forced at all, nor does it feel like a gimmick. This film uses music both as emotional weight, a soundtrack and as a story telling device, the soundtrack is beyond phenomenal. In terms of talent, the culmination of talent between director, actor, editor, stuntman, and musician is unparalleled. Ansel Elgort stands out in this role, after being confined to teen dramas, this is a breakout role for him. He brings a silent intensity to the role which perfectly contrasts the vibrant and absurdness of the world around him. Wright of course delivers in every way, his direction solidifies every aspect of this film. Bottom line: this is a movie for everyone, everyone will find something to enjoy in this movie. The audience in the theater was the most responsive, alive and invested audience I have ever been a part of. They winced at painful moments, cried at the romance and of course the comedic aspects of the film had everyone in stitches. This is the best film Wright has made, the Cornetto trilogy and Scott Pilgrim seem to be steps leading to this action packed, fun filled masterpiece.",Baby Driver
885,mrwwe-95402,Really really cool! Edgar Wright all the way,10,26 April 2018,"I didn't see this film in theatre, and boy I do regret that! Right from the first minute, the film keeps you engrossed. The dialogues are witty. The chase sequences are marvellous. Acting is great. Jamie Foxx totally kills it whenever he's on screen!The story is pretty simple but it's the way Edgar Wright has directed, makes this film so unique. I really don't understand the negative reviews this film has got by some people. I'd rather watch Baby Driver 3 times in a row than watching some ""classic"" movie released 40 years before my birth and saying that it's good just because others think so.Ansel Elgort does a fine job, but I wish they had a better actor than him. The supporting cast is stellar. Spacey does his role perfectly, so do Lilly James and Jon Hamm. But the standout is Jamie Foxx. Delivering dialogues with such humour yet with even more threat, something that he does effortlessly.Overall, baby driver is an awesome movie with nail biting chases and quick witted dialogue. And yeah, the music is really great, in spite of me not hearing any of the songs used in the movie. See, that's a good film. Not the one where you ""don't get it"" but convince yourself that you do.",Baby Driver

With voguish use of gaming 'speed,'we all know nothing resembling real life can move that quickly.Consequence? Two hours of adrenaline-inducing virtual action.

887,greenkoala-04895,Great plot with lots of action,10,10 July 2017,"I thought this was a very good movie because of the fast paced action/plot. It had action as well as romance and had different twists and turns throughout its story. The dialogue was excellent as well as smart. For a movie that's rated R, I'd say the biggest thing is the language; there were a lot of F bombs. The violence wasn't as bad as I thought it would be for a rated R movie. The ending was especially good because it left you in wonder as to if it was a dream or real life. I really like those types of endings because you can think of it in different ways. The soundtrack music in the background made the movie a lot more fun and, I feel, more laid back, but still kept it very exciting. I would definitely recommend this movie.",Baby Driver

And apparently it's armed robbery with an iPod on shuffle. Baby Driver is an all-guns-blazing action flick with more soundtrack than a musical and more fun than a theme park. It's crime with sunglasses on and I like the way it looks! And while the movie is super-funky-fresh, it's not without stereotypes and who better to deliver them than Jamie-mother-fucken-Foxx. Spacey and Hamm too, help remind us that this is still a big budget action movie and not . The movie's youngest actors are by far its best. Lily James makes you fall in love with falling in love all over again and Ansel Elgort and his Baby is nothing but cool an charm. The choreographed scenes of music, guns and cars takes what could have been another action scene and turn it into art. The direction, camera and sound are what make this movie unlike anything you'll see this year.",Baby Driver

891,stevekaj,Was it good?*scratch*,8,22 July 2017,"Baby Driver is a comedy/crime which is really hard to compare to any other film from these genres (except for other Edgar Wright's work). It takes the attention from viewer at the beginning to end while giving the big amount of perfectly fitting music. Action is really compelling, plot is smart, easy to follow and it encourages to care about our protagonist, Baby. It's not hard to predict what will happen in the first 30 minutes of watching but in second part of the film things are getting twisted, the whole crime/thriller mode is being activated with less amount of space for typical humour. The romance isn't the best and someone could say that it's the most flat and simplified part but for me relation between Baby and his ""just-met love from the first sight"" Debora came out quite natural and suitable to the rest of the movie.Casting was perfect. Jamie Foxx as gangsta/psycho is extremely believable, Kevin Spacey is very minimalist but his performance is so charismatic and gentle that he need only one statement to give unforgettable expression/scene. The rest of the cast act also with no big flaws. Too bad Jon Bernthal was there only for a short time.Talking about weak parts of Baby Driver is like talking about consequences of eating pizza - it's not worth its time. In the end we have some much fun with product which doesn't consider viewers as idiots (yes Baywatch, i'm looking at you). Although many things happen like in some fantasy (some elements of car chase, coincidences, romance part), it looks very realistic. We see character's motivations and how every situation escalates. Editing is on the highest level.Also I can't believe how interesting was presented conversation in sign language between Baby and his step-father.",Baby Driver

But give it a chance, I mentally respond to myself. It must have good ratings for some reason; maybe the plot will be gripping, or there are some interesting characters or themes.
Nope. Not a single redeeming quality.
The initially tantalising backstory unfolded into a flippant and uninspired gimmick. The love affair was a cliche in the strongest terms. The portrayal of the protagonist's hearing impairment did more to remind me of the miserable Daredevil (2003) than it did to add depth to his character. And the villain, oh the villain. Usually, a generic good villain character may exhibit some combination of eccentricity, wit, menace or charm. Baby Driver's antagonist exhibited only his prosaic arsenal of expletives. I even confess to watching Kevin Spacey's banal performance with an air of satisfaction in light of the recent press accusations.
And then the stake in the heart, the plot twist. For the avoidal of spoilers I will only say that if I did state the plot twist, all it would spoil is anyone's chance of watching the darn film. I can't say anything about the latter half of the movie, because at that point I decided that it wasn't worth staying up for, which is the only time I've ever walked out on film I payed to watch.",Baby Driver

Characters were forgettable and just horribly underwritten but I guess it also goes as a strength since the movie isn't really all about character but rather style. Best actor in the movie definitely goes to Jamie Foxx. Kevin Spacey was horrible. Plot was overly simplistic but at the very least, effective. Plot twists were pretty much predictable.

Its as if they've been put in to hide the fact that this is an unoriginal mix of a fast and furious movie and a typical 'boy meets girl' love story. 
The main problem is the reliance on music. Music can make any moment in a film magical, but this relies heavily on a certain taste of music to boost any given seen above a mildly entertaining level.

After finishing it, truthfully it wasn't at all like all these great reviews said and certainly did not live up to the current 8 stars it has. It lacks in a comprehensive story, the film has no depth whatsoever to it and it just so cliche. Now yes it is easy to criticize something but for good reason this film can be criticized so easily. If you have a look at almost ANY 7/8/9/10 STAR review for this film it's written as if it is a movie announcement in the local paper or a journalist writing about the film before the film is released, no human being writes reviews like some of these are written. I don't know why or how there are so many good reviews but they are not deserving at all. If you're young then yes maybe you would rate this movie high, but that's because it's simple, has style and has some cool action scenes. I overall found it a little cringe at times, not intriguing, not worth any investment but! there were some cool actors in the film, sadly though their script and character let down the motivation to like the film.My main point before you watch this movie is to have a look at all the 7/8/9/10 STAR reviews and really analyse for yourself if they look like somebody sat down on their device and wrote a personal review about how they felt about the film OR if if looks like a professional announcement of how cool and great the film is.

920,hammimarwen,Original at a cost,7,20 April 2019,"Sometimes you forget that cinematography is an art form. In that sense, making a movie shouldn't follow a single blueprint. Instead, it should be bound only to creativity. The director in baby driver empowered this philosophy and told us the story of baby through music and visuals instead of words. That's how this movie differs from the others and it was a funny experience watching it. It thrills me how Edgar Wright acknowledges the various tools of movie-making as equally important (to dialogue).
The music was excellent and the visuals were perfect espescially the chasing scenes. I liked also how the soundtrack is included into the story as a form of narration so to speak.
In most movies the music would be employed in a couple of scenes and then it stops making room for the actual dialogue. In baby driver it's the exact opposite where the soundtrack only stops in two or three scenes. Even in some scenes that you feel important to the story and the music should stop, it only looses in volume as you can still hear it coming from the earphones. I feel like the director is making fun of the classic storytelling with this method and personally I think he's not totally wrong.
Having said that, I believe the use of music and visuals so intensely made the plot less compelling than it should be.
For instance, Foxx didn't have to kill those cops. In fact, they didn't even have to buy weapons in the first place. And why would you choose a mailpost as your final heist ?
As I said in the title it's original but it came at a cost as the plot wasn't truly fulfilling to follow but it was fun to watch and it didn't disappoint me frankly.",Baby Driver
921,vedranlalic,Mediocre,6,25 August 2019,"I heard a lot about this movie and I've been wanting to watch it lately, so ...
Baby driver is a simple movie, not pretentious with a simple plot line, few parts where it makes you chuckle (not laugh) and I expected more.
Honestly as soon as I saw flashbacks of baby's past life I got triggered, I hate flashbacks but thank god it was only a couple of them.
It's also a simple story of baby being in debt and participating in robberies.
overall it's just a mediocre movie",Baby Driver
922,reynardpush,"Overrated, really bad storyline",2,11 February 2021,"Turned out to be a lame drive-and-shoot movie. Storyline and characters are really lame. I don't recommend it to anyone but the ""fast and furious"" fans",Baby Driver
923,HenryBaker,"Lots of Fun, Set to a Great Soundtrack",9,30 July 2017,"Baby Driver is a fun, dark comedy with an eclectic and amazing soundtrack. The central character has ear buds on most of his waking hours and when he does, we hear the same music as him. The whole movie at times seems like a series of music videos, especially the car chase scenes, which could easily get monotonous, but they are very well done and extremely fun. Some of the plot points and characters are almost one-dimensional cutouts, but you won't have time to think too much about those because the movie moves quickly from one scene to the next and keeps the plot lines engaging as it does. The back part of the movie is darker than the earlier scenes, with more violence and fewer jokes, but it is still a great time. Bonus sightings if you like Mad Men, The Walking Dead, or the Red Hot Chili Peppers, plus the always-amazing Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey showing off their acting skills.For those people who live in Atlanta, this movie is destined to be a drinking game of who can identify the most locations. This was highly entertaining and worth the time and ticket price for some fun escapism.",Baby Driver

But I could relate to the main character, I too love to lose myself behind a pair of headphones, just to observe the soundtrack of life. I love high energy set to good vibes. And though I don't always make the best choices, but I desire to do the right thing.Baby, the movie's main character, drives fast and furious, for some dubious bank robbing thugs. But all for a good cause. To payoff a debt and to take care of his adopted, elderly, deaf grandfather who loves PBnJ with the crusts cut off.When the pressure gets too much, Baby makes a run for it, along with his sweet new love, to leave the past behind.The movie is light, a little violent, but in the end delivers justice and a great dose of sounds you want to keep hearing more and more of.",Baby Driver

I have hard time understanding where the catch to this is, unless cars and racing are somehow close to your heart. Even as a music lover, who knew most of the songs in the film, I cannot say that it was used in a way where it would have added a poignant dimension to the film.Such a big waste of time. And money. A film where you walk out from the cinema and have forgotten you just saw a film some three minutes later and go on with your life. Nothing sticks.Possibly one of the worst ones of the 2017.

Everything about the film is pretty much pitch perfect if you ask me. Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furious films, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that series if a certain perspective of the moves matters to you. This is more in line with Bullit/French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far as great chases.The chicks are fun, simply eye candy and flaunting. The songs are for a lifetime.Action best pure adrenaline action in years. You will be on the edge of your seat during much of the film.",Baby Driver

Where is the world going by giving so high rating to this rubbish?... Haven't you seen really good movies before? Is it your first action movie you watched?
I watched it only because of the high rating and the movie genre ""heist movie"" which I love. What a deception! The main character has absolutely no charisma whatsoever. I want to punch him in the face every time he puts his sunglasses and his earphones. The rest of characters is not even worth talking about except for Kevin Spacey which is a great actor. But in this movie he got the role of some typical selfish brain genius who suddenly becomes a hero at the end. I mean, are you serious? For short they're all very far from the real life characters, even for a typical action movie.

Some gun shots are meaningless and i really doubt it if some of the choices in the character of the movie will behave as defined in its story! Watch it with no expectation.

946,speakingthequeens,One Killer Track,10,17 May 2017,"Edgar Wright's newest film captures everything you can possibly love about going to the movies. It's filled with wonderful characters, great car chases, enough style for a dozen cool flicks, and yes, a soundtrack that is better than sex. While using a familiar story template (the Driver & Drive), Wright completely makes it his own, infusing it with his love for music and his film geekiness. Wright has a perfect filmography at this point and definitely deserves to be ranked as one of the finest directors of the past 20 years. This may be his best movie yet.The cast is note perfect, the only downside is that Jon Bernthal's role is almost more of a cameo (considering the top billing). Ansel Elgort is wonderful as Baby, bringing an instant likability and purity to the character. The supporting cast is equally great with Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Eiza Gonzalez as the standouts. The scenes between all three of them contain the most electricity and tension.The car chases are brilliantly shot, eschewing the dull over-the-top silliness of the Fast & Furious franchise for something much more grounded and much more exciting. The lack of special effects keeps up the tension with actual stunt driving, continuing the good trend of recent actions films going back to doing things for real, showing an understanding of the genre.Usually, I try to not let myself get too hyped about a new film coming out, but this is the exception. I can't remember the last time I had this much pure fun at the movies and all of you need to see it. I was lucky enough to get into an advanced screening and I almost regret it: waiting two months before I can see it again is unbearable torture.",Baby Driver

Baby Driver may be a cute date movie for a 16 or 18 year old going on their first date.It began with a kick or two to start off with, the music jump started this lackluster moving picture so one could at least sit and watch the other 70 or 80 hue and cry minutes left in the picture.

Also, Jamie Foxx's character just didn't seem to fit with how structured the organization is with their planning and aversion to taking any unnecessary risks, but the movie's does pick back up near the end. It was cool the way the music tied into the scenes in the movie, but after the movie ended everyone pretty much quietly left the theater instead of what normally happens at the end of an action flick where everyone starts discussing the action scenes.",Baby Driver
954,ahsampson,A comedic and stylish version of Drive,7,16 October 2017,"Edgar Wright's Baby Driver(2017) does not follow an original plot. Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a get away driver who wants out of the heist game. While trying to escape the world of crime, he falls in love with the beautiful Debora (Lily James). This sounds much like Drive(2011). Both Baby and Driver, the protagonist of Drive, are getaway drivers who are both trying to walk away from the game. Both movies also explore their love lives. Overall, Baby Driver is a comedic twist on Drive.Baby Driver, however, can be praised for its style. Minus the plot, the style of the film feels like something out of a Quentin Tarantino film. It's safe to say that the cinematography for this film is worthy of an Oscar. One can also appreciate the accompanied soundtrack of this film. Soundtrack is comprised of mostly tunes that are not overused in films. These tunes accompany the film and add to its style.There is also a combination of enough action and enough comedy. The film has enough action packed scenes to keep the viewer interested and enough whimsical humor to keep them entertained. Overall the film can be ranked 7/10. Although the plot of Baby Driver is not original, it still a good plot that has a flow. The artistic style of the film, along with its soundtrack make the movie that much better.

Here, the girl is willing to risk it all, sacrifice her life for a guy who she (as it appears) met twice and then went on to kill somebody and goes to jail for 5 years. And apparently everything is fine after his prison release (except if the last scene only plays in his imagination).

959,jcooch25,Baby Driver Can't Completely Get Away from the Action Movie Clichés.,7,17 July 2017,"I am typically a tough reviewer when it comes to the action genre. Not because I don't enjoy films of this genre, I really am entertained; but, when I regularly speak to myself in my head while watching the movie saying: ""Hey, I was right!"", then the level of predictability has definitely taken a toll on my viewing.Don't expect Baby Driver to appear on the ""Oscar Nominees"" list of this upcoming award season, but don't restrict yourself from watching it due to that fact. It's a blast. You're constantly cheering Baby (Ansel Elgort) on as he drifts around the ""bad guys"" (who are actually the good guys) despite the fact that you know he's going to win, because, well why would they have him arrested within the first twenty minutes? That's the kind of predictability I am witnessing when watching Baby Driver. It isn't necessarily a BAD film, quite the contrary actually. But the level of ""fresh"" I receive from this movie is no more mind boggling than that of the new Wonder Woman. It is a fresh character feat within a typical car chase movie. Don't I sound harsh? It's odd hearing this even from myself because if a friend came to me and said: ""Hey you see that new movie that's getting' all the rage from Rotten Tomatoes, Baby Driver?"" I will still answer "" Yes I did, and it was a fun a** movie, go see it"". I enjoyed Baby Driver, I just wished it drifted (ha) away from the action clichés. The director, Edgar Wright, may have just produced his greatest movie to this date, (sorry Shaun of the Dead fans) but it still needs a bit more to be a ""two thumbs up"" movie. I respect the effort of the director, trying to revive a genre so suffocated by clichés. Oh and the cast was pretty fantastic. Ansel Elgort played the shy hero well enough to earn my recognition for his future roles, Jamie Foxx always entertains, even the deaf room mate Joseph tugged the heartstrings of the audiences with his selfless generosity. You deserve better Joseph. And of course, Kevin Spacey delivers a solid performance again. That's pretty self explanatory. I just wish his character, was written with the same effort as Ansel's character was. Baby Driver: It was great in all the right places, but just ""good"" in too many places. ***/****",Baby Driver
960,hunt-hampton,"A Triumph in Musical Setting: or, Disney's Great Regret",9,6 July 2017,"Aside from being an excellent film on its own merits, I took a personal liking to Baby Driver because it vindicated an opinion I've held for quite some time: that Disney made a huge mistake not casting Ansel Elgort (Divergent, The Fault in Our Stars) as the young Han Solo in their upcoming prequel-spin off. Of course, that's not to besmirch the excellent acting chops of Alden Ehrenreich (Hail, Caesar!), who I'm sure will do just fine in the role. But if there's anything that Baby Driver proves well, actually, it proves two things. First, Elgort can pull of a laconic, suave lady's man like few others of his generation, and second, audiences will turn up and shell out for original content. In a world of eight (eight!) Fast & Furious movies, an endless stream of Transformers, and a burgeoning, unwieldy universe of Marvel superheroes, that a movie like Baby Driver could be made at all is practically astonishing. Imagine the pitch that had to be made for this film: ""We want to make a movie about a kid with tinnitus who listens to music all the time to drown it out, but he's gotten into some trouble and now he drives around baddies on their heists, but also he feels very conflicted about this. Oh, and it's basically all set to music."" I'd think most studios would have tuned out after ""tinnitus."" But despite Hollywood's saddening obsession with repetition, this movie was made, and it's without a doubt the best car-themed film since Mad Max: Fury Road. As for the direction, Edgard Wright displays an excellent hand throughout what must have been a difficult movie to film, but the unique humor and style that he has developed in earlier films doesn't appear as prominently in this latest addition to his oeuvre. Although Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World are great movies, they feel nothing alike to Baby Driver. Honestly, had someone asked me who the director was without my knowing, I would have guessed that Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land) had tried his hand at action- thrillers—a good idea, by the way, he should do that. Which brings us to the music. Wow. I thought that Guardian of the Galaxy's soundtrack was amazing, but Baby Driver may well have it beat, and it certainly ups the ante on music-plot synchronization. It's refreshing to see so many directors, Chazelle most prominently, reincorporating music as a central element of their movies, and I hope to see more of this in the future. As for the acting, the dialogue is actually somewhat sparse. That's okay though, because what little of it there is is well-written and well-delivered. Jon Hamm (Mad Men) and Jamie Foxx (Django Unchained, Jarhead) clash well in their intra-heist-crew feuds, and Hamm's Bonnie-and-Clyde-esque relationship with Eiza González (more or less new to American movies) is whimsically fun. Lily James (Downton Abbey, Cinderella), Elgort's romantic interest, carries herself well throughout, but she's frankly not asked to do a whole lot, one of the movie's few downsides. Of course, the real star of the film is Elgort, who balances his character's brazen confidence behind the wheel with the more hesitant, awkward romantic off the streets. His ability to wordlessly communicate aloof, troubled charm is maddening if only because I wanted so badly for him to get the Han role. But it's okay, because even if the as-yet-untitled Han Solo spin-off completely bombs, we will still have Baby Driver: one of the only original, engaging, and innovative action-thrillers in far too long.",Baby Driver

Like the part where Baby is listening to a song with a trumpet and walks by a music store with the trumpet in the window?

Everything about it was simply perfect. So detailed and rhythmic and on point everywhere. Probably the coolest movie I have ever seen. It is so amazing how director Edgar Wright uses music to drive the movie, it adds so much rhythm and groove to the scenes which makes it so interesting and cool and synchronized at every point. I have never seen a movie like this before. It's action packed with fantastically coordinated stunts and car chases. The plot is very entertaining and the characters are interesting and funny. Great acting, especially from Jamie Foxx who does a fantastic job. Ansel Elgort is also a great lead and plays his role very well. Even if you don't like action movies, this movie won't bore you for one second. It is brilliant in every way and so unique and amazing. It's very rare to see movies like this nowadays. Cinema of it's finest kind. This is why I love movies.",Baby Driver
966,HipHopHewey,A More Sophisticated Action Movie That Aims At The Heart,8,30 June 2017,"Going into ""Baby Driver"", I had lowish expectations. I could not have been more wrong. Probably the best action film of 2017 thus far, Edgar Wright (known for ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"") delivers a well blended film that incorporates very well spaced action and romance, with just a hit of comedy. Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a lovable and approachable character, who's obsession with music has you tapping your foot along with the stellar tune he plays along the ride. Action seems to be pretty much grounded to the laws of physics in this film, and even though there's a hearty dose of it, audience members will leave the theater wishing there was more in the film. 8/10, would recommend.",Baby Driver

This movie turned Edgar Wright into my favourite film maker and opened my eyes about a style of film making I hadn't been introduced to, and at least not to this scale. I'm very excited to see what else he does and in the meantime i'll enjoy my 4K copy, my Blu-Ray, my UltraViolet copy, my iTunes copy, the copy I put on an old iPod because immersion, the soundtrack and a newspaper shown in the movie that I bought from a set auction because this is what happens when you see a movie ten times.",Baby Driver

What a fun , cool and different movie, yes it has its ""cliché""s and predictable parts, but as a whole, it's a good movie. The main character is something new to the usual good guy in movies. All the lovable character are exactly that and the bad ones are so hatable. The car chases are amazing in a more of classic kind of way and the action is great. There is a love story, actually two, and they're great and not forced. I found all of the cast did a great job. special mention to Jamie Foxx who made it easy to hate him, and Kevin Spacey who is always solid.To summarize, if you want to change your mind and be entertained four a couple of hours, i recommend this movie.

974,bmadccp,They Tried Too Hard,3,13 July 2017,"We get it, the kid has an eclectic taste in music. We all do. Despite a list of great actors, most of the scenes seemed far too ""forced"", like they were trying too hard to be edgy and hard core, in doing so many scenes came off as desperate. The film has Wright's fingerprints all over it though...fast motion, movements synchronized with music, etc. But there was too much of it and I feel that it detracted from an already weak story. Frankly, I'm both astounded and sadly not surprised that so many people are raving about this movie. It's an okay bit of escapism, but it's predictable and not at all compelling. Edgar Wright seemed to have tried too hard to make the point that Baby (the main character) was ""different"", edgy and innocent but somehow worldly - but despite what we learn about his mother, we actually know very little about WHY he may have ended up so ... special. And we may as well have discovered in the end that ""Baby's"" real name was Elvis instead of whatever forgettable name it was. The director really did evoke those Elvis-like qualities with the lead actor, I don't think that was an accident. The other characters have little history or context for that matter as well. Rather than adding mystery to the film, this lack of context detracts from some otherwise well put together action scenes. Yeah, Kevin Spacey is a big-time crime guy - but we know nothing about him other than he wants to ""partner"" with a kid who once stole his car. That's odd to me...and disingenuous. And because I couldn't buy the forced dynamic that led Baby to be so trusted by his ""boss"", I had a hard time finishing this film to be honest.The dialogue seems to have all been ripped from other movies - who talks like those people? The criminals all seem to have derived their inspiration and vocabulary from other criminal films in the past 20 years. The dynamic between Baby and his WAY too soon girlfriend (what makes this young lady so willing to run away with a kid she doesn't even know? Or is it all just that Elvis charm Baby exudes? This dynamic seems like a nod to a wannabe Bonnie and Clyde alternate reality. Perhaps all of this nuance was what the director intended. Perhaps the genius that so many people seem to be seeing is just this ""odd"" feeling one gets while watching. Or maybe it's not some art-house masterpiece as Rolling Stone is touting it, Maybe it's just sort of a predictable and pedestrian delivery vehicle for an odd soundtrack. But lots of people seem to like it, and there are some cute/funny moments. The chase scenes are good, but it feels as though Wright tried too hard with much of the dialogue and story elements.",Baby Driver
975,ebony_rose_byrne,Fast cars and soul- This is a solid winner.,10,18 June 2017,"I had put this movie on my watch list as the trailer intrigued me but I had no real expectations going into it. All I thought was this would be a heist/car chase movie, that it would be popcorn entertainment with a promising cast lineup. I'm not sure if it was my lowered expectations or my being surprised, but this movie blew me away. From the very first scene, this is such an enticing movie. It has an oddness to it that is so charming and fun, with a main character that makes you love this quirks. On top of that, it is well shot, directed and acted. With a general plot that is not all too original but it's the characters and the style of the movie that take it far away from something ordinary.I would suggest seeing this movie if you are a music lover or love action movies with something more than the mundane. A car movie with soul. Excited to see it again.",Baby Driver
976,themidgarzolom,Driven to Greatness,10,4 July 2017,"Before even looking at what makes this film special, Baby Driver already succeeds on its own as a hodgepodge of action, crime, heist, comedy, romance and drama that balances all elements pretty evenly and deftly. The pacing is nearly perfect and it's very simple and straightforward, but at the same time cleverly and engagingly plotted.What takes this film to a special place is a literally unprecedented level of sound design detail. In several places, you can see elements of the lyrics in the song interacting with background elements and extras in the scene backgrounds. Not only is pretty much every gun shot and door slam and overall action element rhythm-synced to the ever-present soundtrack, but even less noticeable audio tricks fully immerse the audience in the shoes of our main character. For instance, in one dialogue-driven scene, the main character is listening to some other characters speak while keeping in one ear bud (headphone). I was sitting on the left hand side of the theater and the music seemed extremely faint, almost to where one can barely hear it. At first, I thought some inconsiderate asshole in the audience had a phone game with an instrumental loop running, and then I realized: they have the music turned down low and panned hard right as if we are hearing it exactly how the main character would. If this movie doesn't take the Oscar for sound design, something is clearly wrong.The humor style and relentless pacing won't click with 100% of people, but I think the type of person that this film was intended for will love the film and that it also has some crossover appeal to those that aren't big action fans, as well. It also helps that it effortlessly covers so many bases in terms of defying genre conventions. Even the inclusion of certain genre clichés in this film feel more like a wink at the audience than a lack of creativity. Strongly recommended for all fans of action, comedy and music!",Baby Driver

We have sent people to the moon, we have cities with 100% electric powered public transport, we have saved lives with incredibly intricate STEM cell based transplant procedures.

It took a second viewing to allow some of the elements that had registered sub conciously to register with my slower concious mind.
I will not spoil the fun of discovering these ""extras"" for yourself, suffice to say that when you start looking, and listening, you will be astounded at how much more is going on than at first we realise.Some critics have actually criticised this as being a bit kitsch, or too cutesy by half, but I say, ""go suck a lemon, you miserable gits. Crack a smile and give yer ass some competition.""
 The action is great, the violence is strong, but not gory, the music brilliant and as critical to the plot as any movie I've seen. Then we have the two main characters being really well played by Ansel Elgort and Jon Hamm, delivering far more than the one dimensional fare usually portrayed by protagonists in action films.So I rate this higher than your average getaway flik, because it delivers so much more than just action, it brings tons of fun.

It's very good flash and pop and noise, especially compared to most of what's out there, but it's not much else. It's what happens when you take the direction and technical prowess of Edgar Wright's other films, namely the Cornetto Trilogy and Scott Pilgrim vs The World, but you fail to bring over the fun premise and excellent dialogue, settling for just ""pretty good"" instead. Perhaps Wright simply isn't that fantastic of a writer (gedit, Wright can't write, eh!), for his previous films were either collaboratively written or/and based on a graphic novel.

Boy oh boy what a ride this film is. The acting in this movie is amazing. Each and every actor in this film have something to offer and all of the characters bring something special to the screen. Edgar Wright has done a brilliant job at capturing this film. There are so many great camera angles and shots in this film that just make it look like a work of art and it's something that can really be appreciated when you see the film. One aspect of the film i found very satisfying to watch were the scenes that were choreographed along with the beat of the music. It fit so perfectly with the film and never felt like it was a little cheesy or off putting. The intensity in this film is great. There's always something at stake, there's always something riding on what they are doing, which I love. When you as a viewer of a film can feel the amount of tension in a scene and experience the emotion that the character on screen is feeling, it's truly what makes a movie like this special. My only complaint is that I felt that there are some moments which drag on a little but apart from that it's a great watch.",Baby Driver

984,alex_gallegos,A modern action movie that does not disappoint,8,13 October 2017,"I am writing this review mostly because I just re-watched this movie on Blu Ray, so i'll try keep it as short and simple as I can.One of the best movies this year so far. Some people hate it, some love it. For me, it's a great reminder that even a modern action movie can be done right, sure it's not perfect, but no movie is.The characters are really simple, we have the classic ""Cool guy with a sad past"" in more than one character, but the movie itself is more about plot development (As almost every crime/action movie) and not about character development, but even then, the characters feel okay, you can really identify the reasons behind their actions and their personalities are well portrayed by the actors. The plot (Which I won't spoil) is overall good, it has a few notorious problems at the end but If you overlook them, you'll find the story quite interesting without being too complex.The music is really important in this movie, not only because it adds a lot of sense to the plot regarding the main character, but because it gives Baby Driver that refreshing style that has been absent in most recent movies in this genre.Overall (And after re-watching this movie) I still believe Baby Driver has what it takes to be a cult movie rather than just a nice film from 2017 doomed to be forgiven. My rating for this movie may not be the highest among the other reviewers but trust me, this is a movie you will enjoy and who knows maybe you'll find it even better than an 8/10.",Baby Driver

It's probably more a director's oversight, or you may argue this is not his kind of film.. Well.. most of the people would need a rehab after a day of the Baby life and it was not mentioned he had an autism or similar condition. There are other gross inconsistencies about the characters the actors trying to model, like the ruthless and calculating mob boss won't likely be prepared to die for two young kids in love... Anyway, Kevin Spacey stills the show usual. Jon Hamm was a bit of disappointment, he lacks believability considering the excellent job he has done on the Mad Men show.",Baby Driver
989,Ricardo98,Style over substance,4,24 November 2017,"Spoilers: I felt like Ansel Elgort was miscast in the movie. I've seen a number of his roles and I don't think I liked any of the characters he portrayed. Whenever he's on screen, I can't help but think of Big Baby from ""Toy Story 3"", which ruins moments completely. I'm not sure if it's his acting or the way the role was written, but his character comes across as obnoxious, to the point where I was rooting against him. As the movie progresses, you get more and more of an incentive to dislike him as he's continually in a position where he can build up evidence and rat out the people he's involved with, as he records snippets from every heist meeting to make mix tapes out of them later on at home. But this sadly isn't the case, as he keeps it to himself, allowing innocent people to die in the process which he could've stopped; to me that's unforgivable even if he does perform good deeds every now and again to ease his dirty conscience. I don't think I liked or connected with any character in the whole movie, except for the lady behind the counter at the postage shop, but besides that, nobody. All the characters were flat and one-dimensional. We don't learn enough about these character's past to care for them and the direct result of this is that we don't care where the story is going which makes for a rather pointless movie. Sure we touch on Ansel Elgort's character's past, but it it's only briefly and it's the most clichéd series of flashbacks: ""Look his parents died in a car crash and now you as an audience will sympathize and connect with the character as a result"". Sorry, but even though it's sad, it makes me feel indifferent based on his actions. I thought that there were a lot of actors who were too big for the roles that they were given. Instead of being lost in their performances as I should've been, I was found saying, ""There's Jon Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey!"". These actors took me right out of the movie just as Matt Damon did when I watched his small cameo in the movie ""Interstellar"". I thought that Kevin Spacey was justified, but he phoned it in and just played Kevin Spacey, like he's been doing for years now; he didn't even have enough material to work with to begin with like everyone else in the movie. The core of the movie is a love story, but it is so unrealistic, the two lovers only meet twice and are prepared to run away together in a heartbeat. Not only that, but they have zero chemistry and you don't buy into their romance at all, sadly. It all felt rushed and the story-line and characters were sacrificed for what the movie was born out of; music. If Edgar Wright didn't hold such an emphases on this aspect of the movie, then maybe we, as an audience, could've had something to work with.The movie was not only a love story but a story about a getaway driver who drives to music, but the music parts didn't mix well and sometimes I felt there was too much to the point where it ruined some of the scenes. The in-sync style that Edgar was trying to do in moments wasn't well crafted, no where near as well as the iconic in-sync moment in the third act of ""Shaun of the Dead"" when the characters are beating zombies in rhythm to Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"", which was a highlight of the movie; there were no noteworthy moments equal to that scene in ""Baby Driver"" which is mind boggling. On a side and more nit-picky note; the music wasn't really my taste.There were some scenes that just made absolutely no sense. Such as the scene when the characters have to go to a garage to pick up some untraceable arms for their next heist. These arms are being supplied by some dirty cops, but beforehand, you would've thought Kevin Spacey's character would've told them this as a man of complete detail, as shown in his intricate planning of the heists, but he doesn't bother to mention it which goes against his character; instead it's a moment used to further the plot even if it doesn't make sense logically. It's small and big things like this that took me right out of the movie and diminished all sense of authenticity. The action sequences I thought were too choppy, especially the car chases, which lacked inspiration and creativity on Edgar's part and felt like they were out of a Bourne movie; the only well directed shots were the ones in the trailer. Going in I wanted something along the lines of ""Drive"", where there was intensity and high stakes while driving, but it was too light hearted and you knew they'd lose the cops, no problemo. I acknowledge that some of you have said that this isn't a movie about serious characters, that we're supposed to connect with on a real and human level, but a fun movie to sit back, relax and enjoy with friends like any number of superhero movies nowadays. That it's not a serious movie meant to be taken seriously, I get that, but that part of the movie isn't even done well; if it had been then I would've enjoyed it a lot more.At the end of the day, I look for movies with strong characters that I can connect with and authentic dialogue and a realistic plot, ""Baby Driver"" wasn't that. The characters were weak, the dialogue was weak and the plot was weak. It was a movie that relied too much on music to the point where nothing else was given a chance to breath and grow organically.",Baby Driver

991,whoguy,"Bad Baby, easy driving.",7,29 September 2017,"Baby Driver has a fantastic sense of momentum. From walking down a block to evading the police in a high stakes chase, everything Baby does is well choreographed and high impact. The opening heists serve both as the best action sequences in the film, and as a clever framing technique to introduce a colorful and twisted cast of criminals. Unfortunately most every character in this film ends up revolving too close to the titular Baby, making them seem like mirrors for the protagonist's ego, rather than fulfilling their potential as great characters in their own right. This is my only real problem with the film. Lily James and CJ Jones seem crammed into the script only to smile and repeatedly tell Baby how great he is, while Kevin Spacey also has an overabundance of ass kissing lines, although he delivers most of them with a scowl. What makes this all so infuriating is that while Baby is a fun character, and his Tinnitus is wonderfully incorporated into the editing, he doesn't seem worthy of the fascination the script has with him. It is a fun joyride nonetheless, but I can't help but feeling that if Baby Driver had utilized its excellent cast of criminals better, it could have been more than that.",Baby Driver

Perfect amount of blood, laugh, speed and romance. I love the way Edgar Wright pick the right music to portray some action packed moments. Ansel Elgort (Baby) is the real man of the match here with his cool acting. Special mention to CJ Jones (Joseph) for the Oscar worthy acting as a mute foster father to Baby.

993,corbendalasse,Is it good though ?,7,7 February 2019,"Baby driver is now on Netflix. That means that people who weren't convinced enough by the premise to see the film in theaters, will now - maybe - give it a shot. I did. And I don't regret it. Nor do I regret having missed it while it was in cinemas. It's a decent movie, far better than the Netflix usual, but it's not great.The plot is bad. It feels like something written by an adolescent for adolescents. Ok, that's not a bad thing as such: I mean it worked for Wright's Scott Pilgrim. But Baby Driver lacks the self-referential humor. It's less fun. It takes itself too seriously, at least to my liking. The plot is not good, but it shouldn't matter that much since this is more of an 'atmosphere movie' - the main characters are the visuals, the soundtrack, the rhythm, the kind of overall 'vibe'...Let's talk about that. The music is good and used in a clever, entertaining way. The visuals are good, sometimes a bit overdone (the scene in the laundromat did not achieve what it aimed to), but the overall cinematography is more than solid, sometimes even downright amazing (e.g. he car chases) thanks to Wright's signature playfulness and creativity. The rhythm is fine, even if it loses momentum towards the end.But a movie cannot survive on atmosphere alone (maybe Fury Road pulled that off, depends on whom you ask). Baby driver has serious flaws. Take the characters... The protagonist is far too polished to be relatable: young, good looking, witty, genius driver, brave, intelligent, mature, confident, charitable, lucky as can be, well-versed in tasteful music, musician himself, ... But he's an orphan, so he's human after all - I guess. The other characters are all painfully one-dimensional. As mentioned above, the plot is weak. The dialogue is plain.In a nutshell : Baby Driver is good, but it has too many flaws to be memorable. It felt a bit generic, easy, using too many tropes to be genuinely seducing.

Kevin Spacey, being the odious human being he is, lowered expectations from the outset so what chance did this have. It is not a film for music, movie or car fans. Avoid.",Baby Driver

999,filmerflick,Awesome,9,1 July 2017,"This new Edgar Wright film delivers seller acting, exceptional music, and significant fun. Going into this film knowing nothing outside of the trailer did not leave me disappointed as seeing how the events unfold in the film is so wacky and interesting that knowing nothing raised my enjoyment overall. The characters were also pretty great as well, each with their own distinguished personalty and arcs. However, what makes this film truly stand out is the sound design and music. Everything within the movie's universe lines up with the music being played, this includes conversations, gunshots, and even footsteps. Now although nothing really shocked me about where the movie went with its story what did surprise me was just how different this film is from Edgar Wrights other films. This proves his versatility as a director and I am looking forward to seeing other movies like this from him. Overall Baby Driver is an incredibly fun ride. The best way to describe it is La La Land + Drive + Mad Max = Baby Driver. Go see this one as soon as you can as it will not disappoint. And with that I give Baby Driver a 9/10!",Baby Driver
1000,filmjunkie-42618,"This Year's Smartest Thrill Ride has Arrived, and Baby's Driving",10,7 July 2017,"The opening bank heist sequence -- set to the backdrop of ""Bellbottoms"" by The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion -- is indication enough that Baby Driver is, quite literally, driven by its music, and I'm so glad I went along for the ride. Edgar Wright's latest film is a stroke of pure genius.Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a getaway driver for some pretty nasty people. Of course, he doesn't ever partake in the actual heisting -- expressing distaste in blood and gore at nearly every turn -- as he just waits outside for his crew (different every time), jamming out over sweet tunes to drown out his tinnitus. Or, as gang leader Doc (Kevin Spacey) puts it: his ""hum in the drum.""During one of Baby's regular coffee runs he meets Debora (Lily James), a diner waitress who's cheerful energy evokes within him a desire to escape from the business that started out as debt fulfillment -- ""to head west on the 20, in a car we can't afford, with a plan we don't have."" The problem, and the main source of conflict, is how difficult it actually is to get away from the getaway profession. And with such note-perfect direction from Wright, we are swiftly guided through this musically driven experience that uses its melodies -- from the likes of Queen, Martha Reeves & The Vandellas, The Shake, The Five Stairsteps and many others -- to enhance the narrative. Much like La La Land did last year. It's like a musical in disguise!It's also really innovative in the way that it comes across as an elongated dance routine; never before have we seen a film that matches the rhythm of its music -- all chosen before writing the script -- with the beats of sound, movement and dialogue scattered throughout, in the way Baby Driver does. Fasten your seat belts, people. This is one ride you won't want to miss out on.",Baby Driver
1001,jdheerdt,Better Than My Expectations,8,8 July 2017,"This movie is really well done. I thought at the start it was cheesy and basic but it became much more than what I thought it could.

Some parts remained cheesy till the end, but overall this film is excellent.",Baby Driver
1002,torimero,A terrible movie overall,1,16 July 2017,"I purely watched this movie for Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey. The previews made the movie seem mildly interesting, so I decided to watch to kill some time. Terrible movie. It was a circle of opinions for me: the beginning was bad, middle good, and ending bad. Obviously, a terrible movie overall. The plot was hardly there and the script was a joke. There was absolutely no character development throughout the whole movie. Given Baby's back story (the only part of the movie that made sense and is presented in a sophisticated way), Baby should not be as confident as he is. He didn't gradually build up confidence, he just is. If anything, he should be a paranoid hermit. Wright did not do anything to make me develop an emotional relationship to the main characters so the scenes where I was supposed to be on the edge of my seat biting my nails, I was asking myself, ""Am I really supposed to feel for them right now, only after seeing them together on screen twice?"" It was very fast paced, but not much going on. I'm also giving this movie a negative review because there was so many unnecessary aspects. Chekhov's gun should be applied heavily to this movie. Baby has over a dozen different iPods, but he only makes a point of using a different one when he's at the diner with Debora. Which he just so happens to pull out of his pocket, where he also keeps extra pairs of glasses apparently. He has several pairs of glasses changes in the movie, why? He wasn't wearing glasses during the crash and they don't cover his scars. There are so many more of these types of points, but lastly, his cassette tapes. I feel like in the middle of shooting the movie they realized they didn't know how to end it so they decided to make Baby have a tape recorder. This ultimately leads to the end because his cassettes, or one specific cassette titled ""Mom"", ties up all the loose ends, however, messily.",Baby Driver
1003,abualisina,He is just a Baby boy... Don't expect more :),7,16 September 2017,"After seeing the trailer I have to say I had I hopes and I was eagerly waiting for the movie. But after watching it I felt something is missing. Baby Driver hits you really fast with the entertainment and makes you connect with the main character (Baby) really quickly. However, there are a lot of characters in the movie that are overdeveloped, underdeveloped, or just otherwise unnecessary. I don't understand the character contribute of Eiza Gonzalez's. Also Jamie Foxx's character was just got WAY too much screen time. Other than that, the action sequences are so incredibly good that you feel a bit bored during many of the dialogues. Also, there is a certain scene that kind of contradicts one of Spacey's superstitions that felt a bit contrived, stemming from an entire 10 minute aside that the movie could've just done without in my opinion. And finally the END part. Baby faces his karma and go to jail. That also made the end very sweet and obvious Bollywood style. I will recommend this movie for its entertainment value, but if you have an eye for quality, except average and your expectations will be met.",Baby Driver
1004,asilverstein16,"Stylish, action-packed, full of swagger",8,18 July 2017,"Ansel Elgort (The Fault in Our Stars) stars as Baby, a young, adorkable, but highly skilled getaway driver with a dark and troubled past. As a result of a childhood car accident that claimed the lives of his abusive father and loving mother Baby suffers from tinnitus which he attempts to drown out by listening to his i-Pod which is itself a tragic keepsake from his long lost mother. He appears to suffer from an ambiguous disorder which is lampshaded several times with numerous characters pointing out that he seems a little slow or off due to his intense focus, sensory issues, his habit of repeating dialogue from previous conversations, and the fact that he rarely speaks. Baby acts as a getaway driver for a rotating crew of stick up men who pull high end jobs like bank and armored truck robberies. Baby stole a Mercedes years ago which turned out to belong to veteran criminal mastermind, Doc (Kevin Spacey), and contained incredibly valuable cargo in the trunk that was ultimately lost when Baby ditched the car. Doc was impressed by the car thief's skills and guts and is able to use his connections to track Baby down and force him to join the crew as getaway driver in order to pay off his debt. Baby's driving skills prove to be so exceptional that Doc refuses to accept Baby's resignation after his debt has been repaid, he even blackmails him into taking part in another job, threatening to hurt Baby's deaf and disabled foster father who's age and health essentially promoted Baby to the role of parent. Doc also explicitly threatens a female waitress that Baby had bonded with over their love of music and desire to escape their current environments; the two had planned to run away together after Baby's original final job. Over the course of the numerous heists Baby pulls off with the ever-changing four man roster he is teamed up with numerous dangerous, experienced and violent criminals like Buddy (Jon Hamm), a handsome party animal Wall Street trader with an expensive drug habit that he finances with bank robbery along with his action girl wife, Darling (Eiza Gonzalez), and impulsive, ax-crazy gun slinger, Bats (Jamie Foxx) who even declares that he is the one in the group with mental problems and there isn't room for another. Baby Driver is on the surface an action crime drama about a young, troubled orphan driving prodigy who intends to run away forever with his manic pixie dream girl after one last job but is reluctantly forced to continue his life of crime which can make the movie seem like a cliché gumbo but I think Edgar Wright subverts overused plot devices while skillfully playing tropes straight and reinventing characters. Baby is bumping his ear buds the entire movie so naturally the soundtrack is beefed up with lots of montages with expensive music rights. The camera work was more flamboyant than average and gave the movie a stylish look. Cinematographer Bill Pope shot the movie to give it a noir look and definitely hit home runs on the chase scenes, both the driving and foot chases, the latter resembled combat parkour more than a traditional foot chase. Chase scenes and stunts would normally imply lots of quick cutting but Wright actually made sure to make heavy use of long takes, especially the sprawling oner opening shot which went on for several minutes uninterrupted and gave the movie added realism. The bittersweet ending was very realistic and unexpected, it subverts the traditional happily-ever-after ending at one extreme and the Bonnie and Clyde ending at the other extreme which was effective because the audience would likely lose sympathy with Baby if he faces little to no consequences and is thus a karma houdini. The movie was very close to flat out glorifying a life of crime but adeptly transitioned to a satisfying and believable conclusion that allows the film to (1) gain sympathy for the protagonist, (2) stand on it's own as a single film, or (3) leave open the possibility of a sequel. The bottom line is that the movie excelled in almost every area, writing, character development, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, soundtrack, casting, stunts, and was R-rated which only added to the realism and entertainment value. I would definitely give it my highest rating of worth paying money to see in theaters, and I am hoping they do a sequel which I can also pay money to see. Definitely seemed like a second breakout role for Ansel Elgort who really carried the whole film on his shoulders.",Baby Driver
1005,faithannholloway,You'll be dancing in your seat,9,30 July 2017,"Through our earbud-obsessed getaway driver protagonist Baby (Ansel Elgort), we are quickly introduced to the illegal schemes of head man Doc (Kevin Spacey) and his misfit master con team Bats (Jamie Foxx) and Buddy (John Hamm).What unfolds is a series of thrilling car chase scenes that leave a lump in your throat and provide edge of your seat anxiety, each perfectly crafted to Baby's personalised soundtrack. With songs ranging from Beck to The Beach Boys, the film hums to an infectious rhythm that you'll have a hard time to stop yourself from smiling about. Each scene becomes even more impressive once you remember they were actually performed with real cars and real stunt drivers.  And then everything, of course, quickly goes bad.  Tied to the ring of criminals by a past mistake, Baby is very much the sore thumb of the bunch. Equal parts endearing and morally questionable, he takes the film from a classic bank heist to a musical-esque action thriller. We quickly realise Baby is never going to escape the firm grip of Doc and can only look on in horror as his fate grows far more sinister. The film is full of Wright motifs, the classic quick cut montage and witty one liners, similar enough to his previous works to make a mark but different enough to keep it feeling fresh. If anything is disappointing it's the hollow back story of Baby's love interest, Debra. The chemistry between Baby and Debra is electric - at one point they are practically melting over each other at the dinner table with affection. But we never really learn too much about his sweet-as-pie-diner waitress except for the fact that she looked after her sick mum and sometimes does her laundry. We never understand why she's so willing to run away with a serial murdering thief that she just happened to have met. But maybe that kind of plot history is too much to ask. In the end, there's no denying that Baby Driver is worth seeing. Whether simply for the soundtrack or the car chases, everyone will be able to find something to sink their teeth in to. It definitely has its misses, most notably vague character motivations and a shaky introduction, but it finds its own ways to smooth it all over.",Baby Driver

Their was a fare bit of old rock songs and pop songs, and I loved it but i think that they could've included maybe some new pop songs of this decade. I think the story of this movie is just amazing. It is not just about the action and the driving, the movie also focuses most of its time on the love story between Baby and Deborah which is great.

All that being said, I learned quite quickly that this movie is a brilliant, and spectacular thrill ride! I love almost everything about this movie; the characters are well casted and played, the cinematography and overall directing is genius, and the soundtrack is truly a driving force to be reckoned with! My only complaint (a very minor one at that) is, there's this one scene around the second act I believe, where our protagonist and his love interest are having dinner, and the camera spins around over and over again making it slightly nauseating, but aside from this, the only other gripe would be the rather unrealistic love plot (you'll know what I mean when you watch the film). Overall this movie is great fun, and I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for a great movie with a great storyline and top-notch directing.",Baby Driver

Jamie Foxx freaked me out, I just wanted to see him get a bullet. John Hamm was good too, needs to work on his menacing stare technique a bit. The guy who played Baby was just excellent.

Welcome to the Edgar Wright cliche festival! Complete with a mindless plot and illogical character behavior. So Doc suddenly decides to become a good guy at the end because Baby has a girlfriend? What? And apparently Buddy is tougher than The Terminator - very impressive; too bad they couldn't recruit Arnold for that role. I'm surprised Baby didn't jump off the bridge at the end and drive away in an underwater car.

A fitting homage to old songs and action flicks, I won't say that the film is ruined by cliches, and it is definitely entertaining. But there just wasn't enough emotional context to the film, and the turning points in characters' decisions are just taken for granted--everything feels so cartoonish.
I am almost sorry I just criticized this film; I absolutely loved watching it, but felt kind of cheated because I got carried away by its music(and Lily James).

1025,hc03,A love letter to the vehicular action genre,8,7 August 2019,"Edgar Wright's 5th feature-length film, and arguably his most commercially successful outside of the UK, is an action-packed, musical whirlwind of explosive fights, obscure references and incredible cinematography. To call any of the music-synced scenes anything less than stellar would be an insult to Wright's clear passion for music, with meticulously framed panning shots that must've taken such painstaking effort that I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it in modern cinema. Baby, played by Ansel Elgort, is an endearing character who drives (pun intended) the heart of this film, being genuine fun to watch as he runs around as our eyes in these various heist operations, as well as tugging on our heartstrings in the film's more down-to-earth romance core. Arguably this is the weakest point of the film, with the relationship between Baby and his love interest Debora being very surface level, with lots of emotional beats relying on how much you like this duo, which this film doesn't 100% justify. Though its substance is very baseline, with ""mindless action"" to get your adrenaline rushing and ""simple romance"" to get you to feel, the style in this film is not to be glossed over. Truly a marvel for the eyes and ears, this movie plays into a very specific aesthetic and never lets go, hues of pinks and whites overlapping with the sound of Focus and The Damned, keeping the audience invested in this bubblegum thriller through it's many twists and turns. Overall, although it isn't Wright's best, you'd be remiss to miss out on this film, especially if you are a fan of music and/or action cinema.",Baby Driver

1029,r-62692,Wright's Masterpiece,10,22 January 2020,"Edgar Wright's Baby Driver is a triumph. Director Edgar Wright took 22 years to create this film from idea to sensation. Baby Driver is a thriller, comedy, crime film set in modern day Atlanta about an orphan with a gift for driving, which is perfect for heist leader, Doc. Baby (played by Ansel Elgort) never does a job without the perfect playlist. Everything in the movie comes together to create nothing short of a masterpiece. For years the Fast and Furious movies have dominated the driving/car genre, but Baby Driver definitely made a big impression.
Baby Driver not only has multiple action scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, it also plays with the idea of good vs bad. Baby has been working for Doc since he could see over the dashboard. He's supposed to do one last job, but we all know that will get messy. He falls in love with a beautiful waitress named Deborah (played by Lily James), they bond over their love of music and the idea of an open road. He wants to get out of the crime business so he can drive off with her. Baby shows us that good and bad isn't as black and white as it may seem. Wright made many genius directing decisions that makes it clear that people's actions are not the only indicator of a person's goodness.
The movie moves very quickly and I was left wondering how two people could fall in love so quickly, but for centuries this has been a trend, for example Romeo and Juliet. Although the love story moves quickly, it doesn't take away from the movie and conveys the theme of good vs bad very well.
The editing and scenery were (dare I say) perfection. A film having so many car chase scenes can seem choppy or get boring if the scenes are too long, but Wright did a beautiful job of shooting from multiple angles and editing it to grab our attention and keep us engaged.
Sound in this movie is a major component. Baby Driver is almost a musical because of how vital the music is throughout the film. Every scene is so much better because of the music choices. Baby has a specific song for each job and timing is everything. In one scene the other people on the team didn't get out of the car on que, so he had to restart the song, which was not only funny, but showed us how important music is to Baby. He has ringing in his ears from a car crash when he was little, so he uses music to drown it out. The music is played from Baby's point of view, so we can hear what he hears, which is absolutely genius. When the music stops, we hear the ringing in Baby's ears which not only engages us in the film, but brings us closer to Baby.
Wright does an incredible job making an award worthy film (that has won six awards). This film is an absolute success. It's a must see that will have you wanting to watch it again right after finishing it.",Baby Driver

Did not pass the Bechdel test, or even the Turing test to be honest, did a robot write these characters based on what it thought human's are?I am still angered by the ending. Baby went to prison and then presumably was released after five years on parole, cut to a scene of him leaving the prison to meet Debora out the front dressed as a 50's pin up girl (for no discernible reason) standing next to a very expensive looking retro car, with the entire movie up to that point being set in the present day.

Baby is in a crew of robbers led by a criminal mastermind named Doc in order to pay off a debt he incurred after stealing one of Doc's cars. However, just when Baby thinks he is finally free to live his own life with his new girlfriend, Debora, Doc forces him back for another job. Baby wants out of the crew, but the ones close to him will be in danger. Ansel Elgort (Baby), Lily James (Deborah), Kevin James (Doc), were all main actors in this film. It was directed by Edgar Write who is also known for Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Ant-Man, and many more very popular films. I feel like in a way they empowered Baby and his disability in this film. He was able to become very good at something because of his disability and he was also able to use it to protect himself. I know committing crime isn't the best example but the point is to emphasize that setbacks can also help you master something and propel you forward.",Baby Driver

I mean why you kept it going after that busted robbery scene was just stupid. Pretty much it killed the this movie.Soundtrack was amazing. One of the best in years. Shame that this movie was not.,Baby Driver
1046,typenner,Wow. What a terrible movie.,1,13 October 2017,"I RARELY review movies. I usually only bother to write a review if a movie actively pisses me off, and Baby Driver did just that. I've never been so annoyed at an opening 20 minutes of a movie as I was watching Baby Driver. Everything Baby does is insufferable. The other characters (all great actors) are clichès to the point where I might think this movie is a low-key parody.Like it's been said, this movie HAS A CHARACTER NAMED BABY! ISN'T THAT CRAZY? ISN'T THAT JUST INSANE? HIS NAME IS BABY. IT'S BABY. B-A-B-Y. BABY. THAT'S HIS NAME. HIS NAME IS BABY. CALL ME BABY. I'M BABY. LATER, BABY. someone should seriously do a word count on this film to find out how many times the name 'baby' is said. It's super cool though how Edgar Wright discovered music last week. WOW, MUSIC IS COOL. BABY'S GOTTA PUT ON A SONG DURING THIS ROBBERY. IT'S BABY'S MUSIC. THIS SONG HAS THE WORD BABY IN IT. SEE HOW I'M TAPPING ON THIS CUP TO EXACT DRUMBEAT OF THE SONG? SEE HOW THAT LINES UP? SEE HOW I FILMED IT LIKE THAT? THAT'S CUZ WE'VE GOT STYLE. A MUSICAL EDGE. IT'S CLASS AND SASS. THAT'S WHAT KIND OF DIRECTOR I AM. SEE HOW THE CAMERA IS NEVER STATIONARY AND ALWAYS ROTATING AROUND SOMETHING. THAT'S MY STYLE. IN-SUF-FER-A-BULL. This movie tries to be stylish a la Snatch, or at least i think the director is trying to pull off a Guy Ritchie, but damn if he doesn't miss the mark by a few planets. I mean, I get that Wright isn't exactly after realism, but this is ridiculous.The movie is just bad. The movie is annoying. The lines, the music, the everything. This movie sucked. This movie really really sucked. I get how teenagers would like this movie, but to get a 7.9 on here? I just, how? What, why? How? and I'm not a pretentious movie snob. I'm a popcorn blue-collar violence and nudity type guy. But good lord, even I have standards. This movie sucks. IT SUCKED. Christ THIS MOVIE SUCKS SOOO BAD. Do not be fooled. It may say it on the IMDb score (which are clearly, have to be, skewed or tampered with), but this is not Drive. This is not Snatch. And this is not close to HEAT. Trump is the president, and Baby Driver has a 7.9 on IMDb. Those are facts. May God have mercy on our souls.",Baby Driver
1047,kbommaraju,great car chase scenes and music,8,17 July 2018,"I really enjoyed this movie because of the real (non CGI) car chases and the use of a constant soundtrack. The stars of the film give great performances. The movie even holds up on second viewing.One of the coolest things I read about the lead actor is that he asked the director if he could have the Subaru WRX from the beginning of the movie. He ended up getting it as a birthday present.Overall, you feel good when you finish watching this and it doesn't seem that cheesy or far-fetched, which is often the biggest problem with heist movies. The soundtrack is great with everything from hip-hop to country. And there are quite a few stars if that's what you're into.Also, the girlfriend character and the diner reminded me of the diner from the original Twin Peaks. Not sure if that was intentional.",Baby Driver

1049,RestLeg,Took the hype with a grain of salt,4,10 June 2019,"And I was still disappointed. I expected a lot of the bad stuff that has been pointed out in reviews, but I was very intrigued about the use of music. Most people seemed to agree that the soundtrack, and the use of it, were great.
They really weren't.Throughout the film I felt like I was forced to listen to some self-indulgent hipster's spotify playlist. Too many songs sound so similar that it feels like the same songs playing over and over. There were lots of lesser known tracks, with the exception of a few well matured hits. That would be fine, except the tracks were poorly chosen, namely the ones for the actions scenes, which were all fast tempo, garage sounding, monotonous rock songs, that together with the sound effects made for a messy background noise for the action. They just lacked the punch and energy that this film really needed. It was more of an irritation than anything satisfying.The editing and sound editing, although technically great, were nonetheless tiring. The gimmick of syncing gun shots and visual edits to the beat of the music gets old pretty fast. They tried to make it subtle at times, and not spam it too much, but it's there enough to actually become quite restricting in the end. Sound effects and visuals were forced right on-beat, which takes a lot of fluidity out of the action. Everything followed the music in a very rigid, lifeless manner, like someone practicing to a metronome. There's not much musical ingenuity here, with the exception of one scene where a shootout makes for a sort of a percussion interlude to ""Tequila"". That was good.It could have been great, if the music was better selected to pace the action. The timing gimmick could have been used in a more musically creative way too, like gun shots creating jazzy and funky drum fills, instead of every gear shift, head shake, or door slam landing on a percussion strike.So the couple of things this movie is mainly praised for were a let down for me. I get the sense that the music in the film is the directors personal list of all time best songs, instead of carefully selected for it. I've seen people write things like ""Killer soundtrack"", or ""Best movie soundtrack ever"". No. Come on. It's just a mixtape made by someone trying to be cool. I have these songs in spotify playlists as well. It's not an achievement.",Baby Driver
1050,reonb-805-310126,Completely overrated,2,8 July 2017,"I have not seen a more overrated movie in years. The car stunts were good, but there are many other movies with impressive car stunts.The acting and dialogue was most disappointing. Ansel Elgort (Baby) just did not seem cool and exuded no charisma. The romance between him and Debora (Lily James) was so cheesy and cringe worthy. The idea of the music on tapes was stolen from Guardians of the Galaxy, only with less cool music.Kevin Spacey(one of my favorite actors) as the mastermind was wooden and unconvincing and looked like he was just saying the lines to collect his payment. Jon Hamm was completely over the top and not convincing. The only believable actor was Jamie Foxx, whose performance I enjoyed. The plot is beyond ridiculous, and the ending is so stupid and typically American.I have no idea why this movie is getting such high ratings. I guess it must be from a bunch of schoolboys who fantasize about the car stunts. I would give it three stars, but because it is so over hyped I was so disappointed that I am giving it a 2.",Baby Driver

1053,jhemmer96,Stands Right Alongside Mr. Wright's Other Works,8,7 July 2017,"No SpoilersIt really speaks to the state of the film industry that Edgar Wright is not a household name. Wright has perhaps the largest cult following of any individual in Hollywood, his films are consistently met with critical acclaim, and yet it continues to be difficult for him to generate box office revenue. One has to believe that it is because he refuses to indulge the ""mainstream"" movie industry. He refuses to accept writing/directing roles for superhero movies, remakes, sequels, and so on. He did sign up to make Ant-Man, but clearly his originality was too much for Marvel and he was booted early on in production. Baby Driver may be his biggest financial success, and it will never be number 1 at the box office. It is unfortunate that the general public is so unreceptive to original screenplays. That being said, fortunately for Mr. Wright's cult following, Baby Driver is easily able to stand alongside his other films.Baby Driver follows a young, talented get-away car driver known simply as ""Baby."" Baby has found himself in the unfortunate situation of being in debt to heist mastermind Doc (Kevin Spacey) and serves as the driver for all of his jobs. Along the way, Baby has to deal with Doc's unstable employees (Jamie Foxx and John Hamm among others), and court local waitress Deborah (Lily James). The plot in the second act , overall, is pretty weak. It never feels like it has a definitive sense of direction. Character personalities and motivations are a bit confusing and there isn't any satisfying payoff. While the plot may not be extraordinary, it seems that Wright never intended the plot to be the focus of the movie. The real backbone of the film is the soundtrack. Having been in a car accident as a child, Baby suffers from tinnitus. To drown out the ringing in his ears, Baby constantly listens to his iPod. This music controls the driving, running, and even gunshots throughout the film. It may sound cheesy, but it is an absolute joy and you will be toe-tapping and head- bobbing throughout the entire film.Further contributing to the enjoyable nature of this film is its humor. As with most of Mr. Wright's films, Baby Driver is packed with subtle, self-aware humor. It comes frequently and often unexpectedly. Additionally, the stunt driving and chase scenes are the best since the original Bourne trilogy. It is clear how much effort went into these sequences and it certainly pays off. Overview:Baby Driver is a rip-roaring, fun time at the movies that overcomes a so-so plot with some fantastic action scenes and a kick butt soundtrack.",Baby Driver

From there the film tumbles its way down an odd alley of incohesive dribble. Edgar Wright is known for genre-mixing--but any attempt to do so here was half-hearted and results in a boring mix of genres with a dull subtractive effect on the plot.

If you are going into this movie having heard nothing about it and you are more of a quiet, pick apart the characters and plot type of person, then hit theater two, Frantz is just starting. It may be a little cliché at times, but in the end are you trying to be swooned by a movie? This is the type of flick that is about losing yourself in some serious action for a couple hours, which is what modern America is all about these days am I right? The car scenes are awesome. The soundtrack as well sound editing are superbly classic, and the choreography is highly noteworthy. The cinematography is all over the place in the best way. An overall damn good film that had me caught right around the time Jon Bernthal's character exited. I will not say that this is the best film of 2017 or that it deserves award nods or anything.

The driving was obviously amazing and I definitely wanted to be able to get in a car and drive really fast afterwards . Ansel Elgort is great as Baby and his character is given great depth + it's showed to us, not told to us. He pretty much has gotten himself into a life of crime with Kevin spacey who always uses him as the getaway driver for different heists and what not. Kevin Spacey is also great in the movie and so are Foxx,Hamm etc. All performances are great, although Jon Bernthal is barely seen. The romance between Baby and Debora is interesting and believable.

It made the whole film just run so smoothly and 2 hours passed like they were just a couple minutes. I also love the fact that the score is treated more like a character than just background noise added in post - it's interactive and always present in a way I've never seen it before.

It's The Getaway for Bieber fans, starring a wooden Bieber lookalike. All the tens, nines and rave reviews are from kids pumping the rating - don't believe the hype, unless your fourteen.The over-hyped song gimmick that frames the whole film is badly executed and the actual music choices aren't that . The framing device for the main character is unoriginal (been used a dozen times before). A talented cast phones it in and villain Jon Hamm is a caricature. Lily James' character is paper thin as the love interest. There's something in her background but we never find out what.Good car chase scenes, but dialogue is all formula lines and the pacing is bad, with drawn out character scenes that add little depth or insight. First twenty minutes are promising, then straight off the rails. The climax is completely absurd and the predictable ending is pat and drawn out. Waited for it to get to the point.

But then again i find the whole movie falling flat when it all comes to character development, when you really think it over after watching it, you realize it was only boy loves girl, weird backstory obstacle, escape. I would've liked a bit more of an explanation on the whole Doc, Baby friendship, could've perhaps given more backstory to the central story.Still a great movie all things considered, a 7/10 fits it nicely.",Baby Driver
1096,Man-Toast,"Great rhythm, every sense of the word",7,7 July 2017,"With Baby Driver I got exactly what I expected, and that's in no way a bad thing: Brilliantly directed action and many highly stylised scenes that have become a welcomed staple for this director. Something that everyone who's seen this film is talking about is the choreographed action that lines up perfectly with the movie's charismatic soundtrack, and sometimes it even becomes it's own soundtrack entirely. It's a fresh addition that makes the movie feel it's own, but I fear for some it may come off as a bit of a gimmick. I loved it regardless.Some of the problems with the movie are the villains, which there are multiple of. Jamie Fox came off as a bit too superficial, and really didn't sell me on anything he did. He seemed more like an actor playing a role than the crazed maniac that he was trying to be. Everyone is praising John Ham who I thought was great at first but in the latter half of the movie he seemed way too ott for my liking. I know that that's kinda Wright's style but he came off a little too cheesy for me. Kevin Spacey I thought was interesting as the mysterious boss figure but later on fell a bit flat considering his ending.If you've seen other Edgar Wright you can gauge with some accuracy what this will have in store for you, and I definitely recommend this if you were a big fan of Wright's Scott Pilgrim film.

1097,George-Simper,An editing masterclass,9,23 July 2017,Baby Driver (2017)Beautifully edited and choreographed. Exactly would expect from Edgar Wright. The soundtrack is superbly varied and overall an excellent selection. My only real negative is that the characters are generally underdeveloped and the story a little generic.

1100,adriannmuresan,The coolest movie in cool movies history.,10,2 May 2017,"This is actually my first review on here. I had the chance to see this movie as an advanced screening at my university. I now feel obligated to let fellow movie afficionados know that this movie is simply freaking awesome. I love good music and cars (especially Subarus like the one from the trailer) and that alone was a good enough reason for me to go watch this movie. I was not disappointed. I find Edgar Wright's movies entertaining. However, this movie was a step above that. Take La La Land, combine it with heist & Fast & Furious elements to it and you have Baby Driver. The casting was great. Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey have similar roles to the ones in Horrible Bosses, but that does not make it any less fun. The cinematography is exceptional and the plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The camera work in one of the opening scenes reminded me of Birdman, which is a Best Picture Academy Award winner, so this movie is definitely executed in a stylish manner, and has a great attention to detail. The soundtrack is picked to perfection and the dialogue is the wittiest, funniest one I have seen in a movie in a long time. I only see two cons for the movie. One: some of the action sequences did seem a little unbelievable, so if you want a completely realistic movie, you might want to trade some of that for the entertaining factor. Two: it was an advanced screening and the movie only comes out in 2 months... and I already want to watch it again. I rarely rate movies 10/10 but it was the most fun I've had in a theater and that certainly deserves my rating.",Baby Driver
1101,cibicdaniel,My review,8,16 October 2017,"Just for transparency sake, I'll say that I'm a huge fan of Edgar Wright and am quite bias. However this in my opinion wasn't his best movie it was still great. Here are my thoughts:1.For the beginning I will bash the story itself as it, well it isn't the best I had ever seen I mean the romance stuff felt unimportant even though it's supposed to be the thing to drive baby out of the situation he brought himself into.2.There are these characters that seem interesting but just disappear after a heist. Like no nose(remember that guy). The couple was rather a little bit annoying like most are when they nearly start having sex in the elevator and Bats well he's crazy and that' about it. Baby was handled well I think but Debora was there only as a motivation to escape his life and that's it.3.Never the less I will give this much deserved 8 stars because I didn't come to watch the movie for the story but rather the action like most people. If you went to see the movie cause of the story you were most likely very disappointed as previously said the movie handled characters and the story very badly.As a conclusion, I will say it could have been better but it was done with style was well directed the action was very enjoyable but I still wish to know more about Baby and the rest of the characters they seem worthy of delving into. Particularly Doc he seemed cool. That's it that's my opinion and you can do nothing to change it.",Baby Driver
1102,tomrichards-52565,"Gripping action, funny and awesome sound track.",8,23 July 2017,"This is the best action film we have seen in a long time, neither the front row seats nor the man beside me wrestling a bag of popcorn for the WHOLE film spoilt our enjoyment.The soundtrack had me trying to restrain my feet from tapping along; it is not only enjoyable but forms an integral part of the film, pairing perfectly with the picture. The synchronisation of the beat with beeps from a cash machine and wads of cash being placed on a table is a neat touch. The importance Baby places on his music influences the plot in a similar way to Chris Pratt's character in Guardians of Galaxy.The film had us smiling from the opening credits and laughing throughout. The cleverly choreographed driving sequences are realistic and carry weight; Edgar wright builds up tension by creating characters that we care about.I was concerned from watching the trailer that the film may lack any real substance. I needn't have worried as Baby's character development, his love interest and Kevin Spacey's intimidating Doc, create an empathy towards Baby that carries the whole film.The only negatives were the fast cutting during the driving sequences and the picture was fuzzy during some of the low light level shots. These are minor quibbles in an otherwise excellent film and entertaining night out.",Baby Driver

Without giving spoilers i would just say that the story has to many holes,its predictable and its trying too hard to be a cool blend of guardians of the galaxy and kingsman.The biggest disappointment for me was the lead role(baby) played by ansel ergot.There were some good parts in there as well, the character of buddy played by john hamm is amazing and makes the movie watchable till the end, kevin spacey was brilliant as usual.",Baby Driver

The movie is over styled and none of the characters can move with out it being a grand gesture of ""look how cool I am"". This movie is the kid in high school who thought they were better than everyone else yet everyone just felt bad for them for being so out of touch with how things are. Jamie Fox plays his typical bad guy who spews out one caned line after another, this time he does it in obnoxious led goggles. John Hamm slums it in a role so beneath him he need a bulldozer to find it. Kevin Spacey is well Kevin Spacey; creepy in every way. Eliza González is forgettable in a role wrought with stereotype; playing the hot blooded fiery Latino. It was if she was playing a . Finally, Ansel Elgort is so annoying as the ""troubled"" teen that his performance removes you from the movie. Overall, I am sure if you are high school student who can't get enough Fast and Furious then you will like it. If you want more substance in movies, go somewhere else.",Baby Driver

This is an adrenaline heart pumping race car action stylized cinematic thriller in scene after scene with precision focus taking you on an experience unlike any other movie of its kind. The direction and cinematography balanced with a well-developed story line blows everything else out of the water that I've seen in a long time. You are taking on a ride that you have never experienced before in theatrical avenues, twisting and turning not only around every corner but your stomach is going along for the ride as well. The backstory of the protagonist offers a sympathetic gesture of sincere emotional effect that will have you caring deeply for this once child with a heartbreaking past, now a young adult caught in a web of crime with no less than the great Kevin Spacey taking on the role of the father figure, of which possesses a cool Mafia-like demeanor underscoring just how threatening not only his presence is, but the emotions that he evokes that would put a scare into just about anyone. This was a joy ride of epic proportions and one that I will be watching over and over again because it pulled at almost every emotional heart string within me, and even hours after watching it, the emotional ride is still with me and will be for a long time to come.",Baby Driver
1107,alexaltea,Terrible crime movie fueled by dull teen drama,3,22 October 2017,"For context: I have watched over nearly 1000 movies, barely dropping 20 of them halfway through. This movie was one of those rare cases, dropping it after the one hour, when it became unwatchable for me and I considered that nothing else shown afterwards could change this fact. This is my first review, motivated by the huge disparity by the movie's current score (7.8 / 10) and my own opinion on the movie. It's spoiler-free and I haven't read any other reviews.Baby Driver starts as a high-paced movie with two main plot lines, one covering Baby's job as driver for a crime boss, the other covering Baby's romantic relationship. This movie attempts to please all kinds of audience, intertwining both action, romance and comedy, yet failing miserably at each of these points. The movie attempts to do everything, and does so quite poorly:Action/crime: Mostly a boring stream of high-paced scenes without any intelligent plans, other than few stunts that barely made me rise an eyebrow. The opening set the mood a heavy action movie which later on would not be delivered. Tense scenes with other gang members, specially the crime boss, failed by becoming predictable, stupid/illogical or just simply out of context. If you want a good action plot, pick among the dozens of brilliant movies. Calling this an action/crime movie is an insult to the genre.Romance: Again, felt terribly forced to attract younger audiences as confirmed by rating demographics. Minor issues is the weird pacing and uninteresting clichés. Particularly worse was the typical daydreaming teen drama. This movie also heavily emphasizes in the pop and rock music culture of the past decades. It didn't resonate with me, but that's other people might enjoy it more.Comedy: Voice acting, comedic hyperbole and frequent gags showed the movie was aiming above mere comedy relief. However, puns were uninteresting, lacking originality and at best made me slightly smirk. Movies aiming for comedy should be actually funny, or don't even bother. (As a comedy enthusiast, usually rating most of those 2 points above average I don't think I lack the humor to comprehend the puns here). Sometimes, comedic traits and conflicted with the main action plot, e.g. making things unnaturally dark for a movie that is NOT a dark comedy.Also, the backstory information came sometimes essentially out of nowhere trying to use teary material to add some weight on top of a shallow main argument. While it does its job at making me understand the characters better and had overall had a positive impact on the movie, it feels as nothing but cliché-material which could have been presented in more convenient ways.If had included spoilers or even finished the second half (when the movie starts noticeably decaying) I would probably be able to present more issues as well as being more specific about their nature. But this was already a big enough waste of time for me. If anyone feels apathetic about shallow drama fueled by teen angst and music classics of the past years, here's a hint: Don't waste your time with this movie.PS: Accounting for subjective reasons, I could understand my score of 3/10 could differ by +-2 points from others' opinions. But 7.8 / 10? seriously? With such an uniform demographic distribution? People over 45 averaged 7.5 / 10 for a terrible crime movie mixed with teen drama? Honestly, this looks incredibly sketchy to me, and would heavily encourage IMDb staff to start auditing initial scores.",Baby Driver

1109,jkickhoefer,"""Baby Driver"" delivers, even if it doesn't quite make a clean getaway.",8,28 June 2017,"I am someone who has enjoyed Edgar Wright's work immensely. In fact, Hot Fuzz is one of my all-time favorite comedies. So obviously, I went to this movie with high expectations, knowing how much he can deliver a good time at the movies. After seeing it, I can say he most certainly did, although some things did drag it down from it standing toe-to-toe with his best.First, the positives: the music direction is phenomenal. Nearly all the soundtrack utilizes a vast selection of music from the past 50 years, and it's clever in how it doesn't use super-overplayed songs (with a few intentional exceptions) and instead uses music most people have never heard before. This does a wonderful job of emphasizing Baby's encyclopedic love for music. How the film cuts with the music is truly a work of art. Each chase scene felt like a exciting, but focused rush I usually don't see in summer blockbusters. The main character, Baby, has a backstory and arc that feels completely natural. His decisions throughout the film make sense relative to his situation, and Ansel Elgort does a great job portraying both social awkwardness and focused training. Most of the other characters are funny as well. Although I do feel like they could have fleshed out some of them more, most of them do get the job done. It is a bit disappointing, however, considering that even some superhero films this year did a better job with building their characters. Jamie Foxx does a stand-out performance which bought out most of the laughs for me. Now for some drawbacks: the love interest fell completely flat for me. While Lily James' performance is solid, the material feels, well, a bit lacking. I felt they needed to better justify her and Baby's strong emotional bond. Since that spark isn't quite there, I ended up questioning why she played along with the events of the movie. That reason isn't quite given and it is distracting. Also, while the music is great, there are brief moments where they use a more traditional film score. If they wanted to show this bond Baby had with music, they should have completely immersed us in his ears, which they do, but in a couple scenes I felt as though they forgot or phoned it in. Silence can sometimes be as powerful as score, especially when it contrasts.Despite some gripes, I do think Wright has made another solid addition to his short, but impressive, library of work. I do recommend you see this one in the theater if you get the chance, because we all know the last thing we need is another Edgar Wright film to bomb at the box office.",Baby Driver
1110,milanherbosch,An enjoyable experience,7,7 June 2019,"This was a movie which, for the first time in a long time, had me watching actively; rather than looking at my phone throughout the movie.
It was a very pleasant way of being introduced to Ansel Elgort.
Kevin Spacey was awesome as always and I absolutely liked the use and control of Jamie Foxx' and and John Hamm's voices.The only reason that this movie hasn't scored higher than 7, for me personally, was its predictability. But even so, in this movie it didn't bother at all.Overall a thouroughly enjoyable watching experience. Well worth checking out!",Baby Driver
1111,anabubric,Am I missing something?,6,3 September 2017,"I don't consider myself a movie expert or anything but I'd like to think I know a good movie when I see one, even if it's not exactly my cup of tea. Baby Driver was actually supposed to be. It had the potential to be a decent action movie but I was suspicious from the moment I saw it had 8.3 on here. I mean, what could have they done with this movie to deserve such a high rating? So, just in case, I lowered my expectations and, somehow, I still managed to be disappointed. Is it possible I am not seeing the originality and perfection of this movie that everyone keeps talking about?Let's go over the good parts first. The soundtrack, of course. I was very pleased with the song choices and that alone has salvaged this movie from a tempting lower rating than 6/10. Then, the action. One could argue that is seemed forced in some cases, which is true, but overall, I can appreciate the bad-ass driving scenes and the well executed violent confrontations.Now it's time for the cons. To begin with, I feel like this had the potential to be a great story and somehow it got boring before it even began. The relationship between Elgort's (Baby) and Spacey's (Doc) characters could have given some wind to the wings of this movie. Baby's past could have done the same. I swear, there are so many things which could have been used to make some sense out of the story and out of the characters, but they just didn't elaborate on anything well enough to interest the viewers. It's like they wanted this movie to be so many different things that they ended up with a little bit of everything which amounted to nothing much when put together. Onto the girl. I just don't find her character believable nor do I see any relevance of having her in the movie other that to slow down the pace of it. I could go on about all the things which were ridiculous about this love story, but then again, maybe I'm just too cynical to understand it. Next stop, Spacey and Foxx. Come. On. Guys. I adore both of them and I was hoping for either of them to be the highlight of this movie. They were not. It felt like Specey couldn't be bothered to deliver a good performance. I was half expecting him to keyser soze his way out of it and turn the whole thing around and there was even a perfect moment to do so. And then nothing. Foxx didn't do a bad job but this character of his was already used in Horrible bosses so I can't give him much credit for it.The list really could go on for much longer. I don't expect movies like this to have relatable characters nor a reality based storyline, but I do expect a level of consistency, which is something this movie is lacking big time. I enjoy when a movie has more than one thing to offer but this whole ""love story from a musical on one side and a serious, violent heist on the other"", is just not working in a way I find interesting.",Baby Driver
1112,fatboymattyg,"boring, unfunny, annoying",4,29 November 2017,"It is truly heartbreaking that not only is this the most financially successful films of one of the world's best filmmakers, and it is his worst.Edgar Wright has crafted films that are funny, exciting, well paced, and emotionally resonant. Baby Driver is none of these things.The gimmick of the editing got old by the time the title appeared on screen. There is a reason you don't edit an entire movie to music, especially one that is over 2 hours long. The worst part about it is that it's the only thing the movie has to offer because the characters suck.Jamie Foxx ruined every scene he was in, Kevin Spacey played Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm was boring, his girlfriend was in a entirely different movie. Ansel Elgort was fine but his character was so bland, he had no foil, no flaws other than being a criminal, which wasn't really even something he wanted to do. Kevin Spacey threatens to kill his girlfriend unless he did another job, but then at the end sacrifices himself for no reason. Jon Bernthal should have been in the entire movie instead of Jamie foxx because: 1.he acted like a criminal 2. was actually funny and exaggerated without being annoying.The movies tone is too serious and played to straight. Some of the lines come off as cringe because they are ridiculous but are played off as serious.If the movie was really goofy and all the characters were exaggerated stereotypes, but baby was the straight man who would recognize that what was happening was absurd. I think the movie attempted to do this but it fell soooo flat.His relationship with his adoptive dad was so cringe and cliché and it made me wanna puke.The music was very unmemorable and not mixed well with the sound effects.

It is not surprising that when a climactic moment arrives, a dropped iPod leads to a scene filled with a terrifying silence. ""Pick it up!"" our inner voice screams - we want that music back as much as Buddy himself, because without it, the real world intervenes in the form of police sirens and gun shots and murderous mayhem. Buddy's relentless earworms appear in the form of Kevin Spacey doing his Bad Boss shtick but this time with heart; a marvelous turn from Jon Hamm, a worm who cannot be stopped,and Jamie Foxx provides cross-melodies of super psycho crazy.

1124,hobrien-82851,Oh baby!,8,17 July 2017,"If I had three words to describe Baby Driver, it would be eccentric, charming and fresh. Pros: - Use of music was unique and melodic and the movie almost half way became a musical as the songs used, which I will not spoil, were related to the action on screen. - Ansel Elgort was tops, kept his character interesting and mysterious, which is great as Baby will be someone you will invest in and root for during the film increasing the intensity in some of the action scenes. - The editing.. phenomenal. If you are a fan of Edgar Wrights fast paced, smooth editing then look no further. I could go on for a while with the pros yet I feel that I stated the three main ones although I would like to give a special mention to Jamie Foxx, who gave a brilliant performance. Cons: - Although the cons a relatively nit-picky the main con, which does not bring down the entire film but merely slows it down, is the romance between Baby and Deborah, played by Lily James. Although the romance was fine and relatively believable, I just didn't feel it was on par with the uniqueness and charm of the rest of the film.Overall despite the awkward slow pacing at points due to the romance narrative, Baby Driver is a must see film and is a heap of fun, had me smiling throughout.",Baby Driver

1126,RobbSheppard,Edgar Wright. Everything he touches turns to fried gold. Right?,7,7 August 2017,"Edgar Wright. Everything he touches turns to fried gold. Right?When your CV includes cult comedy classic Spaced, the genre-defying Cornetto Trilogy and the inimitable Scott Pilgrim vs The World, anything short of amazing feels like a disappointment. This is the feeling of anticipation that accompanies Baby Driver, the director's first feature since his fall out from Ant Man and the MCU.With a tagline claiming 'all you need is one killer track', audiences have been clamoring to get their eyes and ears around the heist thriller since the first trailers landed. And from the off, it's full throttle.The first twenty five minutes is unadulterated Wrighteousness: The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's 'Bellbottoms' sets the tone as the getaway begins: song lyrics become dialogue; gunfire acts as percussion and tyre screeches and fender benders become part of the musical landscape. Think Shaun of The Dead's rhythmical barman beating to Queen's 'Don't stop Me Now' or where Spaced's Tyres (Michael Smiley) holds an A1 clubbing jam fair to the sounds of a pedestrian crossing. Similarly, Baby Driver doesn't miss a beat.Steve McQueen once obsessed about breaking the 'film barrier': that distance between the lens and the road that sucks the speed out of racing scenes. Wright smashes right through that barrier. On-set tales of Wright strapping himself to car bonnets whilst the cast were thrown around the interior creates scenes that stick two fingers up to The Fast and Furious franchise and would make the King of Cool ask you to pump the brakes.Wright's stylistic flare isn't just restricted to the action, either. As the titular Baby, Ansel Elgort's coffee run goes all 'Singin' in the Rain' as he swings 'round lamp posts whilst lyrics to the accompanying 'Harlem shuffle' pop up on screen via fly posters, shop windows and road signs. It's all kinds of clever.The trouble is, it all gets a little bit tired, and this is where Baby Driver stalls. Once the initial heist is done, the second act seems to lull as the effect wears off whilst we wait for that one last job. Like a friend who keeps playing you songs that are each 'the best ever', your attention starts to wander and the film feels flabby and overly long as a result.The cast doesn't help either. Yes, Baby (Ansel Elgort) is effortlessly cool and omni-Ray Ban'ed with a playlist for every occasion, but his relationship with Debora (Lily James) falls flat. James is endearing but ultimately underwritten and there's never a sense that her and Baby are really a thing. Let alone a thing that's worth fighting for. For that, see Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzalez's Buddy and Darling. Hashtag relationship goals. Spacey is as Spacey does, but it's down to Baby's father figure Joe (CJ Jones) to hold the heart of the film in his hand, never more so than on the steps of the retirement home.My former MCM John Bernthal is initially set up to be the antagonist that the film deserves, but then the first job's done and like that, pfft...he's gone! Jamie Foxx steps in, and while he's the kind of villain you want to see get got, I'd have rather Bernthal's Griff been there for the long haul, especially as it would have allowed for a satisfying bait and switch when Buddy finally steps out of the shadows. With that being said, we do get the best Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers cameo since Back to the Future so, swings and roundabouts.Thankfully, the third act hits its stride again. Once plenty of posturing and a ham-fisted meeting with an arms dealer called The Butcher are out of the way, we're back down to business. The climax is nothing complex and is all the more efficacious as a result: high stakes are on the line between compelling characters with a personal issue at the heart. It's as high-octane as the start of the film suggested and it will make you think twice about parking in an NCP ever again. And after all that, it ends not with a bang but with a whimper, as over-explanation hampers the ending.Now more than ever, Shaun of the Dead and Spaced feel like old friends: the ones who you've known since college, but you can no longer really remember how you actually met. Then along came Hot Fuzz. Funny, for sure, but not best mate material. Now? We're BFFs. I'm hoping I can say the same about Baby Driver one day. But for today, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.",Baby Driver
1127,brycea-74428,"Although not as good as his other works, this new movie is still great",7,6 July 2017,"I watched this movie with a group of friends, and all of us when coming out of the theatre had the same opinion of the movie. It was great! Although I do think it isn't as great as Edgar Wright's I still think this movie is great.First of all the comedy in the movie while not all of it had everyone falling out their seat laughing it was still very funny, the gag with Baby's glasses was a highlight I wasn't expecting to think would be that funny but it worked.The action was phenomenal. I feel like the editing made me much more interested in what was going on as well. Also the way the music linked into the action just was excellent. It made the action scenes into like a dance routine, this made the action interesting and also added a slight comedic element to the action, which i thought was a good thing.I also very much enjoyed the chemistry between Baby and Debora was great but I can't go into detail as I really don't understand how to say it.Another small thing that I loved was when there wasn't any music playing there was a slight ringing in the background which gave us a slight idea of what Baby has to deal with in his life. If this was on purpose or it was just a problem with my screening I do not know.So yes this movie is definitely worth watching. It is a great film by every standard and if you have watched Edgar Wright's previous movies and enjoyed them then you will definitely enjoy this movie.",Baby Driver
1128,todzzgod,Overrated,6,14 July 2017,"This movie seems like it was written by someone not from America who had watched a lot of action movies but didn't quite understand the realities of day to day life here. In a 2 minute heist the police don't show up 15 seconds later. 20 seconds after that the area is not swarming with the police to the point that you cannot get away without outrunning 20 squad cars who seem to know exactly where you are no matter how far away you have gotten. Its too bad because this is half a good movie. There are compelling characters, its got a cool soundtrack, there is a good twist, and the acting is good. The problem is everything seems compacted and contrived to the point where things seem to happen for no real reason. Why does someone in both crews decide to bust Baby's chops so hard? Where does Baby's and the boss's close relationship come from? There is a scene where a lot of people get shot in a warehouse for no reason. It seems like violence for the sake of violence and/or just lazy writing. If they would have filled in the blank spots it would have been the movie people (fan boys) are saying it is.",Baby Driver
1129,obliterations,Probably My Favorite Movie Of All Time,10,7 March 2018,"Baby Driver is a cinematic masterpiece filled with beautiful directing, an amazing soundtrack, and is filled with awesome easter eggs. This film is an example of why I love movies as much as I do.First off the car chase scenes are easily the best I've ever seen, instead of being lazy and chopping it up into a bunch of .5 second angles all put together Baby Driver is very clear and you can actually follow the car through the city which is beyond entertaining.I've seen Baby Driver about 10 times now and it never even slightly gets old. 
It's filled with easter eggs that actually contribute to the story, it will also take you many times of rewatching to catch all of them.This movie is a start to finish masterpiece, through all the times I've watched it I've not been bored for a second, even when Baby isn't being a badass on the road you find yourself enjoying the movie to a ridiculous extent.This is my first review and I hope you found it helpful",Baby Driver

1131,cavemanalarm,Decent Enough,6,20 June 2017,I saw this as an Odeon Screen Unseen viewing. I didn't know what the film was likely to be as i purposely wanted to be surprised. The best thing i can say about this movie is that it was the third best movie i saw in the past week. it was up against stiff competition. I had seen both Baywatch and Wonder Woman the week before. The casting of Baby was masterful and Jamie Fox and Kevin Spacey were both wonderful. But i have to say my favourite character was definitely Baby the dynamic between him and his foster father as well as with doc is amazing. The romance in it was good it wasn't overplayed or forced. In all The film was good and was a decent way to spend a couple of hours but i wouldn't pay full price to see it in the cinema.,Baby Driver
1132,boijec,Great theater experience combined with perfectly timed musical ques,9,29 July 2017,"The movie Baby Driver is a well paced, action thriller set in present day Atlanta and follows the story of a young man called Baby who works as a getaway driver for a man referred to as Doc. Doc plans the heists and collects the talent to work for him on the jobs, he is the mastermind so to speak. Just when Baby thinks he is out of the game, Doc comes in and draws him back in.The plot works because it is simple and well timed. It gives you those moments of intense action but then lets you breathe for a little bit before going into the next buildup. Huge credit to the people who edited this movie, the sound editing and mastering is good, the action editing is good, and the pacing was perfect. Most action films has a pacing problem when it comes to car chases but this movie did it right. When watching it feels like everything is timed to a beat, almost like we are seeing the world like Baby is, to a beat. The only reason that Baby Driver didn't earn my 10/10 spot was a couple of editing moments where a cut reveal what would happen and it ruins a couple of twists but on the other hand, if those cuts were to be left out it would have taken the audience out of the story and just question what they saw on screen.Ansel Elgort could not have been more perfect for this role, looking forward to what he has left in the tank for us in the upcoming years, he fits in good as a main character behind a wheel. A couple of other big names were in this movie; Jamie Foxx, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm & Jon Bernthal. As usual Jon Bernthal and Jamie Foxx prove yet again that they are excellent at playing a-holes. If it weren't for the cast of talents on this movie had probably been overlooked as just another car movie.",Baby Driver

Also, the inclusion of the friendly lady at the Post Office was 100% predictable that she would play into the the job failing.The gun battle at the end plus Baby's determination to get to his girl smacked of a bad copy of Heat.Overall, it seemed like a bad medley of similar movies strung together by someone with ADHD.",Baby Driver

1138,amacaluso-86532,Don't believe the Hype,2,5 July 2017,"I may have been more generous with the rating I chose, however due to the overwhelming number of highly positive reviews, I feel that some brutal honesty is required here.The main themes in most of the reviews I've stumbled across are that this movie has a refreshingly original story and that the car chase scenes were exceptional. Neither circumstance holds true. The story was as cut and dry as any in this genre and the car chase scenes were bland, boring, and made no sense to me. Compared to a movie like Drive, where the protagonist's backstory actually lends to his driving skills (stunt car driver, motorsports participant), in Baby Driver, we're supposed to believe that some kid somehow acquired exceptional getaway driver abilities because of...tinnitus? There is no connection here, not to me anyway. And as for the chase scenes, utterly boring and unoriginal. The cars were completely lame too. Taking Drive as a point of contention again, the cars in Drive even have some degree of backstory to make the seemingly unbelievable chase scenes more believable...upgraded chassis, suspension, and souped up engines. In Baby Driver, we're given nothing more than showroom stock grocery getters...not even the top end models of the cars were chosen to take on the challenges. It was just all around stupid to me and I was left disappointed.OK so the soundtrack was good. But this is not Forrest Gump where a compelling, original story is amplified by a perfectly curated soundtrack. Instead, it's a collection of good music used in campy fashion. If what you're after is the soundtrack, get a Spotify account. Dollar for dollar you'll get a lot more out of it, I promise.",Baby Driver

It is elegant and cool. But also violent and gripping. It's as if Shakespeare were still alive and he'd rewritten 'The Fast and the Furious' in the style of Titus Andronicus. He also secured, as you would expect, a top drawer cast. It is, for the most part, delightfully economical with dialogue and yet Nigella like in its generous helpings of music from the connoisseur class of the 70s and 80s. Some very slightly more obscure pieces you wouldn't find selected for a 'Bill and Ted' standard Hollywood movie. It won't be to everyone's taste, but I thought it was one of the best films I've seen in years. I've come home to see 2001: A Space Odyssey is on, with which it shares some elements of style in presentation.

My favourite characters were Doc (Kevin Spacey) and Bats (Jamie Foxx). Kevin Spacey played his role very well. The character was very serious, humorous and has a lot of control in most of the scenes.Jamie Foxx was great too very cool, very threatening and funny too.He added a lot to action scenes and made the film more enjoyable.Overall I think movie was brilliant with great action, car chases, and the music in this movie is very interesting.

1146,dancole-52398,If I wasn't with company I would have walked out,1,11 July 2017,"*This review contains spoilers*Im genuinely unsure how this is being rated so high, nothing in the film is original, and it would sit quite well in the musical sing along section on.. Awful from start to end.. To start with barely any of the casting was a good choice. Casting Spacey was a huge mistake, while I couldn't fault his acting his script and role *literally* could have been lifted from his 2001 lead as Micky Rosa in '21' Why on earth he was he cast again for an identical part Im unsure.Such classics like: Gone in 60 seconds, Drive, Transporter.. these have older,gritty more experienced actors as the lead role, this I understand. To have baby faced Ansel Elgort was the biggest negative thing for me.For a character which has struggled with personal loss, is being forced to drive, even in emotional scenes, non of this shows, it only further emphasises his incompetence as for the lead role. His whole role was cringe worthy, every that came out of his mouth was either poorly acted or sits well in a musical. Dire script. The opening scene set the scene for the whole film, I loved-up flick romance/musicale.WIth regards to the driving aspect of the film, the whole thing is just shot for the purpose of product endorsement in a way which isn't noticeable or existent in genuine driving classics.I literally can go on,the film try's to be funny but fails at every step, the fight scenes and choreography is basically ripped, the scene where Eiza González whips out her gun has been done a thousand times, and better, in other female roles such as Trinity in the Matrix or more notably by Angelina Jolie her films.Heck it just feels nothing is original, just the usual Hollwood, I mean even the typography of 'Driver' is pretty much ripped from Ubisofts game franchise Driver.Jon Hamm's death scene draaaaggggssss ooooon for a good 40 minutes, jeez its about as crass as a transformer action scene.I cant write a review without mentioning the music, the music score is an integral part of any film, and is there to compliment, or to set the scene or emotion. Here the film is basically the music with actors signing and dancing along to it for 2 draining hours. Music score should compliment a film not be an overly in your face feature of the film. This is where the likes of Drive excels, incredible, how this is scoring higher is a phenomenon I don't understandWouldn't be surprised if there was an adaptation to Broadway where it should burn in its own awfulness.Baby Driver coming as a singalong to your nearest cinema.Maybe I'm being cynical and more critical of films these days, I mean the countless of 10* reviews leaves me in the minority here, but really; that was an appalling, unoriginal attempt of a driving film which I hope flops the test of time among genuine classics.",Baby Driver

1153,andycgoz,"The much-hyped Baby Driver is an audiophile's take on the heist movie, supported by an all-star cast and a killer soundtrack.",8,25 July 2017,"The much-hyped Baby Driver is an audiophile's take on the heist movie, supported by an all-star cast and a killer soundtrack. While in parts the plot is as snappy and high- octane as the driving and the beat, the film lets itself down in the final sequences with a lesser ending than it deserved.You never know what to expect from Edgar Wright. The director best known for the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy (Sean of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End), Scott Pilgrim and more recently Marvel's Ant Man, has a reputation for quirky comedies with big appeal. For me Baby Driver shows the continued maturation of a talented director, with beautiful cinematography choreographed to an incredible soundtrack.Unlike most action movies, Baby Driver has the luxury of an all-star cast, with Ansel Elgort (The Fault in our Stars) supported by Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jon Hamm. Lesser known Eiza González plays the eye candy, while Lily James (Cinderella) is cast as the waitress love interest. All give as strong performances as a good movie of the genre requires, and the first half of the film builds nicely into an enjoyably clichéd premise - the last heist before freedom.The real star of this film though is the music. A carefully crafted, albeit eclectic, playlist from Queen and James Brown to a catchy original remix (""Was he slow"") from Kid Koala keep the story moving from one action sequence to the next, while taking the audience on a journey of musical appreciation. Sadly, as the film races towards completion the plot stalls, trying too hard to build character motivations and redeem villains, we wander into a drawn-out car chase that poses more questions than it answers. Such a shame that Edgar took his foot off the gas so close to the end of what was otherwise a very enjoyable and exhilarating film.",Baby Driver
1154,ok-97613-65795,An Extremely Satisfying Movie Experience,9,26 July 2017,"With the current cinema and film scene becoming increasingly stagnant and repetitive it may seem like there is not an original idea left in Hollywood. Ongoing super hero titles and endless remakes have become the norm and have pushed many away from theaters to streaming sites. It takes a film like Baby Driver to prove to me that this trend can change and that there maybe is some hope for future motion pictures.If i had to sum up the film in one word it would have to be 'satisfying'. I went into the film thinking it would fit into the heist/car chase genre, when really you could argue that its true focus is on music and the way in which characters interact with it both knowingly and unknowingly. The incredible attention to detail and direction by Edgar Wright is a triumph with the rhythm of the soundtrack assisting with pacing and in the understanding of the main protagonist's (Baby's) character traits. Speaking of 'Baby' Ansel Elgort plays the role very well. In fact, all play the roles very well with Kevin Spacey standing out for me (although i feel like my love for House of Cards may be influencing my decision). Whilst the film does not have a plethora of characters all are memorable from the main cast to the smaller roles.In summary if you like Edgar Wright, you will like this film. If you like music, you will like this film. If you are human, you will like this film. With so many franchise films taking center stage at the moment (Avengers, Cars 3 etc) i implore you to go and see this extremely satisfying film experience",Baby Driver

1158,northbynorthwest-95933,Surprised by the high rating,5,15 August 2017,"Over time, I'm realizing I want more out of movies these days...I want to leave the theater inspired, impressed, reached on some emotional level. Maybe I'm asking too much, but like a hit song, a top movie should reach in to you and linger there, tho I realize not every song or movie is gonna do that. This film had potential, but sadly didn't fire on all cylinders, enough of the time. I am genuinely surprised with the rating it has gained. I found the music at the start annoying, with it's little cut scenes all in time to the beat, and wanted more character development instead. It seemed to be trying too hard to be clever. Foxx made a good bad boy, and Spacey was good, but it was a little too contrived overall. The end scenes with the car chase/shooting were getting ridiculous, and it needed more thought put in to the whole thing. The problem these days is everything's been done to death, which makes it hard to put a new spin on an old theme, just like trying to stand out in the world of music. So I am picky, but you pay your money and want to get value for it. I would not recommend this film to anyone over 25, I'd say save your ticket money for something memorable.",Baby Driver
1159,hornage-1,Well Executed but Boring,6,10 July 2017,"The execution and quality of the film making was great, but overall I quickly got bored watching this movie as none of the character's motivations seemed realistic or made sense to me. The action sequences were great, but didn't do anything especially unique or carry any suspenseful weight with the plot that I found myself yawning during much of it. Perhaps it needed more shocking gore.The movie seemed to be a bit confused in its tone, mixing stylized violence with comedy and serious heist elements. It was set in a realistic world, but the characters and their motivations were not. It felt like it was trying to rekindle the essence of a Tarantino cool bad guy heist film like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but missed the mark. I found myself not believing the heist scenarios enough or having enough of a stake in them. It needed a stronger overall macguffin.The use of Music was unique, but I would've have got more out of it if more obscure music was used, like what the GTA video game series does curating amazing forgotten B-side gems from famous artists.I felt like Jamie Foxx's acting talent was a bit wasted, and the bland Atlanta backdrop seemed like a production budget restraint. I wonder what city was written in the original script? I doubt anyone writes for Atlanta. Rather than transporting us to a cool city that feels lived in and feels like a real location, this just felt like a boring block of downtown brick buildings to shoot car chases and shootouts in.I love most of Edgar Wright's other films, so I'm not sure why this was so boring for me. It just didn't do anything new for me and will probably be forgotten from my film memory years from now.",Baby Driver
1160,coldagent_ramsey,An Enjoyable Thrill Ride,9,12 October 2017,"Jam packed with a wonderful soundtrack, great acting and cinematography, and a fresh, original idea, Baby Driver is an enjoyable thrill ride. The movie is fresh and organic, from the first 10 minutes to the last. Edgar Wright, along with the team of filmmakers and acting talent, really bring this movie together with the diverse array of character personalities which help bring distinction and fun to each scene. Lily James and Ansel Elgort have great on screen chemistry that bring about an innocence and infatuation in their relationship. Scenes are quick and witty, with an incredible usage of camera work that blends with the in scene music to great a one-two punch of dynamic flow, like chocolate and vanilla ice cream swirling out the frozen treat nozzle and landing in the waffle cone (our eyes and ears). The movie resembles a well made music video, only elevated to a level where the narrative is coherent and natural, all while maintaining a steady pace while constantly driving the story forward. No need to run to the restroom, every scene is filled with goodness. The meat has been trimmed of its fat, and the seasoned protein packed hog remains, presented to the audience for full, happy, consumption. Give yourself a break, sit on the couch, pour a nice glass of lemonade, and take a watch. You'll be glad you did.",Baby Driver

In the beginning he seems like a friend to Baby and the kindest in the group but as the movie progresses we can see him descending to madness until Darling gets killed by the police.

Secondly, the big reveal of the Mustang or Camaro at the end to then destroy it in the next scene - whats the point if it was supposed to be ""the car to drive off and listen to music in"" There are so many that I could go on beyond the character limit on this page but without being finicky the movie isn't terrible",Baby Driver

I was surprised by the 80/100 IMDb score so I gave it a go.It started well, with an decent heist scene, followed by some excellent driving. An emphasis on music sets the tone. The protagonist is mysterious and charismatic... his name is ""baby"".You learn he works for a gangster in suit (Kevin Spacey) and is tied to him because he owes him for a past mistake. Baby meets a girl waiter and the romance begins. Everything seems to be going in a predictable but satisfying direction... until it all comes crashing down.For no god damn reason the crew decides to assassinate a group that was suppose to sell them guns. In a cheap, poorly executed Mexican standoff, the movie loses credibility.The crew then goes back to HQ where Spacey learns of the botched deal. He still allows them to follow up on the a big operation the next day. Baby decides to kill one of the most annoying erratic members right after robbing the bank. They then (baby and the 2 remaining crew members, one being the main character of Madmen) decide to run on foot from the police shooting and killing a few cops along the way.But these cops don't seem to take the memo. Instead of shooting baby and his 2 retarded friends, they run after them like mall cops.The rest is just a complete mess with baby running around like a headless chicken. Spacey shooting his shotgun. The arm dealers materializing to get shot dead again, and Draper from madmen hunting baby around while he tries to get his waiter girlfriend.Baby then goes off into the sunset, crosses a bridge and gets arrested.Finally, we get a nonsensical court scene where baby is described as a good boy and only gets 5 years.It's bad, it didn't start bad, but obviously they didn't know where they were going with the film... and it should be remembered as a failed experiment.

1174,glennspice,What the hell is this?,3,29 September 2018,I had to take this film scene by scene to see how much of this I could endure. 18 minutes I lasted. Vacuous and bewildering considering Edgar Wright's canon of work,Baby Driver
1175,creminimushroom,Pretty great movie.,9,17 October 2017,"Spider Man: Homecoming, The Hit-man's Bodyguard, Dunkirk, The Dark Tower, and Baby Driver are a few of the films that came out over the summer. After watching all of these and more, I believe that the movie Baby Driver will give you the best experience. In the movie, we are introduced to Baby, a driver of sorts for Doc, who organizes robberies and crimes for a ""crew."" Edgar Wright (the director) utilizes a fast-paced, energized plot that develops characters at the same time, amazing cinematography/camera work, and a soundtrack synchronized with action in order to create a refreshing film that will leave any viewer desperate for more.If you skip to any point in Baby Driver, you are guaranteed to be met with one of the following: a high speed car chase, an electrifying shootout, or tense and guarded dialogue between colleagues who do not, and should not trust each other. Wright uses these three things to create an action-packed plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat. At the same time however, he uses minute details in order to show the differences between Baby and the criminals he works with, such as Bats (Jamie Foxx), Buddy (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza González), and Griff (Jon Bernthal). Bats and the rest of the criminals are all rough men and women who are willing to do anything to finish a job, and make a few bucks. Baby, on the other hand, takes care of his adoptive, deaf father, prevents the murders of a few innocent people, and even throws a woman her purse after he steals her car. Wright does not forsake his characters in order to abuse the adrenaline rush viewers get from action. This adds an undertone that satisfies those who seek a film that solely focuses on character relationships. As a result of the well rounded approach Wright takes to make Baby Driver, he creates a movie that a wide range of people can enjoy.In terms of camera usage/editing, Baby Driver excels. Colors seem to pop out from the screen, and Wright even designed each character's clothing according to their personality, with criminals wearing brighter colors, and Baby wearing duller clothing. This creates a clashing of sorts, which further exemplifies the difference between Baby and the true criminals. On top of this, car chases in the movie are extremely fluid and continuous, while also making a viewer appreciate the sharp turns/complex maneuvers Baby is utilizing while driving. During gunfights, crazy stunts are used, but do not muddle the scene itself, preventing the viewer from being completely confused. As a result, visuals are crisp and connected, while also being informative at the same time.Where the film really excels, though, is in the form of its soundtrack. The soundtrack melds together with its visuals to create an extremely captivating experience. As you watch the film, you begin to realize that nearly every action sequence is timed along with the soundtrack. Music is such a huge part of the movie because of Baby's medical condition, tinnitus. In the opening scene, Baby is listening to ""Bellbottoms."" He dances and taps his fingers inside his car, and even his windshield wipers move in time with the song. During the meetings where the criminals plan their heists, Baby is constantly listening to music, and tapping his fingers along to the beat. During the scenes with a large amount of action, gunshots are also perfectly timed with the backing songs. People getting hit by cars, dialogue, and explosions are seemingly choreographed to fall in line perfectly along with whatever is playing at the time. Car chases follow the same pattern, and the film overall gives almost a music video vibe (a very good music video).Baby Driver is an amazing, and innovative film. It superbly combines visuals and audio, and has plenty of car chases/gunfights to satisfy any avid action-addict. At the same time however, it will also satisfy those who look for character growth. The film as a whole gives a welcome change of direction, one particularly focused on giving viewers a perfect blend of what you see and hear. It is a very impressive film, and a must watch.",Baby Driver
1176,ankhabibullin,Watchable,7,14 October 2017,"Do you prefer an old-school American soundtracks? The film concentrates the audience around the music.Main characters of the film are the best side of the movie.The lead role in this film is taken by Ansel Elgort (Baby). Despite of his ages he worked very good. Kevin Spacey as Doc, the mysterious kingpin after the gang. Lily James as Debora, a young waitress who befriends Baby.SoB-A-B-Y. He is a driver, though he is not a mediocre one. He listens to music 24/7 and drives as fast as bullet. The plot is trivial, but it's more about cool cars, hot girls, good music and whatever rather than plot.I would put 8 from 10, because the plot isn't good, but soundtrack, actors play and jokes are really good. Also I liked that the apogee of this film is in the last quarter. I think Ansel Elgort played really good, maybe, 8 from 10, he merges coolness and calmness in one guy. Of course soundtrack is 10/10.

Because they really trashed the potential character with some cheesy teen romance (bland protagonist and his girl) and melodrama that's not even success compelling the viewer, and worse, they used it for the main motive where the protagonist doing radical turn and even dirt his hand, where I think this factor makes this movie one of the worst Edgar Wright movies.There another problem too like pacing where it becomes slow in the middle, cliché element that overwhelms the movie, forced antagonist, and some questionable actions from the character like bats in the end of the movie that does not make sense at all.

1183,mauler-88188,Edgar Wright melds old and new in this brilliant new take on an old formula.,10,6 February 2018,"I could say that Baby Driver is a complete rehash of the Fast and Furious genre. I could say that it has no original flair or plot, and that the characters were all one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. But this would be patently false. Baby Driver is the perfect meld between old and new. The plot is atypical Hollywood, but every other element reeks of style, flair, and perfection that seems only achievable in modern cinema by Edgar Wright and Wes Anderson. If I could describe this film in one word, it would be love. Edgar Wright loves this film, it is completely his, and it certainly shows. This film is a visual and audial tour de force, unmatched by the bloated spectacles of the majority of modern Hollywood. Somehow, Edgar Wright has packed a relatively small budget film (for this day and age) with so much love and care that it will keep internet film buffs talking about it for years to come. Welcome to Edgar Wright's heist movie fantasy.
 First off, I'd like to talk about sound. The music and sound design take a front seat in the hard-shifting, tire squealing world of Baby Driver. From the very first moment in the film, even before it has faded up from black, the main character Baby (Ansel Elgort), is introduced by a slight ringing in the background. We learn later in the film that this is because Baby has tinnitus, an incessant ringing in the ears caused by a plot relevant incident. This small moment sets the stage perfectly for the detail present in the rest of the film. Whenever there is no music playing, the ringing creeps in unbidden, like an intrusive afterthought. Baby uses the music to drown out the ringing. When the music stops, Baby loses his rhythm and concentration. The entire film becomes more jarring whenever the music stops, reflecting the unease the ringing brings to Baby. Whenever the music is playing, the film maintains its beat perfectly. Every single gunshot in the film is synced with the music. Every action performed, every cut, practically every step is in time with the music. It is relentless in it's pursuit of musical perfection. From the opening scene, straight into the second scene, the film demonstrates its dedication to music. Baby drives, walks, and even talks to the beat of whatever he's listening to. The keen eared viewer can learn more about the characters in this film by listening closely, than just about any other film. In this way, Baby Driver is basically one of the best pieces of musical theater in the last decade. Who knew ""Bellbottoms"" and ""Harlem Shuffle"" could fit so perfectly as heist music.
 Secondly, I'd like to discuss the visual aspect of the film. Edgar Wright has a reputation for showing subtly striking visuals that stick around in your brain long after they have faded from the screen. This is most often not achieved through flashy VFX, but through clever lighting, costuming, and camera angles. For example, a simple ¼ rotated high angle shot of Baby's instantly recognizable sunglasses, earbuds, and jacket behind the wheel of a car becomes a staple for the film after only the opening scene. That opening shot holds so much information, it's mind boggling. The sunglasses convey that he's emotionally distant, the ipod gives him a slightly carefree attitude and introduces the entire films love for music, the black and white color scheme of his jacket and shirt show he's divided between the light and the dark in his life. These are only the things I picked up on. I'm sure there was so much more that I missed. This is only a taste of what is to come in the rest of the film. That sort of attention to detail and loving care is kept up throughout the entire film. There are so many examples of small details that really make this film. The first time Baby sees his love interest Deborah (Lily James), a piece of heart graffiti in the background changes from black to red. That sort of detail doesn't happen from just any film. Things like that are what make this one special.
 The things I've mentioned in this review so far are mostly technical. It is most definitely worth mentioning that every performance in this film is stellar. The star-studded cast list truly does not disappoint. Ansel Elgort, Jamie Foxx, John Hamm, Eiza Gonzalez, an Lily James are all exceptional. All in all, I believe this movie is truly something exceptional. It is a masterwork of craft and style. Come for the car chases, stay for everything else.",Baby Driver
1184,wyattblawson,"If you love Edgar Wright for Spaced, Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim VS. The World & The World's End...DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!",8,20 December 2017,"Let me explain...This film was loved by critics and by a select few of audience members for no reason because they don't know why they like it.I'll describe this film perfectly with one just word: Action.This film, is action.If you hate this film, you were expecting gold comedic performances. You were expecting Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. You were expecting the most random bullshit that Edgar Wright would ever put in his movie. But sadly, all of that was just Simon Pegg's writing...Simon made Edgar Wright famous, Spaced was co-written by Simon, Shaun of the Dead was co-written by Simon, Hot Fuzz co-written by Simon and The World's End...co-written by Simon.This film is also a visual musical that drives this movie to its destination, along with its heavy use of action.This was Edgar Wright's first attempt at directing a big blockbuster film and he succeeded but failed because people expect Simon Pegg to be in it. It...Is...NOT...COMEDY! Get used to it.I could hardly figure out what this movie was, I watched it twice and thought, 'why am I feeling disappointed? I like the movie. What am I missing? Why do I like it and why am I hating it?' It's simple and everyone has the same problem, they expected comedy, from an action musical driven heist film...and it succeeds with flying colors (color without a U, to try and make it look more American, like what Edgar Wright had done).This film is a great action send-off and it felt short but hearing FREAKING QUEEN! YOU HAVE NOT HEARD REAL MUSIC UNTIL YOU'VE HEARD QUEEN! But this is one of the songs that inspired Edgar Wright to make this film and he wants to make it serious because it is serious...but people don't see it that way, they want films to be how they want to see, but look at the film first and associate what you think what this film is really all about...because it sure isn't about comedy for that matter.Edgar Wright is now a brilliant director, he wanted to make an action film (with reviews that have no clue what this film is all about and there is little to no comedy anyway, try as you might but you will see jack shite (Scottish word for excrement) in this film.Try watching it as an action film, similar to Die Hard, and you will be surprised by how much action, suspense, thrills, groove, rockin', poppin', lockin', shockin' and hoppin' this film has to offer...also blood, and it works.And if you keep telling yourself that it's Edgar Wright, he makes comedy films for a living. You need to wake up, he's a film director, not a comedic film director, a FILM director and a damn good one at that.Baby Driver - an action film even a family can enjoy!

1186,osm-21170,The main theme of this movie: Attention to detail.,9,4 February 2018,"This review will have no spoilers because all that needs to be said about this movie is in the first two sequences.
In the opening scene we see the two most important themes of this film, Cars and music. Then we get all the backstory we need. Baby is a lighthearted kid that appreciates music and is happier without the crew. He doesn't exactly fit in because he doesn't like the violence. We also learn that he knows what he is doing. One person from the crew points forwards, but Baby drives in reverse because we saw a cop going the other way in the background. Then we get a sequence of well-shot, practical effects car chase scenes. All of this timed perfectly to the music too, every door shut, every break slam, every turn. All of this backstory is given to us without a single word of exposition. All we get is action and detail.
Then after being stunned by the perfection of that sequence we are put directly into another scene that is just as good, if not better.
Baby is walking through the city listening to music. Every piece of graffiti or character movement matches up to the lyrics of the music. When he finally arrives to get coffee, we get the first words of exposition and it is only to inform us that his name is Baby. Then we see that as he turns back to return to the crew, things are no longer happy. He has to avoid a cop, a bike, and a car. This is all in one long tracking shot, where even the sound effects were timed perfectly with the music. 
In these two scenes we see what this movie is really about: attention to detail. Throughout the film every sound effect is timed with the music, every scene is a practical effect, and every detail tells us more about the characters. We even see in the end that these details return and help Baby, though I won't reveal too much. The movie isn't timed to the music just because it is cool. I think the movie does this because it really draws everyone in and tunes them into the movie's subtle details. Everyone watching this movie gets captivated and really falls for the tricks this movie pulls, every joke, every twist, every beat.
The movie doesn't feel like a music video, but more like a subtle musical. The ones where you go and sit in the audience and are drawn in by the music. You watch the entire play as if it were a film and don't realise until the end that music was a major part of the play. In this film the music is a large part of the film that draws you in, but during the movie it really feels like more of a side point or a returning joke. The real main attraction is the perfection of every scene, the amount of attention put into detail. The movie feels smooth and ironed-out. The movie feels as if it were rewritten and refilmed hundreds of times until finally, the movie was perfect to them. It may not be perfect to you, but to Edgar Wright and the other creators of this film it is a masterpiece, and I agree.
Edgar Wright is a master of detail and he has shown this in all of his movies. This movie is no exception. Many people didn't like it because of the story, which wasn't perfect, but I still believe that if you really disliked the movie it is because you weren't paying enough attention.",Baby Driver
1187,comixfan-15339,Baby Driver Review,10,7 February 2018,"Edgar Wright's 2017 film Baby Driver, starring Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, and Lily James, is a without a doubt one of the most carefully crafted films of the year. Following getaway driver Baby, who is coaxed into continuing elaborate heists for his boss, it shows how imagination can come alive on camera.
After seeing this film several times, the I always think of each scene like a painting. If you just look at it, you will only see what is clearly there. Once you start analyzing it, you see how the finer details were carefully crafted together to make something truly meaningful come out of nothing. Every scene in Baby Driver has more subtleties than any viewer would notice if they only see it once. 
For example, one might watch the opening heist scene and think it is just a fast-paced car chase sequence. Upon closer investigation, the two most evident features that speak louder than the coolness of the quick editing are the actions themselves and the camera angles. The two work hand in hand, as the cinematography compliments the action. In this part, Baby is driving a group of bank robbers to safety while on the run from the authorities. We, as the viewers, see a lot of high angles of this group in the car. Subliminally this tells us how the world sees them. The world is looking down on them, which accurately reflects how criminals are portrayed in the real world. We see them from up above, as if by not stooping to the levels of theft we are better than them. 
These types of angles work cinematic wonders with the speed of the action occurring. Since they are on the run, Baby must act fast to ensure their clean getaway. Many times, during this chase scene they get put in tough spots where our hero must pull instinctual stunts in order to escape. There is uneasiness due to the suspense, and the shots of the camera reflect this. The shot changes as quickly as the likeliness of success of their mission: rapidly. This is a staple for the film's action scenes. Baby Driver excellently uses visuals as a means of communication with the audience to say what dialogue cannot. 
Another prominent feature in this film is the strong presence of mise-en-scène throughout the story, which goes back to the point about the movie's incredible detail. The location, placement of characters, lighting, everything really contributes to setting the mood of the scene. One of my favorite scenes that shows this is the parking garage fight. There is a lot of angle play in here with the varying levels they fight on. Additionally, the lighting is excellent because it relies on the fire of the wreckage and the headlights of the cars to create the dramatic tension. Even if there is little dialogue going on, the viewer is left with a solid understanding of what is happening as well as how each of the unique characters feels about the situation they find themselves in. 
Without a doubt one of the largest contributing factors to the mood of each scene is the music. What is unique about Baby Driver is that the soundtrack, which features a wide array of classic songs from the past few decades, is played through the headphones Baby constantly wears. For example, whenever the group goes on a heist, Baby starts playing a song on his iPod, which then plays as a part of the scene's soundtrack. If his earbuds are removed, the song stops, and we hear the same ringing sound he hears because of his Tinnitus. This adds an extra layer of immersion and brings the audience into the mood that the protagonist is in.
Baby Driver's greatest feat is its ability to bring the audience into its world through its clever use of cinematic elements. Overall, I found the film to be tremendous, as I re-watched it several times. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys films with incredible amount of detail, or to anyone who wants something awesome to watch!",Baby Driver

1192,kanieldent,AMAZING MOVIE,10,28 March 2018,Can definitely relate to baby(with the music not murder and escape driving) and would definitely watch a sequel to this. Never had a better Saturday night than when I watched this movie.,Baby Driver

1194,ghadighoussayni,So bad,1,11 March 2020,The director woke up thinking let's do some driving stunts and put it in a movie. The story is real weak with no interesting twists or even a plot. I really didn't like it and if you're a true movie watcher you won't like it either.,Baby Driver
1195,moreti-61155,it is fun. Thats it,6,7 December 2019,You are not going to find the next The Godfather and i think it doesnt pretend that. It is what it is. A fun movie to expend a good 2 hours.,Baby Driver
1196,jw-60601,Bizarre Movie,2,3 September 2018,Incredible cast but I just couldn't get past the bizarre plot which seemed to bounce all over the place. What's with incorporation of the great music that didn't fit with the overall theme of this flick???,Baby Driver
1197,jkeasberry,Enjoyed the first half,6,29 September 2018,"Watched the movie on a flight and it seemed a decent way to kill some time. It all started off well. The opening scene is very promising. It makes you want to learn more about Baby, who is portrayed as an intriguing genius.
The further up you get into the movie, the more it changes from a 'classic' into a movie with action scenes that are no better than those in Fast & Furious. The focus on characters and their personalities disappeared half way and so did my interest in the movie.
On a more positive note, I appreciated the roles of Baby's step dad and Debra. All other characters were bland in my opinion.",Baby Driver
1198,dag-53531,Baby Driver Is Accelerating To New Heights,8,13 October 2018,"Baby Driver, directed by Edgar Wright, starring Ansel Elgort, Lily James, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Jamie Foxx: tells the story about the life of our main character, Baby. Baby likes to make music with people's conversations that he hears, he's partially deaf, and he's an exceptional escape driver for criminals because he's trying to pay off a debt that he owes to a crime boss named Doc, played by Kevin Spacey. Baby was also traumatized as a child due to being in a car crash that killed both his parents. He copes with this by listening to music to tune out his past and becoming extremely skillful at driving. For a while, Baby makes a good amount of money and almost pays off his debt, but then he meets a girl named Deborah who is played by Lily James, in which all goes downhill from there. Baby Driver displays masterful cinematography in its action scenes and an excellent soundtrack that compliments the mood of each one. This combination will leave any moviegoer wanting more.
To start off, Baby Driver's opening scene already sets up the level of camerawork quality to be expected of the entire film. As Baby's crew of criminals begins their raid on the bank, Baby is busy jamming out to a song he's listening to. The camera pans around him, displaying him singing and tapping the steering wheel as the song plays. When the car escape scene actually starts, the superb camera work is presented to the audience. What makes the cinematography so great is the variety and quality of the angles the car chase is filmed from. Different scenes that show different perceptions of the chase without being over the top really make this action segment seem real and makes you genuinely feel the tension of the scene. Later in the movie, there's a running chase scene that includes Baby escaping from a heist. The camera work is really good here because even though the action is chaotic with a lot of events occurring, the camera doesn't shake excessively. A common action movie flaw is the amount of camera shaking that occurs. While camera shaking does make some scenes feel more intense, too much camera shaking can make someone dizzy or blur the scene, making it difficult to watch. The transitions in this particular action scene are impressive and creative as well, as there's a section where policemen are chasing Baby down a hallway and the camera has a view from the side. Every time the camera is blocked by a pillar in the hall, it switches to a side view of the policemen and then it cuts back to Baby. The cinematography of the movie overall makes the viewer appreciate how well executed the action scenes are in the movie. 
While action scenes being executed well is a major factor in whether a movie is good or not, the soundtrack is equally as important. A soundtrack can make a mediocre action scene into a great one due to adding background sound that keeps the movie watcher interested. An action scene such as car chase would have noise like cars crashing, horns being honked, and the sound of bullets hitting the car. While that's not a bad thing, these noises can become repetitive, and even boring. In order to fix that, adding a soundtrack that compliments the scene enhances it by a considerable amount. However, a soundtrack that is overbearing can totally ruin an action scene as well. Music should be complimenting an action scene and the tone it creates; it shouldn't be forcing a tone onto the watcher. In Baby Driver, the music doesn't overwhelm the audience, but instead fits perfectly with the action. The music in Baby Driver isn't creating the tone; it's enhancing the tone that already has been established. One of the other additional soundtrack features that the movie includes is the syncing of the action scenes with the music. Gunshots and bullets hitting their target are all synced to the beat of the instrumental. This adds to the enhancing of the scene, as the soundtrack is directly interacting with the action. Also, this form of syncing is generally hard to pull off because if it's done wrong, it can completely ruin the pace of a scene if the syncing is too forced. 
One of the reviews I've read for Baby Driver states that ""Baby Driver is a worse Fast and the Furious."" First of all, The Fast and the Furious does not come close to the level of cinematography Baby Driver possesses. The Furious movies all rely on over the top action scenes to compensate for the lack of variety and substance behind their car chases. For example, the most recent Furious movie shows a car escaping from being harpooned by five other cars, then it's back to a normal car chase. The camera angles that the Furious movies use are repetitive and boring due to how basic they are. The level of quality that the Furious series has been cultivating for many years was surpassed the moment Baby Driver hit theaters. 
Baby Driver's cinematography and soundtrack make the movie into an amazing experience that any watcher will be satisfied by going to. The multiple intricacies in the movie's creation really add to the overall quality of the movie, and it makes the average moviegoer really appreciate the amount of work that goes into it. Whether it's a car chase or an on foot chase, Baby Driver makes a masterpiece out of it.",Baby Driver
1199,harveyjwilliams,Good until half way through,7,9 March 2021,"Starts out as a solid 8, with really nice music punctuating everything that happens on screen.But about half way through, the girl gives up everything to follow a criminal she barely knows, and the storyline just gets silly.Still worth watching though.",Baby Driver
1200,michaeludink,This is my absolute favorite movie of all time,10,26 November 2018,"This movie has an amazing soundtrack, beautiful cinematography and shots, and a fairly simple yet brilliant plot. I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys film.",Baby Driver
1201,emreerbay-49418,Excellent with only a word!!,8,9 November 2019,I watched best story movie for last years. Yeeah babyy!,Baby Driver
1202,dfm725,"Cool and Entertaining, Don't Believe the 1 Star Reviews (this movie clearly wasn't for them)",8,27 September 2017,"The plot is basic but it works because all of the razzle dazzle, for lack of a better term, is in the music and action. It's a movie about the driver for bank heists, it's not suppose to have a crazy convoluted plot with twists and turns and an Oscar-worthy acting performance.I see a lot of people putting ""made for teenagers""! Who are you kidding? Very few teenagers would appreciate this movie. If you think this movie was made for teenagers (I assume because the lead was 18-25) than you're either the wrong demographic, or you walk through life with your cheeks firmly puckered at all times.",Baby Driver
1203,SuleymanCT,Watch once in a while,8,4 August 2021,"To be honest, I thought that I was at the climax at the very beginning of the movie. The story is shallow for 8 points but storytelling is enough to close the gap. I could feel the fast pace through the movie, it keeps the heart rate at +90. I really love how they keep the love affair between Debora and B-A-B-Y without dominating the main story.Finally, music are awesome. That's why I wrote ""watch once in a while"", I can watch the movie to just listen some quality music.",Baby Driver
1204,florianhagenauer-24976,Edgar Wright should win all the Oscars...,9,28 December 2019,"One of my all time favourite films. When I first saw the now infamous ""Tequila""-trailer, I was obsessed with this film. I loved the idea of action being edited to music. I recall begging my parents to take me to the cinema. I was too young at the time to go watch the movie on my own. And after weeks of nagging and whining they gave in.
So we went to see Baby Driver and from the first seconds of the film I was glued to the screen until the very end. The opening scene in itself is a masterpiece of action. Not only is it brilliantly shot but it's filled to the brim with small interesting details. The same goes for pretty much every scene of the film. I would've never thought I would rewatch a scene of someone getting coffee multiple times. But I do. Again and again. My only complaints are that some characters lack motivation and that the female characters are absolutely terrible. They're nothing but objects that do whatever the men need them to do. But apart from that this is a modern classic.
Highly recommended!",Baby Driver
