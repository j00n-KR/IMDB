0,kosmasp,Not Cruising,5,7 May 2021,"The movie or story has quite a few themes that are interesting and could be described as deep. And especially early on, it feels like the movie tries to be sensible and might really go full head on with those issues. But than you realize it opts out - takes the easy (cliche) way and route. It sort of panders to the teenage audience it aims at.Now I don't think it is bad overall - but I can see that some people felt offended (intellectually and otherwise) by the movie not taking the viewer seriously. It just isn't the philosophical movie you may expect it or want it to be. Still there are (predictable but still) enough twists and turns and tension to keep you on your toes .. of sorts. It depends on how much suspension of disbelief and how much slack you cut it ...",Voyagers
1,paul_haakonsen,It went from good to laughable in a split second...,3,31 July 2021,"I wasn't sure what to expect from writer and director
Neil Burger with this 2021 sci-fi thriller, but I must admit that the synopsis for the movie sounded fairly interesting. And so without having even seen a trailer or even heard about the movie prior to watching it, I sat down to watch ""Voyagers"".And while ""Voyagers"" did actually start out pretty interesting, and had me entertained, the movie just fell into pieces upon the act where the character Richard died. After that, the movie just became laughable and downright annoying to watch.After the death of Richard, the movie became a pointless theater of fighting, bickering, deception and debauchery, and throw in a hefty bit of bland characters that constantly look like they are seriously constipated. Essentially the movie slipped from being an interesting and atmospheric sci-fi thriller to becoming a mindless clone of ""Lord of the Flies"", but set in space.What really ticked me off here was the ignorance and the behavior of the adolescent characters in the movie. Seriously, they're stuck aboard a space vessel with nowhere to go, and they succumb to such behavior. No, it just seemed way to incomprehensible and ludicrous.Visually then ""Voyagers"" was actually quite good, and there was a good atmospheric sense of claustrophobia and of being crammed inside a space vessel. Just a shame that the storyline had to become such dripple.Essentially watch the movie up to the point where Richard dies, then turn off the movie. At least that way you will walk away with a wholehearted experience of the movie and have good memories of the story. Just don't bother with the second half of the movie, because it was just a big heap of... Well, you know what I mean.""Voyagers"" had potential to be such a great movie and a rather interesting one as well. But a horrible writing of script changed that experience into a joke.I am rating ""Voyagers"" a generous three out of ten stars, and that is mostly based on Colin Farrell's acting, the atmosphere of the first part of the movie and the visuals.",Voyagers
2,zardoz-13,Teens in Space!!!,2,10 May 2021,"Apart from its intriguing premise, the hopelessly predictable, live-action, sci-fi saga ""Voyagers"" (*1/2 OUT OF ****) has little else to distinguish it. First, climate change has ravaged the planet, and the Earth is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Man is running out of time as well as resources! Second, the nearest planet fit for human habitation requires an 86-year voyage! Incredibly, serious minds decide to launch children into space and educate them so they can maintain their spacecraft during this voyage of a lifetime. Later, when they have matured enough, they will reproduce and then train their offspring! Presumably, these first-generation space travelers will apprise the second generation, their sons and daughters, about the dire necessity for colonizing the new planet. Undoubtedly, teens will applaud the confidence mankind has entrusted them with for such a critical mission. Nevertheless, just as parents dread the thought of teens sneaking out for a spin in the family sedan, space agency administrators are just as paranoid about their decision to let everything ride on these teenagers. Ultimately, a space program veteran volunteers to chaperone the thirty young adults dispatched for the stars. Inevitably, you can imagine the deceptive measures which man has taken to keep those young minds focused on the mission. Not only does ""Voyagers"" writer & director Neil Burger know something about YA movies, but he also helmed ""Divergent"" (2014) and was executive producer on both sequels ""Insurgent"" (2015) and ""Allegiant"" (2016), a futuristic film franchise based on Veronica Roth's bestselling novels.""Voyagers"" is set in 2063. Since the trip is an estimated 86-year journey, scientists have assembled a crew from scratch. Thirty test-tube babies--the bioengineered seed of MIT scientists and Nobel laureates--have been incubated in a remote laboratory under close medical scrutiny. These infants are confined for the duration of their stay. They never see either the sun or the moon. They aren't taken for rides in strollers to experience the seasons. Psychologists fear any exposure to either the world or humanity could jeopardize the mission. Similarly, they are concerned about the mission commander, Richard (Colin Farrell of ""Miami Vice""), the accomplished scientist who mentored these gifted youngsters. He is as close as they will ever come to having a parent. He says he can wave goodbye to Earth with few regrets. Indeed, Richard realizes he is taking a one-way trip, but the prospect doesn't frighten him. Nevertheless, he finds himself at a disadvantage when his young cadets bug him with nuisance questions about the mission. When they turn twenty, they approach him with pesky inquiries that make Richard furrow his brow in dread. Literally, these cadets fit British philosopher John Locke's essay about humans at birth being blank slates called tabula rasa. They know nothing more than what their particular culture has programmed into them.Meantime, inquisitive Chris (Tye Sheridan of ""Ready Player One"") and his best buddy Zac (Fionn Whitehead of ""Dunkirk"") discover that their popular beverage, nicknamed ""The Blue,"" which everybody guzzles like tap water, is laced with mysterious chemicals. Indeed, Mission Control has them on a regimen of anti-depressants to minimize any personality disorders. Chris and Zac boycott 'the Blue,' and they experience a radical change. They compete with greater vigor when wrestling since they can muster more strength and tenacity. Eventually, the other cadets follow their example. Before long, Richard finds himself at odds with Chris over this thorny issue. When the ship's communications system breaks down, Richard orders Chris to assist him with a spacewalk to repair the damage. Initially, Zac was assigned to help him, but Richard punishes Zac for groping their medical officer, Sela (Lily-Rose Depp of ""Tusk""), without her consent. Afterward, Richard promises Chris to contact Mission Control about the chemicals in their water supply. Unfortunately, Richard dies from an apparent heart attack. Although the cadets elected Chris as their new leader, they shirk their duties. The friendly rivalry between Chris and Zac reaches a breaking point, and they become bitter enemies. Pandemonium ensues, and the crew turn against each other. Despite Chris's reminder that survival is their first priority, Zac foments an uprising, and his faction raids the weapons arsenal.Sadly, like a pupil plagiarizing a book report on English author William Golding's Nobel Prize-winning novel ""Lord of the Flies,"" Burger has simply swapped out the island setting of Golding's classic with a spaceship. Sadly, studio executives who never read Golding's book but were eager to corner the market signed onto Burger's premise. Presumably, Burger didn't cite Golding because ""Voyagers"" added women to the narrative and outer space served as the setting. Mind you, ""Voyagers"" does a competent job of setting up the situation and getting through the sticky preliminaries. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" production designer Scott Chambliss and Burger have created a sleek, sterile, state-of-the-art spacecraft, but neither the vessel's name nor numerical designation is ever revealed. White is the dominant color. Considering the width of its cramped corridors, the spacecraft seems rather claustrophobic. Lugging oversized space equipment along those passageways would pose a challenge. Two people cannot walk side by side without brushing shoulders. The cadets wind up pushing a plethora of buttons on sophisticated consoles and ogle monitors galore, so ""Voyagers"" never lets you forget it is tech savvy.""Voyagers"" might have fared better as a goofy sex comedy. Imagine something like ""Porky's"" (1981) mashed up with ""Spaceballs"" (1987)! Up to a point, ""Voyagers"" floats several provocative ideas. Alas, the filmmakers don't follow through with anything genuinely original. Not only can you guess the identity of their new leader after Richard's demise, but also the inevitable 'happily ever after' outcome occurs once Zac's rebellion is quashed. After order has been restored but before the end credits roll, you won't be surprised at who is elected to replace Chris. Comparably, ""Voyagers"" isn't as entertaining as either ""Passengers"" (2016) or ""Breach"" (2020), no great shakes themselves, when it comes to depicting mankind's efforts to migrate elsewhere in the universe.",Voyagers
3,siderite,Failed Lord of the Flies in space,7,11 July 2021,"The film had a lot of potential, but it lost it mainly for two reasons. First of all they wasted a lot of time with setting things up, then they moved too fast when it was time for a slower burn. So, pacing, basically. Second of all, it is another of those ""set in space"" stories that have little to do with space other than the flimsiest of setups.The movie starts with a spaceship with a crew of genetically selected children, meant to dutifully run the ship and breed the next generations in order to reach a new planet 86 years later. Ignore all of that. Because the entire story takes place with the first generation realizing that they are kept in check with hormone suppression, stopping taking it, then going through a very short Lord of the Flies episode with some pretty heavy handed ""spaceship Earth"" analogies.Truthfully, I liked how the ""kids"" (they are all older than 23) played their roles and there was quite a lot of tension in the film, the sensation of futility of common sense, the terror that we are all idiot monkeys inside and there is no solution. But then it all went by too fast with no other resolution than a vague message that we are capable of overcoming our fears and rule our worst inner impulses. Too bad, because I think this could have been a better movie is not for all the focus on LED lightning and pointless future weaponry and the pointless extra setup. Even Colin Farrell's character was a bit superfluous. And did they have to place this in space?",Voyagers
4,MLDinTN,"typical follow the leader story, this time set in space",6,30 October 2021,"This movie was OK. Some travelers are going to another planet that takes 86 years to get to. So they create babies on the way. And when they get to be 20 somethings, they soon learn they are being drugged so they won't have emotions. So Zac and Chris stop taking the blue and soon their true personalities emerge. Zac is rather psychotic and is responsible for the chief officer's death which sends everything into chaos. He pretends an alien is onboard and starts making threats. Soon they break into 2 groups. Zac's group finds the weapons and when they learn guns kill, the chase is on. Chris and Sela come up with a great plan and get Zac to charge through a door and they have the door to space open. So Zac gets sucked out but not before drama. And how did Chris make it back after being sucked out. I don't think that would be possible because in space the ship would be moving at a high rate of speed. Andyways they reach the new planet. The end.FINAL VERDICT: A young adult take as to what happens when people get cooped up for too long and their crazy personalities emerge. Worth a watch.",Voyagers
5,UniqueParticle,Really enjoyable definitely doesn't deserve the hate,9,10 October 2021,"Neil Burger is really good at his craft I haven't enjoyed quite a few of his projects and I absolutely love space movies! Lily Rose Depp and Tye Sheridan are magnificent together; they're characters are intriguing. The editing is one of my favorites, I have obsession with a flow of images in a show or film I kinda wish I knew how to edit. I love stories about young people and even better that it's based in space with horror elements! I do think the biggest problem is how off track and out of control some of the it is but that doesn't mean Voyagers deserves to be bashed.",Voyagers
6,cruise01,Sci fi premise that focuses on human wild nature but stylistic film.,7,10 April 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.Voyagers is a pretty fair science fiction film about a biologically created group of kids. Who are going on a voyage to a new planet to colonize and start over. But while on a space voyage. They discover there pleasure senses have been reduced from a drug they been taking. They decide to stop which there wild instincts kick in into madness. Which the group of teens will be divided from trying to have a civilized rule to a living life wild which can put the future of humanity at risk.What worked? The concept and plot is promising. In a future. Earth is no longer livable. Researchers decides to genetically create humans so they wont be attached from leaving earth. They have been isolated from civilization. And Richard (Colin Farrell) who is a researcher and a mentor. Tags along with the space crew to make sure they are behaving. Until they start to lose control.The set designs and visual effects are great. Kind of feels similiar to the movie Passengers.The cast ensemble is good. Colin Farrell is good. Tye Sheridan and Lily-Rose Depp were great. Fionn Whitehead playing a rebellious teen who is trying to create fear within the group and trying to live there lives selfishly was good too.What did not work? The film is a slow burn thriller. The second act is slow and boring in the middle. Could have been a faster direction. The film does pick up when tension rises with Tye Sheridan and Fionn Whitehead are divided and fighting each other.Also the music score was a bit dull for a science fiction space thriller. Which kind of made the movie feel a little dull.It does have an interesting premise and some thrills and a great cast. Which could have been better.,Voyagers
7,Tweetienator,Pretty Standard Teen Sci-fi Flick,4,12 June 2021,"Just another predictable movie - climate change (what else?) destroys human habitat, mankind must be saved (why?), so you put up a lot of teen clones to the task to be the last of mankind... Of course hormons will endager the whole mission. I bet, there must be some secret movie fond that finances movies that got something to do with climate change. Anyway, production and cast are solid, so Voyagers is not a total fail, and maybe young teens may like it cuz they can identify with our young but stupid heroes (well, stupidity is a trademark of our movie heroes these days, no matter what age). Maybe bearable for fans of movies and shows like The 100, 3%, Equals and the like.",Voyagers
8,imseeg,What a cheap mediocre scifi wannabe,3,10 August 2021,"This movie looks cheap and is unimpressive, to put it very politely.The bad: no supsense, no thrill, no jokes, no action, no drama, there is only mediocrity to be enjoyed. This is one of those cheaply made ""scifi"" movies that aspire to be serious and mysterious and whatever, but end up being nothing more than a cheaply made B-movie.Not any good?

9,paul-allaer,"Intriguing premise/strong start, but then fizzles out into ""Lords of the Flies In Space""",5,11 April 2021,"As ""Voyagers"" (2021 release; 108 min.) opens, we are informed that in 2063 a new planet is discovered that will allow the human race to survive, but it will take 86 years to get there. A crew 0f 30 young people is being prepped in isolation for the journey. Then out of the blue Richard, the mission's leader, announces he wants to go along as well, even though it is an one-way ticket and means certain death. The mission takes off in 2067, and then we go to ""Ten Years Later""... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this s the latest film from writer-director Neil Burger, who is quite familiar with the sci-fi genre from his 2014 film ""Divergent"". Here he brings a new variation on a familiar theme: how the human race looks to the skies for survival on another faraway earth-like planet. In and of itself an intriguing premise (and hence one that is revisited regularly by Hollywood). The new element is that the crew of 30 will never reach the end and hence it will be their children and grandchildren who will benefit from all this. So far so good. Sadly, the movie makes a 90 degree (or frankly even 180 degree) diversion into ""Lord of the Flies In Space"" that is frankly pointless and plain dumb, and from which the movie never recovers. Colin Farrell (as Richard) appears for about the initial 45 min. In the film (in the all too obvious ""we need a star attached top this project"" tole. The rest of the cast are mostly non-names, the best of which is Lily-Rose Depp (yes, Johnny's daughter) who bears a striking resemblance to her mother (Vanessa Paradis). The movie's electronic core (by a certain Trevor Gureckis) is a blatant rip-off from Hana Zimmer's electronic scores like ""Blade Runner 2049"". The movie's production set is stylish and looks quite nice, keeping in mind the movie's relative low production budget (about $30 million). But none of these issues can mask the fact that the movie's strong start fizzles out completely and never recovers.""Voyagers"" was supposed to open in theaters last Fall but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. It finally opened this weekend. The Friday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati turned out to be a private screening: I was the only person in the theater. The rest of the 16 screen movieplex was an absolute ghost town, just eerie. Meanwhile, whether you are a fan of sci-fi movies or simply a fan of Colin Farrell and you keep your expectations low, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theaters, on VOD< or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Voyagers

11,stevendbeard,'Lord of the Rings' Type Situation,6,10 April 2021,"I saw ""Voyagers"", starring Tye Sheridan-the X_Men movies, Ready Player One; Lily_Rose Depp-The King, The Dancer, Oh yeah, she is Johnny's daughter; Fionn Whitehead-Don't Tell a Soul, Dunkirk and Colin Farrell-Ava, Horrible Bosses.This is a study of what happens when your emotions are kept under control for too long-or let loose, all of a sudden. Colin leads a group of about 30 young people-about 10 years old-on a space mission to colonize a new planet. It takes 86 years to get there so Colin is just suppose to keep an eye on the kids as they grow up and mold them into a well oiled group of explorers. Since the kids will probably have died before they reach the planet-their grandkids will be doing the colonization-they are drugged with their food into having no emotions. No emotions, no problems, at least that is what was decided before lift off by the adults in charge. Tye & Fionn discover the deception and soon, there is a mutiny and 2 groups are formed, with Tye & Fionn leading the 2 different groups-each group has a different opinion on how things should be done on the ship. Pretty soon, you have a 'Lord of the Flies' type situation with complete anarchy. Lily plays the medical student on board that is also sought after by Tye & Fionn when their control is less than what it should be.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including sexual assault but no nudity-and a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",Voyagers

13,kevin_robbins,New age Lord of the Flies with a space twist,6,27 April 2021,"Voyagers (2021) is a movie recently released in theatres my Mrs. And I caught last week. The storyline focuses on an 86 year space voyage to a planet that supports life. A group of babies and a scientist are sent in a spacecraft where they will live virtually their entire life on the space ship, the babies never knowing Earth, their parents and taking medications that keeps their emotions and mental state stable. When the children discover this they stop taking the medications and all hell breaks loose on the ship. This science fiction movie is directed by Neil Burger (Divergent and The Illusionist) and stars Tye Sheridan (Mud), Lily-Rose Depp (Tusk), Fionn Whitehead (Dunkirk), Chante Adams (The Photograph) and Quintessa Swindell (Black Adam in 2022). This movie has a new age Lord of the Flies feel to it with a space twist. The characters, acting and storyline was fairly interesting and at times very intense. There were some frustrating sequences that had me grabbing my head and screaming ""why."" The ending was fulfilling and the movie is worth a watch. It won't be one of your favorite science fiction films but is a nice change of speed. I'd score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",Voyagers

15,yusufpiskin,Lord of the Flies w/Burger & Farrell & Sheridan,6,3 May 2021,"A didacticism disguised as a young teen sci-fi joint. Operates in spurts and violent sparks, there a multiple sequences where we get lighting speed montages of images associated with lust and it triggered the exact feeling in my brain when I first felt that sensation. The young people are experiencing all these things for the first time, they were raised in a society where everything is insular and they were never taught basic human concepts. Once they do get a taste for it the reality of their species becomes apparent, multiple ideologies come head to head.Voyagers has a great concept and it goes through interesting paths throughout the film as it is a slow-burner film packed with thrilling sequences, themes of love, friendship, and betrayal. All of those themes are visually explored and it just makes everything very stylistic breathtaking within its own matter. The film itself is definitely unique, sincere, and entertaining whilst the production design is beautiful to look at. The character development featured in the film was just fascinating but the chemistry, not so much. Honestly, the directing could've been better within some scenes as the cast members' performances weren't outstanding.... Well, it kinda was occasionally but it wasn't the best if you get what I'm saying. Loved the aspect ratio change throughout the film as well.The film's score was just great as well, it definitely blends in well with the theme of the film. You usually don't get any films like this one. Imo, this film is underrated based on people's thoughts of the film so far. Don't watch the trailer because it's terrible and the film is completely different and you may like it but not everyone will. But Neil, please release the extended director's cut on digital or physical release for more violence and gore. You already said that it is a thing but please do release it some time.",Voyagers

17,aidanratesmovies,It's Lord of the Flies...in space,4,23 July 2021,"A bland and formulaic adventure with some great sci-fi concepts, Voyagers never gets a chance to fully develop as its own film and instead relies on familiar territory for a rather mediocre execution. I like the idea of this film, and it starts out quite interesting, if predictable, but interesting. The sci-fi concepts at hand could have been dealt with so much more uniquely than what director/writer Neil Burger went with. To put it simply, once the first 30 minutes passes, this film is basically Lord of the Flies in space. Instead of relying on the psychological and physical aspects of what may be happening aboard the ship, the film mechanically trots along the same path the classic novel does with every cliche in the book. Not only that, but the film is also just incredibly dull, which is bizarre giving its subject matter- it should be so much more entertaining to watch. I have to say the first half of the film is far better developed than the second half, as Burger clearly had no idea what direction he wanted the film to go and just decided to wrap the thing up best he could as fast as he could. All the actors do a decent job, some can be a bit more overdone than others, but everyone does put their all into it and it's nice to see some effort put into the film along the way. The visuals can often be quite beautiful, and the cinematography quite well done. Its visually pleasing, but it lacks much depth, and easily could have been a lot more with some extra effort. In the end, Voyagers is yet another sci-fi dud that's potential was far greater than the final execution.My Rating: 4/10.",Voyagers
18,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Voyagers,7,2 November 2021,"Science fiction films tend to be more of the same and well, that's what I went into thinking when I was about to watch Voyagers. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised. 2021's Voyagers breaks the mold or at least it intends to. It's knife-edge, intense, and gets all it can out of its $29 million dollar budget. It's been thirty years but we can now actually call a flick Lord of the Sci-Flies.So yeah, Voyagers blurs the lines of its PG-13 rating. There's some bloody images and nubile themes that may be a little too much for your normal budding youth. Coming from the enthusiastic mind of director Neil Burger (Divergent, Limitless), Voyagers has a pristine look and can actually wow you on the big screen (sadly it might be too late for that). With cinematographer Enrique Chediak on board and game, Voyagers is 2001-ish with some serious, Steadicam bliss.Taking place in the year 2063 and containing adequate set designs that are futuristic enough, Voyagers is the space-age version of ""inmates running the asylum"" (or not running, just rebelling). It's about a group of teenagers sent on a spacecraft mission to colonize a planet because the living conditions on Earth just ain't cutting it.Voyagers at a sufficient running time of 108 minutes, is basically cut from original cloth unless you count the 1990 film mentioned earlier (see first paragraph). Edited cleanly, stealth in its violence, and cast almost perfectly (Tye Sheridan, Lily-Rose Depp, and Colin Farrell are really good here), Voyagers only suffers from a pat and speedy ending that sort of wraps everything up in a nice neat bow. Whatev. It's about the journey here or should I say, the journey of 86 years from our planet. Voyagers revels in cinematic conflict as its characters let natural selection and vacuumed Darwinism weed itself out. Good peregrination.",Voyagers

It deep dives into what motivates by examine our animal nature that brings forward self-interested factions into conflict with each other. Why the blue was mixed into their beverage to control the otherwise uncontrollable destructive nature in all of us. It also questions whether our animal nature dictates our behavior or can we decide to overcome animal urges to be above it all. Nature vs Nurture.

22,msbreviews,"Voyagers holds a well-known, successful sci-fi formula and takes it through the most uninteresting, unsurprising, frustratingly generic development path.",2,8 April 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)When people ask me my favorite genre, I usually reply with the admittedly annoying and cliche ""I enjoy every type of film"". While this is ultimately true, I do tend to love sci-fi and a couple of other genres more than the rest. I find sci-fi to be one of the most creative filmmaking sources, partially due to the infinite potential of its storytelling. From extraterrestrial life to an exploration of deep space, our world knows so little of what's beyond our planet, which makes the respective genre a perfect framework for imaginative, unique fiction. Voyagers features an interesting cast, but Neil Burger was behind the disappointingly hollow Divergent saga, so I couldn't help but go in with very low expectations.Even anticipating a tough watch, I never thought Voyagers would be a contender for one of the worst flicks of the year. The general premise is far from being groundbreaking, even with the not-that-original spin that it puts on the ""colonization of another planet"" concept. Still, it's considered a formula because it worked on several other occasions. It just doesn't in this movie. The group of young people bred separately from the outer world could have received an innovative, inventive arc but instead follows an incredibly generic, dull, lazy character development path. The chaos and mayhem triggered by a single person - who just so happens to embody literally everything that's wrong with our society - is as extremely forced as it is utterly ridiculous.In fact, it even raises logical questions regarding the premise of the film. Obviously, people can be born into the same place with the same education, morals, and everything that comes with growing up and still develop a distinct personality. However, Burger doesn't demonstrate why some characters end up challenging the authority and questioning their purpose. Everything happens because it needs to happen. A character performs an irrational action because the plot demands it. Most of the story development is given through absurdly childish dialogues, where a character repeatedly asks ""why?"" to someone with some sort of an answer.Burger's screenplay barely survives due to the lack of any exciting characteristic. From an obviously misleading subplot to the frustratingly predictable main narrative, this movie carries zero surprises. The horrendously choppy, abrupt editing work (Naomi Geraghty) turns an already complicated watch into something borderline irritating. Add weirdly creepy, nonsensical imagery of random life events on completely arbitrary points of the runtime, and Voyagers becomes a really hard film to genuinely enjoy. With no flow between scenes, the primary mission is lost in the first minutes, and the characters fail to complete any resemblance of an arc.Actually, it's ironically funny how Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark in Game of Thrones) continues the trend of not doing anything relevant in a movie or TV series. Unfortunately, not even the cast saves this disaster. Tye Sheridan (Dark Phoenix), Lily-Rose Depp (Crisis), and Fionn Whitehead (Dunkirk) try their hardest with the poor scripts, but some line deliveries are truly cringe-worthy. Colin Farrell's (The Gentlemen) character suffers from one of Burger's numerous bad decisions, ending up as yet another forgettable component of the film. The ending arrives way too fast, something that attests to the way too fast pacing.In these cases where I struggle to find positives in the two pillars of any movie - story and characters - I turn to the technical elements to help me out. Sadly, Voyagers is one of the rare one-location films that doesn't feel suspenseful or claustrophobic, despite many efforts. From the surprisingly ordinary score (Trevor Gureckis) to the by-the-numbers camera work (Enrique Chediak), there's not a single aspect I can take with me as an ""at least that was great"" thought. I guess the set design looks futuristic enough for a spaceship, but once again, it's nothing viewers haven't seen before.Voyagers holds a well-known, successful sci-fi formula and takes it through the most uninteresting, unsurprising, frustratingly generic development path. Neil Burger's screenplay fails to deliver a creative, captivating story with compelling characters, offering the complete opposite. From the terrible editing work to the extremely lazy plot development, passing through cringe-worthy dialogues and randomly weird, irrelevant imagery, it's tough to find a positive aspect in such a hollow movie. Even though most of the runtime is spent in a single location, the suspense levels are close to zero. The themes of the story are clear from the get-go, but the execution of almost every plot point or character action feels incredibly forced. The set design is the only technical component worthy of some appreciation. Not even a talented cast can overcome the awful scripts. A contender for one of the worst films of the year.Rating: D-",Voyagers
23,Stanlee107,Another teen space drama film,3,14 May 2021,"This is basically lord of the flies set in space. This also remind me of Maze runner. The storyline is so stupid. After the only adult ""mysteriously"" dies and all the teenagers are left to fend for themselves, the antagonist and protagonist are plotted against one another. The antagonist sells the story that a monster did it (if he had said a ghost did it then it would be equally implausible). It is inadvertently hilarious with how bad it is & even a teenager may struggle to enjoy this film!",Voyagers
24,trinaboice,Hormonal teens in space. What could possibly go wrong?,4,22 April 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Hormonal teenagers running a spaceship...what could possibly go wrong? This teen thriller feels like a futuristic space version of William Golden's Lord of the Flies. So, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Lionsgate presents this new space drama written and directed by Neil Burger. He stated, ""It's about human nature in a vacuum - who we are at our core.""I really loved Neil Burger's film Limitless and highly recommend it. The TV series off-shoot was also very good. They both take a look at how drugs affect the human psyche and how we see the world. I also thought his Divergent franchise was entertaining, so I was excited to see what he was going to do with this movie.THINGS I LIKED:
Tye Sheridan leads the pack of hormonal teens in space. I really liked him in Ready Player One and he has even been in the recent X-Men: Apocalypse movies. He started his acting career at a very young age with roles in movies like Mud and Joe. He always plays a likable guy, so I immediately liked his character.Fans of Johnny Depp will get a kick out of seeing his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp as the leading lady in the movie. Her mom is the famous French singer, Vanessa Paradis. You can also see her in her most recent movie ""Crisis"" and see my movie review of that film here.Colin Farrell always makes a film better. Sadly, he's underutilized in this movie.Another leading character is played by Fionn Whitehead from Dunkirk (great movie!)
While most of the movie is pretty dark, the ending sequence was very hopeful. As viewers, we know the story isn't over, so it's fun to imagine these characters' grandchildren completing this mission.I really liked the concept of sacrifice for the greater good and how these characters would never actually land on the destination. Instead, their grandchildren would be the ones to reach the goal.Many of the scenes feel claustrophobic, which causes us to imagine what it would be like to live in such an environment. The set designs are clean and sleek.The music is really great.Impressive cinematography, especially considering the very tight spaces.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
You need to suspend your disbelief to initially accept the questionable premise of raising children in a sterile, almost non-human environment...as if that's ever going to be a good idea. It certainly makes a case for the importance of being nurtured, rather than engineered. Children need to learn how to deal with their emotions.There's a scene where the music starts to build and then, all of a sudden, the music stops and the screen reads ""Ten years later."" There are several abrupt transitions like that.Some things don't make sense. For example, the kids aren't supposed to have emotions, but one of them starts to cry and another one says he's afraid long before they stop drinking the substance that prevents their emotions.This actually could have been an interesting mini-series on TV so that there would be enough time to really get to know the characters and care about them. As it is, most of the teenagers are annoying. Some of the secondary characters aren't very compelling at all.The awkward dialogue makes it difficult for the actors to really dig in.It wastes the potential of taking a more profound look at human nature. Acts 1 and 2 start to dive into nuanced concepts, but Act 3 turns into a more young-adult thriller that only addresses the underlying issues on a surface level.There really isn't any humor and most of the characters are robotic during the entire film.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

So what if the story was far fetched, that is the definition of a Si-fi! Someone with a closed imagination would just not get it. It would have been a 10 for me but the camera moving so much almost made me throw it back down to a 5. Story was solid and I loved the ending. I just wish would would have seen the grand children.

28,WalkdenEntertainment,Earth Has A Big Problem...,5,8 April 2021,"The future is here. Earth has a significant problem as it continues to heat up more and more, making it an unliveable planet. The only way the people of Earth can get by is to investigate and find a new home.Thirty young men and women are selected for a critical mission. The selection includes some of the finest young people of Earth who are well educated and healthy. Leading the mission is Richard (Colin Farrell), who is quite passionate to support the crew as much as possible. To the young people, he is a teacher, counsellor, and a general close friend. The mission will take over eighty years, which means the young people selected will never get to see their new home, but their purpose is to create new life once they are the appropriate age, and then the next generation will save the entire world.The mission is in progress, but Christopher (Tye Sheridan) & Zac (Fionn Whitehead) begin to question a few elements on the ship. They examine a blue liquid that they must drink daily and wonder why certain areas on the ship are hidden. What starts as a minor act of rebellion becomes a path of madness and paranoia, not just for Christopher and Zac but for the entire onboard crew. They also begin to question each other on topics such as leadership, affections and trust. To make matters worse, the team are also on edge as they learn there could be the threat of an alien creature on the ship. Can the mission be completed to save Earth? Will members of the ship survive the chaos?Visually, I found Voyagers to be rather pleasing. The world of outer space and future technology concepts on the ship were rather creative and great to see, and elements such as the sound effects were also outstanding. As a plot, Voyagers has a slow start. Once we see the ship members begin to raise questions and take risks, I was generally curious to know what will happen next. I was also questioning if the ship did really have an alien creature on board.But sadly, Voyagers is not a simple watch. While Voyagers delivers a pleasing world of space and sci-fi, the film's plot is quite messy. We witness characters doing repeated things: questioning the truth, arguing over leadership, exhibiting trust issues, and seeing teenagers discover their emotions and sexual feelings for the first time. While such discovery seems like an interesting concept for the first time, the film reveals these aspects in a repetitive, confusing manner. It is also frustrating watching these so-called intelligent youth make continually unwise choices.The film is also entirely predictable, contains cheesy performances, and there are some moments that I generally found awkward to watch. Watching a teenager touch a young girl without her permission for the first time with no real consequences, even from an adult figure, was extremely disappointing to see. Make note; this is not the type of film to share on a first date.The editing here is also questionable. There are moments where characters discuss an issue or have conflict only to get distracted by another issue that is occurring elsewhere, and the dispute is suddenly ignored. The film does not flow well, and scenes feel disjointed, failing to bring continuous flow to the story. After the film, I questioned if many cuts and edits were made for the sake of the film's runtime. For the most part, performances were fine, but by the third act, characters become more laughable than serious as they deliver lines that are just unfitting, cheesy and over the top.Overall, while I enjoy the concept of a group of youth travelling to a new planet to save the world and visually Voyagers has a few genuinely pleasing aspects as a sci-fi movie, it is messy and awkward. The editing is questionable, making scenes feel more disjointed rather than seamless. The film is also incredibly predictable regarding its mysteries. The plot elements feel repetitive as we watch the ship's crew bicker and argue over the same topic repeatedly to the point the film becomes laughable instead of something more exciting and memorable. Voyagers felt as though it was aimed at a more teenage audience.4.7/10 - Walkden Entertainment.",Voyagers

It just felt like it could but it wasn't. It was a mere thought-experiment in every way in which the original story was. What is significant, especially if you're NOT white is, who's on that ship? That question alone unleashes a canopy of concerns not relevant to the film itself.

The set design is excellent, and along with cold emotionless expressions on the actors and shots of the mundane lives of the would-be colonists, helps to establish a plausible set-up with tons of potential. They know they're the first generation of a ship on a multi-generational voyage to colonize another planet, and may also be humanity's last hope of survival. Their grim personas express their awareness of this fact and that the mission is paramount. There's even a mysterious hint at an unexpected presence on the ship to add to the suspense.Don't bother watching the second half though. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it tries to adapt a plot similar to Lord of the Flies, however the big difference here is that these teenagers are supposed to have been highly trained for this mission their entire lives, and are literally the future of humanity. They're not a ragtag group of students on a deserted island struggling for survival.I don't think I need to use any spoilers for you to imagine how trying to shoehorn the Lord of the Flies plot into this situation leads to a trainwreck of a last half. The script takes a sharp turn into utter nonsense with ridiculous dialogue and characters actions. It is truly such a pity and a waste of a great set-up.I will say that I was impressed with the performance of Tye Sheridan in particular, and Colin Farrell can rarely do wrong as well. The other main actors were decent at best, or just too weighed down by atrocious dialogue to make anything of their performances.I'd recommend watching the first 40min or so (8/10) and then just walking away and imagining your own conclusion.

If you like that kind of movie, MAYBE (big maybe) this is for you, but it really doesn't even deliver that well. There are much better films that play with these themes than Voyager.Frankly, it was pretty lite on everything. Beyond the initial premise of what might happen on a long-term colonization spaceflight to an exoplanet, this film really didn't offer much. It wasn't particularly thought-provoking, fun, action-packed, suspenseful, dramatic, nor did it play with any new ideas. It was completely formulaic and predictable.While not hard science fiction, the movie Passengers was a more entertaining and better-looking interstellar trip than Voyagers. Both films have kind of similar endings as well.This one had me bored by the beginning of the second act, and the third act was just meh.

Well you obviously drug them into a stupor until of course someone stops taking the drugs and hilarity ensues. The only real star and adult is killed off early leaving the big star Lilly Rose Depp, yep, that Depp. Unfortunately talent seems to skip a generation and those acting lessons she took from a block of wood didn't help. Well there's a big mystery about a room that was meant for the ""third generation"" crew. Okay, you have a shipload of hormonal sociopaths, what's the one thing you want to make sure they have lots of......guns. Yes, the big secret was an armory to save time so once they get to the new world they can start their first war right after landing. A great way to jump start civilization. The sets are nice and not a lot of effects, everything else sucks. EVERYTHING! The only way it could have been worse is if they decided to make it a musical. Maybe the sequel will be a musical?

It's well made, pretty well acted. Sure, yes, it is a teenager movie (but that's Neil Burger's whole area of expertise), but it's also got decent sets, decent storytelling. It's well paced, no obvious plot holes per se. All in all a professional outing, so in my book a solid 8.You could argue that big science fiction as a whole has just disappeared, movies based on premises like Asimov's books had, or Arthur C Clarke's. The era of grand and philosophical sci-fi is almost certainly over, and most sci-fi these days is just thinly veiled action. I think this movie does that too, it's not really profound or sincere about its premise, it's an entertainment vehicle that's not trying to be profound. Most sci-fi movies these days are like that, and this is no exception. But it's watchable, it's well made, and it doesn't have any obvious mistakes to point out, so it feels like a well made movie.

The movie is interesting to watch albeit it has its cheesy moments and is a complete rip-off of the classic Lord of the flies.First of all the acting is pretty good, it has some emotionless moments that could have used some beefing up however. It was all to drive the plot around the lord of the flies copying.Secondly, cinematographically speaking it delivers a nice claustrophobic feel similar to the film Alien, the music also reminds some of it. Especially during the credits.Lastly, I would like to point out its basically lord of the flies in space, the characters are even the same , they even have a dedicated Piggy character.

142,randomhooves,Lord of the flies... in space.,6,1 November 2021,"It's an interesting concept, although the basic premise seems to be around a century early, both in terms of technology, and necessity - in around 40 years due to 'impending doom' of climate change a bunch of vat grown kids (and Colin Farrell) are blasted off to an exo-planet 86 years away (we're not told how far, just how long). They are to be the first of three generations along the journey. They have been isolated from things normal kids have done (no outdoors or family) and throughout childhood and adolescence have been drugged to suppress their baser urges. Some of them realise this, and stop taking the behaviour inhibitors, leading to a Lord of the flies like revolution happening after Colin clocks out following a potentially extraterrestrial encounter.

I will seperate problems into two: scientific and constructional.Scientific:The Blue Drink is probably water and blue alum mix which is basically a much more pure variant of white alum powder which decreases sexual tension. It has a few side-effects and it wouldn't numb people's all emotions rather make them focus easier and avoid mental tiredness that urges bring. The assumption of the movie is wrong, it wouldn't people into robots and cut it off all at once wouldn't led squeezing a girls breasts in front of everbody.Even small exposure space would affect bodies drastically. So, Zack wouldn't survive or keep his strength during the last fighting scene.Spices usually lasts between 1-2 years and their scent even less. Spices Richard kept wouldn't be possible to keep in normal cirmustances.The guns wouldn't work in artificial gravity in the way they normally would.Constructional:Lily Rose's character has nothing for story. She is like a vase, a trophy in the movie, and it is quite uncomfortable for the audience to see.There is no character development or introduction, the story suddenly throw into situation about people we do not know or care.Unconvincing twist, It was obvious that Zac selfishly killed Richard, and Christopher has proof, but after Zac started to lie/manipulate, chris just did not play the rest of the video.

Too bad they IGNORED that approach in the plot & characters.There are so many plot holes and out-right scientific inaccuracies, I was beginning to think the writers were the same ones who wrote Superman 4: the Quest for Peace.If there was an after-show (ala Talking Dead) I could imagine the producers say ""we needed the characters to do this & that because that's how we move the plot along""... regardless if the character or their actions make ANY sense.These ship crew members are the best & the brightest of humanity yet all but one of them seem to have the IQ in single digits or are all part of a cult that simply believes without any reason whatever their leader in that moment tells them. I was genuinely surprised there was no act 3 plot twist that these kids physically de-evolve into prehistoric cavemen since that's how they seem to be acting already.The first half of the film seems promising, but the last half can only be enjoyed if you turn your brain off or regress into a preschooler mentality and just watch the pretty pictures on screen.Neil deGrasse Tyson would have a field day tipping this movie apart! Sure, movies demand a level of suspension of belief,... but when we're placed in a universe where the average human intelligence being just below Forrest Gup range and science & technology have no resemblance to our own, & then we are told to just go with the plot because that's what's happening for no reason other than ""this is who we really are"" type of explanation, it's pretty darn difficult to be entertained by such mindless tripe.The the first half hour shows promise; and the production values and acting are top notch - which is it's only saving grace, but otherwise, this movie was such a waste when it could have gone in any number of different directions that the one it settled on.",Voyagers

Unfortunately the plot quickly turns into something that could basically be put into any setting. The whole concept and purpose of the space expedition does no longer matter, and the film focuses on what someone deservedly reviewed as a ""Lord of the Flies in space"" narrative.I'd say the film does not deserve the very negative reviews, as despite its odd pacing, it has some thriller qualities. However after the first half of the movie, almost everything - even the climax - becomes completely predictable, and the character building comes to a complete halt when the actions of the protagonists become more and more unrealistic.Concluding I'd say it's entertaining for a movie night at home, the first half is decent in terms of cast, visuals and soundtrack, the second half is mediocre; so don't expect too much, and it's probably not worth a cinema visit.",Voyagers

That's my only gripe. Could have made it more interesting by having a psycho on board caused by the drug perhaps.Most of the reviews are about expecting something supernatural/aliens or a twist that its all a simulation and vote it low but in a real situation this is the most likely outcome as far as what could go bad bar some catastrophic ship failure/collision. On an important trip like this there would be numerous safeguards against going off protocol. They wouldnt be able to go off the blue first of all.

190,gtsstl,Lord of the Flies in Space,3,19 June 2021,"Voyagers has a similar plot to Lord of the Flies. Obviously the space setting differs as does the age of the actors. The preview left me expecting the movie would show teenagers reveling in an awakening of feelings after stopping their intake of a pleasure suppressing blue liquid. Instead the teenagers descend into madness and follow the same path of primitive aggression and power struggles as in Lord of the Flies. This hardly makes sense on a spacecraft which requires some careful management by its passengers. It would seem that violence and destruction aboard a spacecraft could easily lead to endangering all of the lives on board. Just like the Beast in Lord of the Flies there is an ""Alien"" which a challenger uses to inspire fear and draw followers away from the elected leader. There is even a celebratory feast which the challenger uses to consolidate power; he promises to feed and protect his followers. The outcome diverges somewhat from the Lord of the Flies as the space setting requires a different sort of rescue or resolution. The main motivation for making this movie seems to be showing teens in a situation where they are released from adult supervision and allowed to follow their urges. As a viewer I hoped this would be more fun and less problematic than it becomes.",Voyagers

194,sinischism,Two words - DUMB & INSULTING,3,2 May 2021,"Just some quick background for you all, in that I usually try not to beat up on movies despite the fact they may not meet my expectations (as that would entail probably sitting here on this site 24/7 writing about the myriad of dozens up on dozens of disappointing efforts over the years)I'm a HUGE sci-fi fan and of course also love other genres as well, just to give you some background.To that end, I recently checked this film out, as it seemed like an interesting premise. And frankly, it was. The first half of the movie was well done and fairly realistic. Unfortunately (and here is where we have a bit of a spoiler alert), once the antagonist (and his soon to be brain-dead sheep followers) was fully infused with hyper-testosterone by not taking the specific protocol of medication required for all of the crew members, the film went straight into the garbage bin for me.I mean, did the director really think that teenagers are so completely stupid that they would believe an 'alien' was involved in the death of the adult/supervising character (Colin Farrell) especially after they saw for themselves the actual video of him (the aforementioned antagonist) showing that he was the one who in fact killed the Farrell character?I just shook my head as things continued to spiral out of control into complete nonsense (and no, as some have alluded to, this was NO Lord of the Flies meets Space - Lord of the Flies was an excellent character study and a fine novel but this film was a pathetic and disgraceful attempt to try and seemingly mimic some of the dynamics of said novel and it failed miserably to do so)It's really too bad, as I indicated, the premise was interesting and the first half was quite good. Yet the last part of the film was a hot-mess of teen-angst meets out of control hormone self-indulgence.All I have to say is, STAY AWAY from this piece of ludicrous garbage and check out so many other very fine sci-fi/space flicks that are out there - contact me if you would like a list.Cheers.",Voyagers

Movies from the 50s and even 60s had folks walking around on spaceships as if they had gravity, but movies made now should know better. If the makers of this movie were trying to pretend that we invented artificial gravity just 50 years from now it is not mentioned.

208,godosenteksist,Great depiction of the human species.,9,17 May 2021,"Most reviews here are tragic, saying this isn't what would happen, and the best of humans would know better than this going out in space. Well, if that movie was made, of a crew that was sent out on a 86 year trip and everything was fine and dandy, what kind of entertainment would that be? Instead, this movie is smart about showing the very core of human nature as it's being introduced in the later development of the young adult mind. Do people reviewing this movie have any clue or evidence of this experiment on humans? No one has, because it's a SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE idea.Even though every part of this movie is a cliche, it still delivers the message of our faults. How just one bad seed can spread fear and devastation, how peer pressure works, common enemy strategy and all other aspects of how every dictator has used their manipulation to drive their hate through people. If this isn't a perfect example of entertainment AND education, then what is?The cast is amazing and deliver such a performance of how it feels to go through existential crisis and experience revelations of a wider knowledge than the small world they've grown to know. Acting is in the eyes, not in the words.Anyone who says this movie is dumb or unrealistic, do so because they didn't understand it. It's like when someone says they understand how a car works because they can check the oil level themselves, then when asked to explain how the engine works, they resort to name calling and how dumb it is to cover up they have no idea.

209,taylorhayzlett,It was okay,4,2 May 2021,"I first found out about Voyagers after Lily-Rose posted something on Instagram promoting it. I thought it looked interesting, and had a cool trailer. Not to mention a topic that had lots of potential. I rented it today, not really expecting anything because of all of the bad reviews I had seen about it before. I went in thinking the acting would be bad, the writing would be mediocre, and it would just be an okay movie. After watching it, I can tell you that it wasn't that bad. The acting was actually fine considering that all of the kids are supposed to have no personalities. The writing is where my issue is. This is a great concept for a movie, but it was executed poorly. Richard was killed off much too early, and I feel like he wasn't very necessary to the plot. All of the characters made stupid decisions from there on out. I think the probably with the movie is the character of Zac. He became a creep almost immediately after stopping The Blue. He resorted to inappropriately touching the women in the ship without consent. I know that they've never known anything like this before, but all of these kids are supposed to be extremely intelligent. I feel like they might know right from wrong. Also, I find it hard to believe that once everyone was off the drug, that they all either turned to partying, or fighting. I think that's a stupid stereotype put onto teenagers in pop culture. I also think it's weird that everyone on the ship would mindlessly follow Zac down his hole of madness, and his random killing spree where he restored to shooting everyone who didn't agree with him. Overall, this movie is fine. I think I would recommend it, but it's not my favorite.",Voyagers

The writers decided to cart way back on the trip and offer a shallower, wide angle study of the group dynamic versus detailed character studies or engineering functions. Human nature cannot be deterred it posits wisely; the id and ego emerge, hormones flow, and so that goes. To generate conflict, superstition is introduced as a boogie man and bad things happen; corny as it usually is, many believe. There are a few thrilling sequences, predictable but with a payoff. Scripting had to meet the writers demands it seems, and is mostly sparse and punctual. Performances by the leads I felt are more than adequate as they did their jobs. The film is like a detailed Da Vinci painting, though not as valuable - we can zoom in on details in various areas of the story but when we stand back and take in the whole, the details fade and we appreciate the larger, more important story. It turns out we will keep on punching each other in the nose on the way, but we'll get there.",Voyagers

The themes on humanity at it's worst self is emphasized throughout the film but the execution is too clumsy for it to make much of an emotional impact. It just goes to show that we don't need alien intruders, crashing asteroids, or severe malfunctions in the spaceship to threaten the mission when the worst of human nature can cause a much bigger problem.We also witness the kindness of compassionate and sympathetic characters like Sela (Lily-Rose Depp) that balances out the movie's equilibrium to an extent.Think it has more to do with the outlook on humanity's worst self more than the spectacle of showing breathtaking views of space and distant exoplanets.

Now imagine this feeling, but left alone in space, unchecked.For me, the movie was an excellent thought experiment on the human psychology on what would happen if we would put together and train a crew, and then send them trough space. The existential dread, puberty, impulse control, the fear of the unknown, group dynamics, manipulative sociopaths. What motivation even keeps us alive? It's all in the movie and it's nicely done.*** Spoiler Alert ***Most people seem to dislike the behavior of the teenagers and criticize how they are about to fail a mission that they have been trained for. The insanely expensive mission that is supposed to be humanity hope.But guess what, they hit puberty and are constantly drugged in secret to dull their emotions and thoughts, so that they would just be functioning humanoids keeping the ship running and ensuring humanitys survival by reaching another planet on a 89 year mission through space. They are so creepy and robot-like that even Spock seems like warm-hearted santa.They don't know emotions, or only perceive extremely dulled down versions of them like never over 2/10. They never had to learn how to control impulses, they never experienced what we would call life. They never have needs or urges, they have been trained since birth for this mission, in isolation so they wouldn't miss a thing. You see what I am getting at.Then two of them find out about the drugs, stop taking them and things start going south of course.So why choose teenagers in the first place? Well they are intelligent and educated enough to operate the ship and the younger they are, the later they can start producing the next generations which raises the probability of the mission's success. As long as they take the drug, everything will be fine.But now they are confronted with existential dread combined with feelings of puberty that they never learned how to deal with. They realize the dullness of their existence, they don't want to work anymore, or follow orders. They are going to die on that boring monotonous ship anyway, so what's the point? They want fun, thrill, sex and intensity, they want to experience life, of course they do. Like that's their new drug.But something what seemed like an alien attack leads to a paranoia and the witch hunt begins as fear starts taking over their hearts. Some of them with psychopathic traits take advantage of the situation and add fuel to the fire to get in control of the group, just like it happens on earth. The spread of fear by the media and politicians to unite their folks against a common imaginary enemy.One of them even screams out at them how they stopped thinking straight. It's not like they suddenly became stupid, but fear is strong, it makes you blind. It's difficult even for a trained adult. Imagine being scared of something, like heights, and trying to surpress that feeling even if you know that you are safe. You can't just switch it off, but you can get used to it and try to work with it. But those kids are not used to it like at all. Don't try to argue about how illogical the movie is, deep down you know that most humans are not that smart and mostly led by instinct and emotion rather than by logical thoughts.Luckily those kids are rather smart and at the end of the movie, of course it turns out that the glass is half full. The survivors transitioned to adults and maybe that is the point of the movie. What is it that keeps us alive? What is it that keeps us going? Most of us have boring jobs, so what's the point to even create a next generation or even fly to another planet to do so? I guess the point is that humans have to go through hardship and also experience love to fully mature, there is no victory without sacrifice. To strive for more, for a better life, to keep going, you have to experience loss and sacrifice first. You also have to learn empathy and love. Even if they did take their drugs, how would they have taught the next generation? They might have survived the mission but on the new planet without the drug, they would have been doomed for failure and needed to started fresh in the stone age.",Voyagers

Definitely written as if someone with no knowledge of any sciences outside of what they see on TV was trying to plan an essential mission to another planet - so, it's a mess. A lot of it doesn't make sense, but I get told to just pretend it away, so I tried that...And it's still a nonsensical mess made up of a bunch of (apparently) the world's most sociopathic teenagers, most of whom have no sense of self-preservation whatsoever, and a couple of Spock types who sort-of-kind-of try a little bit. But they still act like they didn't spend their entire existence training for EXACTLY THIS.None of these kids has any desire to live past tomorrow? You're going to try to convince me that the majority of humans' honest natures are irreparably evil and excited to die (because we don't come pre-programmed with the innate desire to procreate and continue surviving in their reality)? Even the imagery used as now-adult kids are experiencing emotions for the first time feels hollow, like a failed attempt at mimicry. A bad impression of emotion and sensation. Someone making this movie had a deep misconception of sociology and psychology, along with physics and astronomy.I can ignore some annoying science misconceptions, but the idea that the majority of humans are, in their truest selves, absolutely selfish, self-centered, ignorant, lust-driven, murderous, and purely evil gets ridiculously extreme. I could get behind a little stupidity, but this much of it is just chaotic to the point that it's boring. Like watching a room full of nap-less toddlers play Space Force.Just be ready for everything to go downhill as soon as Colin Farrell's character is gone. Somehow the person who spends the smallest portion of their life on this mission is the one with the most character development. His character is the only one that's easy to identify with, although Lily Rose Depp is a slightly robotic close second. At least that's who her character is supposed to be.Fionn Whitehead isn't very exciting in his antagonist role. He feels like a 13-year-old trying to play sociopath, like he may not have studied this role and instead chose just to do Manson-eyes at the camera really badly.

It's not only about how dark human nature might be.It's about many different ideas within sociology, politics, religion, and human nature make it near impossible to send a ""perfect colony"" out there.Human colonization will probably need to be HUGE. At least a city-sized ship will be necessary. And this film shows why.It's also very entertaining and never dumb.

The inspiration was not ""Lord of the Flies;"" it was more like an Orwellian telling of the autocratic takeovers of societies like those of Hitler and Trump; complete with big lies, over-emphasis on personal freedom, scapegoating and muscle-flexing. The only weak point of the plot was the resolution was too easy and abrupt. On the other hand, the pacing was brisk, and the runtime not long enough to waste our time. The point of making this film was not what the voyagers encountered upon reaching their destination, but whether their humanity could even survive the journey.

There was one injured adult and when he was dead the smoldering silent and sensitive protagonist continued to try and maintain order until the power hungry jerk took the conch shell from him. And the young lady who represented the role formerly known as Piggy met a similar demise when she kept nagging everyone to stop misbehaving. Highly unoriginal. I guess there really are only about 6 or 7 story lines in cinema that just keep recycling over and over... Otherwise, from the beginning the Voyagers story is too big and ambitious and, thus, cannot make sense of all the questions that a story like this arises.

Peaceful protests that turned violent as soon as the sun went down, where people being run over, shot, beaten to a pulp, and other shockingly violent and horrible things all beamed to our mobile devices. Movies are supposed to provide an escape, and unfortunately this was too soon. I almost couldn't watch it.",Voyagers
309,mmendes-55136,Miguel Mendes Rating,8,9 July 2021,"Voyagers is worth the time to watch.It reminds me Die Welle. Remake in america called the wave, also Lord of the flies, remade by a lot.I was surprised by the actors.Tye Sheridan:
from Ready play One... straight performance. Keep to your own emotions. Stay true to what you feel the character is.Lily-Rose Depp: great breakthrough performance.I liked the ease in the way you're personifying the character. You truly captured the character, without over acting.Fionn Whitehead:
Sorry to say my man, you will be type cast as a bad guy for a long time... don't know if you like it, but that was a great performance as well...Of course the rest of the actors: another hit!To the director Neil Burger:
nice Stanley Kubric shots. And making the story work. Hard work gets it done.... Looking forward to see more.And finally, Colin Farrell.Since Tigerland I was amazed. Thank you for letting us see you again. The true emotion I captioned.In other words.Yes, worth the while to see a fresh movie of old, and see new. Kubrick, Sir R. Scott, Cameron.Neil Burger: Make the right picks, and you can be the next Neil Burger... :) dont forget Tye, Lilly and the rest for future projects... looking forward.To the producers...
nice.Be well,
Miguel Mendes.",Voyagers
310,eshnon,My hormones are raging,3,21 October 2021,I thought this would be an intelligent and well thought out movie that would leave me with curious questions. The only question Im left with is the cliff hanger at the end. Just like all space travel movies. Nothing special.Watch the first 20-30 minutes and then fast forward to 1:36:00. Those are really the only parts worth watching. Everything else is High School seniors experiencing adult choices for the first time.,Voyagers
311,avinashdavis,Aweful,1,24 October 2021,"Seriously, 2 hrs wasted, started off great, interesting storyline, great actors even, then got really...really stupid, so many plot holes.Like did they forget they were scientist? Not to mention made it look as it the entire male population is stupid.",Voyagers
312,pdwilli3,"So bad, I turned it off.",2,28 October 2021,"It opened strong and I was excited. It went down hill quickly. Admittedly, as a 40 year old, I'm probably not the demo for this movie. The teenage characters quickly got on my nerves. The lack of common sense in all the decisions defy logic. Rather than torment myself any further, I turned it off.",Voyagers
313,soul-626-343500,It was better on an island...,5,7 May 2021,"A somewhat watchable but predictable mess that at least steered away from the most common forms of liberal Hollywood nonsense. The acting wasn't bad but I liked the story better when it was called ""Lord of the Flies"".I deducted 9 out of 10 stars from the movies rating for not giving credit to William Golding since they clearly ripped off his book. However I gave the movie back 4 stars for doing Golding a favor and NOT associating him with this movie. It sounds like I made a joke there but I didn't.",Voyagers
314,nioakeim,the epitome of human nature,8,4 May 2021,"I really liked this movie. Its the epitome of human nature. All these events that characterise the human kind, especially the ones that terrorism and superstition is used to control and manipulate people.Yes, this movie may be similar to the Lord of the Flies, so what?I feel the message it carries is current and relevant, repacked in a space setting with fresh characters that young people can relate to and maybe get the message that only with peace and collaboration we can move forward and continue to exist.I recommend it.",Voyagers
315,GERRYNIMO,Don't waste your time,1,10 October 2021,Absolute rubbish. Honestly don't waste your time watching this movie time could be better spent washing your car or taking your dog out for a walk.,Voyagers
316,vanchurov,Mind-numbingly dumb,2,28 July 2021,"Don't watch it, just don't. It hits you right in the intellect, so bad, it hurts. The plot while being very generic has holes in it the size of planets, the acting is so bad that it even got funny at one point. And while I do get it, I'm not the target audience for this movie, nobody should be, don't insult your viewers by delivering something that had zero thought put into it. I'm giving it two stars because the sets were decent.",Voyagers
317,paulmcstraw-565-58895,"Record, watch the first 40 minutes and the last 5 and it's a solid SciFi",5,14 October 2021,"This film is so frustrating I got angry and had to leave. The premise is good, although a rehash of other ideas. Up until Colin Farrel dies it's not bad, but then it descends into stupidity, nonsense and unbelievable characters. Once all the mayhem is over and the bad are dead, the last 5 minutes gives you all the hugs you need.",Voyagers
318,grujicd,"It's not really 10/10, but had to compensate for other reviewers",8,29 July 2021,"Much better movie than average rating suggests. Most reviewers are comparing it to the Lord of the flies, or suggesting that second half of the movie is unrealistic because kids were trained for mission, they should know better, etc. Well, they're wrong.*** Spoilers ***We've seen it too many times in our history how easy is it to manipulate people, to amplify their fears, invent an enemy, and present you as a savior. Yes, these kind have above average intelligence, but they don't have any emotional experience. And they don't have any historical knowledge to recognize dangers. They were protected from human nature all their lives. They didn't even know about wars (scene where they're fascinated by some war scenes). They're not a bunch of regular young adults and we can't judge them like that. It seems very plausible that something like this could happen - given circumstances of their bringing. And if one of them is a manipulative SOB. And we know these exists everywhere, regardless of intelligence or education.That said, treat this movie like it's 7/10 and give it a chance. The biggest flaw I found is the artificial gravity which magically stops the moment you exit the air lock (and still rotate with the ship). Apart from that, quite enjoyable movie for sci-fi fans.",Voyagers
319,brijcorns-948-111883,Claustrophobic Co-Ed Lord of the Flies in Space!,3,1 May 2021,"Typical pseudo-psycho drama here with nothing really new. Co-ed Lord of the Flies with a hint of Salem witch trial accusations on a claustrophobic, grossly lit spaceship. High production value does make it pretty to look at.Spoiler:
The entitled teacher's pets come out on top. Ho-hum.",Voyagers

324,vgrenich,"Predictable plot, flat boring characters",1,14 April 2021,The premise had potential. It presented interesting themes and concepts. But never managed to rise above a predictable plot and flat characters. Any interesting concepts that were presented were not fully explored and were largely overshadowed by the movies flaws.,Voyagers

326,jastemmer30,Basically Lord of the Flies in space,4,20 August 2021,"No complaints about the acting or the effects, though the writing seemed rushed and maybe a little lazy in some places. I won't go into detail because this movie was not exactly unique or memorable. It pretty much focuses on a bunch of teenagers who start out as emotionless geniuses that go off their meds and allow their hormones to dictate them until they rally behind a would-be rapist psycho hell bent on murdering the small group of teenagers that are actually capable of logical thought solely because he was rejected. Not bad for a one time watch, but I doubt I'll ever have the urge to watch Voyagers again.",Voyagers
327,robert-34324,Entertaining but flawed,7,31 July 2021,Mostly a good watch if you can get past some questionable reasoning given for the mob mentality that occurs.,Voyagers
328,perpinias,Very good movie,9,1 May 2021,"Better than my expectations. Not just an adolescent sci-fi movie, more like a philosophical/sociological one. One may say that it describes the very begining and the dawn of humanity and civilization as we know it. I enjoy it very much. It has a lot to say for our nature.",Voyagers
329,pkerseydw,Enjoyable Watch for Sci-Fi Fans,7,21 August 2021,"Really is a solid 6 or 7 (meaning a 3 to 3.5 star film on the 5 point scale). I came into this movie with the benefit of incredibly low expectations, but took a chance on it due to my love of sci-fi film, being a Colin Farrell fan, and being interested to see Lily-Rose Depp act. After picking up the 4K Blu-Ray on eBay for under $10, gave this film a watch and was not disappointed.Is this a retelling of The Lord Of The Flies in space? Yes. Does director Neil Burger hide that? No, he embraces it. Does the film borrow from other space tales? Yes- most notably Alien. The music reminded me of Prometheus and Covenant; which I found as a strength.As others have said, this movie is not trying to win an Academy Award. What it did for me was provide 100 minutes of entertainment. I classify it as grab the popcorn and enjoy yourself.Note: Bias in my review (7 stars) may come from enjoying these types of movies.",Voyagers

With genetically made people, on a spaceship who are finding themselves emotionally and sexually. With the one bad alpha male that's full of testosterone. Classic cliche.",Voyagers
332,blowfish-04707,Bad,1,2 September 2021,The story could've been something good. But it was frustrating and not worth the watch. Nothing good happens. Not even sure why they were put in space in the first place.,Voyagers
333,alxmdsn,Colin Ferrell's worst performance.,6,17 October 2021,This movie looks cool but not a lot under the surface once you start to dig deeper. The writing was full enough to elicit a bad performance Colin Ferrell unfortunately.,Voyagers
334,waggelaar,Meh,4,2 May 2021,Was looking forward to this movie but it was very weak. It had a really great premise but they botched it. Why not investigate how they struggle with the idea that they are going to die before they reach the planet.? Why not see how 3 generations deal with it? The idea was there but they opted for a very weak action plot.,Voyagers
335,monaharfmann,Really don't get the hate,7,2 June 2021,"Honestly I don't understand all the negative reviews. Personally I liked almost everything about this movie: the idea, the music, the cinematography and most of the actors. They also put a lot of thought into small details which I really appreciated. Maybe it's not Oscar-worthy or something like that but it never tried to be. It's an enjoyable Sci-Fi movie that makes you think about the nature of mankind, our future, climate change, even democracy. Definitely worth 7/10!",Voyagers
336,katilsto,It's a good movie!,8,16 October 2021,"I don't understand the hate at all. 'Voyagers' is a really enjoyable movie that had me hooked throughout. The actors were great. The story was interesting. I absolutely got 'Lord of the Flies' vibes which I loved! I found it so intriguing to question the true nature of humans and what we are capable of, good and bad. But seriously don't look into it too deeply. It's a great movie. Some people really need to look past the realistic-ness of fictional stories! I'd rewatch it.",Voyagers
