0,SnoopyStyle,Big overwrought stereotypes,5,2 March 2014,"10-year-old Mississippi girl Tonya Hailey is viciously raped by rednecks James Louis Willard and Billy Ray Cobb. They are taken into custody by Sheriff Ozzie Walls (Charles S. Dutton), but the girl's father Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) takes matters into his own hands killing both men and wounding a police officer. Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) knows Carl and takes on his defense. Kevin Spacey plays D.A. Rufus Buckley, and Donald Sutherland is Jake's drunken partner Lucien Wilbanks. Freddie Lee Cobb (Kiefer Sutherland) leads a local rebirth of the KKK. Law student Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock) offers to help Jake.It's a John Grisham novel directed by Joel Schumacher. It's a lot of drama with very little tension. None of these characters especially Carl is worth our sympathies. Also there are a lot of ridiculous things like Carl visiting the injured cop in the hospital. It would never happen like that. It would help out Carl's character if the cop didn't get in the line of fire. It would clean up the morality mess and line up the ethical question better. It would also help to have Carl exhibit some mental problems so the insanity defense has some purchase.The story is hitting all the big stereotypes, and plays every race card. It's overwrought when it's unnecessary. There is no cross unburnt. There is no hood unworn. The NAACP is corrupt. And with so many big Hollywood actors, a lot of this feels fake. This is not a subtle movie. Then there is the ending. I cannot abide by it no matter how it's argued. But even if I agree, the closing argument by Jake was just hitting all the wrong notes.",A Time to Kill
1,Prismark10,A Time to Kill,6,31 March 2020,"A Time to Kill works better if you regard it as a camp courtroom thriller by director Joel Schumacher. There is no way you can take it seriously. After all it has London born, Canadian raised Kiefer Sutherland as a southern redneck.Samuel L Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey, the father of a young girl who was brutally raped by two rednecks. He bursts into the courthouse and shot them dead and also injured the deputy sheriff.Matthew McConaughey is Jake Brigance, a young rookie lawyer who takes on Hailey's case. His own wife is uneasy about the case, he faces threats from the Ku Klux Klan. Even some in the black community do not want him to represent Hailey.The trouble is, Hailey admits what he did. After all he killed the two men in front of a crowd. The prosecutor (Kevin Spacey) wants the death penalty and has picked an all white jury. The all white jury regularly and surreptitiously hold a vote whether they find Hailey guilty or not so they can wrap it up quickly.I guess the only defence Brigance has is temporary insanity but the movie never clearly spells it out.The film consists of six Oscar winners in the cast. It is an adaptation of John Grisham's first novel. The gist of the story is not far removed from Death Wish. No wonder they went down the route of a corny and contrived courtroom drama.",A Time to Kill
2,nogodnomasters,"MISSISSIPPI, RACE, KKK, TRIAL, RAPE, MURDER...",8,9 April 2019,"MISSISSIPPI, RACE, KKK, TRIAL, RAPE, MURDER...did I miss anything? Two rednecks rape and beat the 10 year old daughter of Samuel L. Jackson, who fears they might get off. In open and broad daylight Jackson guns down the rapists. He is on trial for murder. Matthew McConaughey plays a sympathetic attorney who leads a rag-tag group (including Bullock and Donald Sutherland) to defend Jackson against the prosecuting attorney, Kevin Spacey (with a southern accent) who wants to make a name for himself in his bid for governor. The NAACP attempts to take over the case while an overly represented KKK terrorizes the town. Criticism: The temporary insanity plea is clearly a plea for jury nullification, although the movie never uses that phrase. The town appeared split on the case over racial lines with seemingly no middle ground.The acting was good and the movie generated emotion. Kiefer Sutherland plays a ""bad guy."" What flashes through the movie is the genius of of the killer (Samuel L.Jackson) on his ability to manipulate the attorney and others in order to achieve his goal. He is clearly a calculating individual.",A Time to Kill
3,kosmasp,Verdict - (in)sane,9,31 January 2021,"Accused of ... actually if there is one thing that is obvious is what someone is accused of here ... not just anyone. But while this is fast paced and has a lot of things happening from the get go, I will not go into too much of the story. But boy does this movie have an all star cast or what? The answer is yes, in case you are wondering.And while some may feel a bit .. let's say weird about the way justice is being served here (pun intended), the movie is gripping from start to finish. It also is not something the faint of hearted should watch! Especially the beginning (and first inciting incident) really packs a punch .. and it is something that unfortunately still exist in our world! I don't think certain things will go away ... at least not as long as I'm alive (racism being one of them).",A Time to Kill
4,classicsoncall,"""Ain't nothing more dangerous than a fool with a cause.""",8,13 July 2018,"Another reviewer on this board made a comparison of the film with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", and although the same thought came to me while watching it, the similarity is never fully realized. In the earlier movie, a black man was found guilty of raping a white woman, and the stereotype of redneck Southern justice is essentially carried out. The better comparison I think, can be made with another film I just recently viewed, that being ""Sleepers"", in which a pair of thugs murder a former reform school guard who physically abused them while they were in their teens. The whole idea of social justice is stood on it's head in both films, and if the thought behind each movie is to make viewers feel conflicted about their outcomes, then they both succeeded. Just like Gregory Peck's character in 'Mockingbird', Jake Brigance approached his job via a one on one relationship with the accused, a man who's ability to reason is shattered when his ten year old daughter is assaulted and raped by the side of the road, and left to die when a couple of degenerates decide to partake in some demented version of what they consider fun. However the character who perhaps straddles the line best between blacks and whites in the story is Sheriff Ozzie Walls (Charles S. Dutton), a black man who has the same keen sense of justice as does Brigance. He's unafraid to arrest the guilty perpetrators of the horrible rape of the ten year old Tonya Hailey (RaéVen Kelly), nor is he troubled about taking her father (Samuel L. Jackson) into custody for the shooting at the courthouse. I had the sense that he was a well respected man of Canton who saw his job as color blind in the eyes of the law.In a way, the picture's most defining moment might have been saved for the very final scene. Following Carl Lee Hailey's (Jackson) impassioned dialog with his lawyer, one which inspired Jake Brigance to revamp his closing argument, we see Brigance and his family arrive at the Hailey home, as jubilant neighbors celebrate the acquittal. Taking to heart what it means to be truly accepting of others different from themselves, Jake confidently comes to terms with Carl Lee's persuasive suggestion by stating, ""Just thought our kids could play together"".",A Time to Kill

We have a very impressive cast, with everyone in here from Kevin Spacey to Chris Cooper to Oliver Platt. We even have Sandra Bullock, who seems to be the weakest link (acting like she is in a romantic comedy rather than a serious court drama).Actually, yeah, cut out all the Bullock scenes and this could be one of the best films ever made.",A Time to Kill
6,lee_eisenberg,"Will there be comparisons with ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? And why hasn't Joel Schumacher done anything good since?",7,8 March 2006,"Involving pretty much the same situation as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""A Time to Kill"" portrays white lawyer Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) defending black man Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), charged with murdering the racist thugs who raped his daughter, thereby incurring the Ku Klux Klan's wrath.I don't know whether this was the greatest adaptation of a John Grisham novel, but I would recommend it. Needless to say, there are some pretty ugly scenes. The fact that this movie is so well done brings to mind the question of why the quality of Joel Schumacher's movies deteriorated after this; ""Batman and Robin"" and ""Flawless"" are probably the two most infamous examples.Also starring Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey, Charles S. Dutton, Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Brenda Fricker, and Patrick McGoohan.",A Time to Kill
7,jboothmillard,A Time to Kill,7,12 March 2007,"I am not completely interested in all parts to the story, I think it is just the court case I like. Basically, the young daughter of Carl Lee Hailey (Golden Globe nominated Samuel L. Jackson) is horrifically beaten, raped and hanged to die (which she didn't), and he kills the men responsible for this crime. But this is what creates the court case. Carl Lee Hailey wants justice for the crime that the men committed, and lawyer Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McConaughey, the film that launched his career, three years before Edtv) is determined to help him. The opposition, D.A. Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey) is determined to show everyone that he did still carry out an unlawful act against two men who were going to have justice brought to them. Also starring Sandra Bullock as practising lawyer Ellen Roark, Oliver Platt as Harry Rex Vonner, Charles S. Dutton as Sheriff Ozzie Walls, My Left Foot's Brenda Fricker as Ethel Twitty, Donald Sutherland as Lucien Wilbanks, Kiefer Sutherland as Freddie Lee Cobb, Braveheart's Patrick McGoohan as Judge Omar Noose and Ashley Judd as Carla Brigance.

8,sunwarrior13,A Morality Play,9,27 December 2011,"Set in Canton, Mississippi,A Time To Kill revolves around the rape of a young girl and the arrest of the rapists and their subsequent murder by the girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey. The remainder of the film then focuses on the trial of Carl Lee Hailey for murder.It features an ensemble cast that includes Sandra Bullock, Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, Ashley Judd, Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Spacey and Patrick McGoohan.The screenplay was written by Akiva Goldsman, and directed by Joel Schumacher.Carl Lee Hailey takes the law into his own hands after the legal system fails to adequately punish the men who brutally raped and beat his daughter, leaving her for dead. Normally, a distraught father could count on some judicial sympathy in those circumstances. Unfortunately, Carl and his daughter are black, and the assailants are white, and all the events take place in the South. Indeed, so inflammatory is the situation, that the local KKK becomes popular again. When Hailey chooses novice lawyer Jake Brigance to handle his defense, it begins to look like a certainty that Carl will hang, and Jake's career and perhaps his life will come to a premature end. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local black leaders to persuade Carl to choose some of their high- powered legal help, he remains loyal to Jake, who had helped his brother with a legal problem before the story begins. Jake eventually takes this case seriously enough to seek help from his old law-school professor. When death threats force his family to leave town, Jake even accepts the help of pushy young know-it-all lawyer Ellen Roark. This film adaptation of John Grisham's first novel was a highly charged from beginning to end.It allows the audience to make their opinion with regards to whether the father was right or wrong to put justice into his own hands after what happened to her daughter and how the culprits were set free after a trial.In other words,it puts him/her into their morality issues.This alone makes it worth watching.Aside from that,Matthew McConaughey's performance was brilliant as the laconic young lawyer together with other members of the cast.These reasons alone makes the film a must-see.",A Time to Kill

10,CinemaSerf,A superb example of (a) just cause...,7,27 March 2021,"The opening scenes of this movie are the sort that stay with you for ever: the brutal assault and murder of a young girl by two rednecks in Mississippi. Before their trial, they are gunned down in the courthouse by the girl's bereft father ""Carl Lee Hailey"" (Samuel L. Jackson) and it falls to ""Brigance"" (Matthew McConaughey) to defend the man in a state riddled with institutional and communal bigotry. Kevin Spacey is effective as the DA (""Buckley"") who assumes the all white jury will never countenance the murder of these two odious creatures by a black man, but he doesn't count on the resolution - despite threats to himself and to his family - of ""Brigance"" and of his feisty assistant ""Ellen"" (Sandra Bullock). Joel Schumacher really does capture the almost viscerally racist elements of John Grisham's book cleverly here with frequently potent, but not unnecessarily graphic, scenarios depicting just how ""justice"" was expected to flow, even though there is never any doubt about the guilt of either the initial rapists/killers or of her avenging father. McConaughey is super. Sure, he has the boy next door looks but here, also, he portrays his determined character in a convincing manner. So does Bullock - demonstrating, through one especially harrowing scene, that she has more to her than we see with her more regular smart-mouthed comical roles. As ever, Patrick McGoohan excels - this time as the aptly named judge ""Noose"" and both Donald and Kiefer Sutherland and a few short scenes from Oscar winning Brenda Fricker all serve to demonstrate that there is still some semblance of hope (and futility) against the inherently malevolent prevailing attitudes of the time. The closing speech at the end from ""Brigance"" is especially potent. SLJ was nominated for a Golden Globe, his appearances are fine but sparing, but there was a curious dearth of plaudits for McConaughey which I found astonishing - he holds the threads of this menacing, at times quite sickening drama together well till the end. Not an easy watch, but well worth it.",A Time to Kill
11,Boba_Fett1138,A great and powerful movie.,8,3 November 2008,"I never have been a too big fan of movies based on John Grisham novels, since they are quite boring within its genre but I've always liked this movie, though in all honesty the movie really starts loosing some of its power on repeated viewing.The movie has a real inspiring and powerful story. focusing on moral dilemmas, racial issues and the legal system, when a black man shoots and kills two racist white men who had just raped and attempted to kills his 10-year old daughter. It makes this also a real original movie to watch within its genre; the courtroom-drama. The movie mixes its 3 main themes; racial issues, moral dilemmas and the legal system, really well and effectively. It might sound like a messy movie and as a movie that is trying to preach but it in fact is a really well constructed and balanced movie, that is skillfully being directed by Joel Schumacher, as weird as that might sound, considering that he mostly makes some really below par movies. Even his best movies are mostly lacking in more than one way. This movie can perhaps be regarded as his least lacking and simply best movie. Fair is fair, he simply did a good job with this movie.When I first saw this movie it made quite an impression on me, due to its great story about justice. The movie angered me, the movie moved me and it simply grabbed me all throughout. The movie makes its point and is showing the less pretty side of the legal system and the treatment of Afro-American people within it and the treatment of those people in the south of America in general.Samuel L. Jackon has picked several roles like this throughout his career; a black man against society and the system. He seems like a person to me who is always making a big point out of racial issues and the treatment and acceptance of Afro-Americans in America in particular. In all honesty, it often more annoys me than that I find it something admirable and it just doesn't always work out that well and effectively within a movie. This particular movie forms an exception to this though and like I said before it's a movie that makes its point well, by often exaggerating and generalizing things of course but it nevertheless comes across well and powerful.Yes, some things come across as being quite over-the-top and not exactly as anything too believable and I do feel that the movie is overdoing it a bit at times but the movie is just never going too far with it and it knows to maintain a good balance between the strong realistic aspects and the more 'Hollywood' like aspects and themes of the movie.You also really have to give movie credit for its cast. You have to remember that this movie got made back in 1996, when very few people had an idea who actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Kevin Spacey, Chris Cooper and Kiefer Sutherland all were. Besides that, the movie also features some already well established names such as Samuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, Donald Sutherland and Patrick McGoohan in one of his last big movie roles. I say last, not because he's death, he's very much alive still but he rarely stars in any movies, pretty much like he has done throughout his entire career. Seems like he is just more an actor who enjoys working on the stage.Simply a great and effective movie within its genre, although it's already starting to loose some of its power, 12 years later. So it will most likely not become a classic in 30 years from now.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Time to Kill
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Ignite,7,24 November 2009,"Apart from what he did to the Batman film series of the 90's... and I suppose one should eventually forgive that, since Nolan's doing rather a great job with the franchise, so what Joel did was mainly give a new generation a version of the character that resembles the campy 60's show... I suppose Schumacher really hasn't done anything that can be held against him. As far as directors go, there are countless ones out there who are considerably worse; in fact, he's quite dependable, and as long as the source material wasn't a comic book, his movies are seldom downright poor. And it is nice to see him tackle something as interesting and provocative as this. I haven't read the novel, nor any other by Grisham(save for Skipping Christmas... I know, talk about the exception to his body of work), so I can't comment on how close this sticks to it. With a script written by Akiva ""Hit and Miss"" Goldsman, I suppose there's a reasonable chance that it got the core right. The plot is compelling, and the pacing is so good that the two and a half hours pass a lot faster than one might think. Acting is about what one would expect, and while McConaughey isn't half bad in this, he's still out-shined by the masters of the craft(and Bullock, too) in the cast. Jackson does well without being given much to do. This is dramatic, exciting, engaging and, when it means to be, intense. Past the controversial message that some argue that this promotes, is one so banal and predictable that it ought to no longer need be campaigned for. The editing and cinematography are relatively standard. There is violence and disturbing content in this, and the latter is verbally described in detail. I recommend this to any and all fans of those who made it and/or of thrillers. 7/10",A Time to Kill
13,view_and_review,A Time to Kill Leads to a Time to Heal,10,5 August 2018,"When a ten-year-old African American girl is beaten and raped by two white men in Mississippi her father, Carl Lee (Samuel Jackson), decides to take matters in his own hands. There's no doubt he killed the attackers but now he is facing murder charges and there is little hope he can get a fair trial in Mississippi.This movie is soooo difficult to watch. That's why it's been 20+ years since my last viewing. It is such a jarring film it evokes too many negative emotions yet it still brings about a sense of hope.The all-star cast was superb. It's funny because I completely forgot about who all was in it: the likes of Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd, and Sandra Bullock--even Octavia Spencer had a small role.This type of movie is a difficult one to tackle due to its sensitive nature yet I think Grisham and Joel Schumacher did an excellent job. It is riveting, it is upsetting but it is by no means far-fetched. Grisham could easily have taken this entire trial right out of a Mississippi history book and not have changed a thing. This was a bold movie that should have been made and I'm pleased that it was.",A Time to Kill
14,evanston_dad,A Time to Stop Letting Joel Schumacher Make Movies,4,19 June 2009,"Joel Schumacher is a terrible director under the best of circumstances, but he can scrape together moderately competent films when he's dealing in pulpy genre pictures like ""Flatliners"" or ""Phone Booth."" God help us all, though, when he decides to get serious and make socially ""important"" films like ""A Time to Kill."" This screen adaptation of the John Grisham novel takes on race relations in America's deep South, and Schumacher and company commit themselves so eagerly to the sub-par material it's almost sad they couldn't manage to make a better movie out of it. Sandra Bullock looks completely uncomfortable exploring this dramatic material; Matthew McConaughey doesn't have the gravitas required for his role. He gets a big courtroom soliloquy at the end, and you can almost hear him whispering ""Please nominate me for an Oscar"" during each dramatic pause.Schumacher underlines and italicizes every emotion we're supposed to feel so that we're not required to do any work for ourselves. There's nothing more irritating than a film director who thinks he needs to hold his audience's hand.Grade: C-",A Time to Kill
15,anaconda-40658,An Excuse to Murder.,5,11 August 2015,"A Time to Kill (1996): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey: Corrupt drama eager to manipulate to please the crowd. Instead of concentrating on racial issues, it tries to make a case for one's sanity. It is an over hyped mess pitting revenge against justice where the audience is unfairly placed as the jury. A young black girl is raped and urinated upon by two white males. Her father shoots them both dead at the courthouse and is placed on trial. When a white lawyer chooses to represent him the Ku Klux Klan become riled. Directed by Joel Schumacher who dealt with similar themes in The Client. Samuel L. Jackson plays a father with redeeming regret. Matthew McConaughey is very good as his lawyer who faces the wrath of the Klan. Unfortunately the supporting roles are chalk full of dumb stereotypes including Kiefer Sutherland playing the redneck Klan leader. Why these concealed villains are portrayed as ragged seems like a forced portrayal as oppose to fact. Sandra Bullock is an unnecessary romantic prop whose purpose is to bandage up McConaughey and glance at his ass because he just happens to be wearing no underwear. Kevin Spacey plays a quick witted opposing lawyer who is suppose to fail because of the twisted message. Standard courtroom drama giving viewers time to kill. Score: 5 / 10",A Time to Kill
16,Wuchakk,All-star cast in a solid racially-charged crime drama,7,1 June 2016,"Released in 1996 and based on John Grisham's book, ""A Time to Kill"" chronicles events in Canton, Mississippi when an honest black man (Samuel L. Jackson) takes the law into his own hands after a couple of beer-guzzling white rednecks brutally rape his 10 year-old daughter. Matthew McConaughey plays his lawyer, Sandra Bullock his uber-liberal assistant, Ashley Judd his wife and Oliver Platt his friend. Donald Sutherland in on hand as an alcoholic defrocked lawyer while Kevin Spacey plays the staunch prosecuting attorney. Patrick McGoohan appears as the dubious judge while Kiefer Sutherland is on hand as a friend of the rednecks who gets the Klan involved. ""A Time to Kill"" is essentially a mishmash of 1988's ""Mississippi Burning"" and 1992's ""A few Good Men."" Although it's not excellent like the former film it's about on par with the latter and you can't beat the all-star cast. The weakness is the first act where events come across a bit too contrived, smelling of political correctness rather than reality (more on this below). But the story pulls you in during the second act. And the viewer's sympathies are definitely with Jackson's character. A timeline for the events is never provided so it's assumed that they take place during the mid-90s when the movie was released (if not, they'd have to take place around 1989 when the book was published). This presents a believability problem for the rednecks' rampage in a rural black community during the opening. Would several strong black men really tolerate the disrespectful antics of these white scumbags in their own communities in the mid-90s or late 80s? Then there's the problem of the entire scenario being one-sided: The ultra-evil characters are white men, but all blacks are virtuous. I'm white and was held up in the deep south in 1990 (the general timeline of events in the movie) by three young black guys with guns, who stole all my money & camera equipment and then took off with my car (thankfully, they let me live and my car was found abandoned shortly later). You'll see none of this in ""A Time to Kill."" Young white dudes are the problem. Poppycock. I'm not saying there isn't white trash out there, but how about some evenhandedness more akin to reality? At least 2004's ""Crash"" had the integrity to show the awful truth right out of the gate.Despite my criticisms, this is a worthy crime thriller if you appreciate the aforementioned movies. The movie runs 149 minutes and was shot in Canton & Jackson, Mississippi; Tampa, Florida; and London, Ontario.GRADE: B",A Time to Kill
17,gradyharp,Time and 'Social Progress' Make this Film Maintain it Poignancy,8,28 January 2006,"John Grisham's powerful novel about persistent racial conflict in the South was transformed ten years ago into a gripping film by Joel Schumacher with the screenplay adaptation by Akiva Goldsman. The reporting of an act of violence by an African American father whose daughter had been kidnapped, brutally beaten, raped, and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony, even on a small scale, if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit.Matthew McConaughey is the rookie white lawyer, Ashley Judd his wife, Samuel Jackson the father, Sandra Bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists McConaughey, Kevin Spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing McConaughey, Oliver Platt as McConaughey's sidekick, Donald Sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help McConaughey find the truth justice knows, Patrick McGoohan as the implacable judge, and Kiefer Sutherland as the KKK redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town. It is a fine cast and Schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility.Perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'Great Movies', but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias. Recommended. Grady Harp",A Time to Kill
18,The_Void,An entertaining spectacle with a nice comment on justice,8,22 May 2005,"Courtroom dramas are well known for providing thrilling films, and that is exactly what 'A Time to Kill' thrives on; entertainment value. It is clear that the film, in spite of having some very potent themes, puts most of it's focus on being entertaining and it's actually not a bad film for it. Sometimes, films that want to be entertaining and have themes fall down because they're too entertaining and the themes get left by the wayside; but A Time to Kill puts its cards on the table from the start, and it's always clear what this film wants to do with itself. The plot follows a man who, after his daughter is raped and almost murdered, decides to take the law into his own hands. However, this man is also a black man living in a white supremacy state, and so the film injects a racism theme into it's plot, which is always going to mean that it will have some sort of social commentary within it. However, that isn't the most interesting comment that the film wants to make; as that plaudit falls to the idea of justice, and exactly what justice is.The film, based on a novel by crime writer John Grisham, presents an impossible situation to the viewer and central characters; what do you do when justice will prevail whatever the verdict? The viewer and the characters must then make a choice between the law and general morality, and it is there where the film draws it's most interesting plot point from. While, as mentioned, it's always clear that this movie is meant to entertain you; it's always nice to be given something to think about as well. A Time to Kill benefits immensely from an absolutely fabulous cast, which includes the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey, Kiefer Sutherland, his father Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Chris Cooper and more, all of which are lead by Matthew McConaughey. It is the lead that most lets the film down, as although McConaughey can definitely act, he's not quite charismatic enough to deliver a lead performance in front of that cast. Still, the movie is definitely very decent and although you probably wont hurt your brain watching it, it will entertain you.",A Time to Kill
19,JamesHitchcock,"Well-made, thought-provoking thriller",7,13 March 2009,"I have never read a single one of John Grisham's novels; he is one of those authors whose works I know solely from film adaptations, of which there have been several. ""A Time to Kill"" forms part of the cinematic tradition which uses the conventions of the courtroom thriller to examine the problem of racism in American society. This tradition dates back at least as far as ""Intruder in the Dust"" from 1949, and perhaps the best-known example is ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". Modern examples include ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" (also from 1996) and ""Snow Falling on Cedars"", although that was set in the Pacific North-West rather than the Deep South and the defendant was of Japanese rather than African-American descent. ""Just Cause"" starts out like a film of this type but is then spoilt by a plot twist which negates its anti-racist credentials.The film is set in Clanton, Mississippi. A 10-year-old black girl named Tonya Hailey is raped, violently beaten and dumped in a river by two white racists. Tonya survives her ordeal and the men are arrested. Her father Carl Lee fears that, due to ingrained racism in the area, they may be acquitted by a white jury, and goes to the county courthouse where he shoots them dead with a rifle. The policeman escorting them is injured in the shooting. Carl Lee is arrested and charged with murder.The rest of the film revolves around Carl Lee's subsequent trial. A common feature of this type of film is the fearless white lawyer who stands up for justice. (It is curious how this convention has survived for so long. Might it not be more original to have a fearless black lawyer?) This film features two such characters, Carl Lee's attorney, Jake Brigance, and Ellen Roark, a liberal law student from Massachusetts and ACLU member who volunteers to assist Jake with the defence, which revolves around a plea of not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Although he opposes racism, Jake himself is not particularly liberal; he is, unlike Ellen, a supporter of the death penalty. Indeed, there is a suggestion that he is so keen take on the defence because he approves of the sort of vigilante justice which Carl Lee handed out to the two rapists.Defending a black man accused of murdering two whites does not make Jake and Ellen popular with many in the white community, and tensions begin to rise, especially when the Ku Klux Klan begins to organise in the area. Jake is forced to send his wife and young daughter away for their own safety- a wise decision as his house is later targeted by arsonists. Ellen is kidnapped by Klansmen, but later rescued.I felt that Matthew McConaughey, only in his mid-twenties at the time, perhaps came across as too young and inexperienced for a lawyer charged with so major a case. (He was later, in ""Amistad"", to play another lawyer acting for black defendants charged with murder, although that was a historical film set in the days of slavery). Several other actors such as Kevin Costner, most of them rather older than McConaughey, were considered for the role. I felt that much of the sub-plot involving Ellen, who comes close to having an affair with Jake before he develops a conscience at the last minute, was rather unnecessary, and probably included because the film-makers needed a role for a major female star. (Jake's wife Carla does not really count as such because she is absent from the action for much of the time).There were, however, some good acting performances. I liked Samuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee, a decent family man driven beyond endurance by the attack on his daughter and, more generally, by the racist attitudes of the white community. I also liked Donald Sutherland in a cameo role as Lucien Wilbanks, a veteran liberal lawyer who has been disbarred for violence on a picket line activist but who still manages to provide Jake with advice. Perhaps the best performance comes from Kevin Spacey as the ruthless district attorney Rufus Buckley, the sort of prosecutor who is less interested in justice than in furthering his own political career. (The American system of directly elected prosecutors- anathema to anyone involved in the British legal system- seems to be taking some flak from Hollywood; F. Murray Abraham played a similar character in ""the Bonfire of the Vanities"").I have not liked all the Grisham-based films I have seen, but ""A Time to Kill"" is one of the better ones; I preferred it, for instance, to ""The Client"", which was also directed by Joel Schumacher. The interest of the film lies not only in the courtroom duels between the opposing lawyers but also in the issues it raises about race and about justice. The film suggests that there may exist in America more insidious forms of racism than the brutal hatred which inspires the Klan and the rapists. Carl Lee points out that white people, however well intentioned, see him as a black man rather than simply as a man, and that even the most liberal whites rarely socialise with blacks. The film also explores the question of vigilantism and when revenge might be justified; if people are not to ""take the law into their own hands"", the authorities need to maintain a firm grip on it themselves and to be sure that it does not slip from their hands though either weakness or prejudice. A well-made, thought-provoking thriller. 7/10",A Time to Kill
20,KineticSeoul,"Expected a thriller...But this was alright, especially near the end",6,22 December 2011,"This movie is a big trial with other racist stuff going on in the background. The thing that drives this movie is how the case is going to turn out, not because you want it to turn out one way or the other. But because of the situation of it all, since one way human justice prevails and the other way it turns out justice still prevails. Mathew Matthew McConaughey is good at playing a lawyer, Samuel L. Jackson is good at what he does in roles like this and Kevin Spacey was perfect for the role he is given. I didn't really find the movie to be engrossing or gripping since I seen a lot of movies like this. Nor did I find it interesting or entertaining but it's still a pretty big case. I am not sure if this movie is based on a true story but if it was it would have been a well made movie but I wasn't sure if it was a true story or not while watching. Some parts show the difficulties of situations such as what this movie portrays. Especially with the stuff that happens in the background and the situations the characters must face to overcome certain obstacles. Racism is a ugly thing and this movie really does show the ugliness of it and what it can lead to. The title of this movie didn't really fit what is going on all that much in my opinion, I was expecting more of a thriller. But this has some good dramatic moments especially as the movie comes close to the end. The premise of how the odds are against certain characters with the situation and all, especially because of where the court takes place and the judge. Was well done although not all that gripping and heartfelt until it comes close to the end. But the way the characters overcome certain obstacles inside and outside of the courtroom even some putting themselves and loved one in jeopardy to do what they thinks they had to do no matter what the cost. Especially when it came to the protagonist in this story. The final speech in the court is really gripping though and is a bit of a tear jerking moment. Since it comes from the heart and not flashy lawyering.6.8/10",A Time to Kill
21,thesar-2,Definite Time to KIll,9,29 March 2010,"Probably the best book I have ever read was John Grisham's first (and absolute best) novel, A Time to Kill. This is not to say, it went soaring downhill after his debut book, but eventually I had to stop reading after probably a dozen or so.Despite this was his first effort, it was the fourth movie to hit the theaters. I'm sorry it took so long, because of all of Grisham's movie adaptations, this was by far the best.It doesn't hurt at all, it's contains an incredible cast, including two of my favorite actors of all time: Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson. Also, I love both Donald & Kiefer Sutherland, Sandra Bullock, Charles S. DuttonI could just reprint the entire cast. Much like A Few Good Men, one of my all time favorite movies and courtroom dramas, both contain a stellar list of credits.Also, it contains great drama, suspense, dialogue, humor and is a major tear-jerker. If you don't get choked up (or filled with anger) with what happened that little girl (see below) then I can't imagine what would stir emotions within you.Little (and normally I wouldn't point out her race out if not so relevant here) black Tanya (Kelly) is walking home to her family while her father, Carl Lee (Jackson) is hard at work, supporting his family. She's picked up (kidnapped) by the main definition of racist rednecks and raped, beaten, urinated on, tossed, hung and damaged beyond repair.Due to other cases that allowed these kinds of evils to either have reduced sentences or actually freed, Carl Lee takes it into his own hands to slaughter the two bad men in front of pretty much the whole town while they are about to enter their trial. Of course, now Carl Lee's imprisoned and it's up to Jake (McConaughey) to take the case of a lifetime for a mere $900.Add in the KKK causing havoc to those on Carl Lee's side and Jake's failing business, Jake has a lot going on. People get shot, terrorized and a lot of fires set. Jake also has to prove he was legally insane when everyone knows he wasn't and Carl Lee is happy to say otherwise, publicly. This would be the ideal case for Governor-to-be D.A. Rufus (Spacey) if not for the emotional side of the case, or""What would you do if this happened to your daughter?"" This leads to my favorite quote of the movie: ""If you win this case, justice will prevail, and if you lose, justice will also prevail."" I love courtroom movies and books, and the ones I like best are fictional stories involving decisions just like this one. And this one dives you so deep into the Southern town they live in, and in the jury's mind, it's practically impossible for you not to put yourself in the jury's shoes.I have left out a lot of what happens during the movie, as there are a lot of interesting and suspenseful, not to mention comical scenes, but this is a MUST SEE. I have read the book twice (I'm a slow reader and it is quite large – or small print, many pages, so it's not likely, I'll read it again soon) and even though some things were changed, they pretty much nailed the book down. This has to rank as #2 best courtroom movie I've seen (behind A Few Good Men). Also, read the book for more extreme depth into the fantastic character of Jake Brigance.",A Time to Kill
22,sol1218,Let me tell you a story,6,15 August 2010,"***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Far fetched and convoluted story about rape revenge and murder in the deep south circa 1995 that seems to get itself lost in the both translation as well as the screenplay.There's no doubt to anyone in the film ""A Time to Kill"" that outraged father the hard working family man Carl Lee Hailey, Samuel L. Jackson, gunned down both Billy Ray Cobb and James Pete Willard, Nicky Katt & Dough Hutchison, as well as crippling Deputy Sheriff Looney (Chris Cooper), who just happened to get in the way of Hailey's barrage, on the steps of the courthouse as they were to be indited in the brutal kidnap rape of his 10 year old daughter Tonya, Rea Van Larrymore Kelly. The fact that Tonya survived her being attacked by them had nothing to do with Cobb and Willard letting her go. They in fact tried to lynch little Tonya but the tree branch that they tried to hang her on broke. It was Hailey's trial in the murder of Cobb and Willard that made no sense at all if you followed the movies storyline. With up and coming hot shot town lawyer,looking for the big case, Jake Tyler Brigance, Matthew McCouaghey, taking on the case his only hope of getting his client Hailey off was an insanity defense. This was later forgotten about when it became obvious to anyone, in the movie and audience,that Hailey was in fact cold stone sane when he committed his crime. In fact Hailey himself told Brigance earlier in the movie when he was to defend both Cobb and Willard for the rape and kidnap of his daughter Tonya that he was tempted to get out his assault rifle and gun the two creeps down before they were to be put on trial. That even if convicted of all charges they would only end up getting ten years behind bars and be free before they turned 35 years old! Still being old,or young, enough to rape and possibly murder some other unfortunate child whom they took, while getting high of pot and drunk on beer, fancy to.***SPOILERS*** At the trial with all his expert witnesses unable to prove that Hailey was insane when he committed his murderous act Brigance then turns to the jury and audience's moral conscience in getting them to see his, as well as Hailey's, point of view in that this was an act of pure revenge in what the two, Cobb and Willard, did to Hailey's 10 year old daughter in the most graphic description possible to change their minds in convicting his client! That with the local prosecuting D.A Rufus Buckley, Kevin Spacey, who just about had the case won sitting there in the courtroom looking as if he were brain dead without raising even the slightest objection to Brigance's changing the entire reason that Hailey defense was hanging on! An insanity defense!There's also in the film the resurrection of the notorious Klu Klux Klan that's been dormant for years in order to put their two cents worth in the Hailey murder case. These pointy headed loonies were so revolting, to both blacks and whites, that for a moment I suspected that it was Brigance himself who put them up to it, coming out in the open, in order to help his and his client's the accused Carl Lee Hailey's case! Besides the town's hanging judge Omar Noose, Partick McGoohn, there's the usual bleeding heart liberal form way up north Ellen Roak, Sandra Bullock, who's extremely perky and breathtaking support bra made more of an impression on lawyer Brigance as well as those of us watching then her very impressive credentials in the field of Civil as well as US Constitutional law. We also get to see the take no BS tough talking black Sheriff Ozzie Walls, Charles S. Dutton, who seemed to have been elected by the mostly white and racist town of Campton Mississippi not because he's black or even competent in his job but because of his past career as a running back for the L.A Rams!And last but not least there's the Sutherlands father & Son Donald & Kifer who are on the opposite side of the fence in the movie. Donald plays the barley sober and disbarred lawyer Lucien Willbanks who's always giving his protégé Jake Tyler Brigance advice in how to handle the case that almost ends up having him lose it. And then there's son Kifer as the slain accused rapist Billy Ray Cobb's older brother Freddie Lee who screws everything up for the prosecution in getting Hailey's put in the Mississippi states gas chamber by committing, together with his Klu Klux Klan fellow travelers, far worse crimes, like murder arson and kidnapping, then even Hailey was charged with!",A Time to Kill
23,Robert_duder,A legal thriller the likes of which you rarely see anymore,8,13 January 2015,"This is the sort of film that I am certain in 30 or 40 years will be considered a classic. Even if you ignore the fact that it is a terrific cast full of familiar faces and stars that went onto to be superstars, the story and the concept and the writing and the ethical and moral dilemma that comes out of this will be talked about for decades. Grisham created one of the best legal thrillers ever and who better because the man practically created the genre. Translating it to the big screen would be no small feat but I think they went a step beyond and captured the book and the characters very nearly flawlessly. The film runs a little long, I'm not sure given that it is technically a ""thriller"" moreso than a drama that it should feel like it drags just a little bit but I can't fault them for making sure the characters and idea is fully developed. The best thing to come out of A Time To Kill is the dialogue. The script for this film written by Akiva Goldsman is brilliant and masterful. He has done some great screenplays (we'll forgive him Batman and Robin and Lost In Space) but this is truly one of his best. Fortunately for him he also had some incredible actors delivering the lines.Matthew McConaughey is perfect as the struggling lawyer Jake Brigance. No one can play down to earth better than McConaughey and his charisma is brilliant on screen. He also plays a darn good lawyer. His closing speech is one of my favourite scenes in film. Samuel L Jackson perfectly plays the father who murders his daughter's rapists in cold blood. Jackson is emotional and moving in his role and the chemistry between he and McConaughey is very good. There are such incredible actors in this film and the one criticism I can give the film is that I feel like once you move away from the main cast, some of the supporting cast doesn't get the screen time they could have or deserve. Kevin Spacey is good but underused as the cocky DA Rufus Buckley and Sandra Bullock is feisty and fun and a very strong female lead but underused in her role. Oliver Platt who was always good for the sarcastic, fun but serious looking supporting character does exactly that in this film. Donald Sutherland is also terrific as Brigance's mentor but I wanted to see more of him. Kiefer Sutherland couldn't be better playing the smarmy and evil looking brother of one of the dead rapists. Ashley Judd is sort of flash in the pan as McConaughey's wife.This was Joel Schumacher at his best. He was a great director at one time but has slipped in recent years. This was a great example of the sort of vision he once had. He captures the racial tension of the deep south perfectly. You can just feel the air of tumultuous politics. Despite being a courtroom battle, the film is more about the racial battle happening outside the courtroom. The case and situations gives rise to a brand of the KKK and puts Brigance's life in danger and those in his life around him in danger as well. The opening scenes of the film are literally hard to watch, one of the most disturbing rape scenes in film and yet not because its graphically done or shown in poor taste but rather you feel and sense the danger and horrible act that is being done to a defenceless little girl. A Time To Kill is terrific. Its more art than entertainment because of the concepts behind it but if you love legal drama, thrillers, courtroom battles or just a very good film then this is one to see. 8.5/10",A Time to Kill
24,ElMaruecan82,"Good premise, strong performances, but a flawed writing in the form, and worse, in the content...",5,9 November 2016,"For all the good things Joel Schumacher's ""A Time to Kill"" provides, above all, an Oscar-worthy performance of Samuel L. Jackson, too many flaws in the writing altered what could have been a gripping and emotionally engaging experience.First, could the bad guys be any badder? I know these things happen but talk about 'overkill', in one minute, you get all the racist redneck cliche's, the Confederate flag, the pick-up truck, the booze, and the two villains going all 'buahahaha' on the screen. The rape was shocking enough to provoke an immediate reaction; did it really need all that 'dressing'? And didn't we have enough with the two rapists so we also had to have a KKK booster shoot to tell us that there's no one of redeeming value in the 'victims' side, who could condemn the rape, while still mourning the human losses.I know subtlety isn't Schumacher's strongest suit but he had the perfect set-up, a father murdering the men who raped his daughter was enough, and all the film needed was to build on this, not to add extra elements reminding how racism still prevails in the South, we got the idea. So, instead of dealing with the pain that could prevail in both sides, instead of having scenes in the courtroom reminding us that 'an eye for an eye' doesn't stand for justice, and make that the core of the debate, the film was just about racism. Writer Akiva Goldman was so blinded by his own 'personal' crusade that he didn't think the story could have been tackled from a more challenging and, say, neutral perspective, asking legitimate questions about 'vigilante' justice.I read many comments saying ""if I was the father, I would have blown their heads off or made them suffer first"", but the father didn't kill them as soon as he got a chance, which could have been an 'immediate' reaction, he anticipated a verdict and executed them. We only assume he was right if we take for granted that these men wouldn't have had the right sentence, and this is a certitude the script desperately tries to deliver. But had a prosecutor delivered a similar speech as the climactic one, mentioning all the graphic and disgusting details about the little girl's rape, are we to assume that the jury would have acquitted these two men or given them a suspended sentence? If that's the case, then it's hopeless.But I resisted and resented that idea. I refuse to believe that there would have been parents in the jury room who'd have felt any sympathy for the rapists. In fact, it's pretty much a MacGuffin, we're supposed to believe that's how the Law works in order to understand the father's action. Movies like ""In Cold Blood"", ""Inherit the Wind"" or ""Judgment at Nuremeberg"" raised thought- provoking questions. ""A Time to Kill"" provides the good question, but, as if it didn't trust our intelligence enough, it also gives the answer and the arguments, too. And instead of being a confrontation between two disturbing realities, a horrendous crime and a questionable act of vengeance, it becomes your routinely battle between good and evil, and the journey of the young lawyer Brigance, facing burning crosses and houses while his entourage is harassed and threatened.We have to get through these cliché scenes where he contemplates failure, the moment where his wife (Ashley Judd) reproaches him to spend too much time on this case (boy, did I cringe on this one), where his secretary (Brenda Ficker) tells him he's gone too far, and the ""case is lost"" moment because the attorney unveiled the past of a key witness. Such a story deserved better than this stuff we've seen over and over again. Basically, apart from Jackson and McConaughey, there's no single three-dimensional character in the film, Sandra Bullock is the wannabe assistant who miraculously provides all the needed information (especially to the audience) and when she's the victim of the most brutal assault, what does she say when Brigance visits her in the hospital? ""I had to do this, so you could call me Ellen"", how cute!The one character who could have added some nuance was the cop played by Chris Cooper, who lost his leg in the fusillade. ""I would have done the same"" he says, I could buy that, but did he have to add ""he's a hero, turn him loose"", would you call a hero someone who cut your leg off? But this is only a critic on the form; the writing undermines the message more than anything. I thought ""Shaft"" had a sort of pro-vigilante message and I hated the way everyone cheered when the mother killed Christian Bale's character but retrospectively, I realize that, at least in that case, she trusted Justice first, and it proved her wrong. Here, Jackson did his own justice with racial injustices as a pre-crime alibi. Even the climactic summation is all wrong, it invites people to imagine the crime on a white girl, not on their daughter, but a WHITE girl. Well, if that's the way to earn the jury's empathy, then even an acquittal is meaningless. And the film didn't even play fair with the plot to give us a proper verdict: so, the father is ""innocent""? Of what? He killed them, didn't he? He pleaded insanity, so was he or not? If he had been given a short sentence of jail or a suspended one that would have been a realistic ending and a victory, but no, the Justice system admits that he was right to act on his own terms, out of insanity, grief, pain whatever you call it.The more I dig in the plot, the less reasons to admire it, I see. It is really not a good script, and could easily have been one of the best trials movies, had it tried a little more, or maybe a little less.",A Time to Kill

26,secondtake,"A slick, cliché-filled, moving tribute to revenge killing, and a statement against racism",6,3 January 2013,"A Time to Kill (1996)What a powerful movie. Yes, it's built on movie-making clichés, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too.It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges.A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 ""Anatomy of Murder"") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, ""The Prisoner"") as the judge. Both are terrific.Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's ""justifiable homicide.""But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism.The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us ""Falling Down,"" if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.",A Time to Kill
27,Bored_Dragon,"""Now imagine she's white.""",8,1 November 2020,"When I first watched this film twenty years ago, I had to read a book as well. When I finished the book, I had to watch the movie again. ""A Time to Kill"" is one of the few examples where I can't decide whether it's a better novel or an adaptation, although I return to the film more often, simply because it requires less time and leaves an equally strong impression.Somewhere in Mississippi, a ten-year-old black girl was raped and otherwise brutally abused to the brink of death. The perpetrators were immediately arrested, but the girl's father, fearing that they could be released, took matters into his own hands and killed them while they were entering the court. Both of these events are explicitly shown in the introductory part of the film, but the story concentrates on the trial of the father for double murder and the consequences that this case left on everyone involved. The public is divided into those who demand that the father be released and those who demand the death penalty. The KKK enters the scene and terrorizes the family and associates of the defense attorney, who, risking the lives of himself and his loved ones, still drives the case to the end.This is basically a court drama, but as much as it deals with the events in the courtroom, so much does it dedicate itself to the psychological drama of everyone involved as well as the events that follow the whole situation, which give the film the features of a thriller. The excellent characterization is supported by a fantastic cast. Matthew McConaughey plays a young but capable lawyer who tries to save the avenging father (Samuel L. Jackson), and in the process resolve his inner turmoil, calm his conscience and find confirmation for his beliefs. He is assisted by a former top lawyer from whom he learned (Donald Sutherland) and a young, ambitious law student (Sandra Bullock). The relentless public prosecutor is played by the perfect Kevin Spacey, and the KKK's revenge is led by Kiefer Sutherland. There are also Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Ashley Judd, and other famous faces, and the cast itself is reason enough to give this film a chance.When John Grisham tried to publish his first novel, he had a lot of trouble finding a publisher because of the controversial content of this story. The film didn't go much better either, so the reviews of the audience and the critics were extremely divided. People either praise it and highly rate it as a top drama, or spit on it as a propaganda film that supports revenge murder and one-sidedly portrays racism, presenting blacks as victims and whites from the American South as primitive racist villains. There's both, and I fully understand the angle from which people hate this movie. However, I think that the haters also look at it one-sidedly and do not fully understand it, and I join those who support the film. Will you perceive this film as a strong and incredibly emotional life drama or as propaganda garbage ... I think it comes down to whether you would send the avenging father to the gas chamber or you would do the same in his place.The controversial last sentence of the defense closing speech, the sentence that is the biggest cause of resistance to this film, made me genuinely cry. If you find it disgusting at first glance, try to suppress that first reaction and look deeper and more sincerely into your heart, because we all have prejudices, even if we are not aware of them and no matter how painful it is for us to admit them.8,5/10",A Time to Kill

29,sol-,Killing Time,5,17 April 2016,"Sympathetic to the crime of a local African American who shot dead two men who raped his preteen daughter, a Mississippi lawyer tries to get his client off the hook by pleading temporary insanity in this courtroom drama. The key issue highlighted here is whether the murderer, played by Samuel L. Jackson, can get a fair trial in such a deeply racist community, and the film's most potent scenes are dedicated to a KKK rebirth as the trial stirs up division. The film trips up though by making racism (not ethics) the central issue and by making the local D.A. such a condescending, despicable character that his argued logic (individuals should not take the law into their own hands) gets buried beneath his smarminess. Examined objectively, Jackson is unquestionably guilty. Having hinted to his lawyer what he intended to do beforehand, it is unethical for the lawyer to plead temporary insanity, quite aside from the fact that rape (no matter how brutal) is seldom ever argued as grounds for justifiable homicide. With all this in mind, the movie becomes very uncomfortable to watch as we are positioned to root for Jackson to get off, simply because it would be a triumph over racism. The unanswered question that lingers in the air is whether Jackson would have gotten off were he Caucasian because then the jury would not feel racist if they voted 'guilty'. And yet, while deeply flawed, 'A Time to Kill' is always engaging to view. The performances are uniformly excellent, tension frequently abounds and the telling final shot is great -- but one's moral compass may well waver while watching the film.",A Time to Kill

31,didi-5,bigoted and empty,5,11 February 2005,"This film came out with a fair amount of publicity - Joel Schumacher at the helm, John Grisham's novel the source material. Matthew MacConaughey was touted as the new Marlon Brando / Paul Newman (depending on your point of view) but he didn't have the presence or talent of either of those old pros.The story is one of racial hatred set in Mississippi, where the Ku Klux Klan still rage war on the black population, and where Samuel L Jackson's little daughter is raped and killed, causing his to shoot the accused white trash at the start of the film. The remainder of the film is pretty much taken up with his trial for murder and the issues around it.Given that this empty film is implying that it is OK to take matters into your own hands (oh, and that all white men of a certain type and class are yobs, rednecks, and not fit to live), it doesn't have much more of a plot. Sandra Bullock is in there somewhere, mainly draping herself all over MacConaughey as the fans whirr in the hot afternoons. Kiefer Sutherland plays a nutty Klan member (a couple more roles like this would make his star wane considerably in movies thereafter), and his dad Donald makes an appearance as well.'A Time to Kill' is half-baked, unpalatable and not particularly good.

The fight to hang on to their way of life versus the appropriate change to equality for minorities.The tension between those beliefs is compelling as neither side is prepared to budge. How low will the Klan and cohorts go to win the day? Very low is the answer.

33,insomniac_rod,Solid dramatic feature with legal aspects...in the style of Hollywood.,9,14 January 2007,"Solid drama that delivers a believable point of view towards justice and injustice on the legal and human aspects. The film is not exactly about revenge, in fact, it deals more with the legal definition of mental illness; something that could happen to anyone under severe state of mental crisis caused by a specific event. Carl Lee Hailey was under a mental crisis when he saw what they were doing to his daughter. He killed both white teens because he couldn't defend his daughter in other way; he was blinded by rage. Legally, it was a justified action but in Mississipi, at that time, the racist campaign wouldn't help his situation. The Afro American community help Hailey's cause with a fund raised by church and also by finding him an attorney. It's Jake Tyler Brigance who takes the case. A young white man who has little practice but is very secure about his request for justice and for his ideals. Soon after he takes the case, horrible things start to surround the trial's atmosphere. The KKK is against Hailey's freedom, so does part of the jury, the judge, and the District Attorney. Jake soon finds the aid with his mentor, a colleague, and a sexy recent graduate. The case gets violent even to the point that it takes the lifes of innocent people and causes severe damages. Those who are against Carl Lee will do anything to prevent him from his freedom. Now it's up for Jack Brigance and his legal ""team"" to make their best and try to save Carl Lee Hailey. Overall this is a very solid, powerful, and moving drama with legal aspects that are strongly supported by a great, great cast and a brilliant direction by Joel Schumacher. The situations are very well done but sometimes rely on the Hollywood factor. I mean, non-credible manners in order to solve important matters.Matthew McConaughey delivers a solid, believable performance. Sandra Bullock demonstrates her acting skills and looks sexy as hell! Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor and delivers a dramatic lesson in acting. Kevin Spacey and Oliver Platt are very good on their roles. Charles S. Dutton and Donald Sutherland have supporting but powerful roles. Very good roles. Kiefer Sutherland steals the show in some scenes because he truly demonstrates hate through his eyes and expressions. Patrick McGoohan also delivers a fine performance. Overall an excellent cast. This is one of the best movies from the 90's and truly deserves more recognition. A great movie on all aspects.",A Time to Kill
34,imseeg,"This movie promotes gut feelings about revenge. Violent revenge is good, that's the ridiculous message of this story. No credibility storywise.",5,28 April 2019,"Acting and direction are quite good, but the story really is quite ridiculously promoting violent driven revenge. Therefore this movie will probably only go down well with those people who wish to kill murderers and rapists by themselves instead of bringing them to justice in court.The story in short: the daughter of Samuel L Jackson gets beaten and raped by two white men. Out of revenge he kills those 2 white men and afterwards he gets aquited in court of any wrongdoings and walks out of court as a free man.This is such a ridiculous unbelievable story, that I was only wondering what the point of this movie could be? Revenge is good. That's the point, that is promoted by this movie. Kill the one, who attacked you. Not out of self defense, but out of sheer feelings of revenge. If you like that kinda idea, then you might like this movie, provided you are not a white supremacist, because they get literally burned to death in this movie, without any retaliation by the justice department whatsoever. Again, such a ridiculous story is only meant to stir up gut feelings and wallow in it. Not my cup of tea...",A Time to Kill
35,jzappa,Vast Hollywood Entertainment,9,11 July 2008,"Resolves effectively to the degree that Hollywood crowd-pleasers do. Though there are many touches that shade the film with definition, such as our smidgen of sympathy for the mother of the two racist hillbilly rapists, who we despise to no end; the passionate political disagreements between McConaughey's character and Bullock's character and our equal investment in them despite which one we personally agree with; the turning point of the story, Jackson's character acquiring an M-16 rifle and going to the county courthouse and opening fire on both of his daughter's rapists and unintentionally injuring the Sheriff's Deputy with a ricochet, creating a thinner line between right and wrong for the audience to weigh. What's wiser is how Jackson, who gives the best performance of the entire cast, does not resist when he is subsequently arrested; the jury secretly discussing Jackson's case, and his fate looks sealed.Sometimes, message movies are a little overbearing not because I ""don't want to pay money to have a message shoved down my throat"" but because often message movies are constructed for the cause of a message that is already heeded by the masses. A Time To Kill, for example, is a movie about the justification in Jackson's murder of his daughter's rapists and the right elements to integrating white and black people into a peaceful environment to share. These are things most people already understand. However, A Time to Kill is not necessarily preaching to the converted. It's more of a story that fills the audience with passionate feelings ignited when characters do the right thing and the wrong thing, both of which Grisham and Schumacher already aware of how the audience will react. That's why one leaves this film feeling good.There is however a bit of body fat to the film: McConaughey's attraction to Bullock grows, and nearly begins an affair before he gains his wits and goes home. Though I will admit Bullock is exceptionally sexy in this film, can American movies ever let a male and female just be friends and colleagues? It does happen, you know. But, this is tolerable when Kevin Spacey is vastly entertaining, basically playing himself as the swaggeringly theatrical prosecutor.",A Time to Kill
36,freemantle_uk,Racially charged legal thriller,7,10 November 2009,"John Grisham to most people is a love him or hate him type of author, where he has either has lovers or haters of his work. I personal don't mind him, I have read The Firm and thought it was pretty good. Grisham work has ended up being made into a number of films, such as The Firm, The Pelican Brief, Rainmaker and the Runaway Jury, all looking at the American Legal system. A Time to Kill is one of his favourite novels, and made had an active role in the adaptation's production.Set in rural Mississippi, a 10-year-old girl is brutally raped by two racists when she was walking home. It is a violence crime that unites the community and the two men are quickly arrested. The men confess to their crime, but the girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), fears that they would be acquitted. He takes the law in his own hand and kills the two men, and himself gets arrested. A local young lawyer Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) takes the cast despite having limited resources because he felt he would have done the same it had happened to his young daughter. There is public sympathy for the case, especially in the black community and Jake even gains the help of Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock), a intelligent law student. But Jake's life and his family is put in danger when the Ku Klux Khan role into town, led by the brother of one of the rapists (Kiefer Sutherland). They use threats and violence against Jake, his family and employees to stop him in the case. Jake also has to tackle the talented, but slimy DA Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey) who uses all his influence to get his way.This is clearly a bleak story, and has potential to look at a number of themes, from American law to the still embedded feelings of racism in the American Deep South. The film tries to show all this having a number of sub-plots and looks at a number of characters. They are ideas of racism in the jury, in the police, but also the police having sympathy for the father. I sure a lot of people would feel the same if it happened to a close friend or family member. They is good cast in the film. Samuel L. Jackson was going through his mini-phase of being a militant black man, and was in good form. Kevin Spacey was delightfully slimy, which he is good at, and underused. Kiefer Sutherland offered a similar performance to what he did in another legal thriller, A Few Good Men. Sandra Bullock was okay, but nothing special. Matthew McConaughey too was okay, but I doubt his abilities as a leading man. At times when he was on screen with Sandra Bullock it was a contest on who could offer the most wooden performance.This is also one of Joel Schumacher better films, and shows he can do dark, serious films, and not campy messes like he did with his Batman films. There is violence, some good set pieces and a good handle behind the camera: but he was a workman like director with this film. But he and the writer Akiva Goldsman made the film too long with a bit too much fat: they should have cut around 10 minutes to give the audience a more tort experience.Akiva Goldsman did offer some weak moments of dialogue, and a bit too much melodrama. He is in advantageous with this film, and sticks to the standard legal thriller formation, lawyer gets cast, lawyer has trouble with cast and thinks he is about to lost, lawyer is offered a small ray of hope. That's what happens in most American legal thrillers and the legal thriller is not a genre with has caught on in other nation's cinema.Despite they are claims of liberalism throughout the film, it also offers a very right-wing message, accepting vigilantism, that it is okay to take the law into your own hands.With a little editing, re-writes and a strong indie mentality this could have been an really brilliant, but ends up being standard Hollywood pulp.",A Time to Kill
37,kevin_robbins,There's nothing I would change about this film as it is fairly perfect from beginning to end.,10,29 June 2021,"A Time to Kill (1996) is a movie I was excited to watch again for the first time in a long time off Tubi. The storyline follows a group of good ole boys from the south that grab and rape a 10 year old girl in Mississippi. After their arrest the girl's father shoots and kills them at the courthouse and then stands trial for murder himself. An aspiring young lawyer will have to be very clever to get his client off from murder chargers for such a public event. This movie is directed by Joel Schumacher (Falling Down) and stars Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Matthew McConaughey (Mud), Charles Dutton (Alien 3), Donald Sutherland (Animal House), Kiefer Sutherland (Lost Boys) and Sandra Bullock (Speed). The storyline for this is so compelling, intense and well told and paced. There are a lot of little intricate moments and many characters to root for and against. There are some great courtroom scenes but also a nice mix of character interactions and intricacies that are well presented to the audience. This is probably my all time favorite courtroom drama. There's nothing I would change about this film as it is fairly perfect from beginning to end. This is a masterpiece that belongs in your collection that I would easily score a 10/10.",A Time to Kill
38,smatysia,"Good cast, pushes all the buttons, maybe too much",7,8 July 2002,"For an excellent analysis of this film, scroll on down to Daniel R. Baker's review, he hits almost every nail right on the head. This was a pretty good film in some ways, largely due to the excellent cast. Some of the fake Southern accents were a little distracting, but I've certainly heard worse. A lot worse. At least they tried. As I say the acting was almost all excellent, and the director pushes every button really, really hard. That's where the film begins to pall. I read Grisham's book some years back, and cannot remember every detail, but it seems that he went into a lot of detail about being a young Southern lawyer, and that there was a lot more distrust between Brigance and Hailey than was shown in the film. However, you have to lose a lot of nuances to turn a 600 page novel into a movie, even if a fairly long one. (2.5 hrs) But the movie is excessively preachy about race. Yes, I know that race is the main subject. But, even in Mississippi, by 1996 the two racist, yahoo, rapists were not going to get a walk on a brutal rape and attempted murder of a 10 year old girl, even if she WAS black. Perhaps if this film had been set in the '70's, that premise might have worked better. That's why the ""Now, imagine she's white."" line is, in my opinion, offensive to whites AND blacks. One more point: I don't know about Mississippi law, but in most states when one is acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, one spends at least SOME time in a mental institution, and isn't out celebrating with family and lawyers the next day. Overall the film is worth seeing once. Grade: B-",A Time to Kill
39,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,The best courtroom drama I have ever seen!,10,17 November 2005,"This is the best courtroom drama I have ever seen! Even though I did not see A TIME TO KILL theatrically, one night, it was October 30, 1999, it happened to be on ABC, so I decided to watch it. After watching it then, I decided I liked it and wanted to own it. This smashing courtroom drama made me feel really good, and the more I watch it, the more I like it. If you ask me, Carl Lee (Samuel L. Jackson) gave Billy Ray (Nicky Katt) and Pete (Doug Hutchison) what they deserved. In my opinion, Jake (Matthew McConaughey) was the perfect choice for Carl Lee's attorney. This was because he was a young and experienced attorney. I thought that Ellen (Sandra Bullock) looked very beautiful in the black dress coat and skirt, white blouse, and black high heels. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If you ask me, everyone involved in this film did a superb job, and I have quite a bit of the dialogue memorized."" Now, having said all that, I give A TIME TO KILL three out of four stars.",A Time to Kill
40,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Simmering courtroom drama,8,22 July 2016,"Ahh, the courtroom drama. Or, in Joel Schumacher's A Time To Kill's case, the fired up courtroom scorcher. A massive team of actors gather together here to tell the hot blooded tale of one African American man on trial for a brutal murder that is seen by many as justified, but to the prosecutor working the case is just another statistic that will help him vault over the pole to his next suit & tie victory. It's based on a book by John Grisham, and Schumacher also adapted his story The Client, with admirable but less energetic results. This is one my favourite courtroom films, mainly due to the feverish energy of the American South that thrums beneath events like a heart ready to beat out of its chest. Every character has a mad glint in their eye and an epic film of sweat drenching them, and it's easy to see why when you examine the high stakes, hot tempered powder keg of a trial they are involved in. Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant as Carl Lee, a simple African man accused of mercilessly gunning down two cracker asses (one of which is a grimy Kiefer Sutherland). These two punks are responsible for the rape and prolonged brutalization of Carl's twelve year old daughter. A righteous knee jerk reaction for anyone, right? Try convincing a jury in the South of that. Conflict flares up faster than the fire adorning the crosses left on lawns by the arriving KKK, and soon the pressure is on to find the perfect prosecutor and defender for his case. Young upstart Jake Brigans (Matthew McConaughey) is picked to defend, facing off against a seasoned and annoyingly smug prick played by Kevin Spacey. Jake is blessed with the ingenuity and intuition of a law clerk (Sandra Bullock, excellent) and the sagely patronage of a veteran lawman played by a salty Donald Sutherland. It's a tricky case though, with tempers and racial tension running high and a near constant air of danger for people on both sides of the table. Lee stands by his choice and boils in righteous fury that doesn't quell the hurt once it's simmered down, something which Jackson achingly imparts. Jake is swept up in the spectacle of it all, until his relationship with his wife (Ashley Judd) and finally his very life are at stake. Bullock brings the sanity of the big city to this backwater set melodrama and gives some of the best work of the film. Morality is tentatively explored, even though it's clear as day that Lee was completely justified in his actions, and the outcome of the trial should reflect this. That sentiment is right there with the film's title. But does it? You'll have to watch and see. The epic cast lineup also includes work from Oliver Platt, Brenda Fricker, Kurtwood Smith, Charles S. Dutton, Patrick McGoohan, Nicky Katt, Beth Grant, Anthony Heald, Octavia Spencer, M. Emmett Walsh and a moving Chris Cooper in a small role. It's a long film, but it sustains its energy and pace for the duration, with McConaughey's refusal to buck the horse and throw the trial a key asset in letting us feel the hurt of a community torn inside out in one act of flagrant evil. It's up to him and his crew not to right that wrong (realism dictates that it's too late), but to give a modicum of solace to those further endangered by the very same evil. A winner.",A Time to Kill

Most of the movie I enjoyed very much,, ran a little long on time I think,, some parts could have been shortened,, some of the racism ... KKK stuff was a bit much if you ask me,, but I guess it was needed to drive home the point of the sickening hatred that the clan has, and had for the African American.. This movie has a ton of star power,, Matthew McCgonahey, Sandra Bullock, the Sutherlands.. there's so many I can't think of them all , Civil Rights in Mississippi isn't quite taking hold as a pair of racist white boys rape and almost kill a 10 yr old black girl.. the girl's father,, played by Samuel L. Jackson.. takes the law into his own hands and kills the 2 boys,, but in the process takes out the knee of the local sheriff, I would have done the same thing.. except try to have better aim,, I guess this movie is all about morality, and what would you do given that situation. justice is served either way,, whatever the verdict comes out... what I thought was interesting was at the courthouse scene,, you have the NAACP, and the black people on one side, and the KKK on the other side,, and in the middle of the st.. armed National Guard.. what a frightening scene.. excellent movie.. just hard to watch some of the extreme measures of the KKK.",A Time to Kill
42,Spleen,Vile and witless,2,18 June 2000,"It's incredible: Schumacher seems genuinely unaware that in exacting revenge on the two rapists, Hailey has done anything wrong.  There's not a hint of recognition.  If ""A Time to Kill"" had merely glorified violence, it would have been a much less despicable production; after all, it's possible to glorify something without endorsing it.Although Hailey is a much nicer person than the two men who rape his daughter, he has committed a greater crime than they have.  For one thing he kills the two rapists BEFORE their trial.  They MIGHT, after all, be convicted; indeed, there's no indication that their won't be: the most anyone says is that they `might' get off.  Hailey doesn't even wait and see. He simply strides into the town courtroom - the COURTROOM: if THIS isn't a crime against society, I'd like to know what is - and shoots away, incidentally wounding a police officer and causing him to lose his leg.  (If part of the rapists' crime was that they maimed an innocent person, well, Hailey also maims an innocent person.)  He's subsequently tried for murder (but of course!) and the fundamentally dishonest show trial that follows ignites a riot in which one person is killed, others are injured, and an incalculable amount of ill feeling is generated.There is almost comedy in the fact that Hailey justifies himself by talking about his responsibilities as a father.  ALMOST comedy, because Schumacher is too dense to notice comedy when it arises.  Hailey has three or four children APART from the one who was raped.  What about THEM?  By indulging his desire for revenge he risks being imprisoned, which would hurt them, collectively, more than it would hurt him.  And if by some fluke he ISN'T imprisoned he has hardly set his children a good example.It's the casual way Schumacher assumes that we will be on Hailey's side, and on the side of the shyster lawyer who subverts the legal system as much as possible in defending him, that really grates.  It doesn't even occur to him that anyone in the audience might see things differently (i.e., correctly). If anyone DOESN'T share Schumacher's apparent view that the courts exists solely to gratify our desire for revenge, and that we might as well exact revenge ourselves if the courts fail to exact it on our behalf - well, then, that person is left in the cold.  Apart from being stupid and evil the film is utterly unremarkable.  It's like the Canadian national anthem, or a group of unattractive cheerleaders: it won't stir you in the least if you're not already on the side it's so mindlessly supporting.",A Time to Kill

Tempers flare, the KKK is reborn and people start getting hurt and dying. Expert witnesses turn out not to be so expert and the young lawyer's house is burned to the ground. The suspense is in high gear throughout, and the script is powerfully written. Matthew M., Sam Jackson, Keifer and Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock pull out all the stops.

44,rosscinema,"Cliche's and cardboard characters ""kill"" film",4,22 April 2003,"I'm sure John Grisham is a fine writer and I do think Joel Schumacher is a pretty good director but this script and direction just goes way over the top! Two rednecks (Who else?) rape and beat a ten year old girl and are arrested. As they head to the courtroom the next day the father of the girl shoots and kills both of them and accidently wounds a deputy in the process. The Klu Klux Klan get involved to make sure the black defendant is found guilty. Matthew McConaughey got his first big role in this film and he's actually pretty darn good but the film has so many familiar courtroom drama staples that its awash in cliche's. First, since its in the south it has to be boiling hot 24 hours a day. All the actors are drenched in sweat for the entire film. Even in the courtroom! I'm pretty sure in this day and age a courtroom in the south has air conditioning. In another point of the film Ashley Judd who is McConaughey's wife is sent away when the Klan starts making dangerous threats. This is obviously a ploy to get Judd out of the way so McConaughey and Sandra Bullock can have more screen time together and make eyes at one another. This film has just about everything thrown into the mix. A state DA who wants to make governor (Of course), the KKK threatening everyone, Local preachers who are trying to use the case to make money, Jurors who use the ""N"" word, and then they bring in the national guard when riots break out! While watching this film I asked myself if I could believe any of it. The answer is no. I did like a few things about the film. I like the fact that Bullock had a rather small supporting role. I think this is something she should think about doing more of. Take whatever role interests you no matter what the size. Samuel L. Jackson has a good scene with McConaughey in his cell when he tells him that he's different. Its probably the most thought provoking moment in the film. And McConaughey has two good scenes that help keep the film from being laughable. The first is with Bullock in a restaurant and Bullock tells him her aspirations of abolishing the death penalty nationally and she assumes he would agree. Well he doesn't. In fact he tells her the main problem with it is that it doesn't get used enough! The scene rings true and its almost a slap in the face for some viewers. The other scene is of course McConaughey giving his summation to the jury. Its a very strong scene and a well written one at that. Its not easy for a young actor like McConaughey to tackle something like it, but he's got some back-up from the writing. McConaughey shows his chops and proved to everyone that the risk in casting him was the right one. Aside from these moments, the rest of the film is just to over the top to be taken seriously.",A Time to Kill
45,raulfaust,A Film to Rewatch,8,20 October 2011,"Wow, I'm speechless. This is such a strong film that will make you reflect all the while. The story begins with two white punks raping a black man's daughter. Before that, they go to a bar and call the n word for the black dudes in there. After that, Samuel L Jackson's character decides to make his own revenge; he goes to the court and shoots the two rapists many times-- sadly, he mercilessly ends up also shooting a police officer, for apparently, no reason whatsoever. After some scenes we figure out that he's friends with the shot officer and the officer forgives him. The film is filled with many references to the shameful Ku Klux Klan-- an organization that should be forgot and buried in the US history. In Brazil there are few groups of this nature, but fortunately police and judiciary punish these people very hard. I am proud of myself that my best friend is a black guy and I put all my trust in him; I am also proud to affirm I never made a black guy feel bad for being black. I really hope the prejudice in the rest of the world is as small and restrained as it is in Brazil-- at least in the city I live in. Also, I'm in the second year of law school, and I've never really understood what's the real reason for the existence of jury, even after going to some of them.

46,eric262003,Shows Us How Hate Is In All Of Us,8,14 July 2014,"There are a lot of deeming factors that makes ""A Time to Kill"" one of the most important films to watch. It's not a film for entertaining purposes by any means of the imagination. This intriguing story stars Samuel L. Jackson playing the part of Carl Lee Hailey, a vengeful African-American man who killed two rednecks who raped and nearly killed his young daughter Tonya (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly). It all comes down to rookie hotshot lawyer Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) to prevent Mr. Hailey from either serving a long-term prison sentence or worst, be put to death. The acting in ""A Time to Kill"" well performed, by rather large ensemble of terrific thespians. The leading performances of McConaughey and Jackson were both very engaging and quite colorful and a bit disturbing at times. The supporting performers turn in some very compelling roles and movie the film along quite nicely. Kevin Spacey shines as the prosecutor who might be a likable or a hateful character at times. But his charisma as a performer is something everyone respects of him. Sandra Bullock was brilliant as Brigance's assistant and law student, Ellen Roark. Kiefer Sutherland was excellent as the unashamed bigoted, vengeful minded brother of one of the rapists who was killed by Hailey, Freddie Lee Cobb. To wrap up this all-star cast includes Charles S. Dutton, Donald Sutherland, Chris Cooper, Ashley Judd, Oliver Platt and Patrick McGoohan and a cameo from M. Emmet Walsh. I'm not a racist by any means, but the philosophy that the KKK stated is not all that ignorant or narrow-minded by any stretch of the imagination. In fact it is pretty well documented. As a member of the human race, hate is placed in each and every one of us. Racism is not just formed in the KKK or the Nazis, skinheads or the iconic bigot himself Archie Bunker. Bigotry is in all of us. If a person is dressed differently, we laugh at them. If a person does things in his-her ways, we ostracize them. If you have a birthmark in an obvious place on your body, we insult the person. Everyone is capable of delivering hatred, it is in all of us, no one is safe from the wrath and hatred we inflict on each other. There's a lot to like about ""A Time To Kill"", but the message delivered here does not do any justice at all. I strongly oppose taking the law in your hands or relying on underhanded tactics like murder just to get even with someone. If this was based on a true story, I think it would be unjustified if they ended up acquitting Carl Lee Hailey. I expect law and order to be handled in very unbiased perspective with no excuses. Hailey's tactics was cold-blooded and unnecessary. He should have sued these rapists in court before going out on a killing spree. I'm sorry for what happened to his daughter and he has every right to be angered by the whole situation, but he is not entirely innocent for what he did.Another wonderful adaptation of John Grisham's novel beautifully directed by Joel Schumacher. It's a fascinating courtroom drama with wonderful performances and film that will have you pondering for ours giving your thoughts and opinions of those around you. I just don't encourage people to get even with someone, by taking revenge in your own hands but doing something regretful or let alone exposing those who do.",A Time to Kill
47,philip_vanderveken,"A very good movie, despite some clichés",8,12 December 2004,"A Time to Kill is a very interesting movie, because it talks about a difficult subject: what would you do if someone raped and (almost) killed your child? I guess many of us would like to react the same way as Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) did. We would like to shoot the one who did it too, instead of waiting for justice to decide.A young white lawyer will defend the black man who is accused of murdering the two men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. This sparks the rebirth of the KKK and the interest of some black pressure groups, who all think the man shouldn't be defended by the young lawyer. The KKK accuses him of being a ""nigger-lover"" and threatens to kill him, his family and everybody that works for him. The pressure groups on the other hand want to get rid of him, because they want their own lawyers to defend Carl Lee, so they can use him as a status symbol for their own cause.The story is very good, but sometimes too many clichés are used. For instance, it's two boozing rednecks that raped and murdered the innocent black girl who lives with her parents and a lot of brothers and sisters, somewhere on the countryside, in an old house; Every white person in the South is against the black population;... But don't let these clichés turn you down. When you can see past them, you'll see it is a very good drama /court room thriller. I enjoyed watching it and I give it a 7.5/10.",A Time to Kill

It shows that there is still a limit between black and white people and there are not many to defend sometimes the truth. What I didn't like therefore was that the movie was told too detailed and sometimes it lost even the dynamic or the main point. I mean, the last part was played in the court and I thought that it never stops.

I have to say, i simply loved it when Stump Sisson (Kurtwood Smith) the leader of the KKK, was burned to death during a riot. The hatred i felt for him, the rest of the KKK and the spokesman for the Jury, surprised me, but that's the power of this movie.Unrelented, Brigance with the help of Ellen (Sandra Bullock), Harry (Oliver Platt) and his teacher Lucien (Donald Sutherland) continue the fight for Carl's release, and the story grows more dramatic with every scene, with no scene more powerful than the closing address in the courtroom from Brigance, simply brilliant.With fine performances from all of the cast, the credit must go to Matthew McConaughey, for his finest performance ever.This movie is one of the most powerful that i've seen, forget any weakness of story or plot holes this may have, it's morale values are very real, and we could all learn from them.",A Time to Kill
51,Xstal,Still Raising More Questions Than Answers...,7,10 October 2020,"... and when you cascade politics, religion and justice into the cauldron and catalyse them with a culture that, like all cultures, struggles to shake off its generational prejudices, you're left with a hate that's as tough to eradicate as the common cold. Some fine performances all round and quite a spectacular list of actors milling around and in the courthouse. The saddest part for me is that watching it over 25 years after reading the book I've become too accepting that the world is incapable of recognising what the true cause of prejudice is because those we elect to authority really don't want to empower and uplift those who enter the world considerably less well off than the rest.",A Time to Kill
52,Spuzzlightyear,Time to kill for Time to kill (Ha! Clever!),6,18 May 2006,"Time To Kill is a pretty by the numbers drama about tensions that arise when a vengeful father kills the Southern yokels that raped his young daughters and the brouhaha that ensue in the Southern town where the trial is held. OK, let's see, we have Samuel L. Jackson as the vengeful father, Matthew Mcconaughay as the lawyer who represents him, Sandra Bullock as his peppy law student assistant, Kevin Spacey as the D.A., Donald Sutherland as a retired Lawyer reluctantly helping Mcconaughey, and yes, even Kiefer Sutherland as a grizzled young troublemaker trying everything, including yes, bringing the KKK in! So as you can see here, we have an all-star stew here, and it's all somewhat fun, trying to figure out who comes out the winner in this acting derby (I think it's Kevin Spacey and definitely not Sandra Bullock) . This movie may run too long for it's own good, but holds itself together by its performances to make it enjoyable as.. yess.. A TIME TO KILL! Wow, clever.",A Time to Kill
53,classicalsteve,Good Story More About Entertainment Than a Critique of Vigilantism and Race Relations,8,29 March 2020,"This I believe is a relatively underrated film, a classic courtroom drama with strangely similar intensity as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The premise is relatively simple: a Black Man (Samuel Jackson in a brilliant performance) in the rural American South murders two White Supremicists for raping his daughter. He is defended by a relatively right-leaning white southerner (Matthew McCnaughey in an equally compelling performance). I'm not giving anything away as the murder occurs within about the first five minutes of the film.The rest of the film chronicles all the implications that might ensue regarding this case, including involvement by the KKK and NAACP. It's a good story and I think it's strength is being honest to its material. And remember, this is a STORY. This never really happened, although similar cases have happened. Some of the events are a bit exaggerated (this is a film after all, not a documentary), such as White Supremicists clashing with Black protestors outside the courthouse. (Similar things did happen in the OJ Simpson trial for example.)In regards to how to view this film (in the interpretive sense), sometimes viewers and readers of novels and films get it into their minds that if a story unfolds in a particular manner, that means the author(s) and/or creator(s) are advocating a particular political stance outside of fiction material. I don't know if you can readily make that assumption unless the author/creator specifically says so. Certainly viewers and readers might interpret that the author/creator is exploring a larger theme, but what I'm talking about is whether or not we as viewers can draw specific conclusions about political stances.The reason I mention this is because many reviewers have pegged ""A Time to Kill"", novel by John Grisham and film by Joel Schumacher, as somehow favoring vigilantism. Do Grisham and Schumacher advocate vigilantism in certain circumstances? You'd have to ask them, not rely on a novel or film. To use other examples, Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) goes beyond the bounds of the law to stop a killer, and some former law students get revenge on a corrupt lawyer using the jury system in ""Runaway Jury"", also by Grisham. Does this mean that Eastwood and Grisham necessarily advocate the behavior of their characters? Of course not. Again you'd have to ask them outside of viewing a film.I think ""A Time to Kill"" is a fine film, maybe more about entertainment than actually making a political statement. The story-line is compelling, and the acting is top notch. Ashley Judd has a small role as McConaughey's wife and Sandra Bullock plays an aspiring law student who wants legal experience. Oliver Platt plays a legal colleague who gets involved in the case. If you're looking for good solid legal-thriller entertainment, ""A Time to Kill"" is a nice consideration.",A Time to Kill

Too bad Hollywood is obsessed with The Good Ship Lollypop approach to story telling.",A Time to Kill
55,nicholas.rhodes,Good story - Mixed results,7,22 July 2007,"I thought that the story serving as a basis for this film was a good one if a little contrived. I also thought that bringing the race issue into it was unnecessary and gave the impression the author was being one sided. The question I ask is : could the film have been made, would it have had any success if the colours had been reversed, i.e. small white girl raped by two black men, white father kills black men in anger, white man acquitted because the crime of rape was so horrible. I am sincerely not sure that such a film could have been made, due to Political Correctness which has infested the USA which means that any type of film dealing with the racial issue will automatically portray the bad guys as white and the good guys as black, or if indeed there is a bad black guy, there will always be another good one to contrast with this. So the race issue would have been best left out of this because as we all know, no race is free from killers and loonies and rapists. The more interesting question is whether you can take the law into your own hands to resolve a problem which you think at the time the justice system will not be able to resolve for you. This is the interesting part of the film and I would for one side with Matthew McConaughey whom I thought gave the most convincing performance in the film, although I do reproach many of his dialogue as being incomprehensible ( bad diction - strong and slurred accent ). The same goes for Samuel Jackson. Kevin Spacey, though, was brilliant and clearly audible in the role of the unrelenting procureur. On the other hand I was extremely annoyed by bleeding heart liberal Sandra Bullock ranting on against the death penalty and wondered what the point of having her in the film was. The more I see this woman in films, the less I like here - here characters are shallow and lack depth. She was out of place in this film, and apart from miraculously uncovering information about the state physician, contributed little to the proceedings. At least she was taught a lesson by the KKK, whose intervention on other levels seemed very violent and unpleasant - but I would have preferred the whole ""race"" aspect - KKK and all - to have been absent from the film. I am not sure in what period the film is set, and don't know how active the KKK is today. Anyway, these problems were dealt with far better in the film Mississippi Burning with Gene Hackman which was a great film. My main beef, though, remains the quality of the dialogues and the intelligibility of the speech which really was below par. I liked the happy ending and was pleased to see Matthew McConaughey and his family visiting Samuel Jackson.",A Time to Kill
56,Isaac5855,An Intense and Moving Courtroom Drama that takes an unflattering look at southern bigotry....,8,5 June 2007,"A compelling story and first-rate performances make A TIME TO KILL a minor classic. This engrossing story is about an idealistic young white attorney, practically just of out of law school, who agrees to defend a black factory worker on trial for murdering the two men who raped his daughter. A richly complex story has been constructed here that gives equal times to all sides, but most importantly, raises the veil on bigotry in the south and gives us an unsettling look at vigilante justice and things we'd like to believe don't exist anymore, like the KKK. Akiva Goldman's screenplay, based on a novel buy John Grisham, presents a disturbing story populated with characters painted in shades of gray. The cast is superb...Matthew McConaughey snagged the role of his career as Jake Briganst, the young lawyer who has divided a town and put his family in danger, as well as his own life, by taking this case; McConaughey has never topped this performance and probably never will; Samuel L. Jackson delivers his accustomed powerhouse performance as Carl Lee Haley, the tortured defendant; Kevin Spacey is brilliant as the prosecuting attorney; Sandra Bullock is the idealistic law student who agrees to assist Briganst; Donald Sutherland is Jake's alcoholic mentor; Brenda Fricker is Jake's secretary; future Oscar winner Chris Cooper is a cop caught in the line of fire; and Keifer Sutherland completely inhabits the unsympathetic role of a KKK supporter whose brother was one of Carl Lee's victims. There's also a stylish turn by TV legend Patrick McGoohan as the judge that deserves mention. Thanks to inspired direction by Joel Schumacher(definitely one of his better efforts),this is s compelling and deeply moving motion picture that will have you riveted to the screen. Don't miss this one. As far as I know, the only film in which father and son Donald and Keifer Sutherland appear together, though they share no scenes.",A Time to Kill

58,Dan1863Sickles,Racism Is Bad -- But Only Mean Rednecks Must Pay,1,19 January 2010,"The problem I have with this movie is not that a black father loses his cool and shoots two white men who raped his daughter. What bothers me is the idea that ""racism"" -- a complex reality involving a host of different cultural, economic, and political problems -- can be summed up as ""mean rednecks who drive pickup trucks attacking black children at random."" This kind of oversimplification doesn't really solve anyone's problems, black or white. But liberal Hollywood has been employing this approach ever since TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. And it's not hard to see why. Because if racism is simply a matter of the poorest, most ignorant whites committing open acts of violence, then the rich whites who run the film industry, and the legal profession, and the media, are inherently on the right side of the issue. And every other issue, too.In the end, it's not really about racial justice, it's about class prejudice and liberal hypocrisy. And this is not just a southern problem.For example, some years ago, there was a deplorable racial murder in Bensonhurst, an Italian section of Brooklyn. And famed ""liberal"" columnist Anna Quindlen (who is half Italian) wrote a very frosty column, essentially dismissing the entire neighborhood (the entire class) as ignorant Goombahs who should all be in jail. Evidently when you go to college and move to Manhattan you become one of the good guys. And it doesn't matter whether you send your kids to exclusive private schools and associate only with affluent whites -- at least you don't hunt black children from pickup trucks or club people with baseball bats. Because that's racism, and racism is bad.But class privilege, self-congratulation and hypocrisy are okay.",A Time to Kill
59,nicholls_les,Don;t miss the point of this film,10,10 March 2009,"This is a truly excellent film that tells a difficult story. Samuel L Jackson, Sandra Bullock and Matthew McConaughey and in fact everyone in this film does an excellent and very believable job. However I think many miss the main point of this film, although it deals with sickening acts motivated by racism and the subsequent actions of those in authority who seem to believe that blacks should not be treated as well as whites, the main point that comes through in the end is that it really shouldn't matter what colour you are. We are all just people and the little girl was a little girl regardless of colour. It shows how ingrained racism can be and it it a sober thought that despite America electing it's first black president the people who have these feelings won't go away over night. There are few films that can get to me and this one certainly did. I have watched it many times and each time it gets to me.",A Time to Kill
60,policy134,You still get a lump in your throat during that summation,8,13 December 2010,"First rate cast, a compelling and quite disturbing story and Kevin Spacey at his most cool. What a movie! Okay, the story is not a very cute one and the topic of racism vs liberalism isn't really that counterbalanced when you look at the number of white people who have huge roles vs the black people with mere walk-ons.Except for Charles S. Dutton and of course Samuel L. Jackson, the black people are essentially extras. But remember, this isn't a story about a black man who kills 2 people and is accused of murder. It's about the white lawyer who is warned that the black man is going to kill someone and then let him do it.And for that purpose the movie works. We see lots of beautiful white people: Ashley Judd, Sandra Bullock and Matthew McConaughey. We see lots and lots of ugly white people or rather somewhat attractive white actors disguised as ugly white people.It's like the line in the movie: ""Imagine her as white"", except imagine if Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd were black? Quite a different movie and no matter how liberal Hollywood gets, we will still see a movie like The Color Purple and Harlem Nights as different because the actors were black. Take that! And still, I do recommend this film. The actors are awesome and no matter how cynical or jaded you are, you still can't help but feel something during that closing argument. Imagine Don Cheadle delivering it!",A Time to Kill
61,jhaggardjr,Brilliant,10,29 December 2000,"""A Time to Kill"" is far and away the best movie (so far) based on a John Grisham novel. This movie is one of the most powerful, gripping dramas that I've ever seen. It's amazing of how I was pulled into this film right from the start and it held my attention all the way to the end. I was never bored for one second. ""A Time to Kill"" is about rape, murder, and revenge in a small town in Mississippi. It all starts when a 10-year-old black girl is brutally raped and beaten by two white guys. They are immediately arrested for the crime. While on their way to the hearing, the girl's father takes his frustrations out on the two guys by shooting and killing them in cold blood. After being arrested himself, the father (Samuel L. Jackson) asks a young, inexperienced lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) to represent him, which he accepts. During the trial the lawyer, his co-workers, and his family receive serious threats from the Klu Klux Klan, who want to see the Jackson character found guilty (one of the members of the KKK is the brother of one of the two guys killed). For the lawyer and his defendent, trying to get off not guilty will be a tough challenge as the plaintiff is a tough-as-nails attorney (Kevin Spacey) who is smart and experienced. So the young lawyer gets some assistance from a Boston based law student (Sandra Bullock), who provides interesting information for him that proves to be helpful. ""A Time to Kill"" has solid directing by Joel Schumacher, and brilliant acting by an outstanding cast. McConaughey, Jackson, Bullock, and Spacey all give excellent performances, as do the other supporting players which include Brenda Fricker, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Patrick McGoohan, Donald and Kiefer Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Chris Cooper, Joe Seneca, and (in an unbilled part) M. Emmet Walsh. ""A Time to Kill"" is a great movie. One of the best movies of 1996.**** (out of four)",A Time to Kill
62,PeachHamBeach,Great and troubling movie that I have certain issues with...,10,26 March 2009,"A TIME TO KILL is no doubt a very entertaining movie, with a first-rate A list cast, great characters, and of course, hot topics for debate.The issues I have with it are issues I've always had with it, even when I was younger and really into these A-LIST kind of movies.My biggest issue: Carl Lee Hailey. Samuel L. Jackson did a supreme performance and he is one of the greatest actors ever...ever. But I have problems with his character. Believe me, I hate rapists. I hate white supremacist rednecks too. I hate crimes against children and women. Indeed, those 2 pieces of filth might just have gotten off with a slap on the wrist for their deplorable crime. They should have been called murderers anyway, because they not only tried to kill Tanya, they killed her unborn children, or what would have been. To call them animals would insult animals. They were just plain pieces of filth.The reason I have a problem with Carl Lee is that the killings of those pieces of filth were all about him, not his daughter. He should have stopped to think: My daughter has been raped, and she's going to need me at HOME not sitting in some jail with the chance of death row. I know I'm going to get flack for this, but Carl Lee didn't consider his daughter before himself. He just acted on his rage. Sure those pieces of filth deserved to die, and to burn in hell, but Carl Lee was thinking more of himself than his child. That's just the way I feel about it. Instead of seeing Tanya as in individual who needed his love and support while she recovered from horrible physical and psychological injuries, Carl Lee did what I believe a lot of people do, he saw her as something of HIS. HIS daughter. ""You raped MY baby!"" I'm not questioning that Carl Lee loves his child, but does he see her as a person, or just an extention of HIM? Did killing those 2 redneck rapists reverse the damage done to Tanya? No, they only caused more pain.""Say that when you lose a child of your own!"" you say, but see? There you go. A child of my OWN. Not an individual, but something of MINE. If I take the time to think about what is really going to be best for the child, I won't be killing 2 rednecks who aren't worth the heartache that will follow. Those 2 monsters weren't worth Tanya nearly losing her father to the gas chamber, nor the death of Bud, nor Jake's house being burnt down and his family terrorized, nor Ro-Ark nearly being murdered.At times, I want to believe this film has a lot of one dimensional characters, such as the ones played by Keifer Sutherland and Nicky Katt. Are there really such repugnant people in this world? Are people so hateful of blacks that they are like these 2? Unfortunately, though much progress has been made since the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement, many white people in the American South still believe in segregation, supremacy, and probably slavery if they could bring it back. They believe blacks are inferior and just ""don't count"". Some of the rednecks in the courtroom have looks on their faces like, ""So what if she was raped. She was black!"" And yet they want blood because 2 of their good ol' white boys were shot. It's absolutely astounding.The entire cast is terrific from Donald Sutherland as an old lush who used to be an excellent lawyer, to Charles Dutton as the town sheriff, to newcomer (then anyway) Matthew McConnaughey (sp?) as Jake Brigance, a young, inexperienced lawyer who takes on the impossible task of defending Carl Lee, but whose reasonings I have a problem with just like I have with Carl Lee's. McConnaughey's performance always has me in tears by the end of the movie.Carl Lee Hailey? Not a murderer. A hero? Perhaps, though I believe Tanya is the bigger hero in this film, the one to look to for real inspiration.Am I glad Carl Lee shot those 2 pieces of filth? I'd be lying if I said no, or that I wasn't glad to see them get sprayed with bullets.Was it the best thing to do? Another thing to ponder altogther That might be what makes it such a good movie to me.",A Time to Kill
63,Idocamstuf,Just barely gets by,6,2 June 2003,"Knowing that this film got pretty mixed reviews, it was difficult to know what to expect.

64,pfgpowell-1,"Clichéd, formulaic claptrap and an insult to blacks",3,10 March 2014,"On the face of it A Time To Kill is the story of justice done, irrespective of race or ethnicity. Actually, it's nothing of the sort: it's just another piece of sentimental feelgood Hollywood schlock which is, at heart not just dishonest but quite immoral.When Samuel Jackson's hardworking black mill worker guns down in cold blood the two white trash low-lifes who, high on dope and booze, raped, tortured and tried to murder his ten-year-old daughter, we are meant to cheer. The trouble is, the film tells us, that because of latent Deep Southern racism, those two white men would most likely have walked out of court free men when they were brought to trial. So at least the murders ensured that 'justice was done'.Enter Mathew McConaughey's young, reasonably idealistic young lawyer who takes on the case of trying to defend Jackson because he, too, has a young daughter, and he, too, could see himself doing exactly the same to anyone who did her harm. McConaughey's first and only strategy is to argue that Jackson was temporarily insane when he gunned down the two white trash (in the courthouse in front of quite a crowd), but he comes unstuck when Kevin Spacey's ruthlessly ambitious district attorney manages to dig up dirt on the psychiatrist the defence puts on the stand and discredits his testimony.But anyway, the jury – white to a man and woman - were anxious to get home, and unbeknown to everyone – except us, the viewer, who listens in as they plot – determine to find Jackson guilty come what may and get back to their white picket fences.However, justice – or rather Tinseltown's fake take on justice – prevails, and a last-minute summation by our idealistic young lawyer wins the day, the jury, the white biased judge and even the cynically ambitious DA. Jackson walks free, even though he had – and had admitted he had -murdered two men in cold blood. Well, as we say in my neck of the woods, pass the sickbag.Just before starting to write this review, I looked up the statistics of blacks banged up in US jails. It seems that although they make up just around 13pc of the US population, they make up a staggering 40pc of prison inmates. I bet they wish they had a handful of cynical Hollywood producers and director Joel Schumacher around to ensure their brush with the law gets a happy ending. As it is, they can dream on, it ain't going to happen. Oh, and another statistic: with 2.1 million of its citizens banged up in jail, the US has a higher proportion of its citizens behind bars than any other country in the world. It makes the US proud boast of being 'the land of the free' look rather threadbare.The film's cockeyed view of what justice is and how the lot of the black man can apparently be ameliorated in just under ten minutes with the help of a good script and a couple of actors is not its only fault.At the end of the day and despite high production values – Kevin Spacey, Samuel Jackson, Mathew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock and Donald and Kiefer Sutherland don't come cheap – it is lazily and sloppily made. Every single character is at best two-dimensional and could have been played by anyone. Some characters are even, at the end of the day, redundant.We don't actually need either one of the Sutherlands to get the film moving. The entire film is shockingly formulaic, with the 'plot' so well-worn and hackneyed, you can get them four for a dollar down the market.Plot points are thrown in and forgotten – the Ku Klux Klan, long thought dead and gone, not only show themselves but burn down a house and hold a public demonstration in the streets – turn up but play little further part in the proceedings, even though the town of Canton where it all takes place, is flooded with National Guard armed to the teeth.There's a curious sub-plot where the idealistic lawyer almost – almost – has an affair with Sandra Bullock's brainy law intern even though he loves his wife and his family deeply. And Donald Sutherland is totally redundant. All he does is, unconvincingly, play a one-time hell of a lawyer who is now disbarred and an alcoholic. He is consulted once or twice by the young idealist, and despite once vowing never to enter a courtroom again – don't you know it – does so to witness the idealist rousing summation. Clichéd claptrap.The users rating of this at the time of writing is 7.4: that mystifies me. You will have seen this film, whether in the cinema or on TV, several hundred times before. And if you like this kind of schlock, don't worry – it follows its inevitable path to the letter and you won't be disappointed.Me, I didn't like it at all, and only watched it to the end knowing that its dishonesty irritated me so much that I would be writing a review and felt I had to see the whole film. This is not good film-making in the slightest. It is Friday night fodder. Even the film's title is gratuitous rubbish: what does it mean? What does it refer to?",A Time to Kill

However, it works well, and that's what it matters; It's also what 'A Time to Kill' is trying to say. However law and authority play out, they are different from 'justice'. Justice is measured in people's eyes, and unless people realize that raping a 10-year-old girl is freaking disgusting, immoral, inhumane whether she is white or black, law will not be applied same to all the people regardless of people. It is a sad ending because 'Now, imagine she's white' can change the results despite all the efforts and intellects presented by defendant's side.

Reading more than two or maybe three of his books is almost unnecessary, for once you know the basic plot of the others, you can work out pretty much how they work.

69,tastyhotdogs,Solid,8,26 January 2007,"I re watched this the other night on a slow TV night ""A Time To Kill"" is already 11 years old, which you realize pretty quickly when you see Matthew McConaughey is playing a lead role in a serious movie. Not only that, but he's pretty much the glue holding the whole movie together, and being fair, he does it really well. Not sure what he did after this to send his career down the toilet, but he showed here he's got some skills, especially reflected in his final summation, one of the greatest 10 movie scenes of all-time.The movie is about a father (Jackson), who takes justice into his own hands after a couple of hillbillies rape his 10 year old daughter. What was supposed to be the trial of these two villains becomes the trial of a father who sought, and executed, revenge. Complicating the case is that it's in the deep south, in a town where there is a brewing underbelly of white supremacists who don't want to see a black man go free. The further the case goes, the bigger the rise of the white supremacists, culminating in the comeback of the KKK (probably the most annoying part of the movie and a storyline they didn't need to go for). Will Matthew McConaughey be able to free Samuel L Jackson, or will racism win? A great story, very well executed by one of the strongest casts in memory. You've got your Matthew McConaughey's and your Samuel L Jackson's, but you've also got your Sandra Bullock's, your Ashley Judd's, your Kiefer Sutherland's (in the post ""Young Guns 2"", pre ""24"" period),your Donald Sutherland's, your Kevin Spacey's plus a stack of ""hey it's that guy's"".Thought provoking and well worth seeing.",A Time to Kill
70,mmunier,a grand black and white story,8,15 March 2007,"I have seen ""a time to kill"" a fair while ago, for the second time. Today I was thinking of it and came here to refresh my memory about it. Till then my memory of it was just like in my summary. Then reading through the comments it came back clearer. Some felt that the lead actor gave a below par performance, many thought that all were great and I join that side. I'm fairly sensitive to racist situation. despite remembering that I'm a racist too. I had to work on it to believe it but there you are, against all my good intentions I can't do better than this. I only hope being aware of it makes me a better person. It would be nice to be able to switch such ingrown feelings like one switches the light on. However any person with some desire for a little of honesty would admit it's not so. I'm not too worried about the outcome of the story and don't have this purity of soul to share these ideals for justice that will defend any villain, and punish every crime. To me justice is what is done about a case not how it's done. I wish that we see thing with more simplicity. I'm not sure either if I agree with the idea that it's better to let go ten guilty rather than being wrong with an innocent. War, natural disaster and diseases take innocents all the time. And yes error is human and error takes a lot of lives in many fields. Thus as long as justice has done all and the best it can. I think I'd be happy with this. I'm comfortable with the ending even if I understand that it creates precedent. A time to kill, for me was not a waste of time.",A Time to Kill

The McConaughey speech at the end , was very week. By that time, the Director Joel Schmacher must have thought he had his audience in the palm of his hand, so not much thought was put into the most important part of the movie. It is a movie that sets out to say a lot, yet in the end ...we know things wont change in the U. S. of A. I felt i had watched this type of manipulative film many times (and i have)...we all have. The year it is portraying really does not matter. What matters is ...does anyone believe this ? And if you do, you must ask yourself.....WHY..??

73,fimimix,..most people missed the point the movie is not present-day..,10,1 May 2006,"I had to stop reading the commentaries, because some people thought they were attorneys and rambled-on about injustice. My Friends, in the era this film is about, none of the story would be unusual. There are prejudices much worse even now - I was amazed that one person actually compared this wonderful film to ""Crash"": give the world a break!! If ""Crash""...Ugh!...proved anything, is was to reassure EVERYONE racism is still America's cancer.I am from Biloxi, Mississippi - along the Gulf Coast. That city has always been a melting-pot, so many different races live together. In my youth, it was Czechs and other European races. Today, can you believe, it is Vietnamese ! The city has also always been a tourist-area, and always had some form of gambling before it became The Las Vegas of the South - perhaps that has tempered the people there from the state's interior's citizens. Canton - during the '60s - would have been just as it is portrayed in this film.Because of the many TV-courtroom sitcoms, etc., today's population would wonder why there was no strongly-worded assurance the district attorney planned ""to appeal"". What? We are not talking about modern-day justice in this film - Shamefully, this is Mississippi at its worst, and I know about that. We didn't have this kind of racism in Biloxi then, perhaps because African-Americans ""stayed in their place"", a shameful statement if there ever were one. All the foreigners and citizens of other states who are not aware of those days - how can you comment on the film, except to give a critique ? Like many of the people who wrote commentaries, I can watch this film once-a-month. ALL of the cast gave a superb performance; the story did not drag; the places that were filmed were true-to-life; to some folk's surprise, there ARE people who live in the state who do not speak like idiots: people think I'm English!; Mathew Mc was astounding and Sandra Bullock's performance was exactly as it should have been, as an activist ""little rich girl""; Southern gave a true performance of a alcoholic lawyer; Sam Jackson was masterful and expressed the difference in being ""white"" and ""black""; Kevin Stacy's portrayal of a Southern lawyer with all the connections, right on; I can think of no one who wasn't brilliantly cast.Missed by many people who made comments, this film is a statement that today we are brutally MEAN to one another: ""Crash"" re-states this fact, although it is not nearly as poetic. Do I own this film? You betcha!! I'll most likely have to buy another, and it will be money well-spent. Grishom knows how to get our attention, and ""A Time to Kill"" clearly demonstrates all who were involved in its making were determined to keep his story pure. Wake-up, People - many parts of our world are not pretty today......",A Time to Kill
74,Aly200,"Haunting, Poignant and Tense",8,27 August 2017,"From bestselling author John Grisham comes this taut and suspenseful thriller about an African-American man on trial for killing his ten year old daughter's rapists and the crisis of faith his inexperienced Caucasian lawyer must deal with as he fights for his client's life.With an all star cast, the charge is lead by Matthew McConaughey as the inexperienced Jake Brigance, a protégé of a famed but since disbarred legal figure in his community. McConaughey's Jake is naïve, arrogant and eager for his chance to participate in a murder trial to prove his metal. However each encounter with his client, Carl Lee Haley (a perfectly cast Samuel L. Jackson), chips away at Jake's foolish ideals as he must grow from a wannabe bigwig to a man humbled by what he uncovers as the trial when Jake realizes that a similar experience could befall his own young daughter. Jake even contends with the temptation of unfaithfulness by the allure of Sandra Bullock's intelligent Ellen Roark, but as Jake begins to find where his truths lie he finds himself unable to forfeit his marriage as he sees how much he really cares for the people around him. The momentous breakthrough has to be the final summation that Brigance gives to the jury as he describes the torment that Tonya Haley endured (watching McConaughey try to resist an emotional breakdown as he delivers the address is one of the most intense) and asks the all-white jury to imagine if Tonya were the same race.The performances from Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd also rise to occasion especially for Jackson's Carl Lee as he embodies any father who would want to avenge a horrid wrong done to his child. It's Carl who humbles his naïve attorney and forces him to see the differences between the two of them; Jake being a privileged white attorney who can easily get sympathy while Carl is a black machine worker that killed two white men which Carl knows (and Jake soon realizes) is what could end up costing him his freedom or life. Bullock as Ellen Roark is used sparingly, but she becomes a vital member of Jake's legal arsenal as Ellen's vast knowledge helps educate Jake in how he proceeds with his defense of Carl Lee. Ellen also provides a solace for Jake when his marriage becomes rocky due to his decision to defend Carl leads to numerous attempts to harm them, but in the end Ellen knows that Jake won't risk his family to be with as her near-death experience reminds him of the human frailty in the world. And to briefly touch on Ashley Judd as the put-upon Mrs. Brigance, she brings a real depth to her performance as the actress balances between a woman who respects her husband's profession, but is afraid of the public repercussions though she ultimately sticks by her husband in a touching scene.Grisham himself praised the film's faithfulness to his novel and the strong casting. Critics also praised the film's handling of such controversial subjects though many were still unsettled by the material. Do keep some tissues handy cause you may need them.",A Time to Kill

76,David_Frames,SLJ and the KKK,6,27 February 2006,"A bit of a plodding, just on the right side of sanctimonious Grisham flick in which Samuel L. Jackson plays a poor black southern man who blows away the redneck pond scum that raped his ten year old causing sometime friend Matthew ""I live on the hill"" Macognahoghanogna to take his case against a backdrop of racial hatred, intimidation and family breakdown etc... There are no shocks in this one, you've seen it many a time but if you like 'em efficient, workmanlike and slick then there's no reason to think you won't lap up the intricately manufactured tension. Will MM lose his lovely blonde Ayran family? Will he sleep with the sarcastic Bullock? Can he possibly beat the bigots and convince a jury of southern white folks to acquit SLJ? Will Donald Sutherland be redeemed through his young protégé? Well what do you think? You can't fault the cast who all put at least 10p in the metre and deliver their contribution with just enough lift to make it all gel. An appreciative, if unenthusiastic nod must go to Kiefer Sutherland who makes a very good simpleton and an even better racist and the MM express is a likable enough lead. The big issues, namely colourblind justice and southern racism aren't explored so much as signposted but with Joel Schumacher at the helm this was never going to be Mississipi Burning, more Blackman and Robin. To be fair to him he does keep it reasonably tight and given its terrifyingly predictable trajectory there still is a hint of anticipation when MM gets to his feet for his make or break summation.In the end we discover that we're all the same really and that the South is full of backward racists. Not huge revelations you might think but we did get to see SB tied to a poll and someone take a shot at fair haired Matthew so it wasn't a waste of time after all.",A Time to Kill

He understandably wants nothing more then to see them both die.But when he learns that there's a good chance that they might get off scot free he takes matters into his own hands. Unfortunately his vigilantism leads to his own trial where he faces murder charges and finds himself being represented by a young but genius attorney who gets him acquitted of the crime.This was the right verdict in my opinion.

A Time To Kill is the exception that confirms the rule. It reaches levels of brilliance no other Grisham film ever has; except for Runaway Jury. I do not say this lightly as I am a huge The Firm fan. Grisham films have a tendency of well...disappoint. They are (almost) all great but not as great as they should be (coming from Grisham).A Time To Kill is indeed the exception. I rather dislike the title, as it comes across as cliché but other than that there are few things I would want to change in this movie. The whole cast is almost literally on fire, Matthew McConnaughy in particular deserves praise. I've always considered him a B-actor but he's truly remarkable as Jake Tyler Brigance. He brings the character to live splendidly. Sam L. Jackson plays another angry black man, and I cant' help but feel he's being type casted an awful lot.

McConaughey's summation is somewhere between moving and maudlin. I know I'm being ""played."" Even then I found it somewhat moving. But the substance of it and the movie could have been more insightful.And then comes the basic question---does an injured member of a family have the right to execute people known to have done some injury to his family. Emotionally, you want to say yes. But if we are a nation of laws, and that has become more doubtful lately, then must we not abide by them in order to preserve our own rights? The insanity defense was actually ludicrous. He planned the murder. He even discussed it in advance.We are repulsed when an all white jury finds a white man innocent of killing a black man who did some egregious wrong to his family. But in this movie we are asked to think that it's acceptable to have a white jury find a black man innocent of killing two white men when his daughter is horribly raped. But the defense asks the jury to imagine what would be fair retribution if the little girl had been white. So is their finding of him innocent a result of sophistry or judicial progression?",A Time to Kill

84,Lupercali,Hamfisted and disappointing,5,21 March 2005,"Somehow I missed this movie when it was released, and I rented it recently from an online DVD store without knowing how old it was. I quickly surmised that it was mid 90's, but what I was startled at right from the outset was how incredibly DATED it seemed: the attitudes portrayed, the liberal guilt, and its attempted resolution through the courtroom heroics of the protagonist. This might have been a groundbreaking film a couple of decades earlier, but I guess the producers didn't notice we already have 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Twelve Angry Men' and umpteen other such things. Then it hit me, why all this incredibly old-fashioned moralising... but I'll get to that in a minute.This alone may not have sunk the film, but lo, the movie suffers from the attack of every screen writing cliché in Hollywood. I mean, it's so predictable that I was actually able to hold my left hand in the air and let it fall at the exact moment that Matthew McConaughey's supposedly dead dog runs out of the bushes. Add to that the utter over-the-topness of it. We've got the Klux Klux Klan marching down the road outside the court in broad daylight for Heaven's sake, and the National Guard running about going 'Hut! Hut! Hut!', and armoured vehicles - in one scene the army has machine guns trained on the (completely inert) crowd outside the court. Heaven forbid they should just cordon off the area if they were expecting trouble. I'm sorry, but I actually laughed at a couple of these moments.We've got a bunch of fine actors, almost none of whom are given anything to act with. Good evidence of this is that Kiefer Sutherland was in a movie with both his father and Kevin Spacey, and managed not to look conspicuously inferior. I don't think this was due to any great effort on KS's part. More that his character was about as one-dimensional as theirs.I could have fun just listing the absurdities in this movie. Oh, and the plot-holes. Part of the reason we're supposed to accept that the revenge killing was justifiable in this case, is that one of the perps had signed a confession. If this was so, why was everybody expecting him to walk free the day he went into court? And did Morgan Freeman's character _know_ about this confession (this is the defense of the revenge killing; that the killer absolutely _knows_ the accused to be guilty.) And oh, yes, it just slipped the defense team's attention that their star psychiatrist was a convicted statutory rapist? Good God.Now, if all of that isn't bad enough, we have the fact that the film is actually pretty offensive. We're supposed to come away from this feeling that this vigilante revenge killing was justified; either that or presumably get in our pickup with the Union flag on it and drive off swigging a bottle of Jack Daniels. Well, pardon me: I'm opposed to the death penalty, AND I would probably have done the same thing Freeman's characer did, like most guys would in that situation when they're half out of their minds, but this film did not convince me that I would have been right in so doing, and I don't like having my intelligence insulted by the supposition that I can't work it out for myself.McConaughey tells the jury to imagine that the rape victim was white. The prosecuting attorney might have been given the opportunity to ask them to imagine if the two men Freeman shot had turned out to be innocent. Because ultimately that's what's on trial here: not this specific case, but the whole notion of the death penalty, whether dispensed by the courts or by a vigilante.Oh yeah. The Magistrate is Judge Noose. That has to be either one of the worst attempts at humour in history, or the worst attempt at symbolism in history. I forgot about that.Anyway, earlier I said I was baffled by why the film seemed so dated, so concerned with the race issue. Why Freeman's character could say something as dumb to his lawyer on the last day of the trial as ""America is a war. You're on the other side."" Then I remembered, this was only a few years after the Rodney King bashing and the LA riots. A film very much of its time, but that doesn't excuse how terribly ham-fisted and clichéd it is.I'm giving it 5 simply because the production values were decent, the actors did what they could with a bad script, and there were actually two or three decent scenes (Bullock and McConaughey in the café arguing over the death penalty was one of the film's few good moments). But 5 is my bare minimum for a big budget modern movie simply going through the motions. This has nothing to lift it any higher, and I'm probably being a bit kind to it.I suppose I should add that I live on an island halfway to Antarctica, so don't really have any overwhelming racial or political investment in the subject matter. It was just a stupid film. It would have been stupid if it had presented the opposite point of view as ineptly.I find this movie guilty of being ridiculous, obnoxious, predictable, and occasionally funny.",A Time to Kill
85,brandon_lee420,One of the best lawyer films ever!,7,6 February 2010,"A Time To Kill seemed to me like a movie that would bore me out of my mind and it would probably get a five or lower star from me. Happily, the movie turned out to be a powerful, top-notch, entertaining, and truthful thriller. You can hardly expect that from Hollywood films nowadays and that is a shame because they don't make classics any more, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption, and I am sure that everyone would disagree with me when I say that Avatar is nothing compared to the 1900s films. A film with such a boring story turned out to be a film that would be remembered forever and that is all thanks to Joel Schumacher and his crew. Joel Schumacher has directed entertaining films such as The Lost Boys, Flatliners, The Client, The Number 23, and Phone Booth and A Time To Kill ascended up my ladder faster than a cheetah could kill a cockroach. What a great director! Matthew McConaughey (Jake Brigance), the lawyer in this film who defends a black man, has given everyone his best performance to audiences everywhere and he truly looked like he had gotten into his part. Sandra Bullock plays the witty and sExy gal named Ellen Roark (Ro-Ark) who thinks that the death penalty should be used also offers help to defend the black man. Kevin Spacey looked good on screen and his villain-kind-of-role made me hate him. The real star of the show was Samuel L. Jackson! He portrayed a man whose daughter had been raped by two men and out of anger, he kills them, only to land in a battle between right and wrong. Samuel L. Jackson really looked like he was settled into his role and he, by far, gave the best performance in the film. The film is emotional at times but the end was more emotional than ever because it had tears in my eyes.(May contain some spoilers!!!!) In Canton, Mississippi, 10-year-old Tonya Hailey is viciously brutalized by two white racist rednecks -- James Louis ""Pete"" Willard and Billy Ray Cobb. Almost immediately after Tonya is found and rushed to a hospital, Pete and Billy Ray are found at a roadside bar, where they had been bragging about what they did to Tonya. Tonya's understandably distraught and enraged father, Carl Lee Hailey, remembers a case from a year ago, when four white men raped an African-American girl in a nearby town, and got acquitted. Carl is determined to not let that happen in this case. While deputy Dwayne Powell Looney is escorting Pete and Billy Ray up a flight of stairs to a court room, Carl emerges from the building's basement with an assault rifle, and he kills Pete and Billy Ray for what they did to Tonya. Carl is later arrested at his house by African-American sheriff Ozzie Walls, and Carl is scheduled to be placed on trial. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local African-American leaders to persuade Carl to choose some of their high-powered attorneys, Carl wants to be represented by his friend Jake Tyler Brigance, who has a wife named Carla and a daughter named Hannah. Presiding over the trial is white judge Omar Noose, and the prosecution attorney is Rufus Buckley, who would like nothing more than to win the case and swim in the publicity that a win would generate, because Rufus realizes that a murder conviction could help him gain higher office. Helping Jake on the case are his former law professor Lucien Wilbanks, fellow attorney Harry Rex Vonner, and law student Ellen Roark. Ellen has had experience with death penalty cases, and that's exactly what Rufus may be seeking. To start things off, Noose denies bail and denies Jake's petition for a change of venue. Carl has also been fired from his job. Billy Ray Cobb's brother Freddie Lee Cobb wants revenge on Carl, so Freddy gets the help of the Mississippi branch of the KKK, led by Mississippi grand dragon Stump Sisson. Carl's wife Gwen tells Carl that a doctor has said that because of Pete and Billy Ray, Tonya's reproductive organs are damaged enough to where she won't be able to have kids when she grows up. That night, a KKK member is found trying to plant a bomb under Jake's porch. Jake's secretary Ethel Twitty and her husband Bud are also attacked by the KKK. Still, Jake, Harry, Lucien, and Ellen continue to help Carl. On the day the trial begins, there is a riot outside the court building between the KKK and the area's African-American residents, and Stump Sisson is killed by a molotov cocktail that was dropped from a roof by one of Carl's sons, who was not seen dropping it. Freddy and the KKK start burning crosses throughout Canton, and one of the crosses burns Jake's house down while Jake and his family are not home. As a result, the National Guard is called to Canton to keep the peace during the trial. But Freddy is not about to let that stop him. While Freddy continues his efforts to get revenge on Carl for Billy Ray's death, Carl's attorneys put everything they've got into Carl's defense. (End of Spoilers!!!!)The great thing about this film is that it doesn't hide the coarse language, not at all. Throughout the whole film you will hear the word f*ck, semen, raped, and a lot other more but these words are the most vile. The setting was great as well for a film like this since racism was still at large and it made the film look good. The Ku Klux Klan were a bunch of weirdos that wore masks and hated black people. They were unnecessary in my eyes. Donald And Kiefer Sutherland, father and son in real life, were similar and acted similar and even looked similar.",A Time to Kill

87,tmpj,A very taut racial thriller !,7,13 August 2010,"This one had me sitting on the edge of my seat. The 90s weren't as polite as the late 50s/ early 60s when we were riveted by ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", a book and film that author John Grisham credits as an influence to this story. Two ""Good Ol Boy"" racists go on a red-neck spree, disrespecting all things Black...men, women, and children. Their beer guzzling binge culminates in the rape and near murder of a 10 year old black girl. Samuel L Jackson plays her father...and he goes out for revenge, killing the two miscreants and seriously wounding a deputy sheriff in the process. The film there-after revolves around the very basic points : A. Can a Black man receive a fair trial even in the so-called ""New South"" after killing two white men...even though their crime was and is considered reprehensible by every decent human being? And B: Will the Black man receive competent legal representation and receive justice irrespective of his ""vigilante"" action which appears to many to be justified? What will be the fallout? Matt McConaughey's performance as the lawyer is slightly reminiscent of Gregory Peck in ""Mockingbird"". He has a moralistic reverence for the law, and endures the taunts of the townsfolk and his other encumbrances with fortitude. Sandra Bullock is convincing as the law student who wants to chime in and lend a hand for the experience. Don and Keifer Sutherland deliver solid support...the elder being a dis-barred lawyer who is ready with advice, the younger playing a racist Klansman out to get revenge for the two dead rednecks. The atmosphere hinges on the explosive as the racial tension builds, and it is a movie that is worth watching with a message worth pondering and remembering. See the film.",A Time to Kill

Great supporting roles from Ashley Judd and Kiefer Sutherland in this one too.",A Time to Kill
89,Mr_PCM,Gripping and uncomfortable - thanks to Sutherland jnr,8,15 April 2009,"Another day, another John Grisham adaptation, this time with quite the illustrious ensemble cast – Sandra Bullock, Samuel L Jackson, Kevin Spacey and Matthew McConaughey ably supported by Brenda Fricker, Charles S Dutton, Oliver Platt, Ashley Judd, Patrick McGoohan and Chris Cooper, as well as both Donald and Kiefer Sutherland. With Joel Schumacher sitting in the director's chair, a tale of racial tension in the deep south of the United States could prove more brash and inflammatory than anything which John Grisham might have intended. But Schumacher proves surprisingly adept at handling some sensitive material, producing a gripping and harrowing tale of racial hatred and injustice.Samuel L Jackson plays avenging father Carl Lee Hailey, who shoots dead two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter on the way to their trial, fearing that justice will only be done if he takes it into his own hands. Now McConaughey's Jake Brigance (Hailey's attorney) must find a way to defend him against ruthless prosecutor Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey – again excellent as an attorney after a superb performance as Clarence Darrow, but this time as a by any means necessary prosecutor rather than white knight defender). Meanwhile racial hatred is stirred up by the re-emergence of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Kiefer Sutherland's vicious portrayal of one of the murdered's brother. . As tension rises, viewing becomes more and more discomforting as some unfortunate truths are shown of everyday life in the deep south of the USA. What makes for an even more interesting story is the fact that there is some corruption and racial hatred on both sides of the colour divide. Faint shades of To Kill a Mockingbird are apparent from the outset, with many of the town expressing their opinion, and prejudices running riot, as well as the building up to the trial all the while the defending attorney being pressured and intimidated to withdraw – only with a lot more hostility and violence, on both sides. The guilt of the defendant becomes somewhat irrelevant as the violence increases.However, Jake Brigance is no Atticus Finch, and Matthew McConaughey is certainly no Gregory Peck. He is rather dislikeable as the crusading lawyer trying to defend Jackson's avenging father. Jackson himself meanwhile gives an atypically very understated performance, eliciting neither too much sympathy or hatred – he is just an ordinary man who did what he did for his daughter. Spacey is as usual excellent, but the film is stolen by Kiefer Sutherland's tremendously sinister performance as the bigoted, grief-stricken, borderline-psychotic redneck who revives the Ku Klux Klan in the area in response to his brother's killing. He is a truly hateable avenger and in this film he truly steps out of his illustrious father's shadow.As the action continually shifts from the courtroom to the town and backwater houses, the tension continues to build. Carl Lee Hailey did kill the two men who raped and tried to murder his daughter, of that there is no question. What the story asks is not what constitutes justifiable killing, but what could drive a man to such an action? Similar to films such as Mississippi's Burning and To Kill a Mockingbird, A Time To Kill's theme of racial tension and hatred proves that man has a long way to go before he is truly enlightened, but that while there are men who are willing to disregard and even fight against injustice, there is still reason for optimism and hope.While the film does become quite harrowing and even uncomfortable to view in places, it is still a tale you cannot take your eyes off, and Joel Schumacher has done well to not go over-the-top as he is prone to do in many of his films, but rather lets the subject matter tell its own story. While not all the performances may be Oscar-worthy, the story more than makes up for this.",A Time to Kill
90,Danimal-7,"Ham-handed, simplistic, but not completely worthless",5,5 October 1999,"I read Grisham's novel before I saw the movie.  Both novel and movie are severely flawed; what is interesting is how *differently* they are flawed.The plot of A TIME TO KILL is simple.  Two vile white thugs brutally rape and try to murder a little black girl near a small Mississippi town.  They are caught, but before they can be tried, the girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) guns them down on the courthouse steps, accidentally wounding a white deputy in the process.  Hailey hires attorney Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) to defend him; Brigance is put through the standard wringer of difficult relations with his client, threats against his family and home, and a judicial deck that is stacked against him.The chief flaw of Grisham's original novel is that it has no sympathetic characters; even Hailey ends up looking cowardly and dishonest.  The chief flaw of the movie is that the heroes are too perfect.  Even Oliver Platt's character never does anything really despicable.  Grisham's original novel realistically portrays lawyering as a profession that crushes idealism mercilessly, but the movie shows Brigance as a starry-eyed sentimentalist out to ""save the world one case at a time.""The best part of Schumacher's A TIME TO KILL is Samuel L. Jackson's performance.  While Grisham's Hailey seems to kill the rapists just because he thinks he can get away with it, Jackson makes it clear that he wants these two men dead even if it means he will be convicted or even executed for it.  Nothing less will satisfy him, his pain and rage are so great.  He is also pleasingly intelligent, another trait lacking in Grisham's Hailey, as is shown when he out-manipulates some NAACP characters who are trying to manipulate him.  I shared, and I think most viewers could share, Jackson's rage in the line, ""Yes, they deserved to die, and I hope they burn in Hell!""There is no question that, according to clearly defined legal standards, Hailey is guilty of murder.  Brigance's insanity defense is designed to give the jury a legal excuse to acquit; neither Brigance nor anybody else believes that Hailey is or was actually nuts.  This is in no way unrealistic; juries can and do ignore the law and facts to suit their own feelings, as can be seen from the O.J. Simpson case, the Scottsboro case, and numerous cases of ""Texas self-defense"" (the popular term for the tendency of Texan juries to acquit men who murder their wives for infidelity).  I can honestly say that if I were on Hailey's jury, I would never have voted to convict him, regardless of whether the law required me to do so.  I could not live with Hailey's blood on my hands.But A TIME TO KILL steadily degenerates into a series of rah-rah crowd-pleasing scenes and go-get-'em speeches delivered by McConaughey and Donald Sutherland (Brigance's disbarred mentor).  A scene involving a dog dredges up bad memories from INDEPENDENCE DAY, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman's efforts to set up the triumph-against-the-odds scenario are so blatantly transparent that the movie ends up being laughable by the end. Sandra Bullock's character is even more uselessly tacked-on than Demi Moore's in A FEW GOOD MEN.The climax is one absurdity after another.  A criminal is suddenly caught despite the total absence of any evidence leading to him; Brigance's wife returns to him for no reason that didn't already apply.  Brigance gives a closing statement, in which he asks the jury to imagine that the victim of the rape was white.  What is the point of this argument?  To any decent person, raping a black girl is just as bad as raping a white one.  If the jury somehow felt that this monstrous crime was justifiable because the victim was black, how would that despicable attitude be changed by Brigance exhorting them to imagine that she were white?Jackson has a speech at the end which essentially boils down to accusing Brigance of being a racist, because he doesn't come over to Hailey's neighborhood and visit.  I have a serious problem with this line of thinking; for people to visit each other's neighborhoods because of their race rather than because of their individual qualities would take the country no closer to Martin Luther King's dream of judging people by their character rather than their skin color.  But supposing Hailey has a valid point, the movie's answer to it, where Brigance's family does come over to visit Hailey's amid much pompous drum-beating, smacks of pure condescension rather than genuine neighborliness.The lawyerly realism of Grisham's novel is not completely lost; the emphasis on jury-selection tactics mostly survives into the movie.  There is a good scene where one of the State's star witnesses turns out not to be as helpful as the prosecutor had hoped.The acting is good.  Jackson, as described above, is mesmerizing.  Matthew McConaughey is not dazzling, but is sincere.  Kevin Spacey does a superb job as the bloodthirsty prosecutor.  Patrick McGoohan's voice cannot be plausibly disguised as Southern, and he appears to phone in his performance. Kiefer Sutherland delivers his patented psycho performance, which he does about as well as usual.  Racism is an ugly thing with ugly consequences; it is ill treated by Goldsman's treacle.  Say what you will about MISSISSIPPI BURNING, but there was nothing sugar-coated about Parker's movie.  And of course A TIME TO KILL doesn't even approach TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  The most interesting parallel to Schumacher's work is the TV movie OUTRAGE!, whose theme was identical except that the rapist was black and the outraged father white, and that the father killed the rapist only after he had been set free.  The conclusions reached were otherwise exactly the same as in A TIME TO KILL.Rating: ** out of ****.",A Time to Kill
91,Mario64,I wanted to like it but I couldn't.,6,26 July 2001,"Okay here's the good: 2 good performances by the main characters who you cared about, court drama which a lot of the time was effective, and other entertaining elements. Still the movie fails to quite deliver, and instead of be rightous it ends up just trying to excuse vengence. For every effective courtroom scene you see, there's another that makes you cringe. I liked most performances, but this is obviously one of the worst roles Sandra Bullock has ever taken. Outside the courtroom most was okay, although there were one to many scenes with the KKK without even a true reason for them to be involved (This isn't the first time a black man who was defended by a white man in Alabama had a chance for an aquital). This movie is also full of obvious stereotypes. When I see a courtroom drama I want a movie that makes me care for the character charged, which this movie succeeds in, but I also want to believe it's rightous, and no one can convince me that it is justifiable to kill someone who raped your daughter. Hayley doesn't deserve to die or even get life in prison, but I believe he should get some punishment for what he did. I wanted to like the movie for the basic reasons, good performances, good drama, intersting aspects. Still I can't get by the overall concept. I give this movie a 5 out of 10.",A Time to Kill

94,segacs,Contrived and heavy-handed,4,26 August 2007,"A Time To Kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one that didn't skyrocket him to fame. (That would be accomplished by ""The Firm""). That's why this movie didn't get made until much later, after Grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head. Unlike most of those, this book was actually about something. It had meat, it had weight, and it had heart.But it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie. Namely, ""A Time To Kill"" sets you up.Here we have a black man (Jackson), on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. We have an underdog lawyer (McConaughey) battling the big bad system to save his client. And oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with hooded KKK men burning crosses.In other words, we're supposed to sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. We're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. We're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people chanting ""Free Carl Lee"".But the racism issue is a smokescreen, and the whole thing is contrived. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. Yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he wasn't innocent. This would have been true no matter what his skin colour, or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else.And what's so heavy-handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn't be taken into people's own hands, then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood.This isn't the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. As a movie, A Time To Kill stays pretty faithful to the book, and the acting isn't half bad. But it played the hand it had been dealt, really. Even a good cast can't elevate bad source material.",A Time to Kill
95,rondine,Is the law always justice?,8,9 August 2005,"I just re-saw this movie after the first time years ago. Coming to IMDb I was surprised at the number of reviews that were negative. But like any controversial movie or topic, there are 2 polar extreme views from many different people.I will just briefly recap the story. A 10-year-old girl is on her way home from the grocery store. 2 young men brutally rape her, try to hang her (branch on the tree broke) then toss her 30 feet down to a river bottom & leave her to die there. She miraculously survives. Her father, Carl Lee Haley (Samuel L. Jackson) then decides to take the law into his own hands, after hearing they could either get off completely, or perhaps just serve 10 years & get out early on parole. After the shooting and killing, he seeks Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) to be his lawyer, since he previously helped his brother win a case.The movie makes many strong statements, perhaps some are overstated & I would agree there are times that it is pushing our collective buttons. But even so that shouldn't diminish the message. The real message of this movie isn't, vigilante killing is okay when the people ""deserve"" it. The real message of this movie is how do we, black and white, come together for real? The scene in Carl's jail cell where he tells Jake he is the enemy is a tough one to watch. Hard for a couple of reasons, one being that this man has just sacrificed his friends, family & home for this trial but his client is telling him HE's the enemy. And another because it's partly true. Being a person that believes we really & truly are equal, I can see what he means about saying, ""when you look at me you don't see a man, you see a BLACK man."" He says that by virtue of how he was raised, he sees him as different. I would say this is true for both of them. Having been married to someone from Mexico for 10 years, I was frequently the only ""white"" person at many gatherings. I learned to speak Spanish because I wanted to understand him, his friends and the culture. Mark this: understanding is the enemy of ignorance & racism. Only when we truly understand each other can we start to see without the eyes of prejudice. It is through empathy and compassion that understanding comes to us. And yes, it goes both ways. You can say to Carl Lee, ""have you ever brought YOUR daughter to my house to play?"" If there is to ever be a true unification, it must come from all sides equally. Blame is pointless- or as Dustin Hoffman said in the movie Papillon, ""blame is for God & small children."" One reviewer said the last line of the summation, ""now imagine she's white"" was offensive. Why? After all, if one is to be judged by a jury of their peers, how can you possibly say an all white jury knows what racism a southern man and his family have lived in fear of? And don't think that just because the bad people in this story are drawn so extremely that they don't exist. They do. There are people even today that think we should all be segregated and that one race is superior to another. But when it becomes personal and internalized, we all feel differently. And if we're being honest, none of us knows what we would do until something like that happens. By telling an all white jury to picture her as white, he is in effect saying, imagine she was your daughter, just as he had already done himself. If she was your daughter, wouldn't you want to kill those ""men""? The title of my review was one I also used for a movie called ""Billy Budd"" by Herman Melville. In that book/movie they ask the question, is the law always justice? That is also at the crux of this movie. Because how many of us have seen things in the news or papers about how someone does a horrible, heinous crime & yet receives what seems to be a light or unfair sentence? I agree with the prosecution, 10 years DOESN'T seem like enough time for attempted murder & rape. If the punishment really did fit the crime, would Carl Lee ever have felt he needed to take the law into his own hands? Probably not. And you can say, well, she's still alive so killing those men wasn't a just sentence. But what kind of scar have they left for that 10-year-old girl? Besides them making her infertile for life, the mental & emotional scars are HER life sentence. Shouldn't they receive at least the same? Yet our justice system would say 10 years is enough. Not to me.The performances by everyone are very well done. A terrific cast- down to even the supporting roles like Charles S. Dutton & Chris Cooper & Brenda Fricker & Donald (and Kiefer) Sutherland. I've even read here on IMDb that Matthew McConaughey's final summation was done in one take & yes, those are real tears. This is a tragic story & how someone can watch this & not be moved is beyond me. Just to set the record straight, I don't condone vigilante law. I believe the law is there for all of us & we must abide by it. But like any man-made institution, it is flawed and needs to be reformed. 10 years is a drop in the bucket compared to what they did.All around a good and thoughtful drama, I recommend this movie.",A Time to Kill

The actors are all great, from Matthew McConaughey & Sandra Bullock to Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey. The great part of A time to kill ( as of Dead Man Walking, too ), is that the film does not concentrate on the defendant or the prosecutor, but it concentrates on both. Maybe you hope that Samuel L. Jackson will be innocent, but you also know that this is not possible actually, since he has murdered two persons. My favorite part has to be the end summation of Matthew McConaughey. That is one of the greatest moment in film history I think. Good points : Story, ACTORS, CHARACTERS!!!, directing, ENDING, the summation, style, plotBad points : sometimes a bit too long, but just sometimesAll in all, I rate this movie 9.6/10 and recommend it to everyone.

100,longcooljolie,"Far-fetched and over the top, but good entertainment",7,26 January 2013,"Sometimes on IMDb, reviewers take the movies too seriously. They analyze the plot development and plausibility and compare on-screen characters with real life examples such as their next door neighbors or as in the case of ""A Time to Kill"" the people of the American South.The movie was based on a John Grisham novel of the same name, and this author has become famous for writing engrossing legal thrillers with memorable characters. ""A Time to Kill"" was one of his more sensational novels and tugs on the heart strings more than the rest, such as ""The Client"" or ""The Rainmaker.""Joel Schumacher directed, which gives the movie a popcorn entertainment, comic-book feel. After all, this is the same guy who directed the first two ""Men in Black"" movies and ""Batman Forever/Batman and Robin."" He manages to create some stirring images, such as when Carl Lee carries his bloodied daughter Tanya out the front door of the house and toward the ambulance, with the whole neighborhood looking on. Yes, we know that such a thing would never happen in real life (paramedics would have put her on a gurney in the living room) but the anguish and rage on Carl Lee's (Samuel L. Jackson) face packs a wallop.Charles S. Dutton shows the world he can be a tough hombre in his role as Sheriff Walls, an ex NFL player for the Rams. Another powerful scene shows him invading a bar to collect the two boys who have raped and ravaged Tanya. And after Carl Lee has murdered the two boys who have damaged his daughter, Sheriff Walls wearily leads a police motorcade to Carl Lee's house, where the only dialog is ""See you Gwen.""This movie contains the first major role for Matthew McConnaughey and an Oscar-worthy performance from Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley a DA with gubernatorial aspirations. Sparks fly from the screen because of the sexual chemistry between McConnaughey and Sandra Bullock, who plays Ellen Roark, an idealistic law student who volunteers to help with the case. Other surprises include a delightful turn from Oliver Platt as a caddish southern divorce lawyer and Jake Brigance's (McConnaughey) close friend.In other directorial hands, the movie could have been a simple courtroom drama, but Joel Schumacher emphasizes the subplot of the rise of the ""new"" Ku Klux Klan as a response to the murder of the two boys by a black man. The Klan violently clashes with the townsfolk, a whole National Guard battalion gets called in and ""A Time to Kill"" ends up filled with the most action ever for a John Grisham adaptation.Of course, the ending satisfies, too.

Her part was pathetically overwritten. If this was intentional to secure the interests of Ms. Bullock, then this is the movie's failing. I have nothing against Ms. Bullock as an actor, I have enjoyed her performances in numerous roles, however this happens to not be one of them. She is almost a comic book caricature of herself and it detracts from the impact of the story immensely. She professes to be a student of law, yet at many twists and turns she appears to be more knowledgeable of the law than her counterpart, the lead counselor for the defense (Matthew McConaughey), a bona fide licensed, practicing attorney. She also appears to possess a degree in medicine based on a scene where a simple ""band aid"" would seem counter-indicative considering the nature, source and force of the injury she simply 'dresses'.The closing argument (summation scene) is very emotional and should win this movie critical acclaim based on that merit alone, although this is somewhat jaded by some of the unrealistic, outlandish events which precede it and therefore merely lend toward relegating this film to cinematic mediocrity. It appears to be a bit melodramatic in some places and Donald Sutherland's role is weak, underdeveloped and unimpressive (pity because I really like Mr. Sutherland as an actor). All in all, it's definitely worth the watch for the compelling storyline, if nothing else, about racial injustice, but if you happen to miss it, you won't regret too much.

I've 'watched' this movie several times now and Patrick McGoohan's Judge, Omar Noose, is getting better with the watching. He's excellent in the earliest court scenes, revitalising an already flagging tale. His keynote scene is, of course in the outside world, on the balcony of his home, painting. That's when his judge's chirpy legal cynicism (as in realism), comes most clearly to the foreground. However, watching it again the other night I'm beginning to enjoy his later scenes in court as well, where he doesn't get to do that much apart from twitch and bang his gavel and growl threateningly at his noisy courtroom........ and sense the wind of change that blows his legal ship towards a more politically correct shore.He didn't get so many plaudits for this one as he did for 'Braveheart', but I'm starting to like both performances, as much as each other.",A Time to Kill

Samual L. Jackson is the father, whilst potentially career best turns form Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock steal the show. Oh and Kevin Spacey turns up but there's little point even mentioning his performance as he makes it all look so easy.The film follows the events of the rape, the rapist's murder and the trial which ensues. The K.K.K. takes sides, the N.C.A.A.P. wade in and death threats and bombs are flying through the swamps of the deep south. This is a very good thriller and one of the best Grisham adapts to date, but it's the question that drives it throughout; the question of is there ever a time to kill which keeps this 149 minute thriller burning, even when the plot falls foul of the clichés.Worth a watch every time and will certainly polarise options.",A Time to Kill
112,showgirl626,One of the best courtroom dramas you'll ever see,8,17 August 2006,"I can't believe this movie isn't in IMDb's top 250...this is a really good movie. It's totally believable (exception noted below), and you can see both sides of Carl Lee's plight. You know what he did was wrong, but you can TOTALLY empathize with why he did it. If I was in his shoes, I would be sorely tempted to do the very same thing.The acting in this movie is wonderful. The movie is paced well, each character is necessary and well-accounted for (their relationships with others and the story's explanation of such is justified)...what I really love about this movie is the fact that (even though this is one of those Nice-Guys-Finish-First movies) you're never 100% certain of the outcome.The only real issue I would raise with this movie is the relationship between the judge and the prosecuting attorney. Such blatant elbow-rubbing in modern times would surely force the judge to recuse himself.This is the movie that made me decide to take a second look at the literary works of John Grisham.

116,jwtrox08706,A Great and Well Casted Film Full of Statements About Society and the Justice System That are Still Applicable Today,10,17 May 2010,"No film has ever quite left me conflicted as this film has, and that is meant in a good way. Very few big budget Hollywood films can say they leave a lot of room for discussion after the screen goes black and the credits begin to roll. This film brings to life John Grisham's novel of the same title: ""A Time to Kill."" The film is also well done as far as imagery and performances from actors. The dialog by the characters is so well done.My personal reactions to the film are split. On the one hand, I am very sympathetic toward Carl Lee and his family. I can't say I wouldn't do the same if I had a young daughter like his that was raped by two drunken lowlifes. In many ways, I cannot say that what Carl Lee did was wrong. Those two boys that hurt his daughter deserved what they got, and the justice system in place where they committed this crime would have greatly and unfairly favored their case.At the same time, from a legal standpoint, as well as from a moral standpoint, I cannot condone Carl Lee's actions. He should have been convicted, because letting a man be acquitted of murder, no matter what the circumstances are, is very devastating to precedents in the criminal justice system. It is true that nothing ever justifies one human being killing another. I am a believer that if the criminal justice system does not hold people accountable for their actions, that God always does. On a person's Judgement Day, the day he/she dies, he/she is finally brought to justice and finally held accountable for his/her failures as a human being—failures that he/she has not repented for and felt truly sorry for.But, I digress. This film is rich in statements about society today even, as well as the criminal justice system. Society is still divided racially, and in so many different ways, now. The criminal justice system is seemingly too subject to human emotion as opposed to reason, and it has been that way for so long. Why? It is subject to human eyes, and this film very emphatically states that fact that is also a truth. The success of this film can likely be attributed to its time of release as well. It was released pretty much on the heels of the fallacy that was the verdict O.J. Simpson received in his trial for murder. (Yes, I believe very strongly O.J. was guilty.)At the same time, this film is well casted. A lot of times, big Hollywood films with big all star casts seem to be very much for the purpose of getting people into theaters to watch a movie that is otherwise mediocre. This film is very much different in that it is well casted and well acted. Matthew McConaughey is very powerful as Jake Brigance, a young charismatic lawyer looking to make his big break. Samuel L. Jackson is stellar as Carl Lee Hailey, a blue collar working father and husband that works day by day to try and support his family. Sandra Bullock is exemplary as Ellen Roark, a young woman fresh out of law school wanting to have some impact and looking to get her foot in the door as well, and make a name for herself having been somewhat in the shadow of her father, a very wealthy aristocrat. She works to help Jake in his case, despite their differing views. Kevin Spacey is excellent as the District Attorney Rufus Buckley, an adamant political figure who is not above bending regulations to win a case. Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland, Brenda Fricker, Oliver Platt and Charles S. Dutton are just a few more names of an extremely strong supporting cast, and they all shine brightly in this film. In the very few films such as this, I always look for somewhat of a wild card performance from a supporting actor/actress that I know nothing about or have seen very little of. That wild card performance comes from Patrick McGoohan as the aptly-named Judge Omar Noose. Noose is very much on the side of the prosecution, and the way he is portrayed in the film is rather indiscreet: from his long curly gray hair, half moon spectacles, to his very strong bias against the defense and his plantation home where he has black servants. The imagery that stood out mostly to me was a subtle one. For much of the film, the lighting along with the constant sheen of sweat that everyone seems to have on their foreheads is something that suggests the racial tension really coming to a boil. Finally, on the last day of the case, the day of summation and the delivery of the verdict, that sheen that everyone has from the thick muggy air of the Deep South is gone: foreshadowing to anyone who hasn't read the book perhaps?It's an incredible film that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a good film that can both provide the drama that someone needs, or provide a point of discussion for an intellect. I give it 10/10 stars.",A Time to Kill

Idealistic, liberal students from the North volunteer their efforts while the National Guard moves in to restore order.

118,amanbirsingh,KKK movies!,7,17 April 2020,"Running for a good 150 minutes, A Time to Kill is a well made movie given the thin edge the film-maker has walk to on when it comes to the theme. Presenting the KKK to a general audience, who may choose to stay away from something like this without a standard excuse, without pushing on their buttons, is a challenge to any director.Samuel L. Jackson is probably the only actor on the face of this earth who could've served on this venture. One feels a little empathy for Matthew Mconnaghuey who's got a lot on his plate to finish and fights hard to keep his place. Kevin Spacey finds it easy to fit into his domineering role and suffices it lending all the necessary weight the movie needs.What exactly the movie is meant to be doing apart from reminding us about how far we have come from the days of activism should not feed the arrogance that comes with aging. Resurgent clans reveal a more capable system that deals with it, but one that keeps going back to its doubts when it needs to propel its energies. The movie still fails to come out as powerful, not that it is intended to be that, and why the director chooses so mellow a routine on so bold a topic is a weakness. One of the reasons could be the numbing of culture over time because of violence and the general acceptance of this way of things by the affected sections of society.I rate this as a 7 and a must watch for anyone reading about orthodoxy that runs deep through income and educated groups.",A Time to Kill

122,Fire God,Let's Not Kill But Let's Watch This Anyway,9,21 June 2000,"I reveal extremely important details of A Time to Kill in this review, so if that would ruin the movie for you, please don't read on.
Samuel Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey. Hailey kills 2 men who raped and almost killed his little girl, Tonya. It is up to Jake Brigance, played by Mathew McConaughey, to try to keep Carl Lee from either spending the rest of his life in prison or being put to death. McConaughey and Jackson give us great performances and so does most of the supporting cast. Kevin Spacey plays the prosecutor, who you might like and hate at the same time, with the brilliant flare I have grown accustomed to. Sandra Bullock is good enough, as the assistant to Brigance, and Kiefer Sutherland is excellent as the racist and revenge-oriented brother of one of the rapists. Other actors who give good or great performances include: Donald Sutherland, Oliver Platt, Ashley Judd, Patrick McGoohan, and Chris Cooper. I agree with and like the racial messages in this movie, and think that they were very well implemented. I don't think the average person realizes how much racism there really is. It's not just in the Ku Klux Klan, a bunch of skinheads or even the bigoted `Archie Bunker' living next door. It's in you and it's in me. Until most of us realize that, and make a concerted effort to do something about it, racism will continue to live strong in this world.
I like A Time to Kill a whole lot; it's actually one of my 50 favorite films of all time, but I wouldn't feel like I was writing a complete review if I didn't share my disagreement with the main message this movie seems to convey. That message, the way I see it, is that it is ok to take the law into your own hands, to break the law in order to execute your own version of justice in the form of murder, before the system has even had a chance to succeed or fail. If this case happened in real life, I would be very disappointed in the jury for acquitting Carl Lee. I view a jury's duty to follow the law as being similar to a country's duty to follow the principle of freedom of speech. These two ideas are opposites in a way but the philosophies and significance to society are very much similar. We shouldn't censor a statement just because we disagree with it; in fact we should support the right to say it, or freedom of speech won't work. For very similar reasons, we should not condone someone breaking the law just because we empathize with that person. `I'd have done it too, if it was my daughter!' A big problem with this way of thinking is: who is to decide what laws should be broken, and for what reason? You? Me? How about a member of the Ku Klux Klan? No to all. We should tell all people to not break the law, and if they do, they should be held accountable by the law, except in rare circumstances. If Carl Lee was legally insane when he committed the murder, I would not be complaining; but he wasn't, and the Jury knew that.
And what if the murdered suspects are innocent? You can't even partially undo that kind of injustice. In A Time to Kill, the viewer sees the crime that Carl Lee is responding to; in real life, however, it is usually not that clear cut. If you take the law into your own hands, killing the accused, you are not only breaking one of our most important laws, you might just be murdering an innocent person. A Time to Kill is an entertaining movie that makes people think long and hard about very important issues, which is great; I just hope it doesn't inspire too many people to take the law into their own hands by either committing a crime, or exonerating those who do.

127,Alan One,Morally irresponsible filmmaking,2,1 November 1999,"I'd like to place the blame for this abominable movie at John Grisham's feet, but in view of Joel Schumacher's history of morally irresponsible filmmaking, he probably deserves it more.This courtroom drama follows the case of a black man (Jackson) who murders the two white men accused of raping and killing his daughter.  An idealistic young lawyer (McConaughey) picks up the case and slogs through opposition from a horde of stereotypical white southern bigots.  Schumacher sets up the blocks and knocks them down in the bluntest way imaginable.  From the get-go, it's the bad (Klansmen, aristocrats) versus the good (simple black folks, ""enlightened"" white folks), and not a moment of ambiguity for the whole two and half excruciating hours.  Do we ever wonder if the victims were the rapists?  Nope, we aren't allowed to.  If we were, we might draw different conclusions about how justifiable homicide is and whether or not Jackson's character is innocent.Worse than that, the courtroom action is sluggish and poorly executed. McConaughey's lawyer shows no qualms about using underhanded technique; but then the message of the film is if you're doing it for the right reason, any means are justified.  He gets the prosecution psychologist to admit to an indiscretion (gasp!), wheedles an accusational statement about the victims from the sheriff (wow!), badgers one of the victims' mothers (yikes!), and, best of all, completely abandons the insanity plea during closing statements and basically says, ""If the little girl were white, you'd have done the killing yourself.""

Samuel L. Jackson, always an incomparable actor, plays Carl Lee Hailey with the passion that he puts into every role. As a father himself with a daughter, I think that Sam Jackson plays his role as Carl Lee so fervently because he's acting out on what he would do if something ever happened to his little girl. The performances are outstanding - Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd and Matthew McConaughey are wonderful as always. This was the first R-rated movie I ever saw, and my father went with me.

130,TheFilmFreak1,Populist Silliness,8,1 December 2011,"The premise of 'A Time to Kill' is relatively simple: little black girl is raped by big white men, bigger black father (played by designated scary black man Samuel L. Jackson) is vexed by said rape and in retaliation kills the offending white males (and injures a white officer of the peace in the process), and the media (mostly white), district attorney (white), and Ku Klux Klan (white, surprisingly) descend upon him like vultures. Jack Brigance, a hotshot lawyer who doesn't play by the rules (though would rather get Sandra Bullock to break them for him), takes black father's case. Of course, with a simple premise comes a need for substantial queries: can a single man or a state better serve justice, and should a judiciary be designed around idealistic or pragmatic sentiments? The problem is, though, that the film tries to answers these questions. From 'A Time to Kill's opening moments the audience is made painfully aware of the director's adamancy that we invest our sympathies with Jackson's character. The quick-cutting and distorted angles of the film's introductory rape sequence offer vicarious punishment for the viewer that makes us not only feel nothing but emphatic passion for the raped child, but also unconditional hatred towards her attackers (who are by no means the most difficult people to despise). This means that, regardless of the odd Horatian jab at insincere affirmative action advocates, Joel Schumacher clearly wants us to feel that the cosmically correct outcome of this trial is for the father of the victim to be found innocent of charges that were very rightly made. In other words, this film might as well be called 'Vigilante Justice: The Wave of the Future'.The filmmakers go even further by forcing the audience to be diametrically opposed to and even repelled by all parties featured in the film who are opposed to Schumacher's desired conclusion, even if they are parties of a somewhat honourable disposition (such as the son of the policeman who gets shot). By doing this, 'A Time to Kill' supports fascist ideals of vigilante justice, thus is conservative propaganda. Yet it tries to cover this up by throwing the race card on the proverbial table (a card which essentially permits persecuted minority groups to be placed above the law). This means that 'A Time to Kill' combines two of the worst attributes of both sides of the American political spectrum and in the process becomes a frightening hybrid of oligarchic ideologies and victim mentalities that nobody in their right mind would want to take credit. Despite all this, 'A Time to Kill' is strangely dynamic drama. Maybe it's the thrill of watching Armageddon fall upon a small and decidedly fragile town, with white supremacists having Molotov cocktails thrown at them and courtrooms playing host to drunkards and snide doctors; or maybe it's because Schumacher actually does a pretty good job of directing some utterly wonderful supporting actors (Donald Sutherland, Kevin Spacey, Kurtwood Smith, Oliver Platt) and some rather mediocre main ones (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock). At any rate, this piece of populist exploitation works like an inexplicable charm. Unlike Grisham's novel, the film hooks you from the get-go and keeps you practically on the edge of your set until the beautifully delivered closing statement by McConaughey (his talent did not live through the 90's, but this scene is at least a marvelous requiem to it), after which things starting getting a bit anti-climatic.Ultimately, 'A Time to Kill' is a very solid film that does not deserve to be condemned purely on the basis of its fallacious morals. Not as intelligent or well made as 'The Pelican Brief', but certainly just as thrilling.",A Time to Kill
131,lspaiser,I was surprised this movie was this good after reading the book.,8,30 August 2000,"I was very much drawn into the book, and thought that it would be hard to get the same feeling out in a movie.At the beginning I thought I was right. From the beginning I was thinking ""they left out a whole mess of details."" I was irritated that they did not develop the characters better like in the book.But by the 3rd quarter of the movie this was the last thought in my mind. And by the end I understood that the screenwriter had very skillfully budgeted his (limited) screen time for the most important parts of the movie, where it is well spent.I think the acting of the principals was very good, and I found especially for Sandra Bullock as Ellen Roark - who was the most believable character. Although the rest of the acting was very good, I felt she was the most believable.Which raises the main weakness of the movie, as good as it was, having read the book, I could not help being reminded that most of the characters were in fact, actors in a movie. Except for Ms. Bullock, there was a bit of woodeness to the ""folk"" in this small southern town. Also the plot is a bit contrived (but true to the novel). Most important is that (for me) it worked.

132,elwinter,Legal drama about race relations in 1990s Mississippi,7,20 October 2002,"Adapted from Grisham's first (and arguably most substantial) novel in which he addresses changing race relations in the South.  The plum acting role went to Samuel L. Jackson, which he carries off well.  He plays the father of a very young girl who is very raped, barbarously brutalized and miraculously survives.  He kills the perps, and comes up for trial, around which the drama hinges.  Things end up better than they would have in the 1960s, but Mississippi cannot yet be mistaken for a land of justice and equality.  McConnaughey and Bullock characters are a little slick and shallow, but what can one expect from Hollywood?

133,Bigideas_Baggins,Rufus has a point,1,15 April 2021,"I really resent this movie for how it manipulates its audience. That is, what the movie is trying to say, you should fully sympathize with Sam Jackson's character, and if you don't, you basically belong with the guys in the white hoods. What I mean is that the movie takes the question ""Is it okay for a father whose daughter was raped to take justice into his own hands and kill the perpetrators?' and repackages it by stating that in the (southern) United States it all depends on racial background. So Carl Lee had no choice but to kill the guys, because they were sure to be released without punishment otherwise. And now he will be sentenced to death for it, but only because he is black; if he was white, he would have been released immediately. But lo and behold! Because if his lawyer's brilliant move of switching races in the minds of the jury, he gets released!Obviously, the issues for black people in the (southern) US, or in general really, are well documented, then (this movie is 25 years old at this point) and now still (I am writing this after BLM became a thing). And it is my view that these issues are very real. So if you are open to that as a viewer, it's easy to be taken along with how the movie is trying to put it to you that the inequality (of justice) for black people is the big problem here, and how we should feel good that in this case the protagonists managed to overcome that. But what the movie deliberately obscures in this way, is that it advocates for no justice at all, except the justice that an individual takes for himself. A person, regardless of (racial) background, killing two people should be brought to justice, and punished accordingly. And of course the circumstances matter - maybe it was self defense (clearly not in this case), there is the temporal insanity plea (rather clearly also not applicable in this case). Also, everyone will have an opinion on what the punishment ought to be (here in Europe it would not be the death penalty, but that is of course different in some US states), but what this movie is trying to tell us is that the justice system is almost to blame for even bringing this person to trial. A man revenging the rape of his daughter by killing the rapists should get a medal, and he would have gotten it too, if he was white, and now he (almost) gets it because the white jury had their eyes closed an convinced themselves that he was.I am firmly convinced that however much may be wrong with how justice functions (which is anyway vastly different in various countries) and however unbearable it will be to watch people walk free when you know what they did, the alternative is still much worse. The alternative essentially being ""every person for themselves"" and that is kinda what we had before we had civilization.As an aside, yes, the movie is rather well made, acted (for the most part), etc.Even the way the story is written is not that bad, but's hard to appreciate all that for me, when what is written is such a despicable message.",A Time to Kill

Matthew McConaughey's character is wrong, and Sam Jackson's character did not deserve to go free. What is wrong with this country that we think that this is an example of a court delivering justice? Kevin Spacey's DA character was exactly right when he addressed the jury about Carl Lee Haley, and said ""He's taken justice out of your hands, and put it into his own."". You see, in the movie, we the audience are given the knowledge that those two racist, loser, rednecks actually did the crime. WE know that. So when we see Carl Lee Haley (Sam Jackson) conclude that they may go free and they have to die, and then storm into the courthouse and kill them, we're to feel that it is righteous and deserved. But in real life, you almost never get to know with such certainty who did and did not commit a crime. That's why the lady justice is wearing a blindfold. What if some other loser redneck who had a beef with these guys, did the crime and then tossed the evidence into their truck to frame them? What if some serial-rapist had set them up because he knew they, as drunken losers, were an easy mark? Do these scenarios sound so crazy? But this is what we are so often served up on TV and in movies these days. We the audience get to KNOW, not think or suspect, but KNOW that some suspect is in fact the killer. And then the writers make our blood boil as they get set free on a technicality or something. But again, that's not real life. Sometimes the person that everybody KNOWS is guilty, didn't actually do anything wrong. Of course we all hate racists and rapists, but this movie's message that some crimes are so heinous that vigilante justice is the right choice, is dangerous. I believe that there are bad guys out there who deserve to die, but since there is no way of undoing such an act, we need to be as sure as possible that we're punishing the right person. And that's why we have trials, judges, juries, Miranda rights, etc. When we start side-stepping all that from time to time, then there isn't anything separating us from the criminals. And John Grisham is a lawyer?!",A Time to Kill
137,stewartmatt99,A good film,8,25 August 2010,"When Tonya Hailey, a young African-American girl, is raped by two white men, the town of Clanton Mississippi is changed forever. After hearing that there is a strong chance that the men who raped Tonya will get off because they are white, Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to take the law into his own hands and kill the two men who raped his daughter. Killing them in the courthouse, Carl Lee does not try and hide his murder, and immediately goes to jail. Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) is set to defend Carl Lee, but with the return of the K.K.K. it will be a much harder, and more dangerous case then Jake had originally anticipated. Jake will have to risk everything he owns, including his family, to free Carl Lee, and beat the District Attorney (Kevin Spacey) in what will be the hardest case he has ever had.Along with The Rainmaker A Time To Kill is without a doubt my favorite film based off of a Grisham novel. The script was not just fantastic, but I really, really liked the story in this film, and I even thought some parts of it were quite touching. The courtroom action was very interesting, much better than most movies I have seen, and it really kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen.The cast was fantastic, not all of the acting was perfect, but it certainly was good. Several of the actors in the film have been at least nominated for an Oscar. However, there some flaws in the performances, they definitely were not perfect. Matthew MaConaughey as the lead was much better then I had expected, it was not Oscar worthy or anything, but still good. I can easily tell you that He is much better playing a lawyer in a courtroom drama, then some loser in a terrible comedy. Now, Ashley Judd playing his wife was not very good. I am not really sure why, because in a lot of her movies she is a pretty good actress, but in this one she is not really at all. Sandra Bullock and Oliver Platt are good along side MaConaughey, but my favorite performance was by far Kevin Spacey. He was brilliant playing the District Attorney.Overall, A Time To Kill, is a flawed but very good film with great performances, and to some will be a touching, and maybe even at times moving story. Along with a lot of interesting court scenes, and a nice ending, it was a good film.",A Time to Kill

140,halohamish,A Time to watch,8,17 October 2008,"The racial tension in a small country town is ignited when Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), a black man, shoots two white men dead as a retaliation to prejudice inflicted on his daughter. The perspective on right and wrong is a main theme throughout the film and questions every character's outlooks and morals, even among the ""good guys"". Or more to the point, whether there is, or is not, in fact, a time to kill.Not only does it ask this to the characters in the film, but it asks it to you, the viewer. It makes you ask yourself where you stand. The film raises many important issues in society, and not just among racism, but justice for that matter, and what is right and wrong, both morally and ethically. Of course though, even with all this said, the film is not unbiased. Working off the basis of most movies, there is a definitive ""good"" and ""bad"" and you know who you're cheering on and who you're not, or at least, who the writer's are and are not. Sometimes this can come across as a little simple-minded, maybe even arrogant, but the film tries its hardest to bring a point from every side. Opinions still rage among characters who are meant to be working with each other, showing the different thought process of individuals.Many see this film as heavily biased, but I can guarantee there are many respectable points brought forward by all the characters, even the ""bad guys"", that will challenge everyone. The white aren't all just black hating hicks and the black aren't all just innocent victims of racism who never inflict any themselves.Moving away from the social aspect of this film, A Time to Kill offers much in the way of acting and writing. Although I usually find Matthew McConaughey uninspiring, his performance as Jake is the best I've ever seen him hold. Jackson is superb and refreshing in a much different role than that of what he seems to be playing recently. Alongside these great performances is Sandra Bullock as aspiring lawyer, Ellen Roark, and Kevin Spacey as ""big bad wolf"" District Attorney Rufus Buckley. A Time to Kill is a work that evidences the best all these actors have to offer, or at least, did have to offer once upon a time. It shows of a better time before such actors fell into forgettable flicks such as ""Fool's Gold"" and ""21"".At the end of it all, A Time to Kill is going to conflict with many viewer's personal opinions. Not everyone is going to agree with it's outtake on what is good and bad. But you can at least give it credit for daring to raise the question and making you decide where you stand.

Perhaps I shouldn't have had high expectations because not only does it lack the depth and quality of the novel -which is perhaps understandable-but the choice of casting leads a lot to be wanted.To give credit where its due, Matthew McConaughey is great as Jake Brigance (even though the character in the novel is much more jaded and multi-dimensional than the movie version). And Samuel L Jackson does a great job as Carl Lee Hailey. And Brenda Fricker and Kevin Spacey are both goodBut somehow Ashley Judd, great actress though she is, is miscast for the role of Carla Brigance. Perhaps this is not entirely her fault because the character of Carla Brigance is not treated well in this movie and lacks the character development or the liveliness that characterizes her in the novel. And Sandra Bullock as Ellen Roark -what were they thinking? Bullock ultimately succeeds in transforming a very intelligent, genial and pleasant character into an obnoxious, shallow and vacuous character who left me cold and unsympathetic toward her -even during the climax of her character's role. Gone is a lot of the witty dialogue and humorous banter that characterized the Grisham novel. Lucien's character, although good, doesn't have much of the appeal that is such a strength in the book and the same goes for Harry Rex Vonner. And the issues and perspectives are not really examined in the depth that they should be in the movie -even given that a movie adaptation of a book can't go into the same depth, this one is sadly lacking.All in all I would advise people to read the novel and give the movie a miss.",A Time to Kill
144,asteinfi2,Misguiding Moral Message,2,26 July 2005,"I came away from this film fairly angry. I thought the several talented actors all gave strong performances, the direction was good and in general a pretty well done production. My main problem with the movie was on a moral standpoint.Samuel L Jackson plays a man living in the prejudiced south who's daughters are raped by two white bigots. In search of revenge he goes after them and kills them. The main part of the movie centers around Jackson's trial. McConaghey is the heroic lawyer for the defense and Kevin Spacey is the oily prosecutor. Sandra Bullock, and Keifer and Donald Sutherland round out the talented cast. After a heated trial and many looks at the ugly racism of the south, even in present day, Jackson is acquitted. In our society a man must be punished for his crimes. You are not allowed to kill another man period. I deeply empathize with Jackson's position, I might have done the same myself, but if we allow the public to take law into their own hands, we will create a vigilante society where no one is safe and the law means nothing. No matter how evil those two men were and how much they deserved to be punished, they needed to be punished by the law, not Jackson. I agree that sometimes the law does not always fulfill its duty but that is something we must fix with the legal system. We cannot use that as an excuse to allow civilian killings. I also think racism is a problem still and is something else we as a society must address, but this movie gives the message that killing in revenge is OK, and killing is never OK.",A Time to Kill

OK, I could not avoid talking about him.It is OK to construct a tight story, but Grisham goes to far here. He needs to transport just another moral lecture and spoils it all. So there is this black guy who murdered the rapers of his daughter and he finally gets free because everybody feels pity for him and (that's Grishams stupid trick) the only other alternative would be the death penalty.So we should let all murders of criminals roam free? What signal is that? At what point can somebody left free, which deed is cruel enough to justify a private murder? Ah, nonsense.

And the sugary ending! I've become very tired of the good-triumphs-over-evil-and-everybody-lives-happily-ever-after theme which certain film-makers can't seem to resist, especially when the national flag features prominently near the end-- they remind me of some of the old WW II propaganda movies.

Not one actor's time or talents were wasted in this extremely well thought-out project.. not one actor wasted a cent of the money we paid to see it.Matthew McConaughey's ""Jake Brigance"" was an incredibly lucky shot of an acting debut that he took and ran with like the wind, turning in an amazing, heart-stopping, truly star-making performance, which may prove to be the crowning achievement of his entire career when all is said and done.. It will be a treacherous climb to try and top it, certainly.Class act Donald Sutherland is superbly cast in a quiet, and profound role, as ""Jake""'s, {now no longer practicing}, professor, a perfect fit, this role, for a man of such rare eloquence~ There is a sizzling sub-story going on between ""Jake"", a devoted family man, and Sandra Bullock's character that could not have been tighter, steamier, nor more well written and played out.I recommend this movie to anyone who believes in justice, who has a child, or only knows one.You want cheap, tawdry, sleazy, violent 'entertainment'?

It is without a doubt a stain on the history of our nation. However, this wasn't one of them. I think its entirely over the top for the times that it was set in. To me it promotes racial division rather than harmony, as well as vigilante justice. I can't envision any prosecutor in the 1990's seeking the gas chamber and first degree murder charges against Carl Lee, nor the reprehensible acts of the two lowlifes who raped his daughter to spark the rebirth of a KKK to defend them or want to avenge their deaths. Yes there will always be idiot racists and lunatic fringe groups, but the fabric of society in this movie would have been a lot more believable had it been set in the 60's. Matthew McConaughey overacted and like many of the others seemed afflicted with a case of sort of over the top white guilt, Sandra Bullock's character was completely pointless and just seemed to be forced into the movie for eye candy purposes, Samuel L Jackson was good portraying a sympathetic character....... but overall it was more everyone's response to the situation that derailed this movie and made it an overdone and overdramatized picture of race relations in 1990's America.",A Time to Kill

But perhaps not. I hear this is the most faithful Grisham adaption yet, and if that is true, I can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work.""A Time to Kill"" is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be a suspenseful crowd-pleasing thriller and, at the same time, a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions. Let's face it, those two types of films do not go together in Hollywood, which is why ""Dead Man Walking"" had to be made independently.The story involves a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy) out to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter. The day before the rapists' trial, Carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building, he charged out and shot both of them dead. To help out with the defense, Jack accepts the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary, and put in the film only for marketing purposes.Meanwhile, one of the rapist's kid brother (Kiefer Sutherland) was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge. All of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse, a kidnapping, a brutal beating, and race riot.  I'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film, in addition to the courtroom scenes. What I later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot.The main question that the film constantly asks, over and over again, is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Sure they can, but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair. This film, however, doesn't seem to think so. Besides that, there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. For example, there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse, who is a member of the Klan, and, for reasons unknown, is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the Klan. After Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and company, and left for dead in the wilderness, this unknown person comes and saves her---and we NEVER find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing.And speaking of the Sutherland character's reign of terror, it's amazing how witless the police and the Bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film. There's a scene when Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he comes out, shooting one of the guards instead. Now you'd think since there are dozens of police around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. No such luck. From what we could see, no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose. Even after Bullock, was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she never, ever mentioned who her kidnapper was, nor was it even questioned. Why was this? Simple. The Sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense, although logically, he should have been out of the picture.Besides Bullock's character, there another thankless character. He is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie--to supply a number of one-liners for the audience. In my opinion, one-liners show a major weakness in ""serious"" films when used. It demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film.But enough of the film's many minor problems. What about the film's message here? It is clear that Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. The lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity, etc that caused him to kill. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement. After describing everything that took place, he adds on one final line...""The girl is white"". We then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes.In the very next scene, a girl comes out yelling ""He's free! He's free!"". Wait a minute! Do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? Most of all, why weren't  there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off. I'll tell you why. They couldn't show the delibertion because NO JURY could acquit a man of such a crime, no matter how much the defense's closing arguements touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them?This film should have had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation, because in reality, there would not be an acquittal. But since dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge, the makers of this film should be held responsible. What a socially irresponsible film this is!",A Time to Kill
166,madricci,"Outstanding actors, timeless story, a must-see!",9,30 October 2006,"For me this is actually one of the best movies I've ever seen, not only 'cause of the great performances of all main- and supporting actors, but most of it all because of the message and the feelings it gave me while I was watching it and even still gives me. People are watching movies for the same reason they listen to music or look at paintings, they wanna feel. We all have to come along with people of different colors, nationalities and whatever. The best and most peaceful way to do that, like it's mentioned in the movie, is to listen to our hearts, which for me is the message that the director and screenplay-writer wanted to bring along. I hope I got the message, on any account it made me cry several times which is a thing not many movies have achieved yet. For me as a German who dealt a lot with the history of his own country and also a little with the history of the Ku-Klux-Clan, it was good to see that those people are shown as just what they are: A bunch of mind-sick, dumb and dangerous Nazis. The whole situation in the movie in my opinion stands at the appropriate rate to reality of that time in the south of the United States,what makes it very authentic and traceable. The reason I call it a timeless story although it's certainly set in a special time is that everyone is almost forced to think, at least subconsciously, about the way he or she is dealing with those problems of difference that are always gonna exist. I highly recommend this movie but I will not say enjoy or have fun 'cause you won't find these things in ""A time to kill"". I also love the title 'cause when you think about it, everyone can become a murderer in the right circumstances. But what you're gonna find is a captivating story, acting on its highest level and strong emotions.",A Time to Kill
167,bendipa,A waste of time,4,9 May 2005,"If you enjoyed films like Mississippi Burning or In the Heat of the Night, which dealt superbly with the subject of black racial discrimination, then at first glance, you could be excused for thinking that A Time to Kill might be just the movie for you. Unfortunately, you may end up being severely disappointed.The film is one of the worst of its type, because of the awful direction. I haven't read the book, so I could not judge how true the screenplay and action relate to Grisham's story. But disregarding the book, the main problem with the film is its utter drabness. The characters seem cardboard cut-out stereotypes. Matthew McConaughey is the struggling, caring white lawyer with a beautiful, blonde blue-eyed wife and daughter, defending angry, black Carl Lee Hailey, whose young daughter has just been raped by 2 rednecks. Hailey walks into McConaughey's office and tells him that he intends to get revenge on the 2 rednecks despite their impending trial, and he succeeds in killing them on the day of their hearing. Like the courthouse wouldn't be properly guarded. And yes, McConaughey decides to defend him after this incident because he is a 'man with a conscience'. Then the brother of one of the murdered rednecks decides to involve the Klu Klux Klan, and so we have threats made to McConaughey and his legal team, and race riots in the town where this all takes place. And in the end Hailey is acquitted of murder, everyone smiles and is tearful, McConaughey is a hero, and they all live happily ever after.Well that's the nuts and bolts of this very predictable and unoriginal plot. To make matters worse, the actors at times appear to be going through the motions. Donald Sutherland is brought in as a seriously drunken lawyer to help McConaughey; that idea stolen from a much earlier legal drama, The Verdict', which was vastly superior to this dross. Hailey, played by Samuel Jackson, seems relatively unperturbed by what he has done, and the fate that might await him. Kevin Spacey as the DA, plays the stereotype who tries to make out McConaughey is too inadequate and green a lawyer to take on the case. How many times have we seen that sort of scenario in legal dramas? Patrick McGoohan plays the crusty old judge presiding over the court, who is over zealous and stubborn much of the time. Sandra Bullock plays an eager-beaver law student who arrives out of nowhere and insists on helping out McConaughey over the case, because she has a heart, and wants to learn...and so it goes on. And that's the problem. An impressive sounding cast, but none of the actors convince or can lend any real credibility to their characters. They are just too wooden and stereotyped. I read that the Mississippi state accents were poorly done by most of the cast, but I am no judge of that. Nevertheless if I didn't know any better, I could be fooled into thinking I was watching a legal drama spoof. So best give this one a wide berth.",A Time to Kill

170,zogz54,Repulsive and dangerous,1,24 February 2007,"This is a truly repellent film, and one that is all too representative of the deeply pernicious influence that John Grisham has wielded over cultural life in America. It attempts to paper over its rabidly right-wing approach to justice with the usual flabby soft-liberal posturings over race. Ironically, however, its racial attitudes are almost as objectionable as its unabashed endorsement of vigilante violence; here, patronising smugness is taken to new lows. This film is in the not-so-proud Hollywood tradition of stories about heroic white men riding to the rescue of noble but ineffectual black men, and seldom has this tradition been affirmed as explicitly as it is here. In the form of representatives of the N.A.A.C.P., black people do indeed offer their support to Jackson's character, but this is rejected in favour of Matthew McConaughey's bland young lawyer. In place of the political clout and legal expertise the N.A.A.C.P. are able to supply, Carl Lee Hailey (Jackson) instead sticks to the inexperienced idealism of the crusading Caucasian protagonist. Know your place, black folks! Don't you know there's a dashing, photogenic white hero in the building? Move along now, and leave the rescuing to this poor man's Atticus Finch. Good white people do battle with bad white people, and the only appropriate place for black people in all of this is at the sidelines, looking stoical and dignified. Another point to make against this odious trash is that the assertion of the individual's right to seek violent retribution is not so different from the basic assumptions of the Ku Klux Klan, the villains of the piece. But such subtleties are hardly the type of stuff that the likes of Grisham and Schumacher can be expected to trifle with. It beggars belief how the former can have had the audacity to accuse Oliver Stone of encouraging violence when that is precisely what this dangerous rubbish does. Films like 'A Time to Kill', which champion personal vengeance, no matter how bloody, contribute to the kind of political climate in which leading politicians can express sympathy with crazed loons who murder judges. Apart from its warped values, the film is shoddily written, lamely paced and atrociously acted, with one of the worst collections of hammy 'Southern' accents ever assembled. The cinematography is nice.",A Time to Kill
171,Victim_Of_Fate,Insulting,1,8 March 2000,"Regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film - that vigilante justice is acceptable - is justifiable, I was more insulted by McConaughey's closing statement.  In a courtroom drama, the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film, and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one, the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury.  This basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl.  I for one find this very insulting. As for the rest, I found the acting reasonable, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self (doesn't really work in a courtroom drama), but what's the point when the film's message is as poor as this one.  It tells you that vigilante justice is fine, and accuses you of racism if you disagree.",A Time to Kill

It is one of my favorites right now. Afterwards i read the book, and i loved it too. I think that i would not love the book if i didn't saw the movie first. After ""Time to kill"" and ""Pelican brief"" (the only ones i read and saw the movies) i think Grisham is a great writer and his books can be nicely adapt to the cinema.About the movie, i think that what happened should not happen anywhere around the world. I think that raping is a proof of cowards.

173,bubbsy2,"""Yes They Deserved to Die And I Hope They Burn In Hell""",9,24 February 2012,"I stumbled across the Trailer for this movie on YouTube and was intrigued. I purchased the movie on iTunes a few days later and found myself unable to turn away from the screen, no matter how badly I wanted to. Some off the scenes are hard to bare, such as the rape and torture and attempted murder off little Tanya, a scene that was portrayed to show the true horror of the act and yet it was not filmed in an overly explicit or indecent manner. Many peoples problem with this film seems to be that Carl Lee acts as a vigilante, he takes the law into his own hands and serves out a punishment that while illegal the movie still portrays him as the good guy. But isn't he? Yes he shot those to men (I use this word lightly) and yes he feels no regret but would any one is his shoes? I understood his reasoning, those men raped, tortured and tried to kill his daughter twice, first by hanging then by throwing her from a bridge and while his daughter may have survived, she is undoubtedly damaged, not only mentally but also physically as she is not able to have children after the attack. Could any parent stand that happening to their baby and not be driven to actions that they would normally consider themselves incapable of, especially if there was a good chance that the people responsible would walk free, if not instantly in a few short years? The question is, when the law fails to uphold justice, whose responsibility is it to punish the guilty? Who has the right to be judge, jury and executioner? Can anyone really say his actions where unjustified, can any parent say that they would do otherwise in his situation, not only as revenge but to prevent it from happening again. I do not favor violence, I do not consider myself aggressive but I felt nothing but satisfaction watching those two men die and why? Because they deserved to be punished and there was to high a chance they wouldn't be with the judicial system.The acting in this movie is superb, the only characters I thought a little 2D where the KKK members, it was as though saying ""These people are in the KKK, they are bad, they are bad because they are in the KKK"" was enough, that, I found unsatisfying. Otherwise every character had depth, good qualities and flaws and they all went on their own journeys that all begin the day that little girl is subjected to the most unimaginable cruelty. She sparks change and struggle and the struggle of the other characters can be paralleled to the struggle she will face for the rest of her life. This film makes you think, it gives you time to question and it gives you time to come to your own conclusions. The pace is perfect, The score chilling. The morals admirable. The story heartbreaking. This film is about race, but it is about more than that. It's about family, love, hate, revenge and human nature. I loved almost everything about the film, having said that it was not perfect, claiming insanity was foolish as the act was clearly premeditated several hours before the fact thus he was of sane mind, the closing statement is unrealistic and it does not keep in ties with the Insanity plea, it is more an emotional appeal. The KKK as I said before are a bit 2D and some off the scenes are a little cliché but the overall movie is still brilliant. If there is one way to wrap this movie up, it is the scene between Kevin Spacey and Samuel Jackson, when Spacey's character (the Prosecutor) asks Jackson's character (the defendant) whether or not he believes in a sane state of mind, the two men he killed deserved to die, unwilling to answer at first as he is trying to act as though he killed them in an state of mind where he was unstable, Jackson does not answer at first however driven to anger by the prosecutions repeated questions he bellows in response, ""Yes they deserved to die and I hope they burn in hell."" and if you watch this movie, wait till that moment and see if you disagree with him.",A Time to Kill

177,dauplaisej,Reification of Reproduction - Nuclear Family Uber-Alles,7,18 January 2007,"The subtext of a woman's value residing in her reproductive capacity reduces what could and should have been a fine film into a morality tale. The nefariousness of emphasizing Tonya Hailey's (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly) permanent damage, that she'll never bear children of her own, and likewise, the undertow of Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock) as probable spinster to be, mars an otherwise laudable tale of social justice. Roark isn't invited to the party at the end - and Tonya is the first to greet the Brigance's daughter, Hannah (Alexandra Kyle) - as if she lready knows that she has some work to do if she wants to make her way in this world. Tonya's existence resides in its disparity from Hannah's; one girl is disadvantaged in every conceivable way, whereas Hannah is the golden child of parents (McConnaughey and Judd) who prove paragons of virtue in a fashion that smacks of class-based Post-Commune Parisian didacticism. Carl Lee Hailey's righteous vigilante revenge nonetheless fails to eradicate the truth of the ""damage"" to Tonya's maternal capacity that is highlighted in the courtroom scenes, and which sways the jury only because they imagine a little white girl similarly damaged as Jake Brigance utilizes an impromptu guided imagery exercise based on Carl Lee Hailey's revelation that he, Jake, by oxymoronic virtue of his white guilt, is therefore the only man who can save the accused. Silently, unwittingly, however, the viewer is drawn into finding both Roark and young Tanya guilty of nulliparous existence. Freud once asked what women want.

Picturing it in your head?  It might almost feel real, make you hate those men that did that to her.  I don't really understand Sandra Bullocks part in the movie except to create even more conflict, which there is already plenty of.  The beginning was made well.

180,wildjoker_7,There is a Time to Kill,8,10 December 2002,"This was a book by John Grisham which I read.  It is a very good book and form what I remember the movie follows as closely as it can.  The movie is fantastic. A little girl is walking home but doesn't make it quite there because two hicks hit her in the head with a beer can and then they have their way with her.  They ruin any chance she could ever have with giving birth.  Any. They don't have any remorse because they live in the south where they will surely get off because the jury will consist of whites.  Which of course does not settle to well with the daddy, Car Lee Haily, he sneaks into the court house and kills them both.  He is now the one that is going to trial and he is the one that has an all white jury.  But what he has now is a lawyer who wants to win.  Jake Brigance has not had a good case in quite a while until he stumbles across this one but decides that he should take a pay cut to defined Haily.  A law student comes along, Ellen Roark, to help for free.  The case gets more difficult because the NAACP wants another lawyer, the Klu Klux Klan rears their dirty pillow heads, and rage of the black community fire what is a big decision for 12 people to make, was what Haily did justified? This movie was good.  I liked it a lot.  The fact that Haily killed those boys for what they did to his daughter was not all to bright but it is what he did.  And what he did was no worse then what they did to his daughter. They raped her and beat her.  By raping her they ruined any chance that she could have with birth of a child of her own, which is in its own right murder.  They ruined a father because they ruined a daughter.  So what they did was, in all actuality, kill themselves.  They could have saved everyone a whole bunch of trouble and just killed themselves, but they didn't. The cast in this movie is caliber.  Kevin Spacey shows how evil he can be by playing the snide district attorney.  Sandra Bullock gets a little serious with her Roark role.  Matthew McConaughey shows his acting ability with Jake, especially during his closing statements.  Samuel L. Jackson brings out the life in a father that lost the innocence of his daughter by to dirty men. The whole case turns into a race issue and has the Klu Klux Klan marching and the African Americans marching too just to match them.  They fight in front of the court house.  They want it to be a race thing.  But it shouldn't be.  It should be about a girl who lost what she had because two men thought they could get away with it just because of her color.  But no matter the color she was still a little girl and no little girl disserves what she got. This movie is exciting and thrilling.  It was a great book and a great movie.

A good story was turned into mush by these movie grave-robbers who waded through the pantheon of great films to steal ideas and by sheer laziness turned them into stale cliches.

Also, and very important, it sticks faithfully to the storyline in Grisham's book.McConnaughey is simply great in the role he plays as defense lawyer; that alone is reason to watch the movie. Also, Samuel L. Jackson as the protagonist is his usual dynamite self. The movie didn't reach the box-office figures that the other above-mentioned films did, but to me it surely deserved to. The story needs to be told to give people a truly realistic picture of racial bigotry and its sometimes tragic results.The only reason I rate it 9 instead of 10 is that the ending, in my opinion, was a little flat and could have been fleshed out a bit more.

I also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. In the movie characters are given a ""nobility"" of personality that seemed so stilted. The villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional.

Jackson played Carl Lee Hailey, who was on trial for shooting two rednecks named Billy Ray Cobb and James Louis Willard for brutally raping his 10-year-old daughter Tonya. Rounding out the top four characters is Kevin Spacey, who played D.A. Rufus Buckley, one of the toughest lawyers in Mississippi, who was actually running for governor. These four, plus other great actors and actresses like Kiefer and Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Brenda Fricker, and Oliver Platt make A Time To Kill a great film.The plot line of A Time to Kill is a young lawyer, along with three solid assistants, defending a father that killed two men for raping his child. The plot line itself was really deep, but the way that the cast executed their roles makes this movie an uncanny piece of film.For the most part, I liked the events that took place in the movie. In fact, the only event I did not like was when Jake and Ellen were in Ellen's motel room. The two were sitting on the bed looking at each other, ready to start making out. But Jake backed down because he was married. That was disappointing because first off, his wife was out of town and she never would have found out and secondly, he wanted to do more than just make out with her. Heck, if that was me sitting with her, I would have made out with her whether my wife was gone or not. How could you resist kissing a sexy woman like Roark? I guess Jake was soft enough to resist.My favorite part was when Jake and Carl Lee were in Carl Lee's jail cell talking the night before the final hearing. I learned about how Carl Lee felt about Jake after this remark. ""They see you, they see a yard-worker. They see me, they see an attorney."" He said that Jake was one of the bad guys. I had mixed feelings about Carl Lee's remarks. Jake did see Carl Lee as different, but he wasn't one of the bad jury guys.In conclusion, I would like to say again that A Time to Kill was my favorite movie that I had ever seen. I could watch it over and over again. Thanks, Joel Schumacher, for directing such a well thought-out movie. This movie will be a classic to me for years to come, seeing as it is now a decade old.",A Time to Kill

We did have a great debate over it. I will use it again for next semester. The cast of characters were well received and believable. We went through a few bad films before this one and this one was well received. As for me, I liked the film, but didn't find it the best, though I'm a bit hard to please.

196,funkjosh,"Worth a rent, but not great",5,8 February 2004,"I really wanted to like this movie. And in some ways, I did. The steamy atmosphere of the cloistering town is set well. While not an amazing cast ensemble by any means, it still is quite good. There is a lot of acting talent in this film. Matthew McConaughey's end speech was by far his best moment ever on screen and definitely a standout performance in a larger context. He does that rare thing that the great actors must be able to do - as his character had to do to convince the jury to acquit Carl - he made the audience fully believe in his performance and the reality of the story that he had to tell.In some ways this movie is on par with, say, Mississippi Burning (one of the greatest civil rights movies to come to the big screen) as far as great dialogue goes.That being said, the reason why this movie is not at the level of (for example) Mississippi Burning is that it is almost completely fictional. The reason that civil rights movies are important in and of themselves is that they tell a real story - they give us a piece of our national history that actually happened. They are both a picture and a painting. Reality, incredulity, knowledge, empathy, sorrow,  acceptance, and learning are the reasons why the Civil Rights movement interests people and why we watch movies about it. This movie was complete fiction. Without the base in reality, it loses its credibility as a civil rights movie and does not inspire a great deal of passion.As a legal thriller, it is somewhat cliche (lawyers power-swinging like baseball players at witnesses, opening statements, summations, and discovery) but the performances turned in by Kevin Spacey and Samuel L Jackson in the courthouse are stirring and firey in parts.
After everything is said and done, I probably won't be buying it for my own DVD collection, but if you're thinking about renting it or can watch it for free, go for it.",A Time to Kill

The director Joel Schumacher tries to force his own terms on the audience.The movie so obviously pictures the character of Carl Lee (Samuel L. Jackson) as a very sympathetic person who is as good and innocent as the nice little boy next door. But this is a man who murdered two men with cold blood. I can't have sympathy for him for committing murder, even though the guys he murdered raped his daughter. Of course Carl Lee has to be punished for what he has done - in my opinion. Yet the director forces his own terms on us - that we have to have sympathy with Carl Lee. And if you can't agree with that the whole movie falls apart. The director makes the big mistake to force his own opinions upon the audience instead of letting people think themselves.Therefore, I really can't recommend this piece of trash as I can't have any respect for the director.",A Time to Kill

(and for the record, I do live in the rural south, Alabama to be exact.) Vigilante justice may be legally wrong, but so many people, especially parents could relate to this character. The feelings, the passions of the people in this movie were so real, so heartfelt that I could not help but be sucked into it.

The prosecutor's ultimately unsucessful tactic was to appeal to their notion of a savage black man taking the law into his own hands and undermining civilised white society.Ultimately the jury realised that Hailey had just as profound and human an attachment to his daughter as they did to their children. Enough that he could be driven to temporary insanity.Oh, what did I think of the film? 7/10. Lifted above the average by the strong performances of the lead actors.",A Time to Kill

211,barbarrossared,"This is not ""To Kill A Mocking Bird """,2,26 February 2011,"This is not ""To Kill A Mocking Bird "" or ""In the heat Of the Night, two films that forcefully and righteously took on racism in the The South before the Civil Rights movement retired Jim Crowe. This ""movie""(I cannot call it a ""film ""as it would give it the respect it does not earn.) No doubt ""A Time To Kill"" does justice to the Grisham book in the sense it portrays the fictional novel correctly. However the movie and the book is laughable with it's stereotypically characters, stretched plot line and paper thin believability. . Starting with the story line. Set in apparently modern day rural Mississippi, A black ten year old girl's brutally attacked, raped and left for dead by a pair of viscously depraved racists (needlessly to say white) The father, fearing his daughter's assailants would not get justice from the white jury, guns down the rapists before their trial. The main characters.are so cartoonishly evil or saintly good one would expect they would have horns and halos on their heads. The racists rapists are rednecks who drive pickup trucks and are as stupid morons only Hollywood could dream up (Openly bragging about their deeds in a county with a black sheriff?) The father of the victim is desperately poor but stands proudly with the dignity of the righteous. One has to support him despite his murdering of two unarmed, shackled men and the careless maiming of an innocent deputy sheriff . Anything less could be viewed as support for the most vilest of human scum. The loopholes in are overwhelming. The father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) believes his daughter's rapists will be acquitted by a white jury, the same white people who elected a black man for sheriff(a position of power in a rural county) And are viewers expected to believe a prosecutor with an eye for higher office, bring charge of first degree murder to a father of a brutally raged child? Only people who have biased view of Southerners, have never set foot in any state south of the Mason Dixon line or is Joel Schumacher, the director who ruined the Batman movie franchise with the insipidly bad ""Batman & Robin"" would find this plausible. Even the at the height (or should that be the depths) of the days of Segegation the most ardent Segregationist wouldn't condone the rape of an ten year old child. But this is fiction, terribly bad fiction and the movie's plot demands villains and the political atmosphere for them to thrive, no matter how ridiculous. Another small but incredulous point is a how does a dirt poor family in the Mississippi Delta region afford an M-16(Ar-14?) but not an lawyer? An very expensive weapon that is not likely to be hanging from the walls of a poor black family. A real Carl Lee Hailey would more likely have an old family shotgun. Could the director be making a point about gun control at the expense of character creditability. In THIS movie? You betcha. Every good story has a lesson to be learned. With ""To Kill A Mocking Bird "" the point is clear. For true justice to be obtained, the law must be color blind. What is the message the audience of ""A Time To Kill"" are left to learn? That taking the law into one's hands is good, only if one's prejudices and the racial cause is politically correct? One need only to switch the color of the skin of the protagonists and see what ""justice"" is according to them. The makers of this piece of work have made the case for racial vigilantism, whether they intended to or not.",A Time to Kill

It is hard to make a movie about a blockbuster book from such a talented author as John Grisham, and Joel Schumacher failed.

Most movies on prejudice are rather boring and dreary, but not this one! It is really interesting. It shows whites lending a hand to the blacks and also stepping in their shoes (as shown in the summation)and to see many people being moved by the summation speech. It is also rather moving to see how Jake sacrifices many things in his life to help fight the case for Carl Lee. This movie also teaches us things like putting ourselves in others' shoes and to not divide and stereotype people based on colour.

220,kbarbour1,Great flick even with some of the stereotypes,8,15 June 2005,"I rented this movie the other day because I just saw ""Sahara"" and was reminded of how good M.McC. was in ""A Time to Kill."" He really is great in this movie. My husband has this theory that most actors and actresses are really just playing themselves in most films, that no matter how well they play themselves, it's really not much of a stretch. But if the stuff we read and see of McC. in real life is at all accurate then pretty as he is, he really is a great actor.I'd also forgotten what a great cast this was: Keifer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Charles Dutton, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Cooper, Oliver Platt. I don't give Sandra Bullock very high marks for this one though. I mean I like her, but I think she falls under the rubric of my husband's theory and sometimes that works for me and sometimes that doesn't. Part of the reason I didn't like her character was the holier than thou way she preached to Jake about the death penalty and his southern sensibilities - I mean how do you get up on a soap box about watching murderers die for their crimes (apparently her character had witnessed two executions) when you know that at the heart of the issue in this movie is a 10 year old little girl who was viciously raped and would have been successfully hung if her attackers had not been drunk. Bullock's speech seems further out of place when you consider that she's against the executions while arguing for the acquittal of a man who, well, um, EXECUTED two men.Okay - so I didn't like that scene. Scenes I did like and highly recommend you look out for are the court room scene when Kevin Spacey puts Chris Cooper's character on the stand. I won't spoil anything for you, but I will say I wasn't sure whether CC was a good guy or bad guy in this movie (he plays both so well) until this scene.Of course Jake's closing statements in the trial are amazing. Truly gut wrenching and provocative. And it doesn't hurt that the courtroom scene here evokes ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" with it's hardwood floors, wooden benches, and packed seats and balcony.I also really like the light hearted moment with Oliver Platt and Matthew McC. teasing McC. secretary about whether she had an affair with McC.'s former boss, Lucien Wilkes.Can't say I like Ashley Judd much here - though again, I usually do like her (she's very good in Simon Birch). She's not as pretty as a blonde and she just wasn't very believable. Also, while I love the whole idea of the steamy south, some of the scenes with Judd and McC. and their humidity clad bare skin were a bit much. The film takes place in 1996 - they have a/c down south, ya'll.Overall, despite stereotypes, the movie is very good and very worth renting and watching a couple times for the great acting and the atmosphere if you have a thing for the south like I do.",A Time to Kill
221,xquenda,back to the Middle Ages,1,28 June 2005,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! It is basically a propaganda for blood vengeance and also, in the dialogs, for death penalty. Maybe it is a cultural reason that I, as a European, am a little sensitive about those topics and felt totally disgusted. But the film also has not much to tell beyond these central points. With a big portion of emotionalism it merely tries to cover its plot's weakness and, even more, to capture its viewers with its opinion. The obvious intention is to make the audience heartily agreeing with the offered judgment. This is dangerous, it is the way propaganda works. Could the action be seen as a kind of justified manslaughter? No! It was in the European Middle Ages when vengeance as an accepted form of criminal punishment was abolished. And this should not be changed! I'd like to advise everyone to watch this film again and, as an experiment, to replace the raped daughter with a raped 70-year-old mother. I doubt that shooting the rapist will be equally approved. Anyway, the film has to get at least 1 out of 10, maybe for the musical score.",A Time to Kill
222,nathy85,"""A Time to Kill"" is really about...",8,22 December 2009,"""A Time to Kill"" was not about the trial of a man who committed a murder, but was an exploration into the blinkered society we may live in. Of course the African American Carl Lee (Samuel L Jackson) killed the two rapists of his ten year old daughter, and naturally he was guilty of that, and you would think that as we are watching a courtroom film about whether he was guilty or not, that he would have no chance of being acquittedbut that's just it, it's not a film about whether he is guilty, and so people should stop judging it on basis that it ignores the facts. The best way to make a courtroom drama dramatic is to heap as much evidence up against the defendant that the viewer is rooting for, and that's all they done here (to the maximum).The vigilante murder by the grieving father was just a catalyst and the courtroom was just the setting. They were just tools used to drive the message of the film, which is pretty much summed up in lawyer Jake Brigance's (Matthew McConaughey) final speech when he says, ""now imagine the girl is white"". The film, like some reviewers seem to be saying, is not implying that the white jury are inherently racist against black people and that they'd be more horrified by a white girl being raped than a black girl. What it's saying is that the jury would maybe sympathise or relate (and I use these terms loosely) to it happening to a white girl as they would be able to picture it more as if it were their own daughter who had been violated, rather than a poor black girl of a crazy (enter racial slur here___).To support this, Carl's little pre-judgement day talk to Brigance lies at the heart of this final speech when Carl tells Brigance in his prison cell that through no fault of anybodies, they have been divided as white and black, that they are from different neighbourhoods and that their kids won't ever play together. In a sense this would have been true, especially if you take into account the time the film was supposed to be it set. The whole point was explicitly verbalised to the viewer when Carl asks Brigance to make the jury see through his eyes, or in a more literal sense befitting the film, through his heart and that's what he did. Don't rip this film apart for being illogical to facts or irresponsible, because it is obviously not claiming to be. Having said that, we shouldn't forget that in his final speech, Brigance did tell the jury that the psych doctor (who gave evidence in support of Carl) who was charged with statutory rape in his past, had actually been innocent as the girl was 17, on top of which he married her and had kids with her. This would make him not a felon and his statement that Carl was insane at the time he committed the murder entirely credible. So who knows, maybe the jury agreed Carl was insane and acquitted him based on that alone. In any case, it is made clear that this is an emotional drama that seeks a truth that sometimes real logical justice does not provide. It deals with heavy subject matter such as racism because racism hurts people emotionally and so is a perfect way or pulling the audience in, and if it's done its job then you should have shed a few tears (or more) at the conclusion of it.",A Time to Kill
223,trevorgroves-64399,"Terrible, unrealistic movie",1,21 January 2017,"Probably the worst, most fake courtroom movies ever made. No way, no how in the REAL WORLD would the murdering defendant get acquitted ANYWHERE, let alone by the ""racist all-white jury.""

Lol gimme a break. Oh yeah, and never mind that the prosecution didn't get a summation in the la-la land Hollywood courtroom. In the REAL WORLD, it does not matter how horrific or heinous the crime is. Our law does not allow vigilante justice--no matter whether the avenger is black, white, green or purple. Even if the two racist whites had killed the little girl (which they didn't), the father who takes the law into his own hands to murder them in cold blood (not to mention that he blew the leg off an innocent cop in his illegal act) would rightfully and legally be convicted of murder. End of story. Even if the defendant were a white man in Mississippi, he would be convicted. The fact that the defendant in the movie was black just makes it an even faker ending.

Due to poor legal research, all the courtroom scenes were full of implausible scenarios including a judge who violated so many ethical rules, and McConaughey who was possibly the most under prepared attorney ever in a capital case - ostensibly so that Bullock could swoop in and save the day. This however, is highly unrealistic, and resulted in a very forced legal drama in nearly every courtroom scene.The last straw for me was a scene where McConaughey and Jackson discussed what questions to ask a witness DURING TRIAL. McConaughey was reluctant to Jackson's proposed question because he was afraid of the witness' possible answer, at this point, I had to turn the movie off. ANY attorney, pardon me - ANY PERSON, would have merely questioned the witness before trial to ascertain an answer so fundamental to a case, let alone a capital one.But, as I said previously, what the movie severely lacked in courtroom procedure, it made up for in the storyline. I never read the book, but if this is an accurate adaptation of one of Grisham's novels, I suggest that he do some intensive research on trial advocacy for his next.",A Time to Kill
225,malindasynnamon-51014,"A raw and poignant film that rips my heart out, but carries a strong message of how hate turns our society into one filled with victims of horrendous cruelty",10,13 May 2020,"I've seen this movie a couple times since it was first made but tonight was the first time I've watched it in over 10yrs, and it still evoked the same raw emotions in me that it did the 1st time. This is the first time I've watched it since becoming a Mother, and I can honestly say that if ANYONE harmed any of my 3 children in such a way, I would get trigger happy mighty quick. As world a majorly of parents,. This movie shows us just how differently and more difficult it was for a Black person in that time to garner the same empathy and understanding as a White person in the same situation. It showed just how deeply and violently people could hate, just because skin colors didn't match. And I'm not impervious to the fact that that kind of hate still exists today, but it's not the norm as it was back then. I fell in love with this movie first time I watched it. In my personal opinion, justice did prevail against all odds. And watching the characters put their lives in harms way to help another human, reminds me that amongst all the everyday evil we see splashed across the Newspaper Headlines or Internet, etc. there will always also be so much good to be found as well. I'll never understand how one can hate someone for the sole fact that their skin color doesn't match their own that they'd be willing to kill and kill again. This is an amazing, fast paced film that achieves what it set out to do",A Time to Kill

227,demondetox,"most heartbreaking, soul-shattering and mind-tearing",10,2 May 2017,"""A Time to Kill"" (1996)This isn't just any movie, filled with the A-League of Hollywood. This isn't just a story well written and brought to screens.The summary for this movie sounds so... simple. ""In Canton, Mississippi, a fearless young lawyer and his assistant defend a black man accused of murdering two white men who raped his 10-year- old daughter, inciting a revolt by local racist groups.""What this summary doesn't tell you, is, that 'A Time to Kill' is one of the most heartbreaking, soul-shattering and mind-tearing movies you could ever watch.The novel, with the same title, by John Grisham​ from 1989 was already almost too much to bear and it took every ready many tears to cope with the pain this story caused. Not a second of the novel - or the movie - goes by without the reader/watcher sobbing and fighting back the gasps of shock.Now, watching the story being told by the most talented people the movie industry has to offer is exactly the kind of cinema we have been missing for so many years.These days, Hollywood doesn't know how to make movies anymore. Back in the 90's they sure as hell ripped us apart from the inside out with amazing stories like this one.Instead of writing terrible scripts, they should invest more time reading and finding such diamonds like ""A Time to Kill"" by John Grisham.",A Time to Kill
228,GeneralWatson,Fantastic & Moving,9,29 May 2006,"This movie is by far one of the best I have seen in recent years. It brings together many genres and subjects such as action, history, the courtroom and the KKK.The former poster has a point, but I must point out that the average viewer will not see any legal goofs (and I come from a legal background).All of the performances are brilliant and the whole movie is thought provoking. The ending can't fail to move, by far some of the best dialogue ever written, whilst very deep, it is also very believable. The acting for such a sensitive movie is never brought into question.I have no negative comments about this film.",A Time to Kill
229,jason-obyrne1,"Incredible Storyline, Amazing Cast Unforgettable",10,5 March 2006,"The first time I so this movie I felt how it really should when a movie grabs you from start to finish without action but emotion. The storyline is based around a man Carl Lee Hailey( Samuel L Jackson) and his actions in which he takes after his daughter of 10 years old is raped and nearly killed by two red necks in the local town. When the two men are being brought to court they are shot a number of times and killed by the father who has been taken over with anger and revenge. This is when other characters are introduce into the movie like Matthew McConaughey who becomes Carl Lee lawyer, which I feel this was one of Matthew McConaughey best per formations and film's in which he has done.The movie itself comes with A-List actors/actresses like Kevin Spacey, Kiefer Sutherland Ashley Judd and Sandra Bullock. Also all great perforations, this movie couldn't have be done better it is prefect. America please don't make a remake.",A Time to Kill
230,el_p,Amazingly silly!,2,9 March 2006,"A lot have already been said about the poor script, acting etc.I myself am wondering. Is it really the best strategy for a defending lawyer to go out getting p**s drunk the night before the start of a murder trial? And on top of that risking the life of innocent people by driving a car highly intoxicated! The movie is just choc full of stupidities just like that! The class actors (not this time though)) such as Jackson, Spacey and a few others in minor roles must be highly ashamed to have their names credited to this utter piece of -insert bad word- excuse for a drama.See this movie only for its unintended parodical values.",A Time to Kill
231,mcribs,Stunning performances in a strong film,10,17 March 2006,"I believe this film contained everything possible upon release to make it a huge success at the box office, save one thing. Given the fact that the film had one of the strongest casts at the time, It's downfall was marketing.I believe this film should be ranked amongst the very best for its content in terms of plot, acting performances and all-star cast. A Time To Kill is a very topical film about racism in Southern America, also including a very moving portrayal of the effects of rape, particularly to a young child, amongst a whole community.A definitive must-see for the majority of film fans.",A Time to Kill
