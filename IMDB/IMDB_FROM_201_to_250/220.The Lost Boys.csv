0,TheLittleSongbird,It really is fun to be a vampire...,9,10 November 2011,"I do find Joel Schumacher very hit and miss, when he's good, he is very good, when he is bad, he is very bad. The Lost Boys is a contender alongside Veronica Guerin as the best of his movies. Of course the feel is very 1980s, hence I can understand why some may find it dated. However, the 80s feel adds to the charm of The Lost Boys to me. The film looks very stylish and has a killer soundtrack, my personal favourite soundtrack of Schumacher's movies actually. The script has some cheesy moments, but it is still very entertaining, and the story is swiftly and intelligently told. Schumacher's direction is one of his more secure directing jobs too, no heavy-handedness, no over-saturated colour or frenzied camera work here. The characters are very likable, especially Corey Haim's, and the acting is great. Haim is adorable, but it is Keifer Sutherland who stood out to me as the most impressive and perhaps most dynamic performer of the cast. All in all, a lot of fun, one of my personal favourites of the late 80s. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Lost Boys
1,bkoganbing,The Brothers Frog,7,9 March 2008,"In The Lost Boys Dianne Weist and her two sons are moving in with her father Barnard Hughes in the Pacific coastal town of Santa Clara. Some strange kids inhabit the place and when older son Jason Patric spots Jamie Gertz in a tight fitting blouse among them, the old raging hormones do take over. Kiefer Sutherland heads the gang and believe me they've got quite an initiation rite.His older brother's strange behavior is concerning Corey Haim and the only people who share his concern are a couple of brothers named Frog, played by Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander. It's rumored that Santa Clara has been a haven for vampires for many years, but the only two who want to do anything about it are the brothers Frog. Until now.The Lost Boys was one of the great Eighties Brat Pack movies, with a cast full of tongue in cheek performances. The Coreys, Haim and Feldman, were at the high points of their respective careers as teenage idols and they both show why they were. Best in the film however are Dianne Weist as their absolutely clueless mother and Edward Herrmann who employs her at his video store.There's a sequel coming out 21 years after this film made its debut. I'm trying to picture Haim, Feldman, and Newlander fighting another crowd of teenage vampires.Anyway you got to love a film with a pair of characters named Frog.",The Lost Boys
2,Leofwine_draca,Just turn off the brain and enjoy,6,18 August 2016,"At its best, Joel Schumacher's THE LOST BOYS is a witty and affectionate spoof of the vampire genre a la FRIGHT NIGHT, with good '80s effects work from Greg Cannom and a script that is littered with references to vampire movie folklore and films that have preceded it. At its worst, this is extremely dated and cheesy dumb entertainment, cynically aimed to exploit the younger market by mixing then-popular child stars with teenagers as their peers, and very few adults (I think perhaps three in total) in the cast. I know a lot of people hate Schumacher's work, but I remain pretty much ambivalent about this and his 8MM; I can enjoy the films for their merits but am also acutely aware of their failings.At least THE LOST BOYS is fast-paced, and easy enough to just sit back with and enjoy at face value. Although the costumes and mullet-style hairstyles have sadly dated, the age-old story of human vs. vampires can never really grow old, whatever the setting, so the '80s cheesiness is never overwhelming (except in the soundtrack, occasionally, in which atmospheric singing is mixed with clunky heavy metal rubbish). Schumacher keeps his tricksy, MTV-style visuals to a thankful minimum and packs the film with lots of jokes for it to appeal to a wide audience. The idea of a youthful vampire ""gang"" of male teenagers is used for its showy value alone (motorbike riding at night; midnight dare jumps off railway bridges) yet the themes are never fully explored above a comic-book simplicity. The makeup of the vampires isn't used until the latter stages of the film, which is for the best, and largely effective (somehow a few prosthetics and scary contact lenses work wonders).The trio of intrepid, GOONIES-style heroes are played by the two Coreys, that is Haim and Feldman, and the relatively unknown Jamison Newlander who takes a back seat in action. I'm pretty nonchalant when it comes to the two Coreys, but your mileage may vary: Feldman was always appearing in the movies I enjoyed back as a kid in the '80s, so I guess I was a bit of a fan of his, although I'm not too sure about his unsuccessful adult career later on in life. The ever-wooden Jason Patric (the ""star"" of the disastrous SPEED 2) is the handsome but poorly-acting male lead, complete with designer stubble, a greasy mullet and '80s padded leather jacket; unfortunately he has the most complex performance of the cast as he struggles to balance his human and vampire halves, although thankfully with so many minor characters he isn't focused upon too often. Jami Gertz is the bland female love interest, whilst Dianne Wiest and Edward Herrmann give strong support as the two lead adults.As for the vampire pack, two actors are distinctive: Kiefer Sutherland and Alex Winter. Winter (better known for his role in BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE) manages to genuinely look creepy as his weirdo vampire, and that's good because that's ALL he has to do. Sutherland, meanwhile, puts in a thoroughly nasty turn as the chief vampire and it's a delight to see him get his comeuppance (what, you're surprised?) - in fact he's the best actor in the film and this is his most famous early mainstream performance as far as I can recall. The rest of the vampire gang are pretty unmemorable and just kind of blend into one.THE LOST BOYS boasts an exciting, frenetic climax of spook house-show shenanigans as the vampires launch a frenzied attack on a rapidly-becoming-destroyed house, complete with taps bursting, stairways smashing down and all manner of huge explosions. Then there are the messy final disintegrations of the vampires which act as an interesting precursor and influence on the later mayhem of 1996's FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, with vampires dissolving in holy water, bleeding, getting impaled, and exploding. My only complaint is that Sutherland doesn't dissolve after being staked - surely a missed opportunity for a fine piece of gooey special effects work. THE LOST BOYS may not engage the brain particularly, but it's harmless stuff and quite entertaining if you don't take it too seriously.",The Lost Boys
3,SnoopyStyle,fun teen vampire movie,7,4 September 2015,"Brothers Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam Emerson (Corey Haim) with their divorced mother Lucy (Dianne Wiest) move to Santa Carla, California to live with her hippie reclusive father out on the farm. There are lots of missing people in the area after attacks from the sky. Michael falls for Star (Jami Gertz) who is the girlfriend of gang leader David (Kiefer Sutherland). Sam is befriended by brothers Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan Frog who are self-proclaimed vampire hunters.It's a fun teen vampire movie from Joel Schumacher. It's an enjoyable ride. The attention is split between Michael and Sam. That leaves the movie with two somewhat separate paths. It's not quite a dark older teen horror. It has a bit of childish fun with Sam and Edgar. That split personality is part of its charm but also holds it back from being great.",The Lost Boys
4,Prismark10,The Lost Boys,7,20 September 2020,"The title might have been borrowed from Peter Pan. Vampires never grow old.Joel Schumacher made a comedy horror film bathed with hidden meanings and featuring a rock soundtrack from the likes of The Doors.Lucy Emerson (Dianne Wiest) is divorced, broke and moves back to Santa Carla to live with her father.In tow are her sons, the older Michael (Jason Patric) and the younger Sam (Corey Haim.) Grandpa (Barnard Hughes) refers to the town as the murder capital of the world and several young people have gone missing.Michael is infatuated by a girl called Star (Jami Gertz) who is the girlfriend of motorbike gang leader David (Kiefer Sutherland.) However David is a vampire and Michael has been bitten and is now between two worlds.It is up to Sam to save his brother with the help of Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan Frog, they work in a comic store and regard themselves as vampire hunters. They think people in the neighbourhood are strange.On the surface, this is an enjoyable and a very 1980s romp. Moody, funny and colourful. It was the kind of thing that spawned Buffy the Vampire Slayer.The movie could be about alternative family structures at a time when Conservative America were emphasising the importance of the nuclear family. Lucy is groomed to be the mother for all the boys. Sam and Michael might have a potential stepfather as Lucy finds a love interest.There is also hints of homoeroticsm between David and Michael with Michael trying to resist the change to become a vampire. It might even refer to the scourge of Aids, hence the missing young people and the title of the movie, The Lost Boys. It could refer to a lost generation.",The Lost Boys

My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Os Garotos Perdidos"" (""The Lost Boys"")",The Lost Boys
6,mark.waltz,"Living la Vida local...forever (Maybe),",7,23 September 2015,"People are strange when they get caught in the rain. So goes the song that opens this comedy horror hit set in a small California town where the teen population is made up by 50% living and 50% Undead. Dianne Wiest is returning to her hometown with her children to live with her father (Bernard Hughes), a crotchety grouch who keeps a supply of his special soda which is off limits to his grand kids, and forgets to reveal certain secrets of the town to his returning child. The oldest son, disillusioned by having to have left his old home, manages to make new friends, but unfortunately they are the wrong kind of friends.Shortly before the family was seen driving up the California coast into the town, an amusement park was invaded by the teen night creatures who prayed down on a couple making out in their car, turning them into a late night snack. Wiest plays her typical happy-go-lucky single mom, and finds romance by getting a job at the local video store, finding romance with her boss, eligible bachelor Edward Herrmann. She's disturbed by the presence of the strange teenagers who come in, and the caustic conversation that occurs between them and Herrmann. The younger son gets mixed up with a bunch of strange kids whom we later find out are on the search for evidence of how they can destroy these midnight teen creatures.The violence increases, the blood flows, and yes if you haven't figured it out already, these lost boys (and girls) are vampires. That even includes a little boy, turned into a night creature desperate for nutrition for the human plasma. The idiotic teenage vampire hunters begin to suspect that Hermann might be the head vampire, and when a plot to expose him involving garlic doesn't work, it seems like they are on the wrong track. But is it too late for the older son? He seems to be turning into one of them, and if choosing the wrong crowd can get him turning into a creature of the night, then he doesn't have a chance of avoiding the stake.Sleep all day! Party all night! That is the promise that the older son's new friends give him, and all it will take is one last drink of the red liquid to complete their mission. But with evidence creeping in on this rough teenage crowd, it seems like the mirror of their souls will not be reflected as time runs out. This is horror comedy at its best, certainly not quite as gruesome as the ""Scary Movie"" films but definitely much better. There are lots of surprises along the way, and then there's a musical opus that is almost classic as a film reaches its dramatic and violence conclusion. Veteran actor Bernard Hughes gets a great tag-line, being sort of the Sylvia Sidney (""Mars Attacks"") hero to save the day, although he doesn't use bad music like Slim Whitman to do so.One of the great top popcorn films of the late 1980s, this was the film that established Dianne Wiest as one of my favorite actresses. She had started off in mostly supporting neurotic parts, and with ""The Lost Boys"", she began playing kindly moms confused by their children, and here, started the trend. After this along came ""Parenthood"", ""Cookie"", and my favorite of her parts on screen, the Avon lady mom in ""Edward Scissorhands"". There is some stupid comedy with the two vampire hunting teens, as they seem more like pals of Sean Penn's from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", but perhaps their characters influenced the creation of Buffy, the vampire slayer. It is a must for horror movie fans, and more than 25 years later, it seems like something just so fresh, almost like it came out yesterday.",The Lost Boys
7,kosmasp,Found,8,21 June 2020,"I recently heard from a friend that there were two fractions back when this movie was released. The ones who loved this movie and the ones who were into Near Dark. Now I reckon if you watched those movies back then, you may have a similar view and may like one over the other.If you are watching them now for the first time ... that will be a different story. Near Dark seems more mature, this has a bit of a Goonies vibe going for it with the kid vampire hunters. Still that doesn't mean this doesn't get down and dirty ... and ugly and violent. Quite the opposite is the case. And what a cast it has! Kiefer Sutherland alone would be top billing, but also everyone else who was cast into this. Nice job by the casting director I would say.Having said that, unlike the Highlander, there can be more than one (and I'm not talking sequels to this, though there are two of them, that were made 20 odd years after this was made)! So you can like Near Dark and this! They both have their strong suits and fangs, but they also both have certain ""weaknesses"" (flaws if you will) to boost ... highly enjoyable, if you don't mind the mayhem! Relish in it, it'll be fun",The Lost Boys
8,Sleepin_Dragon,The ultimate vampire movie.,10,23 October 2020,"So many wonderful movies came out of the 1980's, a time it seems where people genuinely didn't take themselves too seriously, and weren't afraid to push the boundaries.For my money this is the iconic vampire movie, the best of the lot. It's quite literally everything you would want and more. Yes it's a bit cheesy at times, but it's funny, gripping, captivating, and incredibly sexy, vampires should be sexy, and they sure are that.You have to love the clothes and hair, they are what you'd expect, the music is tremendous, absolutely brilliant all these years on.If you haven't seen it, I urge you to, it is still an absolute belter of a movie, one with added bite. 10/10.",The Lost Boys
9,classicsoncall,"""Kill your brother. You'll feel better.""",7,23 January 2019,"I've watched and reviewed almost thirty Dracula and vampire related flicks here on IMDb, and it never ceases to amaze me that virtually every one offers up a new element in vampire lore I haven't seen before. In this story, when you kill the head vampire, any of his 'offspring' vampires or 'half vampires' revert back to their normal selves. I didn't know you could have a half vampire, so that's an entirely new concept for me. Sounds like being just a little pregnant.Well I probably shouldn't have liked this picture as much as I did, so go figure. Kiefer Sutherland and Alex Winter made it for me as vampires David and Marko, they had just the right touch of menace and teenage rebel going for them. Starting out, I didn't think Michael (Jason Patric) would fall so easily into their little clique. Personally, I would have been a lot more hesitant to enter a dark, dreary cave with a bunch of social misfits who looked like they were looking for trouble. Now with Jami Gertz along for the ride, I could have been persuaded easily enough, but still, it would have taken some doing.I've always liked Corey Feldman too, the guy can be funny just standing there. I would have preferred a more suitably matched partner for him than Jamison Newlander as Edgar's brother, Alan Frog. The Frog Brothers sounded like they might have been on the wrong side of things in this story, but as vampire killers, they really seemed to know their stuff. I see Feldman reprised his character in a 2008 movie titled ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"", so I might have to look that one up and see how he progressed in his vampire killing career.The only recommendation I can make here is for having a good time with ""The Lost Boys"". It's got a quintessential Eighties look and vibe, and if you're into vampires, that's a bonus.",The Lost Boys
10,gavin6942,A Vampire Classic... Redefines the Genre,9,11 March 2007,"A single mother and her two sons move in to the grandfather's home in a West Coast town. The younger son (Corey Haim) meets two alleged vampire hunters and comic book collectors (one being Corey Feldman) while the older son (Jason Patric) becomes friends with actual vampires. Family ties become the ties that bind or the start of a civil war.This film really hits home for me. The creative force behind it took a genre (vampire films) and combined it with that 1980s youth mentality to produce a vampire film that will stand the test of time. Richard Donner was supposed to direct (he had previously worked with Haim/Feldman on ""Goonies"") but handed control over to Joel Schumacher. I have no real love for Schumacher, but he did something wonderful here and I can't help but commend him for that.The supporting cast is also great. Kiefer Sutherland (who has gone on to great things) and Alex Winter (who went on to make ""Freaked"" and then disappeared). Edward Herrmann plays Max, the mother (Dianne West)'s boyfriend. I have a fond memory of seeing this film for the first time at my friend Jodey's house and having another friend comment, ""I bet that guy drives a Lexus"" (due to Herrmann being a Lexus spokesman at the time). The memory still cracks me up.The cast and crew are great, but three things deserve some attention: music, comics and mythology. The music was great, to say the least. The use of the Doors ""People are Strange"" was nice. I don't like the Doors, but that's okay because Echo and the Bunnymen were kind enough to do a cover. There's even a large Jim Morrison poster in the vampire's den (which really seems odd, but alright). The best song is what I would call the theme which has children singing ""thou shall not..."" which is played at key moments to tug at the audience emotionally. I was moved, I won't lie. It's not even a good song, but it fits.The comics were a nice touch. Whoever wrote this (and I apologize I can't recall offhand) loved vampires and loved comic books, because they knew how to balance the two perfectly. Not only is a comic a driving medium for getting the word out on vampires, but there is just a comic book undercurrent that connects the primary protagonists. I was an avid collector in my youth, but I was certainly not as informed as Haim or Feldman on the specific nuances of old school Batman or Superman issues.Last, the mythology is amazing. Most horror films, and vampire films in particular, can be judged by the way they represent the source material. This movie addresses mirrors, garlic, sunlight, holy water, getting invited into residences and stakes through the heart. In some areas they deviate from the classical traditions, but do so in such a respectful way that this seems all the more perfect (any deviation has a plausible explanation -- it's not just merely thrown out the window). Being traditional and new at the same time is hard, but mastered here.If you see only only Haim/Feldman film, see ""Goonies"". If you see two, see this one. (If you see three, see ""License to Drive"" or ""Dream a Little Dream"", I guess.) And if you see only one 1980s vampire movie, see this one. I can think of no other film that appeals to both children and adults while staying both serious and light-hearted, classic and modern. Besides, you'll never see Kiefer Sutherland with hair like this again.",The Lost Boys
11,lee_eisenberg,"Nothing gets ""lost"" here.",7,24 March 2006,"Combining the old-fashioned horror flicks from the '30s and the Brat Pack feeling of the '80s, ""The Lost Boys"" comes out quite interesting. It features a family moving to a California coastal town which turns out to be inhabited by vampire punks. And these dudes sure know how to party! Some of the scenes here are really impressive, and the use of the Doors' song ""People Are Strange"" is also really neat. And it's got a good cast: Jason Patric, Dianne Wiest, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Alex Winter (of ""Bill & Ted"" fame), Edward Herrmann, and Barnard Hughes. And that ending? Maybe it was a little confusing, but I sure didn't see it coming! Really cool. Too bad that director Joel Schumacher degenerated in later years; ""A Time to Kill"" was his last good movie, as far as I know.",The Lost Boys
12,jboothmillard,The Lost Boys,5,5 October 2017,"It was coming up to the 30th anniversary of this well-known and popular 80s movie, and I was really annoyed I had never seen it before, so I'm glad I finally made an effort to get my hands on it, directed by Joel Schumacher (St. Elmo's Fire, Falling Down, Batman Forever, Phone Booth). The title is a reference to the Lost Boys in Peter Pan, who, like the vampires, never grow up. Basically the Emerson brothers, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim), from Arizona have moved to the small beach town of Santa Carla, California, with their recently divorced mother Lucy (Dianne Wiest), to live with their eccentric Grandpa (Barnard Hughes). While Lucy finds herself a job working in a video store run by local bachelor, Max (Edward Herrmann), Michael and Sam explore the boardwalk, there Michael becomes fascinated with young woman Star (Jami Gertz). While Michael follows Star, despite her seeming to be in a relationship with mysterious young biker gang leader David (Kiefer Sutherland), Sam meets the Frog brothers, Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan (Jamison Newlander), a pair of self-proclaimed vampire hunters, who give him horror comic books to warn him of the threat infiltrating the town. Michael finally talks to Star, but David goads him into following the biker gang to their hangout, a sunken luxury hotel beneath a dangerous cliff, he is initiated into the group. Star warns Michael not to drink from an offered bottle, telling him it is blood, but Michael ignores this, then he, David and the others head to the a railroad bridge, they hang off the edge over a foggy gorge, one by one letting go and falling down, and Michael follows. The next day Michael wakes up unaware how he got home, his eyes are sensitive to sunlight and has a craving for blood, leading him to attack Sam, with the dog Nanook retaliating, and seeing his semi-transparent reflection, Sam realises Michael is turning into a vampire. Michael convinces his terrified brother he is not yet a vampire, he needs his help, Michael slowly develops supernatural powers and also asks Star for help, they have sex. Meanwhile Sam deduces that Michael is half-vampire, his condition can be reversed by killing the head vampire, Sam and Frog whether it is Max that is the head vampire when he is invited to dinner by Lucy, but Max passes every test, so the boys decide to focus on David. David provokes Michael into killing, they stalk a group of beach goers, Michael is horrified when he instigates a feeding frenzy, he escapes and returns home, there Star reveals she is also a half- vampire looking to be cured, she reveals David had intended Star to seal her fate as a vampire, with Michael being her first kill. The next day, Michael is weakening, so Sam and the Frog brothers go looking for the vampire gang's lair, they find them all hanging and sleeping above, they impale vampire Marko (Bill & Ted's Alex Winter), awakening David and the others, but the boys escape into the sunlight, rescuing Star and half-vampire child Laddie (Chance Michael Corbitt). That evening while Lucy is on a date with Max and the grandfather is out, the teens arm themselves with water pistols filled with holy water, garlic cloves, a longbow and stakes, they barricade themselves in the house. Night falls and David's gang attack the house, one of the vampires is killed by the Frog brothers and Nanook, pushed and dissolved in a bathtub filled with garlic and holy water. Vampire Dwayne (Billy Wirth) attacks Sam, who manages to shoot an arrow his heart, it penetrates a stereo behind him, the electrocution causes his body to explode. Michael is then attacked by David, forcing him to use his vampire powers, he manages to overpower David, he is killed being impaled on a set of antlers, but Michael, Star and Laddie do not transform back to normal as expected. Lucy returns home with Max, he reveals himself as the head vampire, the previous invite into the house rendered him powerless, Max's objective was to have Star be the mother to his lost boys. As Max pulls Lucy to him and prepares to turn her into a vampire, Grandpa crashes his jeep through the wall of the house, Max is impaled by a wooden fence post, killing him and causing him to explode. In the end, Michael, Star and Laddie return to normal, and amongst the carnage and debris, Grandpa casually grabs a drink from the refrigerator, and says ""One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach: all the damn vampires"". Also starring Brooke McCarter as Paul. Sutherland is charismatic and cool, but equally menacing as the leader of the gang, and Haim and Feldman make an amusing duo, the other actors all do their parts fine as well, it is a fairly predictable story and not as witty as it could have been, but it's a good alternative teen movie, filled with laughs, plenty of violence, and with suspense and twists along the way, an interesting horror comedy.

13,Woodyanders,A totally 80's vampire horror winner,8,24 August 2021,"Teen Sam (likeable Corey Haim) and his petulant older brother Michael (hunky Jason Patric) move with their recently divorced mother Lucy (sweet Diane Weist) to the sleepy coastal town of Santa Carla, California. After Michael falls in with a group of renegade vampires led by David (Kiefer Sutherland at his most charismatic and menacing), it's up to Sam to save him.Director Joel Schumacher employs a flashy MTV music video style, offers a nice blend of horror and humor, and brings plenty of verve to the hugely enjoyable premise, with an especially lively and exciting climatic showdown with the vampires. In an inspired touch, being converted to vampirism is depicted as a form of adolescent peer pressure, plus there are a few clever riffs on vampire lore and the young bloodsucker bunch are extremely sexy as well.The sturdy cast gives this film a substantial additional boost: Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander are very funny as oddball local vampire experts the Frog brothers, Edward Herrmann does well as amiable video store owner Max, Jami Gertz looks positively ravishing as the seductive Star, Barnard Hughes lends delightful support as Sam's rascally grandpa, and Brooke McCarter, Alex Winter, and Billy Wirth are all quite effective and convincing as members of the vampire gang. Special kudos are in order for Cody as protective dog Nanook. Best of all, this film stands tall as probably the most 80's vampire horror picture made in that decade: The outrageous clothes, big poofy hair, blaring rock soundtrack, glittery cinematography by Michael Chapman, snappy editing, and witty dialogue that's peppered with knowing pop culture references all scream the 80's.

14,ccthemovieman-1,A Teen's Vampire Movie,6,18 May 2006,"This is a vampire movie for teenagers, or at least was when it came out. A number of these actors became well-known as adults. Teens definitely would like this film better than adults.However, older folks can still be entertained by this if they don't let the obnoxious teen attitudes get to them, and just enjoy the colorful scenes in here. It's lightweight horror-comic entertainment but gets pretty tense in the last 15-20 minutes.Overall, this just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth. I did let these teens' attitudes get to me, making me annoyed at times. I was a bit aggravating watching the too liberal mother (Diane Weist) in the way she handled her kids, too.There are so many other good vampires movies that worth keeping.

I needn't have worried as the story is as good as it was then with extra amusement given by the sight of hilarious '80s hairdos.At the start of the film Michael and his younger brother Sam move to Santa Carla, California with their recently divorced mother, little realising that it is the murder capital of the world and home to a group of vampires. When they go into town Michael is somewhat smitten by a girl called Star who it turns out is with David, the apparent leader of the vampires. At this point he thinks they are just the local bad boys and doesn't suspect a thing when they invite him to their lair for some Chinese food and a drink of ""wine"". Meanwhile brother Sam is hearing about the presence of vampires from the Frog Brothers who work at the local comic shop and their mother is getting to know Max after applying for a job at his shop. That night's activities have left Michael half way to becoming a vampire and if he is not to become a fully fledged vampire he must persuade his brother and the Frog brothers to help him destroy the head vampire... and not kill him too.Jason Patric and Corey Haim are good as Michael and Sam and Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander are suitably funny as the Frog brothers but it is Kiefer Sutherland who steals the show as bad boy vampire David, it was clear that he would go onto bigger things.

17,BA_Harrison,"The Lost Boys is the best teenage vampire film, and those who disagree can suck my big, fat jugular!",10,8 December 2009,"Hailing from the 80s, the decade when horror films really knew how to be fun, Joel Schumacher's The Lost Boys is naturally packed with all the trappings of the era, including a catchy, radio friendly pop/rock music soundtrack, impossibly loud shirts, and big hair. Whilst this nostalgia factor is undoubtedly a major factor in the enjoyment for its older fans (myself included), spirited performances from the enthusiastic cast, a very witty script, and excellent direction from Schumacher ensure that, even if you were still just a wicked glint in your father's eye when the film originally came out, The Lost Boys is a guaranteed good time.Equal parts horror, action, and comedy, the film stars Corey Haim and Jason Patric as brothers Sam and Michael, who move to coastal resort Santa Carla with their mother, unaware that it is a hotbed of vampire activity. After Michael is lured into joining a local gang of young bikers, Sam discovers that his brother's new acquaintances are members of the undead; employing the help of local vampire experts, the Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), he attempts to locate and kill the head vampire before his brother begins to feed and becomes a fully-fledged member of The Lost Boys.With classic turns from 'the two Coreys' (making it about as 80s as you can possibly get), great performances from a young Kiefer Sutherland, Alex 'Bill from Bill & Ted' Winter, Oscar winner Dianne Wiest, and Barnard Hughes (grandpa from TV's Blossom), plus excellent special makeup FX (from Greg Cannom) and slick and stylish visuals that avoid being so 'MTV' that they irritate, this is pure brilliance from start to finish.As for those whippersnappers who dare to utter the name Twilight in the same breath as The Lost Boys, consider these points before making the same mistake again: Twilight's Corey count is zero; Twilight is totally bereft of saxophone playing bodybuilders; and in Twilight, not one vamp suffers 'death by stereo'.

Looking like an INXS music video coupled with the self-amused swagger of ""Less Than Zero"", ""The Lost Boys"" has attained quite a following for '80s aficionados, but aside from giving the infamous ""Two Coreys"" (Haim and Feldman) amusing roles, it fails to broaden its scope beyond the youth market. Dianne Wiest is certainly nice to have around as the kids' mom, but this is pretty much the same character she played in ""Parenthood"". The design of the film and costumes seem far more important to director Joel Schumacher than a keen sense of dynamics between the characters, and the one-upmanship is like something out of a frat-house movie. It's both dreary and posed, like a Goth ad for hairspray. ** from ****",The Lost Boys
19,BandSAboutMovies,The perfect 80's horror movie,10,20 October 2018,"When I first put in The Lost Boys, my wife mentioned that she would watch it for a few minutes. Of course, she ended up watching nearly the whole thing, remarking how attractive every guy in it is, how she dressed as Star for Halloween as a little girl and reciting the dialogue word for word. After all, she says, it is the perfect 1980's movie.Michael (Jason Patric, who my wife also loves in Speed 2: Cruise Control) and Sam Emerson (Corey Haim, whose 976 hotline was called by my wife every single day) are the children of divorce, moving with their mother Lucy (Dianne Wiest, who my wife loves in Practical Magic) to the tourist town of Santa Carla.They'll be living with their strange grandpa (Barnard Hughes, Sisters) and trying to acclimate to what just might be the murder capitol of the United States (it used to be Youngstown, Ohio, a town I grew up close to). Just look at the boardwalk - it's covered with posters of missing kids.At a concert (once, SNL was funny and did this sketch based on this scene) featuring a shirtless and oiled up man playing saxophone (he's actually called The Believer if you read the Vertigo Lost Boys comic book that came out in 2016). Michael falls in love quickly with Star (Jami Gertz, Less than Zero), which brings him into the orbit of the Lost Boys, led by David (a perfect Kiefer Sutherland).Meanwhile, Sam is meeting Edgar and Alan Frog (Corey Feldman, another of my wife's 976 call loves and Jamison Newlander, who is in the 1988 remake of The Blob), two comic shop working kids who are really fearless vampire killers. They claim that Santa Carla is the hometown of numerous vampires and that his brother could be one of them.Tying into today's theme of video stores, the kids' mom soon meets Max (Edward Herrmann, Overboard), a kindly video shop owner who seems at odds with the Lost Boys that run the boardwalk (Bill S. Preston, Esq. himself, Alec Winter, is amongst their number).The divide between brothers before and after puberty is clearly delineated by this film, as Sam is content to sing old soul songs in the bathtub with Michael is out there chasing strange women, hanging from railroad bridges and watching rice turn into maggots. You can also see this movie as the struggle between growing up and growing away from your family. Or dealing with a mother who is starting to date again and how that changes your perceptions of her. There's also the fact that the title itself is a reference to J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan stories, boys who will never grow up.Of course, everything leads to a final conflict between the Emersons and the Lost Boys, with Max as their secret leader. I always loved how the video store owner's goal all along was to finally find a mother for his motley collection of vampiric ruffians. The way he reacts when she isn't afraid of them at the video store telegraphs this upon repeated viewings. And does anything beat grandpa's last line? ""One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach: all the damn vampires.""?After starting his directing career with The Incredible Shrinking Woman and D.C. Cab, Joel Schumacher really did an amazing job on this film. You can almost forgive him for his work on the Batman films. No, not really. You can never forgive that.This really is the perfect 80's film. I always felt for the vampires more than the humans. Never grow up. Never die. Never age. How does that sound bad? Sure, you have to kill other gangs on the boardwalk, but is that such a rough life?",The Lost Boys
20,Coventry,The 80s called. But only to state they are still inimitable!,6,11 October 2018,"It's actually very relevant to watch or re-watch a film like ""The Lost Boys"" in 2018, because we're currently at the heights of an era where horror stories taking place in (or bringing homage to) the 1980s are tremendously popular. Thanks to the success of shows like ""Stranger Things"" and movies like ""It"", almost every young and aspiring horror director wants his/her film to play in the eighties and feature that indescribably joyous atmosphere. Can't blame them, of course, because everything really was a lot better and much simpler back then. But anyways, it's films like ""The Lost Boys"" that truly make you realize that all these nowadays attempts to recreate the 80s will always just remain pathetic wannabes. Nothing, and I really do mean NOTHING, can beat the spirit and the vibes of an authentic 80s horror movie, and ""The Lost Boys"" is a stellar example to prove so. It's difficult to put into words what the exact differences are, but if you're old enough to have witnessed cinema in this era, or if you're a genuine fan of the horror genre, you'll definitely know what I mean. By this tirade, I certainly don't intend to claim that ""The Lost Boys"" is a masterpiece of horror. On the contrary, I even think it's quite overrated and that many people only regard it so dearly because they saw it upon its initial release and thought it was the hippest, freshest and coolest product since Coca Cola Light (or Diet Coke, depending where you are from). Following a few script-rewrites, ""The Lost Boys"" allegedly changed from a vampire version of Peter Pan (with child protagonists) to a Californian pop-culture vampire flick with teenage and adolescent protagonists. Whatever it is supposed to be, director Joel Schumacher fools around with all the traditional vampire trademarks and puts them down as nihilistic biker punks with flamboyant hairdos and party animal lifestyles. Hence the legendary tagline ""Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire"". The vampires' haven is the beach community of Santa Carla, where the town's carnival remains open 365 days per year and excessively oiled muscular saxophone players give away free open-air concerts. Santa Carla is nevertheless known as the murder capital of the US, as illustrated by the hundreds of ""missing children"" posters hanging all over town. We're supposed to assume that head vampire David (Kiefer Sutherland in an iconic role) and his gang are responsible for all these disappearances, but we actually don't ever see them murdering or abducting any victims. The main plot revolves on two brothers, Michael and Sam, moving to Santa Carla with their mother, following her divorce. Adolescent Michael is immediately drawn to David's cool vampire gang, whereas teenage Sam joins forces with the crazed Frog-brothers; who always hang out in the local comic book store and claim to be experienced vampire hunters. Several aspects of ""The Lost Boys"" are undeniably fantastic and utterly cool, like Corey Feldman's OTT performance, the soundtrack, the hanging-from-the-bridge sequence and the explicitly gross vampire deaths during the climax. Other, and sadly more important elements, are downright disappointing, like the absence of tension or genuine frights, the lack of real menace coming from the vampire characters, the inefficient comic reliefs (like grandpa) and the expulsion of mandatory monster essentials. For example, since when can you become a vampire by sipping from a bottle instead of getting bitten? ""The Lost Boys"" remains a must-see for horror lovers and admirers of typical 80s cinema in general, but in case you're searching for a truly great alternative vampire gem, check out ""Near Dark"" which got released in the same year, 1987.",The Lost Boys

22,Hey_Sweden,"""Holy s**t, it's the attack of Eddie Munster!""",7,4 September 2013,"Hip, slick 1980s vampire picture is good fun for fans of the sub genre. It's got a healthy sense of humour, some memorable lines of dialogue, an attractive and engaging cast of newcomers and veterans, a cool soundtrack, good visual effects, and some impressive production design and cinematography. It's very much of its time, with the title characters looking like some sort of rock band, but it's energetic and entertaining.Divorcée Lucy (a chipper, endearing Dianne Wiest) moves with her teen sons Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) to the community of Santa Clara in California. Michael falls in with a local gang led by David (Kiefer Sutherland), not knowing the truth that they're a bunch of blood sucking night crawlers. Luckily, Sam has made the acquaintance of Edgar and Alan Frog (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), two comic book store dudes who know the score and what to do about it.The interesting ensemble cast also includes old pros Edward Herrmann (as Max, a video store proprietor), and lovably ornery Barnard Hughes, as Michael and Sams' eccentric grandfather. The Lost Boys are played by Brooke McCarter, Billy Wirth, and Alex ""Bill S. Preston, Esq."" Winter. Jami Gertz is undeniably beautiful as Michaels' love interest.Working from a script by Janice Fischer, James Jeremias, and Jeffrey Boam, director Joel Schumacher does give his movie a sense of ""cool"" as well as a good pace; the finale is particularly exciting. Among the songs heard are a solid cover of The Doors' ""People Are Strange"" by Echo and the Bunnymen. The makeup effects by Greg Cannom are effective without being overdone.It does invite comparison to 1987s' other vampire favourite ""Near Dark"", but overall ""Near Dark"" is more thickly atmospheric and dreamlike and substantial. ""The Lost Boys"" is a hoot, but it may simply be too juvenile for some tastes.Seven out of 10.",The Lost Boys
23,Doylenf,"Good mixture of fun, fright and fangs...",6,21 October 2006,"Joel Schumacher may have taken brickbats for his ""Batman and Robin"" film (according to its detractors who hate what it did to the Batman franchise), but they have no cause to complain about the horror, humor and fantastic pleasures of THE LOST BOYS, a rich time capsule from the 1980s that put new zest into vampire films.Not that any of it is meant to be taken seriously. The story is roughly that of a divorced mom (DIANNE WIEST) who moves to a small California town of Santa Clara where she expects to raise her two normal sons (JASON PATRIC and COREY HAIM). The minute the boys zoom off on their motorcycles to visit the local boardwalk, they run into the local bad boys who don't seem too much worse than your normal bad kids. KIEFER SUTHERLAND with his bleached blond hair is the leader of the gang and Jason has his eyes on Kiefer's girlfriend.But this is no normal gang. And Corey is soon telling his mother that they have to have a serious talk about something. He's sure his brother is becoming a vampire after hanging out too much with Kiefer and the gang. The story takes a dark turn but never loses its giddy sense of humor as the bat cave boys begin to act up. One of the funniest scenes has Corey on the phone asking her to come home from a dinner date while Jason is flying in and out the window on another phone assuring her things are OK.It's rib tickling fun and Schumacher gets just as much humor out of the whole thing as he does horror. There's a busy soundtrack full of '80s sounds and this is one of the reasons Andrew Lloyd Webber picked Schumacher to direct his PHANTOM OF THE OPERA years later. He had seen THE LOST BOYS and was very impressed with Schumacher's handling of visuals and music.If you like vampire flicks, this is one of the best--quirky fun with enough special effects for horror fans to enjoy to the max.",The Lost Boys
24,preppy-3,A great horror/comedy,10,13 February 2001,"This got blasted by a lot of critics when it came out in 1987. I never knew why. I liked it then, I like it now. Two brothers (gorgeous Jason Patric, annoying Corey Haim) move with recently divorced mom (Dianne Wiest) to CA and get mixed up with a gang of vampires. Plot wise this is no great shakes and some of the acting is really bad (Corey Feldman and Jami Gertz in particular), but the film is a lot of fun to watch. It moves quickly, looks great (especially on DVD), has some very good performances (Kiefer Sutherland and Wiest really stand out) and is never too gory or bloody (film deserves a PG-13, not the R it got). WARNING! Some possible spoilers ahead----Also some of the lines are priceless--""My brother! A scum-sucking, blood-sucking creature of the night! Wait till mom finds out!"" or ""Don't kill me Mike. Basically I'm a good kid."" Also, there are fairly decent special effects, a few good jolts and a great soundtrack. One of the best horror comedies of the 1980s.

Not really holding up that well, it still manages to entertain with its eye-candy and teen idol panache. It manages, if not full well, to combine Horror and Comedy and deliver an entertaining, fluffy piece of film that was better then and in hindsight somewhat sugary.It has a fresh over-saturated colored look and synth beat that came straight out of the MTV generation's psyche and the movie managed to capture that current of an electric pallet and teen swagger that was in much display as the decade unfolded.Overall, it is better as a time capsule than a period piece of Art. It has a runway fashion appeal for the female crowd and some gory goings-on for the boys and for this it is a rather unique take and as a one shot it is a curiosity that is worth checking out.",The Lost Boys

Meanwhile Sam has met Brother's Edgar (Corey Feldman) & Alan Frog (Jamison Newlander) who warn him that the area is crawling with Vampires which Sam thinks is ridiculous, that is until he witness his Brother Michael turning into a Vampire as he flies, has no reflection, sleeps all day & wears sunglasses all the time. Sam calls Edgar & Alan who say they will help destroy the head Vampire which will cure Michael, however David & his Vampires are vicious killing machines...Directed by Joel Schumacher I have to say I really liked The Lost Boys & think it's a great 80's teen horror. The script by Jeffrey Boam, Janice Fischer & James Jeremias is a light comedy horror that isn't exactly deep or meaningful but it provides terrific entertainment if your in the right mood, it moves along at a great pace & is never boring or dull. The character's are great & very likable especially Sam & the Frog Brother's who provide some pretty amusing moments, usually silly over-the-top character's don't work for me but these guys did from the way they talk & ride everywhere on BMX bikes to a scene where they burst into a Church interrupting a christening to fill bottles with holy water. There's some cool action scenes & some nice gore along with plenty of bloodsucking Vampires. This is also one of those films that has a barrel load of memorable dialogue, there's some really cool quotable lines in The Lost Boys. It's not perfect & there are a few plot holes here & there like Max (Edward Herrmann) having a reflection when the other Vampires don't but it didn't seem to matter that much as I was having fun with it.Director Schumacher does a good job & the whole film is pretty stylish throughout, there's some nice Vampire attack scenes, some good action & he keeps things moving at a nice pace. I also have to mention the soundtrack as it's brilliant, I don't usually notice the music in a film that much unless it's really bad but The Lost Boys has a fantastic 80's soundtrack that I thought was great. There's some decent gore although it's not too gruesome, there are some exploding Vampires, stakes through the heart, impalings, severed limbs, melting Vampires, biting, blood squirting, flesh ripping & of course death by stereo.Technically The Lost Boys is great, it's well made with nice production design with & good special effects. The acting was pretty good & the Frog Brother's are very funny.The Lost Boys is a stylish, cool, funny 80's Vampire horror film with an awesome soundtrack that I must admit I really enjoyed. Definitely recommended.",The Lost Boys
27,CinemaSerf,"I've had some bad Chinese meals in my time, but this one takes the cake!",7,24 August 2020,"I hadn't seen this for years - and I have to say it's held up reasonably well over the last 30-odd years. It's a contradiction to every vampire film that has ever been made - the boys with the fangs are handsome, trendy and led by the enigmatic Kiefer Sutherland. Two young brothers - Jason Patric and Corey Haim, alongside their mum arrive in a California town, from Phoenix, to stay with their grandfather. Pretty soon, things are starting to go bump in the night and the family start to realise that all is not as it seems and perilous times loom. It's a fun ""horror"" film, it has precious little terror or gore and any chilling that does go on certainly doesn't involve your spine. It has a great 1980s soundtrack - plenty of high octane action and attitude and is well paced to speed along nicely for just over 90 minutes. The dialogue is a bit cheesy and the girls' roles are pretty stereotyped but hey, it's the original teen vampire flick with a good twist at the end and is way better than any of it's successors in the genre.",The Lost Boys
28,Bunuel1976,"THE LOST BOYS (Joel Schumacher, 1987) **1/2",6,20 October 2007,"I recall this film coming out, but have stayed away from it until now because I had assumed it was strictly a modernistic juvenile version of the vampire legend. As it turned out, the real heroes are resourceful, knowledgeable boys a' la THE MONSTER SQUAD (1987) – which I did catch on VHS many years ago and now intend to revisit soon.The cast is certainly interesting: Kiefer Sutherland may have the showiest role (as the lead vampire), but Jason Patric is also good as the confused new kid in town unwittingly initiated into the vampire cult. The ubiquitous two Coreys (Haim and Feldman) still exude the charm which made them a popular team around this time; Barnard Hughes almost steals the show as the eccentric grandpa who eventually saves the day, and utters the film's great closing line; Dianne Wiest and Edward Herrmann are less appealing in their roles as the adults.The vampire make-up is OK, and it was nice to see them hanging upside down in caves rather than lying around in coffins. The extended climactic fight may be excessively gory for a kiddie film, but ends the film on a satisfactory note. The reveal of nerdy Herrmann as the villain was not too convincing – nor is his clamoring for Wiest as his vampire bride!! – and the film would have been better off without them.I liked the in-jokes where movie posters/video box covers – including O LUCKY MAN! (1973) – were incorporated into the film's production design; also effective was the use of a children's ditty on the soundtrack – but that sax-playing muscleman/rock star act was beyond camp. By the way, executive producer Richard Donner was intended to direct but passed on the chores to Joel Schumacher who, all things considered, made a slick, hip and entertaining job of it.",The Lost Boys

That should ruffle some feathers. Especially considering I've never even seen Twilight.The Lost Boys were stylish, bad, and didn't say much. They didn't go around making threats or talking themselves up, they hung out, made a little trouble, and killed a partier or two.

One of the main abilities of this is to actually update the traditional forms of vampire lore into a more modern and rather intriguing series of concepts that play into the era pretty nicely. Rather than feature the traditional European version of the creature that runs around dressed to impress with a focus on keeping his identity a secret at all times, this one's use of rebellious free-spirits who don't really care and figure on just draining anyone they believe will blow their identity but look and act like typical teenagers allows them to blend in quite nicely and make it seem like an attractive, worthwhile life. The updating of the hunting tricks is pretty clever as well, and the ways of incorporating them into the story makes for some nice fun, as well as the different confrontations towards the end when they invade the coven to wipe them out which generates the film's action quotient. While it's got some signs of the time present that come off as goofy, as well as a few other minor flaws, it's overall really fun and entertaining.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",The Lost Boys

One thinks without this, there would be no Twilight, but thats my only criticism of the film.What we have is one of the most fun horror movie ever made, in the same Vein as 'Fright Night' this has young characters in jeopardy, but always with a little pop culture reference at hand.The main thing that is noticeable in this movie, is the homo-eroticism.If you read between the line, the film could be about young men coming out of the closet, David only really comes out of his shell when he meets Michael and the rest of the titular characters, but dismisses the rest of the crew.The wine scene could be classed a a euphemism to another certain bodily fluid, which 'converts Michael, and the longing gazes between him and David are rife throughout.That aside,it's a great movie, with laughs and scares aplenty, and some of the best effects seen in a movie in 1987.This is the movie that put Haim, Sutherland ad Patric on the map, and they should be eternally grateful.The recent sequels have not tarnished the film, and that first sequence of Sutherland appearing on the boardwalk, is as iconic 24 (he he) years later as it was back then.A great vampire movie, and one of the best cult films ever made.",The Lost Boys

The older son is in fact being recruited by said vampires and is already becoming one after drinking a strange liquid. All in all I love this film and it is one of my favorite vampire flicks. Good mixture of action, horror, and especially for me...comedy.

Meanwhile the mother (Dianne Wiest) starts dating a supposedly suspicious shop owner, Max (Edward Herrmann). A young Jami Gertz plays the sole babe. This is a stylish and hip vampire flick that expertly meshes horror and humor. I usually don't like horror-comedies, but this one works well. The horror is pretty horrifying (in a fun way) while the comedy is consistently amusing. The coastal California locations are superb. However, the excellent train trestle sequence was shot in Alabama (see below). I generally don't like 80's new wave pop rock, but the soundtrack is enjoyable, particularly the creative Lost Boys Theme ""Cry Little Sister"" by Gerard Mcmann (with a catchy chorus sung by children). ""Lost in the Shadows"" by Lou Gramm is good as well. INXS, Roger Daltry and Echo And The Bunnymen also have songs on the soundtrack, the latter group doing a mid-80's version of The Doors' ""People Are Strange,"" which is very close to the original song and actually sounds like its Jim Morrison singing. The sax-playing beefcake sequence featured one-hit wonder Tim Cappello playing ""I Still Believe.""Speaking of beefcake, this zeroes in on my problem with this movie: There are multiple lost boys, but only one lost girl. Although Gertz is good-looking she's always wearing a long skirt and so we never get a good look at her beyond her face (and I'm not talking about nudity, btw), with the exception of a campfire sex scene that doesn't work because it's premature and overall lame. Needless to say, a mid-80s horror flick without babes is scandalous. Director Joel Schumacher needed to take notes from the six Friday the 13th movies that had been released by the time ""The Lost Boys"" was shot. Oh, wait, Schumacher is gay; nevermind. While the movie was largely shot in Santa Cruz, California, the vampire cave entrance was 350 miles south at Rancho Palos Verdes whereas the train trestle sequence was shot in Bayou Canot, Mobile, Alabama. The boys were able to jump into the underlying fog because the river was only 12-15 feet below, although the movie gives the impression that they were way higher up. Interior shooting was done in the studio at Burbank. The movie runs 97 minutes.GRADE: B",The Lost Boys
38,zetes,Surprisingly fun,8,11 April 2010,"Super corny '80s vampire flick. Brothers Jason Patrick and Corey Haim, along with their mother, Dianne Wiest, move to their new home in a California city known as ""the murder capital of the world"". Turns out the murderers are actually vampires, hair metal vampires to be exact, lead by Kiefer Sutherland, giving basically the same performance he did the previous year in Stand by Me, except with, you know, fangs. Alex Winter of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of his handful of cohorts. Patrick falls for a hot chick (Jami Gertz), who leads him to Sutherland's lair, where Sutherland turns him in to a half vampire. He'll only become a real vampire if he kills. Meanwhile, Haim hooks up with Corey Feldman (yay!) and Jamison Newlander, two kids who somehow own a comic book store and are secretly vampire hunters. It's nutty and pretty sloppy (it is, after all, directed by Joel Schumacher), but, boy, is it fun. Haim and Feldman, in particular, are hilarious. I could do without Jason Patrick, though. He always come off as kind of a douche to me.",The Lost Boys
39,Mr-Fusion,"Doesn't take itself seriously, and that's the charm",7,28 October 2015,"""The Lost Boys"" is one of those movies that walks the line between awesome and silly, but never really goes overboard. There's a surprising likability to the entire movie, vampire darkness steeped in teen movie, and it feels like something that would've gone off the rails in lesser hands. But what I really like about this movie is that it is shamelessly a product of its time; the formidable array of mullets, the look, the feel. There's no way to remake this without genericizing the hell out of it. No lubed-up sax guy, no deal. And speaking of the '80s, this is definitely one of the really good soundtrack movies. Who knew Echo and the Bunnymen would do a great Doors cover? And I admit no shame in saying that I've always liked the Lou Gramm song. I don't care if it's overwrought, ""Lost in the Shadows"" represents this movie to me. Not sure what it is, but it's cool.""The Lost Boys"" is a lot of fun, definitely in the midnight movie vein. It should always be watched with like-minded friends.7/10",The Lost Boys
40,christopher-underwood,overwhelmed by the gleeful desire to laugh at everything.,6,18 October 2020,"Fine opening with shots above Santa Cruz Beach boardwalk and it has to be said that the film has a good look and solid sound throughout. Trouble is what a lot love this for makes me cringe and I'm aware that had I been born in the early 70s, I too might have been able to enjoy this much more. This has, for good or bad, a real 80s feel, lots of silliness, big hair, big shoulders and big music with nothing taken too seriously. Of course, Ghostbusters (1984) dealt with ghosts and not vampires but there silliness was tempered and gradually taken more seriously and I feel the comedy and the scares work better in this way. With The Lost Boys there is a lot of enthusiasm and hectic activity and shouting and screaming but ultimately nothing really matters and all the effort put into the make-up, special effects and soundtrack seems overwhelmed by the gleeful desire to laugh at everything.",The Lost Boys
41,siderite,A childhood gem,8,4 August 2007,"This movie was something I have seen on an old VHS when I was a kid. I loved it, but for some reason I could only remember that it was with vampires, Keifer Sutherland and the song (Strange, by the Doors, great song). Actually, I best remembered the song. (and it was a cover by Echo & The Bunnymen, too)So I have been searching for it, and saw it again. It certainly did not have the same effect as it had in my childhood, but it was nice nonetheless.First, to the people that said this is one big commercial: you are right. It is all about music, youth and corruption. Watch MTV, enjoy the ""young rebel"" fashion that is supported by all major labels, buy the tape, but don't get too corrupted, we need you to work when you grow up. But it is also one of the best vampire movies of all time.The plot is about a gang of vampires, enjoying their night life and total freedom, but after all, they were ""made"", one head vampire was at fault, and the idea is rendered beautifully by the death of Kiefer's character. With all his vampirism gone, he is just one dead young kid.If you have the time to reminisce over the gone golden era of the 80's, where people still remembered the 60's (""I was this close to being called Moon Child or Moon Beam"") and still enjoyed moderate freedom.Update 2020: watched it again. I remembered something very different: something visceral, about the physical sensation of wanting to belong, of lost youth when you just want to let go. This time it all felt jumbled and poorly edited, with not enough attention given to any of the components of the film. I guess it matters a lot what age you are when you watch it.",The Lost Boys
42,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Sex, blood and rock-n-roll!",10,11 June 2002,"One thing I can always promise you is that when people talk about the best vampire movies of all time, The Lost Boys is guaranteed to be on their list. In the 1980's, films were all about action, sex appeal, muscles and very good looking teenagers. Joel Schumacher, who was starting out at the time, was given the script and it was about kid vampires. He thought it sounded silly and offered a different idea of it being teenage vampires on motorcycles; who knew he had one of the best ideas that would create such a huge cult classic for decades? I absolutely adore this movie, everything about it: it's style, the script, the humor, the horror, the make up, the cast and the music. While dated, it still has a timeless fun style to it that will entertain those who are seeing it for the first time as if it was the opening weekend at the movie theater. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and it's interesting to see that I still love The Lost Boys so much, as an adult I have a different love for it than ""the boys are sooo cute!"", well, they still are, but besides the point, The Lost Boys is a great movie that will not disappoint.Michael and his younger brother, Sam, move with their just-divorced mother, Lucy, to Santa Carla, plagued by gang activity and unexplained disappearances, what better place to take your children?! The family moves in with Lucy's father, an eccentric old man who lives on the outskirts of town, and enjoys taxidermy as a hobby. The center of town life is the Boardwalk, which is plastered with flyers of missing people. While Lucy gets a job at a local video store run by a conservative man named Max, Michael becomes fascinated by Star, a beautiful young woman who lives with the mysterious leader of the local gang, David. Meanwhile, in the local comic book store, Sam meets brothers Edgar and Alan Frog, self-proclaimed vampire hunters who give Sam horror comics to teach him about vampires. When Michael meets Star the next night, David provokes him into a motorcycle race, in which he is baited into almost going over the edge of a sea cliff. David invites Michael to their lair, where he is put through an unsettling initiation that includes drinking blood from a wine bottle. The next night, while Sam takes a bath, his dog, Nanook, is forced to fend off Michael's bloodlust-driven attack on Sam. When Sam looks for his dog, he finds his brother has been attacked, but also that Michael's reflection in a mirror has become transparent. Sam calls the Frog brothers for help, they say the only way to save his brother is by killing the head vampire who they suspect is Max, Lucy's boss and new boyfriend.It's hard to pin point what is so great about this movie. I love the cast, starting with Kiefer Sutherland who plays David, the lead of the Lost Boys. He has only a few lines, but you'd think he was the title character the way he presents himself, you can tell he had so much fun with this bad boy role. Dianne Wiest, one of my favorite actresses, what a beautiful lovely woman she is, her character is so warm and wonderful. She plays a great mom and is so believable the way she reacts to the situations she's put in by her crazy sons. This was also the start of ""The Two Corey's"", Corey Haim and Corey Feldman who had great chemistry along side with Jamison Newlander as they are hunting for vampires. They're like Rambo's who take themselves way too seriously and that's why they are so hilarious but great at what they do. The make up effects are just great and the vampires had such a sleek sexy look to them but still terrifying; the scene where they show Michael their vampire faces is one of the most memorable and most frightening. This is without a doubt the sexiest vampire movie you could watch. It has everything a vampire film should have to entertain. I still love showing this movie to my friends who never saw it, I envy the look on their faces at the end when they fall in love with it too as I wish I could say I was seeing it for the first time too. But I watch it each time and love it as if I were watching it for the first time, it's a fantastic movie, I could go on and on, but I'll just end with: please watch this movie. You better be buying this movie right now as you're finished reading this comment.10/10",The Lost Boys
43,blanbrn,"Cool, slick, wicked, and stylish vampire flick that rocked the 80's!",8,17 August 2008,"""The Lost Boys"" is without a doubt one of the best vampire films ever made. Simply for the way it was presented in a cool and hip kind of way it's hard core and Gothic gory involving teenagers captured the late 80's just fine. And the star power and music of the film carried it to blood thirsty success. A family a mother(Diane Wiest)and her two teenage sons(Corey Haim and Jason Patric) move to an oceanside coast city in California to live with her father(Barnard Hughes). Only from the start the family sees and finds that this town is unlike any other it's just wickedly strange! Kiefer Sutherland who plays heavies so well is timely wicked and cruel as the leader of a cult vampire crew that causes havoc upon the town. And you find with this vampire classic that it's not camp or cartoon like as it's more fun with stylish gore and exciting drama, the feel good fun is even more enjoyable with Corey Feldman entering as a young vampire hunter! Plus you don't have to worry about any unreal special effects as the scenes and action of this film are straight up. Really probably maybe the best vampire film ever made it has such good drama and the acting from the stars are tremendous a treat seeing the work of Haim and Feldman plus Sutherland is wickedly raw and the films music all make for a hip and cool stylish cult classic.",The Lost Boys
44,MovieAddict2016,A rather disappointing cult film.,5,9 December 2005,"""I don't see a TV, Michael. No TV means no MTV.""So says Sam (Corey Haim) to his brother (Jason Patric) as they check out their new house in Santa Cruz. That quote best describes ""The Lost Boys"" -- a vampire film for the MTV generation (opening with Echo and the Bunnymen's ""People Are Strange"" Doors cover); for people who want lots of blood and guts but no intelligence. The movie is billed as a comedy but it's not funny. It's also billed as a horror but it's not scary. What is it, then? I don't know. Like its characters, it seems to be lost.Michael and Sam move to Santa Cruz with their mother (Dianne Wiest), which happens to be the murder capital of the world. Little do they know that a blood-thirsty pack of teenaged vampires are responsible for the mass murders of the city. They roam the boardwalks at night, spotting prey, and feasting as they dive down through the sky for a midnight snack. Security guards are killed, children are killed, and stoned party animals are killed -- all at night, by the vampires, who -- as legend has it -- are allergic to daylight.The movie was made in a time when special effects were so poor that showing the vampires flying through the sky might seem ridiculous. Instead, we get lots of swooping camera techniques that try to make us see through the eyes of the lead vampire, David (Kiefer Sutherland), who transforms Michael into a vampire one night and literally hangs out with him.The title for the film comes from the story of Peter Pan and his lost boys (all four lead vampires share the names of these lost boys, too). In that tale, the kids in Neverland never grew old for unexplained reasons. Here they never grow old because they've vampires. They are immortal. But, of course, onion garlic and holy water and stakes through the heart will kill them. Tough break.Clever concept, but poor execution, helmed by Joel ""Batman and Robin"" Schumacher, who also directed ""St. Elmo's Fire,"" which perhaps explains why Sam has posters of Rob Lowe and Molly Ringwald on his bedroom wall. (Why, exactly, he has a poster of Lowe stripping out of a shirt, can be left for explanation by someone who knows.) After his brother becomes a ""half-vampire,"" Sam alerts the Frog Brothers, local vampire hunters with way too much time on their hands. (One of the brothers is also played by Corey Feldman, who used to be a huge teen icon during the 1980s and now has trouble finding jobs anywhere.) They go on a rampage, kill one of the vampires named Marko (Alex Winter), and are pursued by the rest of the pack.What's even worse is that the film tries to implement more than a few twists, especially towards the end, which soon becomes absolutely unbearably awful, unsatisfying and absurd. I have to wonder how on earth this movie ever gained as good a reputation as it has over the years.To be fair the cast struggles with the material. Jason Patric is acceptable as the lead hero, but I never felt any strong feelings for him. The two Coreys (Haim and Feldman, who reunited on several projects over the years since ""The Lost Boys"") aren't even very humorous, especially Feldman, a comedic relief character who usually manages to become the annoyingly likable persona of any given film, but evidently tries too hard here, particularly with his forced low voice (no, it isn't natural). It's one of his worst roles that I've seen him in. Edward Herrmann, as Wiest's mandatory love interest and possible on-the-side vampire (or so Sam suggests at one point in the movie), is severely miscast -- an actor used to playing roles such as that in ""Richie Rich"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty"" who tries to act smart here and doesn't succeed very well at all. The best performance comes from Kiefer Sutherland, as David, but his role is misadvertised -- we are led to believe from the commercials and posters and DVD covers that he is one of the main characters of the film, yet I'd be surprised to hear that he shares more than fifteen minutes of screen time. Sutherland presumably enjoyed working with Schumacher (a real hit-and-miss director), because he teamed up with him again for ""Phone Booth"" (2002), which is undoubtedly superior in almost all ways.""The Lost Boys"" simply isn't very scary, funny, or even entertaining. The ending is embarrassing and tries to throw in a bunch of twists, but they're just plain silly. It's not a very good vampire flick and not even on par with some of the best cheesy horror flicks out there (""Gremlins"" is the perfect example of this sort of movie done right). It tries to add originality to a concept that has been squeezed dry over the years since Max Schreck and Bela Lugosi made it popular (film-wise, that is). How disappointing that they cannot even manage to make us laugh at some of the vampire stereotypes, and instead serve us some laughably bad ideas with a laughably bad script and a truly lame ""twist"" ending. Mel Brooks' ""Dracula, Dead and Loving it!"" wasn't anything special but at least it was smart enough to spoof a dry formula, rather than suck its blood dry, so to speak.",The Lost Boys

46,sddavis63,A Campy Attempt At Vampire Fun,5,7 April 2010,"There are basically two distinct (but related) stories in one going on in ""The Lost Boys,"" which revolves around a family (mom Lucy and brothers Michael and Sam) who move to Santa Carla, California from Phoenix after mom's divorce. Santa Carla apparently has a reputation as the ""murder capital of the world,"" and we soon find out why.The first of the stories begins when Michael (Jason Patric) meets a local beauty named Star, who's tangled up with a local gang. This is the story with potential. The gang are actually a gang of ""young"" vampires, who set out to ""recruit"" Michael. I liked the idea of young vampires, which of course builds on the whole problem of gangs, and kids who don't fit in but want to fit in. The gang was pretty convincing, and Kiefer Sutherland especially was great as David, the apparent leader of the gang. Had this been developed as a straight horror-vampire movie about this roving gang of young vampires terrorizing the town and this family in particular it might have been a very effective horror movie. However, those who put the story together decided to introduce the second part of the story, which frankly didn't work as well.In Santa Carla, a couple of even younger teens (led by Corey Feldman) know what's going on and fancy themselves as vampire hunters, their knowledge about the undead apparently having come out of vampire comic books. To save his brother, Sam (Corey Haim) hooks up with these guys, who use every cliché trick in the books (garlic, wooden stakes, holy water, sunlight) as they set out to destroy the creatures of the night. To me, this aspect of the story came across as silly, and every time the ""horror"" aspects of the gang started to become convincing, we got Feldman et. al. getting back into the picture and turning this into a vampire-hunting comedy. The final confrontation is overdone rather than climactic, and in the end Grandpa comes across as being as silly as the young vampire hunters.To its credit, the movie surprised me with the final identification of the ""head vampire,"" who has to be destroyed to release Michael. In the end, though, I wish this had stuck to horror and let go of the attempts to be a teen comedy at the same time.",The Lost Boys
47,g-bodyl,Good Blend of Comedy/Horror!,8,7 July 2013,"The Lost Boys is an 80's vampire film that is better than most vampire films out there. It also helps that it is part comedy. There are some very amusing scenes that involves the grandfather, the dog, and of course the Frog Brothers. This film is filled of lush cinematography wince the camera work and lighting is above-average. The makeup is also really good and is better than it's time.Joel Schumacher's film is about a widow and her two teenaged sons moving to Santa Clara to find out the town is not all that peaceful. The older son Michael and the younger one Sam finds out the town is full of vampires. With the help of the Frog Brothers, they must eradicate the gang of vampires known as the Lost Boys in order to get peace.The acting is not all that bad. Corey Haim is decent as Sam but his acting wavers every now and then. Jason Patric is good portraying the stormy Michael. Dianne Wiest is okay but a little annoying as the mother. Corey Feldman is amusing and reminds me of his role in the Goonies. Kiefer Sutherland is actually really creepy as David, the leader of the Lost Boys.Overall, this is a fun vampire film that has plenty of funny moments. In fact, I see this more of a comedy than a horror. But, it's still very creepy. I loved some of the high, aerial views set to 80's rock-n-roll.

In my personal opinion, I think it depends on what the film entails and the reason for it being the best. I would reckon this film is one of the best.I really like how they got actors who aren't really famous because they didn't need to be Hollywood's great to be good, they were truly good. The only person I did recognised was Alex Winter as one of the biker men. He was involved in 'Bill and Ted's excellent adventure'. He actually did look like a real biker with hair extensions and wearing a black biker jacket. The hair extensions probably hurt I reckon haha!I thought Jami Gertz as Star looked absolutely beautiful, she still is and like, she seems to be such a pro as an actress! I never seen her before in films that I've seen. I'm glad they got her character and Jason Patric's character Michael together, they were definitely a match, I was over the moon!Didn't anyone think Corey Haim looked so much like the kid from 6th sense? I thought he looked 110% like Haley Joel Osment, they are literally clones honestly.

54,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Vampires done the right way in this '80s cult classic,8,6 June 2011,"Living in the modern era of overdone vampire stories, ""The Lost Boys"" makes for a worthy retro antidote. With films and TV shows full of characters who simply are vampires these days, ""Lost Boys"" reminds us how part of the allure of the vampire is the mystery and suspense created by not exactly knowing if someone is a vampire or even better — suspecting it.Although it doesn't take long to realize who the vampires are in ""The Lost Boys,"" it doesn't make their reveal any less effective. The '80s hair biker gang led by Kiefer Sutherland as David has the trappings of an iconic cinema cult of renegades who revel in their immortality. The story holds out on reviewing their true form long enough for us to take them seriously. Brothers and main characters Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) serve as perfect entry points into this vampire-infested world of small-town California. After their mom (Dianne Wiest) forces them to move in with their grandfather, Michael and Sam each uncover strange things in their new town. After chasing a girl (Jami Gertz), Michael gets caught up in this mysterious gang and finds himself avoiding sunlight among other things. When Sam takes notice, he enlists the help of the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), two comic book geeks who moonlight as vampire killers.""The Lost Boys"" bathes in '80s film cheese. There's boy-sees-girl-across-the-room romance, a comic book store, a carnival, gangs ... the list goes on. The film epitomizes that decade in movies, which either makes it corny or classic. I would argue that as the plot thickens, it moves from the former to the latter.The key to the film's effectiveness is the slow unveiling of the vampires. The scene in the tree where they show Michael what he has become by turning into their vampire forms and attacking their pray has a massive impact. Although we never see the transformations in process thanks to budget issues most likely, the colored contacts, make up and Joel Schumacher's approach are enough to freak you out in all the right ways. The cumulative amount of blood and guts at the climax also adds that cult-classic horror camp that will put a stupid grin on the face of any of the genre's fans.Horror elements and vampires aside, ""The Lost Boys"" is 100 percent '80s through and through with themes of broken families, fitting in and losers saving the day. It undoubtedly inspired some of the films of the early '90s as well. In that sense, it's not just a fun film, but an important one.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Lost Boys

56,southdavid,"""Perhaps vampires is a bit strong but""",8,24 February 2020,"A Valentine's day re-release for the seminal 80's (None more 80's !) Vampire classic had our local multiplex at the most full I've ever seen it, particularly for a late night screening.Michael (Jason Patric) moves to a Californian coastal town with his younger brother Sam (Corey Haim) and mother Lucy (Dianne Wiest). His attraction to the beautiful Star (Jamie Gertz) leads him to interact with a dangerous gang led by the enigmatic David (Kiefer Sutherland). Sam meanwhile, meets the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), who attempt to convince him that Vampires are the reason the town has such a high murder rate.Despite this being a remastered print, ""The Lost Boys"" is like a time capsule to the 80's. Not just in terms of the hair and clothes in front of the camera but also in cinematic style and technical prowess. There is some truly blunt editing choices that I'm sure even Joel Schumacher wouldn't make today, and long scenes panning over the coast with the iconic pop song playing over it that I think might hit the editing room floor. Some of it hasn't aged well, the muscle man playing the saxophone along with his rock band looks hilarious now, for example. This is not to say that the film isn't still great though. It's a tight story, with solid special effects, particularly in the climatic scenes. I do feel like the film could have done with another level of misdirection in who the lead vampire is. Musically it's great, with Echo and the Bunnymen's cover of The Door's ""People Are Strange"" a highlight. The young cast all do OK. I've never considered before how good looking Jason Patric was at the time, but it really struck me on this viewing. If the film hasn't aged well in some aspects, the humour of it still stands up, mostly from Barnard Hughes as the family grandfather and his quirky ways, or from the vastly over-confident and under-experienced Frog brothers.But there's an inherent sadness to the film now too. Corey Haim, Corey Feldman and Alex Winter would all be victims of child abuse, with it being a contributing factor in Haim's overdose death in 2010. It's difficult to see the young actor knowing that he wouldn't live to be as old as I am now.""The Lost Boys"" is a funny and influential film that it was a lot of fun to see again. Perhaps knock of a point or two though, if you weren't there the first time. Man.",The Lost Boys
57,jzappa,John Hughes's Near Dark,7,22 October 2006,"The Lost Boys is not a horror film or a gorefest. It's a movie made ever so strictly for its target audience, grungy teenagers, and equally as strictly for its time, 1987. If you're not a teenager, and you're not watching it in 1987, you're not going to enjoy it as much. Its focus is on the glamrock, the hairstyles, the clothing, the hip lingo, how sexy Jason Patric is, and how gawky the adults are.For me, an 18-year-old in 2006, it wasn't exactly moving. What I did like about it was the early performance as a villain by Kiefer Sutherland, who would later chill us to the bone as pure evil in several other films, notably An Eye For An Eye and Phone Booth. Being the only vampire that isn't intensely annoying and ugly, he gives the film a lot of ammo, as do Patric, Wiest and Haim, even if Haim is given most of the cheesiest lines.The script is loaded with fun but tiring clichés and dialogue that even teens probably cringe at, especially by the Frog brothers, like ""It's the attack of Eddie Munster!"" and ""The bloodsucking Brady Bunch!"" But, the music is actually really good, and the soaring aerial cinematography is fun. If only the movie were made nowadays with much more gore and vampire violence, which this film is practically devoid of, and less formulaic plot elements like Dianne Wiest's naive mother character and Edward Herrmann's dorky older man character. This movie could've been a lot more than it is, but it's OK. If you were a kid in the 1980s, you'll surely love it for sentimental reasons.",The Lost Boys

Divorced woman, Lucy Emerson (Wiest) and her 2 sons, Michael (Patric) and Sam (Haim) have just moved to Santa Carla, California to live with her father (Hughes). Soon, Michael and Sam discover that there's vampires living among them after Michael falls in with a gang of punks. Sam seeks help from vampire hunters, Edgar (Feldman) and his brother, Alan (Newlander) to rid them. Sutherland (24) plays punk leader, David, Gertz plays Star, an attractive girl Michael finds romance with and Herrmann (Overboard) plays Max, a man whom Lucy starts dating. This is one of the best vampire films with a good cast, great score and terrific make-up effects. I recommend this 80's horror classic.",The Lost Boys
59,GOWBTW,A fun ride!,8,14 February 2008,"Great movie, great cast, great story. ""The Lost Boys"" is an adventure I can go for. After moving to the West Coast. Starting over is a big step. Two brothers Michael(Jason Patric) and Sam(Corey Haim) start making some new friends there. Some of them ending being cool Edgar Frog(Corey Feldman) and his brother Alan(Jamison Newlander), and there are those who are only night owls lead by David(Kiefer Sutherland) and his crew. However, they are worse than night owls, they're vampires! They suck Michael in to their group, they fly at night, they do kill those surf Nazis. But their lifestyle is not for Michael. It's up to Sam and his friends to stop those fiends. Since their mother(Dianne Wiest) is useless to them in the beginning since she's seeing Max(Edward Herrmann) who the boys suspect as a bloodsucker too. They spike the Parmesean cheese with some garlic(Better yet, I bet it was just plain garlic itself). Give him a glass of holy water. The vampire killing scenes are just plain fantastic. The kill one during his resting period. The put one in a tub filling with holy water and garlic. One was ""death by stereo"", and Michael and David met face-to-face. Only to find out that Max was the head vampire. Plenty of horror, plenty of comedy, this movie was fun! 3 out of 5 stars!",The Lost Boys
60,FiendishDramaturgy,A Delight!,9,27 October 2003,"Corey Haim is excellent (for once) in this Joel Schumacher comedy/horror.There are two gangs which run the boardwalk of Santa Carla at night. One is a lawless bunch of wannabe bikers, the other is a blood-thirsty group of vampires boys. This movie omits the gag war which ensues throughout the literary work, but still manages to be a lovable and highly-liked production.In my opinion, the reason behind this huge likability of this comedy/horror by the man who killed Batman (Yes, this is the same man who directed Batman 3 & 4), is the casting. In all fairness to Mr. Schumacher, he also directed ""Bad Company,"" which I found absolutely delightful, and ""Phone Booth,"" which I found compelling and highly entertaining.These actors were perfectly cast in their roles, which lent a most endearing quality and a sense of something right, to this endeavor, which lacks in so many others. (Like Batman 3 & 4.) The soundtrack was perhaps the true star of this production, as it was literally the best part of the movie. However, the performances were professional, witty, and realistically offered by these veteran actors.Another element omitted from this work, is the fact that Grampa was a veteran/retired Vampire Hunter, which explains his fortuitous entry at the end of this movie.This star-studded cast each did his/her part to lend to this work a complete believability inside this dark fantasy. Some critics have labeled this movie as ""pure camp,"" and while the ""Frog Brothers"" did lend a campy element to this production, the movie itself was of a good quality and deserves the recognition and following it enjoys. Their manes, Edgar and Alan Frog are an obvious alludiation to Edgar Alan Poe, and is thereby acceptable camp as the homagic element in its purest form.Some of the scenes found within are quite compelling, dramatic, and portrayed with veteran talent; ie: the scene where David (Keefer Sutherland) opens the ancient, ornate bottle containing the blood from which Michael must drink. It is perhaps ~the~ most compelling scene found within this movie. There are some edge-of-your-seat moments, good sound comedic elements, and an otherwise all around solid story to be found here.The sets were excellent, the effects were horrifically believable, and the characters were well developed enough as to give the audience a good dose of concern for the principal participants. The addition of ""Laddie"" on the milk carton shows the level of detail and care given to this attempt, and again, the soundtrack just adds so much as the songs are fitting and right with each scene, carrying the audience from one scene to the next in smooth dissolves. Very well done.I found the love interest between Michael and Star to be sweet, desperate, and tragic, as I believe it was meant to be. The fact that she chose to make love to Michael rather than feed from him was significant within the story line, as was Max's asking for Michael's invitation before he would enter the house, and as was Grampa's distasteful curl of the lip at Max's doing so.Very well done production which highly deserves the kudos it's been given. I cannot say this movie was ""scary,"" but it was suspenseful, funny, heart-warming, creative, and extremely regaling. A remake would be in order, I think, within the next 10 years or so. It would be nice to expound on the gang wars a bit more, and give a better character treatment to Grampa in this one. And even though I am a fan of this original work, a little more true horror and less comedy would not hurt my feelings in the least. Although, it will be very hard, in my opinion, to recast the role of ""Sam."" This, again in my opinion, was Haim's best portrayal in any role to date.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Lost Boys
61,Stevieboy666,The Mullet Boys,8,1 August 2021,"I have previously only ever watched The Lost Boys on VHS but last night, coincidentally on its 34th birthday, I enjoyed it in widescreen. This movie made vampires cool, no East European counts in black capes here but instead a gang of bikers who only come out at night and like to party. Yes their mullets and big hair looks very dated, as do some of the clothes worn, but it's an 80's film and portrays that wonderful decade excellently. The film features a young cast and thankfully no 30 year olds playing teenagers! Great cinematography, good acting and soundtrack, the story combines both horror and comedy really well, a bit like Fright Night (1985). There are some wonderful lines such as ""Kill your brother, you'll feel better!"" and ""Death by stereo"", just two of many examples by our young heroes. The vampires coastal lair features posters of both Jim Morrison and The Munsters, a couple of nods to the movie's obvious influences. Without doubt this is a stylish teen coming of age 1980's classic that can be enjoyed by both horror fans and those who are perhaps a little more mainstream.",The Lost Boys
62,dee.reid,A little more than a vampire movie. ***SPOILERS***,10,31 October 2002,"""The Lost Boys"" was without a doubt the hit with the teen crowd that Warner Bros. expected it to be.  And surprise, it was the hit they wanted it to be. Take a closer look and you will realize this is more than a teen vampire movie.  The key word here is TEEN.  This films central theme is not vampires, but it's about enjoying the pleasures of youth.  The films title, in case you don't know, is borrowed from Peter Pan's gang, ""The Lost Boys"", who were a bunch of kids who could never grow old.  In this film, ""The Lost Boys"" are a gang of teen vampires who could never grow old.  The story, in more than one way, does resemble ""Peter Pan"", largely with the aforementioned themes of youth.This theme is realized here but it's also clear that some people won't get that, so I'll open you up to it a little. One example would be, with the exceptions of Dianne Weist, Edward Herrmann, and Barnard Hughes, why do you hardly see any other adults in Santa Carla?  Also during the concert scene, the only people you see are teenagers.  Not a single adult is seen.  This leads to the speculation that Santa Carla may in fact, be a haven for teenagers who could have possibly run away from home, are lost, or are looking for something to do with their lives, while they're still young. Santa Carla does in several ways resemble Neverland.  Neverland was populated by nothing but kids and despised any adults who came to their land.  Another example would be Dianne Weist's romance with Barnard Hughes.  When they first meet, she says that ""We were that age once"".  It is also evident that between these two, they may be trying to relive the younger, happier days of their lives.A final example would be the ""Lost Boys"" themselves.  David (Kiefer Sutherland), the gang's confident leader, seems to obviously like the fact that he's a vampire.  In fact, he embraces it, something that any kid would love.  All they do basically is ride bikes, sleep, party, and drink blood; all things that any teenager in his position would do.           
It's also a coming-of-age story too.  Michael (Jason Patric) is also probably beginning to experience love for the first time in his life.  He pines for Star (Jami Gertz), who is the only girl in David's gang.  But his need for blood also seems to be getting in the way of that though.  His younger brother, Sam (Corey Haim) is too young to be experiencing love. (He's still into comic books and things like that).  Also Michael joins David's gang, something that many teenagers when they're young, would do. To have a sense of belonging and making new friends, I think is Michael's ultimate goal.Apparently, some people have missed that point entirely by thinking that this is just another 80's vampire movie.  On the contrary, I think that the 80's setting perfectly fits this movies material.  I think, that had this film been released in 1997, ten years after its release, the outcome would have been very different.  Had it been, this film would probably have been filled with the sex, drugs, and gory violence that seems to inhabit most of today's teen movies.  So the 80's setting WAS a good idea after all...10/10",The Lost Boys

64,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""You're history buddy!""",10,31 October 2016,"Nearly 30 years it's been since this first came out and I have yet to see another modern vampire movie that offers half as much of a ridiculously good time as The Lost Boys does. I think it works on every level that it's meant to, it's humorous and scary enough at points, putting humour into the horror and horror into the humour and poking fun at the old vampire lore yet still working as a legit vampire flick at the same time. And it doesn't even feel like it's about vampirism as such, I think it has a bit of an underlying coming of age tone, with kids moving to new places and finding new social circles and groups they can fit into, falling in with bad crowds.. It's one of those special rare types of horror movies that has a distinctly unique quality about it, I mean it isn't even remotely your typical vampire movie. All the main characters have enough development that they're all likable. Young Corey Haim was so lovable and funny and was just a ball of energy to watch, I think among other stuff, his performance is one of the main things that make the movie work so well. The chemistry that he, Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander had together was such a fun highlight. I love the absolutely hilarious touch of the two hippies that are always in the background whenever there's a scene inside that cool comic book store that look like they could be either sleeping or dead! Jason Patrick I thought was just okay in his role as a responsible young guy that gives in to peer pressure and finds that he has to save himself from becoming a soulless killer. I did like the excellent rival chemistry he had with Keifer Sutherland and his relationship with Corey Haim seemed sweet and genuine, I buy the brother dynamic between them. Apart from the awesomely charismatic Keifer Sutherland, all the other vampires of his gang barely speak but they have a lot of personality in just the style and attitude of how they look. And it may have been big at the time, but I think they dodged a bullet when they decided to make them decidedly more rock and roll than glam rock! I like the way you don't see the vampires true forms until near the end and how they set it up with the early scenes where you don't see what carries off the security guard and the comic book-stealing couple in their car. When you do see them in full vamp mode they're scary and demonic, with the eyes as the focal point of the makeup effects which hold up very well. I love Diane Weist in it, she's so adorable with her short hair and has a genuine motherly quality about her. She's so kind and sweet that she attracts the diabolical attentions of one who's own wholesome outlook on family values are a twisted reflection of hers... I loved Edward Herman as the physically imposing nerdish man with a very dark secret. You never would have expected him to be the main bad guy, especially after the clever double-bluff when they mislead you into thinking he is the head vampire and then officially disprove him mid-story. But watching it again there are clues, like when he firmly asks the vampire biker gang to leave his video store and they do so without a fuss, when he asks to be invited in is the real big one you can't quite forget, and simply how he isn't dead after encountering the boys outside his home during one very creepy scene. Bernard Hughes as the quirky old grandpa who liked scaring his grandson with spooky stuffed animals was just brilliant, it was like he wasn't even acting, who ever didn't want a grandpa just like that? He steals every scene he's in, and he saves the day! Although I do wonder if he meant to crash through the house and impale Max or if he was just drunk driving and they got lucky? I love the weird vibe of that final line of his that leaves things on such an enigmatic high note as the characters as well as the audience are left dumbfounded and in the dark. As a kid I always thought the bottle that he drinks from meant that he too was a vampire. It may be horror technically but the tons of footage of the beach, blue skies and especially the boardwalk that serves as the film's backdrop is so beautifully rich that I find that it gives it all a strangely feel-good upbeat quality. I can just get lost in that retro 80s punk hair carnival coastline atmosphere. It's so alive and has a very strong appeal to me. The music had so much soul, the image of them riding across the sandy beach in the moonlight with ""Lost in the Shadows"" playing is so visually striking and memorable and a real iconic image of this picture. The energy of the concert scene with the greased-up muscle bound saxophone player is infectious, that guy was really f**kin' into it! He couldn't be in the movie for more than a minute and a half but you sure do remember him. I always wanna be there, I wanna get into it with that crowd man!!! It all has such a youthful exuberance about itself, and to me captures something of the spirit of youth in general. You could never recreate this kind of movie, it's one horror comedy thriller that I consider forever classic and a real gem of its era. It's always had a special place in my heart, and regardless of how my view of this film has changed over the years, I still love it dearly. ):P ""I haven't changed my mind about that!""",The Lost Boys
65,dwpollar,"Campy, scary and funny vampire movie...",8,2 September 2010,"1st watched 8/31/2010 -- 8 out of 10 (Dir-Joel Schumacher): Campy, scary and funny vampire movie that I consider a classic in the genre. Joel Schumacher, who is one of my favorite directors, blends so many things into one movie and makes it entertaining as well. The story is about a newly divorced mother and her two children moving into a new town(dubbed 'murder capital of the world' on back of a billboard) and in with her demented father. The eerie element is introduced in the first scene as Kiefer Sutherland and his boys invade a local carnival and then a death occurs. The older son, played by Jason Patric, is enticed by a woman, who appears to be part of this group, and then unknowingly is initiated into it by drinking the blood of the leader. He first, though, has to have his own first kill to truly become one of them, and his younger son, played by Corey Haim, along with a goofy couple of brothers, try to stop this from happening. These brothers try to hunt down and kill the lead vampire, which is supposed to reverse the curse. The movie is filled with hilarious one-liners which shows me that it's not taking itself too seriously and makes the movie better. It also has wonderfully atmospheric scary shots with a little over-the-top violence in the last half hour. The humor, though, wins out and makes this movie a classic that shouldn't be missed.",The Lost Boys

67,rooprect,The Bat Pack,9,20 February 2017,"Every decade or so, a film will come along with a cast of nobodys and do marginally well... only to become a cult classic years later when all the ""nobodys"" are megastars. Sure, people will watch this movie for the thrill of seeing a 20-something juvenile delinquent played by Kiefer Sutherland (""24""), or a 30-something mom played by Dianne Wiest (""Life in Pieces"") or a nubile, teenage Jami Gertz (""The Neighbors""), but as you're star shopping you realize, wow, this actually is a cool flick. And here's why...""Lost Boys"" was one of the first, and in my opinion best, movies to successfully bridge horror with adventure, comedy, and apologetically 80s fashion sense. It's as if you took The Exorcist and threw it in a blender with Labyrinth, Weird Science, and Duran Duran's wardrobe closet.Speaking (not) of Duran Duran, an iconic 80s band that's unfortunately missing from the soundtrack's lineup, there's quite an assembly of awesome 80s bands like INXS (""Good Times"", ""Laying Down the Law""), Echo & the Bunnymen (covering The Doors ""People Are Strange""), Aerosmith & Run DMC (""Walk This Way""), Lou Gramm from Foreigner (""Lost in the Shadows"") and Roger Daltrey from The Who (covering Elton John's ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me""). This flick has it all.The plot is another huge innovation, almost a quarter century before we'd see the young GQ vampires in the Twilight series, here we have probably the first time in vampire film history where vampires are young good looking teens & tweens, as opposed to the creepy, twisted Nosferatu image that started it all. This is especially effective because the transformation from teen heartthrobs to terrifying bloodthirsty maniacs is a powerful contrast that plays upon our very intrigue with the dark inherent sexiness of vampirism. And call me crazy, but their pre-goth look has aged extremely well. Bear in mind, most of the people in the theater watching this movie in 1987 were wearing parachute pants and pastel colored Izod golf shirts with the stupid collar turned up. I plead the 5th on that.One quick note on the look of the vampires. Notice how their fangs are done... VERY creepy. Unlike the traditional wolf-like ""Dracula"" vampire who has sharp canine teeth (3rd pair from center), and unlike the ""Nosferatu"" rat-faced vampire with incisor fangs (center pair), these creatures of the night are sporting elongated bicuspids (2nd pair from center). I don't know why but this freaked the heck out of me when I was a kid and it still does. Maybe it's because, unlike wolves & rats, there is no natural animal who has sharp bicuspids so the vision is especially ""unnatural"". Who knows.I'm going to return to an earlier point regarding the crossover between horror, adventure & comedy for a minute. This cannot be overstated. In the bonus interviews, the director talks about how the producers and corporate suits were confused if not terrified at the concept. But luckily the artists' vision prevailed, owing a lot to improvised comedy on the set (the ""Frog brothers"" absolutely stole the show). Again, why is this significant? Because just when you think the movie might be bordering on melodramatic cheese, it makes fun of itself in a very overt way, and you realize that even if you don't buy the outlandish concept of, say, a bunch of high school kids becoming world class vampires, that's OK. Because the filmmakers don't necessarily buy it either, and that's why the movie is peppered with some outrageously awesome lines like: ""My own brother, a goddam, sh!t-sucking vampire. You wait 'till mom finds out, buddy!"" So really, if these examples haven't been enough I'll spell it out. ""Lost Boys"" was a groundbreaking film in its look, its sound, its attitude and yes, even its story which has a very nice surprise twist or two. Other 80s flicks like ""Fright Night"" and ""Vamp"" did admirably well and are worth seeing, but I have to say ""The Lost Boys"" is the one that got everything right.Watch this movie if you're in the mood for a good horror flick, or a good adventure, or a good comedy, or if you want to hear some cool tunes, or if you're running low on ideas for the next Halloween party. Just don't drink the blood punch. (Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean)",The Lost Boys

69,jfgibson73,Chamber Goth Style To Spare,8,10 October 2015,"It's amazing to me how fresh this movie feels in 2015, even as it radiates late 80s style. The Lost Boys really relied on great characters, then took it up a notch by layering atmospheric visuals and a well matched soundtrack. It keeps a perfect balance between the Gothic angst of Michael's storyline and goofy humor with the two Coreys. There were some stretches where it dragged, but also had some editing that today's movies could really learn from. The best example of this comes during the climactic final act, when the final showdown between heroes and vampires gets down to business. And that business is killing off bloodsuckers in a highly satisfying fashion. Most movies would drag this sequence out with lingering deaths and tension- killing chases. Here, everything is nicely timed, especially the head vampire Max. He reveals himself, beats up all the heroes, then holds a young son hostage and forces the mother to join him in a matter of seconds. And just as it looks completely hopeless, grandpa comes crashing in and gets the final word. It made me remember how I felt as a teen, watching with friends on a rented VHS tape. I can still hear Kiefer Sutherland calling, ""Michael...Michael...""",The Lost Boys
70,gcd70,"Might grab you, might lose you, depends",5,27 August 2008,"Well executed, clever idea, from writers Janice Fischer, James Jeremias and additional screenwriter Jeffrey Boam, that really never grabbed me personally. It may just blow you away however, depending on your taste.Simply put, this is a modernisation of the age-old vampire story, though perhaps 'vampires done for generation X' might be more accurate.Joel Schumacher has taken the whole package and presented it glamorously, with every element done (some over done) to a nicety. Glitzy, slick and under 90 minutes, Schumacher knew how to sell an entertainment like this to a youthful audience. Even a rock soundtrack is shrewdly thrown in (it's a good one too). Director of Photography Michael Chapman captures the action with flare and panache.Finally, the cast make it all work. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect as the sinister band leader, David. Jason Patric's central role, that of the confused Michael, is well played and good support comes from Corey Haim (no great actor but suitable) as his amazing little bro' and Barard Hughes as their reclusive, crazy granpa. Jami Gertz peps things up as Starr, the girl who led Michael into David's trap, and Corey Feldman drops by as a vampire eliminator (lame but necessary). Admittedly Dianne Wiest's enormous talent is wasted somewhat.Certainly I can recognise that this was a smart, well produced flick, just not to my taste.Friday, February 20, 1998 - Video",The Lost Boys
71,dworldeater,"""Death by stereo""!",8,17 October 2020,"I t has been at least a decade since I last watched The Lost Boys. I have seen this a lot and have been a fan since it's intial run on cable. But, The Lost Boys is classic stuff and is a great movie that holds up. Very original and at the time, hip and contemporary take on the vampire mythos. The film is very strong visually with great camera work outstanding f/x and creative wardrobe. In some ways The Lost Boys is dated and is very 80's, but the characters are very well drawn out and memorable and the storytelling is solid. Also the performances are solid with tight and fluid direction. I guess this was considered to be a horror/comedy. I never saw it that way, while The Lost Boys has some humor and some 80's cheese, that was par for the course for Hollywood movies of the time. There are some exceptions to that obviously, but that was expected of movies in general at that time. There is some good, quotable dialogue and this is my favorite movie with both of the Corey's. The horror elements here are pretty strong with dark atmosphere and tension in the appropriate spots. The violence is pretty savage and while I would not consider The Lost Boys as a gory film, it does deliver sufficiently enough in the bloodletting department. Overall, The Lost Boys is a great film that was a hit and made a lot of money for Warner Brothers studios. The Lost Boys is also essential viewing for any fan of the horror genre or for enthusiasts of the cinema of the 1980's.",The Lost Boys
72,ferbs54,"""Death By Stereo""",7,25 April 2011,"A Gen X'er work buddy of mine was shocked when he recently learned that I--a baby-boomer horror buff--had never seen the 1987 scare film ""The Lost Boys."" Already a cult item of sorts for those of a certain age, the film is one that had somehow slipped by me for the last 24 years...until last night, that is. And now that I've seen the picture, I can honestly say that it strikes me as a somewhat dated albeit undeniably fun outing that is regrettably deficient in the Shocks, Scares and Horror Department; still, I can understand its appeal for those who were of an impressionable age during those nascent days of MTV. In the film, we meet the Emerson brothers, Michael (the older, played by hunky Jason Patric) and Sam (an extremely endearing performance by the late Corey Haim), who move to ""The Murder Capital of the World,"" Santa Carla, CA, with their divorced mom (the ever-cute and always dependable Dianne Wiest). Before long, Michael gets involved with a bad-boy biker gang that is actually composed of bloodsucking vampires and led by a peroxide-dyed Kiefer Sutherland, all to impress the lovely Star (Jami Gertz), and Sam realizes that his older bro is slowly turning into a creature of the night himself. Good thing that the managers of the local comic book store, the Frog brothers (some very funny van Helsing renditions here by Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), are well practiced in the art of vampire extermination....An ingratiating mixture of style, comedy and scares, served in fairly equal thirds, ""The Lost Boys"" is certainly a nice-looking and perfectly entertaining film. Director Joel Schumacher has given his picture a polished look that at times strongly resembles an early MTV music video, never more so than in the lovemaking scene between Michael and Star, with those soaring-in-the-clouds visuals. (Indeed, Sam even comments on his need for MTV in one scene; almost as dated a reference as his comment regarding ""Dynasty"" a little later!) The picture features a terrific soundtrack (very cool to hear Echo and the Bunnymen essaying The Doors classic ""People Are Strange"") and makes inspired use of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk for many of its action sequences. Still, as a horror film, the picture is fairly tame...until its final 20 minutes or so, however, when we are treated to some pretty impressive zombie slayings, courtesy of our brave young heroes and their garlic-infused holy-water pistols. In a film with much to admire, though, perhaps the single best element is that wonderful cast of future stars on the rise. And how fun to see Edward Herrmann, a good 13 years or so pre-""Gilmore Girls,"" here playing a very different sort of paterfamilias! In all, fun stuff for all ages, although some aging baby boomers may wonder what all the fuss is about, as they seek out a vampire movie with a bit less teen angst and a bit more bite....",The Lost Boys
73,Jonny_Numb,another reminder of why the 1980s sucked,4,4 January 2004,"Beyond a collection of awful hair-metal 'dos and a laughably bad concert scene where everybody is decked out in their embarrassing '80s duds (and the singer is lip-synching horribly), there's just not much going on in ""The Lost Boys.""  Go figure that this Joel Schumacher film puts the emphasis on visual style and pretty lame humor as the two Coreys and Jason Patric fall in with a gang of hair-metal rejects who are actually vampires (led by Kiefer Sutherland, the only actor here who maintains his credibility). Contains another notorious performance from Jami Gertz, as well...4/10",The Lost Boys
74,aidanratesmovies,"Campy fun, not much else",8,16 October 2020,"Although it can have some dull moments, and is rather campy, The Lost Boys proves to be a mostly entertaining and fun filled ride of 80's comedy/adventure/horror terror, with a delightful young cast at the heart of it. The plot is basic, and can at times be a bit predictable. It's a typical new family moves to town, events happen type of scenario, and you'll mostly know what's gonna happen from there, but there is no doubt it is fun to watch. Between the cool 80's soundtrack, Schumacher's directing, and the performances on screen- it is quite enjoyable to watch. I enjoyed most of the performances although I do feel Alex Winters was criminally undermined some screen time. Jason Patric proves to be quite good throughout the film, as well as Dianne West (as always). Corey Haim, Bernard Hughes, and Kiefer Sutherland all provide some campy but delightful performances in their respective roles, and some decent performances from the vampire crew all around. I wasn't very impressed by the script, not in just the fact how basic it was, but also at the randomness of it all. It drops little things here and there that just seem out of nowhere, like a joke that doesn't quite make sense, but is said so enthusiastically you can't help but feel like you should be smiling. In the end, The Lost Boys did what it needed to do, but nothing more. Its enjoyable, its entertaining, it has chemistry, but it doesn't have quite enough to be great. Although, that all being said, it still is probably the best vampire flick to grace the screens in quite some time.
My Rating: 8/10",The Lost Boys
75,truemythmedia,Pretty Dull.,5,21 June 2019,"I think my problem with this movie was that I didn't see it at the right time. If I'd have been a kid in the 80s, I probably would've loved this movie and have been able to look past all the little things that irked me about it. As it is now, I just can't bring myself to care about the film; I don't hate it, but I also don't particularly like it either. This is a film that I don't think I'll ever fully grasp the allure of, but that's all right; different movies are made for different people. You might like this movie; I couldn't care less about it.

76,masonsaul,Incredibly fresh and stylish vampire film,10,8 November 2020,"The Lost Boys is an incredibly fresh and stylish vampire film that finds a new perspective in the sub-genre. It's really funny, thrilling and fun. Jason Patric, Corey Haim and Kiefer Sutherland are all incredible. Dianne West, Barnard Hughes, Corey Feldman, Jamison Newlander and Edward Herrmann are all great. Joel Schumacher's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and expertly paced. The soundtrack is amazing and the music by Thomas Newman is really good.",The Lost Boys
77,a_chinn,High point of The Coreys,8,27 May 2017,"""Michael, you're eating maggots."" This film was a lot of fun back in the day and it still holds up pretty darn well. This film is a perfect example of a funhouse style of horror film that successfully balances humor and scares, a combination that rarely works. Corey Haim and his hunky older brother Jason Patrick move to Santa Carla, the murder capital of the world, with their mom Dianne Wiest to live with their colorful grandpa, Barnard Hughes. Out on the beach boardwalk, Patrick meets a pretty girl named Star, Jami Gertz, and runs afoul her leather jacketed biker friends, led by a memorable Kiefer Sutherland in his breakout film role, who turn out to be gang of vampires. Haim then teams up with Corey Feldman, one half of the vampire hunting Frog Brothers, to save his family. While the film certainly has a solid cast, which also includes Alex Winter and Edward Herrmann, I think a lot of the film's success goes to the folks behind the camera. Director Joel Schumacher brings a lot of fun visual razzle dazzles to the pictures without being distracting, greatly aided by Martin Scorsese's frequent director of photography, Michael Chapman, and production design by frequent Tim Burton collaborator Bo Welch. They all give the film a very ""California"" feel that felt unique for a vampire film and a slickness not see in prior vampire pictures. Thomas Newman also provides a fine score for the film, but another major reason for this film's iconic nature is it's memorable is the 80s soundtrack that features INXS, Echo and the Bunnymen, and the memorable theme song ""Cry Little Sister."" Credit is also due to film's clever and witty script. There are several credited writers, but the main writer was Jeffrey Boam, who sadly died young after a string of memorable films including the adaptations ""Straight Time"" and ""The Dead Zone,"" original films like ""Innerspace,"" ""Lethal Weapon 2,"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" and co-creator of the very funny short lived TV series ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr."" Overall, this one is an iconic 80s horror film that has stood the test of time. Too bad it's legacy has been marred by crumby direct-to-video sequels years later when this film probably should have gotten a proper remake/reboot during the Twilight vampire craze.",The Lost Boys
78,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Coming of Age Vampire Film,9,16 June 2019,"To start off this review, I didn't grow up with this film like most did so I don't really have a lot of nostalgia for it. This is actually only my third viewing, with this time being in the theater on a 35mm print. The synopsis of this film is after moving into a new town, two brothers discover that the area is a haven for vampires.The two brothers are Michael Emerson (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim). They are moving to Santa Clara to live with their Grandpa (Barnard Hughes). Their mother is also with them, Lucy (Dianne Wiest). It is during their move that Sam notices on the sign that it is Murder Capital of the World. They get a taste of the city as they head through it.Michael and Sam head into town during a party on the boardwalk. This is where we first see the sweaty, shirtless sax player. Michael is entranced by a young woman, Star (Jami Gertz). He sees that she is hanging out a group of guys, led by David (Kiefer Sutherland). Sam on the other hand goes to a comic book store where he meets Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan Frog (Jamison Newlander). They are impressed by Sam's knowledge of comic books and give him one about vampires. He tells them that he doesn't like horror comics, but they warn him that this is for survival. They believe the town is overrun by vampires.This is something I feel the film was very strong with. We slowly learn the truth of David and his friends as Michael starts to hang out with them. There is an odd dynamic though. Star seems like she is with David, but then immediately takes a liking to Michael. I personally am not a fan of that when films decide to go that route and have the characters fall in love too quickly.Something else I really liked about this film was the dynamic of the Frog Brothers. They seem like they are hardcore vampire hunters, but they never really killed one. They just know the truth. I could see myself hanging out with them. I thought it was pretty fun and their dinner scene was pretty funny as well. Max (Ed Herrmann) is great during this scene. He is a man who hires Lucy and then asks her out. This is an interesting aspect to the film as well.I also really like the name of the film and how it is incorporated in it. David and his crew are kind of similar to Peter Pan and his lost boys. They're lacking guidance for the most part and kind of run wild. They also never grow up, just like The Lost Boys as well. I think it is pretty cool little thing to reference in the film. Going from this, there is the aspect of growing up and rebelling from your parents. Michael is at that stage in his life and he is butting heads with Lucy. She thinks it is hormones, but he really is dealing with some heavy things.The film is paced quite well actually. We get introduced some unexplained phenomena that happens, but the common factor is clearly David and his friends. We kind of know they are supernatural. I do like how they downplay it though for a good portion of the film though. This does have a really solid reveal in it as well. It definitely is a film that upon a second viewing, you can pick up little things that tie back in. I really did like that about the film. There is also a funny reveal at the very end as well. I do like how the film ends and climax is solid for what is built up.As for the acting, I thought it was really good. This is the height of the two Corey's. I thought Haim was really good in this film, even though he does come off slightly immature. Feldman is doing a voice that he seems to be stuck doing when he is acting even today. I do like his character slightly better in this film of the two. Patric was really good as the brother who is in love, but knows that he is going through changes that he doesn't want to. Sutherland is great in this film. He is such a badass. Gertz is also good. I do feel like she gets relegated to love interest, but she is smoking so I did enjoy when she was on screen. Newlander is also good as the other Frog Brother. Hughes and Herrmann are also both solid. I also need to shout-out to Alexander Winter who appears as Marco. I know him from Bill and Ted films and I thought it was cool to see him in this one.Something strong for this film was the effects. I really like the look of the vampires in this film. Their eyes and fangs look good. The blood and gore effects are also solid. They don't go over the top, but they do go far enough to make it quite believable. There is a great massacre scene in this film that I am a big fan of. This of course was done all practically which I am also all for.The soundtrack for the film is also something that I really enjoy. The theme song for the film is so catchy and one of my favorite themes. The song that the Sax Man plays is also really good. The rest of the score fits the film for what they were going for and enhances the film in my opinion. I should also point out I like the us of the The Doors 'People Are Strange' song as well.Now with that said, even though I didn't grow up on this film, I am a big fan. I think that it has one of the better concepts for a vampire film out there. The incorporation of Peter Pan and the concept of The Lost Boys are cool. I think the film paces itself well to show us there is something supernatural going on, but the characters learn at a solid pace. I thought the film has some good reveals in it that enhance the story. The film builds at a good clip to a satisfying conclusion. The acting is solid across the board as well as the effects and soundtrack to the film. Now I might not have nostalgia for the film, but I can recognize that it is really good. I recommend seeing this film if you haven't, regardless if you like horror or not.",The Lost Boys
79,Samiam3,Flys by like a vampire in the sky,7,7 May 2009,"The best non-cinematic term to address The Lost Boys would be to call it a sugar rush. It provides an exiting burst of energy, but one that does not last long, and the ending does not feel as good as the rest of the experience. The Lost Boys has a breezy sense of fun, a great sense of humor, and a very funky look, but it all goes by a little too quickly for us to enjoy it to the full. At best, it's fairly entertaining.The story is well constructed at the beginning. Some films take fifteen to twenty minutes to set up a premise, The Lost Boys accomplishes this before the opening credits end. We are informed of the time and place, we know who the protagonists are, and we sort of know who the antagonists are. Michael and Sam are moving to Santa Carla to live with their grandfather, following their mother's divorce. One night on the boardwalk, Michael hangs out with the wrong group of people, and the next morning he is a vampire. This pretty much summarizes the first act. From here on the story loses its rhythmic pacing and moves into adrenaline mode. Sam with the help of two new friends seeks to destroy the head vampire and save his older brother. Lost Boys gets silly, but it winks at its own sense of idiocy, and never gets too nasty, or violent or gory. I think the movie provides a good blend of material for the horror fans, but it needs a little more.",The Lost Boys

I'm not a big fan of vampire movies but have seen a few-this is not a scary type movie, more a fun one of two boys who move to a small town on the west coast and get mixed up with a bunch of vampires. Best of all, this movie introduced me to Jason Patrick who's quite the talented actor. Many I know, became major fans of his, through this movie.Lost boys is light, it's fun, pretty setting-decent acting-a gem for today's kids groing up who may not have seen it. I myself saw it so much as a kid I got horribly sick of it and vowed not to watch it again but I'll probebly see it once more in the future. This movie is a must see for fans of vampire movies, it's no longer a favorite of mine at all, but a great movie for kids(actually all ages) and a fun quirky one-check it out if you haven't.",The Lost Boys
81,Seraphion,A classic to remind us of how a modern vampire movie should at least be,7,15 November 2015,"Amid these days' stupid vampire movies where the vampires glow under sunlight, this movie sure is a classic example of how a vampire movie should be at the very least. Stories about vampires have dated back even before Bram Stoker's Dracula story. I guess there's something in the whole pseudo-immortality that allures people into watching or reading more and more vampire stories. Yet new stories shouldn't mess with the more critical point of the lore, like making them glow under sunlight. In a way one can also say that the whole glow under the sunlight thing comes from diluting two parts of the lore depicted in this movie; that vampires glow in the dark and that the half vampires are still able to withstand sunlight. I like how the movie put its twists, even with clues here and there one can still fall for its story flow and suspend their findings. The acting overall seems very much a standard. But for me again the still is a great one in terms of a vampire movie.",The Lost Boys
82,Movie-ManDan,I Finally Figured Out Why I Love This Film So Much.,10,18 June 2015,"The Lost Boys is one of the best vampire movies ever made. To me, it is one of the best horror movies in general. What so many horror movies miss are the proper connections with the actual story and characters, and the horror elements. The Lost Boys has deep meaning (which I consider to be allegorical) which takes advantage of the horror, not the other way around. That is why the majority of horror movies are all mindless.The films follows teenage brothers Michael and Sam (Patric, Haim) who move with their mother Lucy (Weist) to their grandfather's house (Hughes). Sam makes friends with brother vampire hunters (Feldman, Newlander) who caution his every move, while Michael befriends a mysterious group who make him a part of them. You guessed it, vampires! Soon, both pairs of brother must band together to take down the head vampire to turn Michael back to normal.Moving to a new town is very scary: new schools, new jobs, new friends. Peer pressure always gets the better of you. You do whatever you can to fit in and a lot of the time there's no going back. That is pretty much the case with Michael. He follows Jami Gertz which leads him to ""the lost boys."" They are mysterious so he is interested. He tries to go back when he uncovers what he has become, but he cannot. In real life, when somebody starts smoking out of pressure, it is super rare to break that habit right away. The only way for Michael to stop being a vampire is either by death or killing the head vampire, whomever that may be. Sam, on the other hand, is stronger and wiser. He outright rejects Feldman and Newlander right away, only returning to them later. Had it been Michael, he would have accepted them right away.As a horror movie, there has to be a strong scare factor in order to work. These vampires are actually terrifying. Some of these are the scariest vampires ever put to film. Even more scary than many innovative horror movies these days, no gross or stupid. The vampire bits are not even the only good parts. The astonishing vampire bits are just a plus. That is why the story and characters support the horror.4/4",The Lost Boys
83,philip_vanderveken,"It tries to be renewing, but is too conservative at the same time.",6,10 January 2005,"If you aren't a very big fan of vampire movies, you better leave this one alone because it will be quite disappointing. I know what I'm talking about, because I like vampire movies (even though it is not my favorite kind of movies), but I wasn't impressed by this one at all.So where did it fail? Well, it tried to be original and renewing, which I appreciate, but it was conservative as well. They did an effort to show us vampires in a different way (this ones could actually fly, they sleep in a cave instead of a coffin, don't wear an ""old-fashioned"" costume...), but on the other hand the filmmakers didn't want to be too progressive either. They still let the main characters fight the vampires with holy water, a lot of garlic and by bashing a wooden stick through the vampires' hearts.And that wasn't my only problem. Perhaps it was all very new in the eighties, but today we have been flooded by teenage horror movies, making that this one really doesn't stand out above the others. Add to this a dated and far from original scenario and you know that you have a movie that isn't really worth much attention.The only reason I can imagine that you want to see this movie is the music and the costumes. If you are a fan of eighties pop music, than you'll hear some fine classics in the soundtrack. If you want to have a good laugh, than you should pay some attention to the way they are dressed. Especially the 'bad' guys look like the Village People. LOL. For me however that isn't enough to like this movie. I give it a 5.5/10.",The Lost Boys

85,shakercoola,Straddling genres it misses its bite. Visually it is glorious,5,12 July 2019,"An American horror comedy; A story about a single mother and her two sons who become involved with a pack of teenage vampires when they move into an offbeat Northern California seaside town. The main theme is vampirism as a metaphor for mythic male bonding, resisting growing up, commitment, and marriage. It is well photographed with rich and dark colours, great costumes, an anthemic score and some great pop music that fits well. The storyline starts out well too, creating a mood of a punkish, after-dark teenage world. But, by appealing to a broad audience it never delivers on either sub genre - not enough laughs for a comedy, mimicking ""The Goonies"" for cornball, and no sense of dread for a horror. Inevitably, it has to face the serious business of a third act of horror, but in doing so resorts to a formula of unimaginative action, chasing, and special-effects gore. Some young teenage viewers will find it pleasing, especially the anodyne humour of one-liners from its kooky characters, and they will find the horror quite startling. All the performances are good and there is a genuine sense of fun, passable, and watchable, if sometimes a bit anaemic.",The Lost Boys

87,Howlin Wolf,Youth Gone Wild.,8,11 July 2007,"... Is there a direct link between vampirism and 80's fashions?? Will people who regularly wear leather jackets and have immaculately coiffured hair automatically become more vulnerable to joining the ranks of the undead? How about if you live in a town where open-air concerts are regularly staged by sweaty saxophone players with glistening torsos? If ""The Lost Boys"" taught me anything it's that these details are ominous signs - and it *should* have taught me something, because it's been played in regular rotation by me since I was a nipper... My hair is a mess and I don't model myself after The Fonz, though, so thus far those teeth haven't grown and I've managed to avoid having fangs as my newest accessory.There's something about the very time-specific style Joel Schumacher brought to this tale that just works. Throw in a hip young cast on the cusp of greatness - or, in the case of 'The Coreys', implosion - and you really have something that should be a banner event for kids of that time. Impressively though, the jokes are actually funny and still hold up well to this day.The film as a whole is never going to send a chill up your spine, but what affectionate nods to its genre there are still rock in that nostalgic kind of way that really has a kick to it.",The Lost Boys

89,mstomaso,Thankfully Lost Boys Doesn't Take Itself Very Seriously,6,26 September 2007,"Joel Schumaker's The Lost Boys is an outrageous comedy adventure with a cast composed of some of the mid-80s' hottest male teen idols. The film successfully walks the tightrope between schlock-horror-comedy, young adult romance-adventure, family movie, and talent showcase. And there is no gore! Like most of Schumaker's work, Lost Boys is very Hollywood. Unlike most of the subsequent vampire films, however, Lost Boys very rarely takes itself seriously. Though most of the film's humor is pretty dated, it essentially hybridizes Ferris Bueller's day off and Interview with the Vampire.Corey Haim and Jason Patric are two brothers who have just moved with their mom (Rachel Weist) to a new boardwalk town. Michael (Patric) wastes no time getting himself mixes up with a mysterious beauty (Jami Gertz) and her hive of vampires who literally hang out in a ruined hotel nestled within the San Andreas Fault. Meanwhile, his brother (Haim) has met a pair of ca. 9-year-old wannabe vampire slayers. Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric give particularly strong performances and really drive most of this film.The cinematography is very good and quite consistent with the film's tongue-in-cheek approach. The script is economical and appropriate, though a bit dated. The editing is fine. Schumaker is Schumaker, and if your familiar with him, you know what you're going to get in his films - well-paced economical entertainment designed for a big budget which blends Hollywood formulae with big name talent and an at least half-thought-out plot. In other words, Schumaker always at least tries to give a lot of bang for your buck. The formula works here, and, in my opinion, more than it usually does. Unlike most modern gothics, Lost Boys uses special effects and make up very sparingly. It is refreshing to see a horror film without CGI and vats full of cow blood. However, the film is fairly dated, and not all that original (similar in style and story to Return of the Living Dead, among others). Still, it's a better film than it deserves to be,and one of my top-rated from Schumaker.",The Lost Boys
90,one9eighty,They're only noodles Michael,8,24 August 2020,"The suggestion that a film is iconic is overused these days and some absolute turkeys are given that status, despite being terrible. ""The Lost Boys"" is not on of those films, and it absolutely deserves to be classed as an iconic cult film, not just iconic for the 80's, but also in the genre of horror/comedy films and vampire films too.Directed by Joel Schumacher, who has some solid movies on his CV, this 1987 film stars Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Dianne West, Edward Herrmann, Alex Winter, and importantly Kiefer Sutherland - in one of his most memorable roles.Divorcee Lucy (Dianne West) and her sons Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) move to the coastal town of Santa Carla, California, to live with Lucy's dad, ""Grandpa"" (Barnard Hughes). While exploring the nightlife, Michael falls in love with a young girl called Star (Jami Gertz) who is connected to a group of bikers led by David (Sutherland). Meanwhile Sam bumps into the Frog brothers, Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan (Jamison Newlander), who try to tell Sam that the town is plagued by Vampires. While this is going on, Lucy gets a job at the local video store, working for Max (Edward Hermann), who might have hired her for romantic reasons too. As Michael's pursuits of Star get him closer to David's gang he starts to experience changes; he spends more time awake during the night rather than during the day; he starts getting strange urges and a strange hunger; and he loses part of his reflection; and the family dog becomes hostile towards him. Maybe it was just the 'cigarette' he shared with David, after all, that had him seeing maggots where there was rice, and worms where there was noodles. If not the 'cigarette', perhaps it was the 'red wine' that he shared as part of his induction into David's world. As Michael tries to get a grasp of the changes happening to him, it is his younger brother Sam, and his Frog friends who help him with suggestions of how to stop the changes. As a gang they must work together to stop the darkness that is befalling Michael and the sleepy coastal town of Santa Carla before it's too late.This film was well ahead of it's times, Schumacher does well to take the vampire myth and puts it in a sleepy but young coastal town, covering it up with seemingly genuine occurrences such as the missing kids, and even covering up vampires as angry biker punks. The scenery, the setting, and the way it is filmed are all great. It is fair to say that the general cinematography and mise-en-scene helps establish the film early on, and then allows it to flourish superbly as the plot unfolds. Although slightly dirty and washed out at times, everything still looks authentic - it is just the firelight smoke swirling in the sea air that makes it looks dirty. David's gang is mean and nasty, but so damn cool too. The audience can empathise with Michael, first having concerns about David and his cronies, but then wanting to be part of the pack too. The link to the characters actually happens on different levels too; if you don't find a link in Michael, then perhaps you are more aligned to mother Lucy - perhaps you worry about what your kids are doing while you are trying to earn a wage. Perhaps your link is with Sam; worried about a sibling that is going through a change into manhood - only this time into vampirism instead. The empathetic links that the audience could make comes from the strength of the cast and their performances. Everybody pulls their weight and the script that they work from is tight and has depth. In my opinion this is Jason Patric's finest film performance, he is cool and broody, the perfect outsider, almost akin to a James Dean's ""Rebel without a cause"" (1955) performance - wanting to be involved only to find that he could be cooler than the gang without trying too hard. Sutherland looks like he has come straight off stage at MTV from fronting the coolest rock band in the world, it is easy to hang onto his every word. He commands attention whenever he is on screen. Corey Haim is a great leveller to give the audience stability to hand on to. Cory Feldman and Jamison Newlander are excellent and extremely memorable as the Frog brothers. And, as ""Grandpa"", Barnard Hughes gets some great one-liners and comedy moments too.Straddling various tags; at times, this film is schlock horror comedy, sometimes young adult romance, occasional comic adventure, and still a family movie. It might be dated when you look at it now - it's unmistakably 80's with the fashion, but it still stands the test of time because it's a highly entertaining movie that doesn't always take itself seriously, but is made to make audiences happy whether you want trills, spills, scares or cares. It even established some vampire film tropes which are still used today; ""Vamp on"" is a term which is common place in modern vampire films to describe the transition between looking normal and being a nasty looking blood-sucker; prior to this film my main experience with vampire flying was when they transitioned into bats - well not here! The film also does well in it's use of makeup and fake blood, modern films tend to go down the CGI route, while that was available at the time I think that had it have been used it would have made the film look cheaper, and possibly hampered it's visual appeal.With a pace that won't bore, running at 97 mins, with one of the best and coolest soundtracks of its era - ""The Lost Boys"" is truly a great film, and one I am happy to recommend to anyone. It is also a film I find myself watching at least once a year too, not because I own a copy, but because it is the kind of film which will be on a TV channel at least once a year. There is bad language, there is a sexual reference and violence - it's not for the entire family audience, viewer discretion is advised. What you've got here is one of the best none-traditional vampire films committed to film, an entertaining, iconic cult film that I absolutely love. 8 out of 10.",The Lost Boys

92,CharltonBoy,Bon Jovi With Teeth,8,1 February 2002,"I read another comment from a reviewer and it said "" ahead of it's time"" and i cant think of a better way to describe The Lost Boys. For a film that is 15 years old you wouldnt know it , apart from the 80's fashion and music. It still looks cool and the soundtrack fits the film perfectly. It is 90 minutes , which is just right for a horror movie (not too long) and it has a good blend of humour without making it too stupid. Joel Schumacher deserves a lot of credit for a very watchable horror flick that will go down as one of the better ones of the eighties. 8 out of 10.",The Lost Boys
93,gbheron,Good Horror...Should Have Been Great,7,9 February 1999,"This movie has all the makings of a great horror classic, and through the first 3/4s it is.  Characters, plot, photography, everything is going for it, then the directors cops out on the ending.The ruination of many a good film is that the screenwriters and directors don't know how to end them.  In this case too much reliance was placed on special effects which were used to stage a gory, high-flying fight to the finish.  This movie deserved better....too bad.",The Lost Boys
94,KnightsofNi11,Very cool vampire flick,7,26 June 2012,"When you combine the cheesy style of 80's films and the exciting horror of vampire films The Lost Boys is what you get, and it is exactly what you would expect from an 80's vampire flick. Jason Patric and Corey Haim play two teens who just moved to a small coastal town in California, only to discover that the town may or may not be frequented by vampires. Michael (Patric) gets himself involved with this gang of punk rocker looking vamps and it's up to his brother Sam (Haim) to save him with the help of some local self proclaimed vampire hunters. Whatever you think The Lost Boys might be like, you're probably right.The Lost Boys is super cheesy, but super fun as well. The music solidifies that 80's cheese and the overall look of the characters just adds to the very time period specific quality the film has to it. There's no exceptional camera work, superbly intelligent screen writing, or dense and complex story being worked here, but The Lost Boys is definitely a lot of fun, and that's all it really strives to be. Honestly, there's really nothing wrong with this film because it does what it came here to do, tell an awesome vampire story. It does take some liberties with the vampire lore, but it's things that can be overlooked.Really, as far as this film being a vampire film goes, it really succeeds on an entertainment value level. The vampires look awesome in this film and they perfectly locate that area between being incredibly scary and really badass. We don't get any real vampire action till about halfway through the film, but it's worth the wait. There are some great human versus vampire scenes in the last half of the film, especially the final standoff between the vampires and our protagonists.The Lost Boys as a whole is a wicked cool film. It doesn't amount to much more than a neat vampire flick but it certainly excels at being one. I definitely enjoyed this film throughout. It gets a little slow and a little choppy as far as editing goes towards the middle, but it catches its footing for the final act and really pays off. The Lost Boys is simply just a lot of fun.",The Lost Boys
95,jluis1984,Great 80s fun!,7,3 August 2006,"There are many films about vampires, but one that is almost always remembered with a shy smile on the face is definitely ""The Lost Boys"". As one of the best remembered films of the 80s, this movie has become part of pop culture and a defining film for that period as it showcases most of what was cool or hip in that decade. While its status as ""horror classic"" has a lot to do with the nostalgic factor, it's an entertaining film on its own right and its modernization of the vampire myth along with its tongue in cheek humor still make for a charming and funny session of pure mindless entertainment.The movie begins with Lucy Emerson (Dianne Wiest) as she moves to Santa Clara, California, with her two teenager sons, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim) after a bitter divorce. In Santa Clara, Michael becomes involved with a local gang of bikers who have a dark and mysterious secret while Sam becomes friends with two weird boys who claim that the town is being invaded by vampires and its their mission to get rid of them. As Michael begins to act strange, Sam suspects that his brother has become one of the undead and begins to take his friends seriously.Directed by Joel Schumacher, ""The Lost Boys"" is a movie that effectively combines a cool and attractive look with a simple but entertaining plot resulting in a successful and charming film. The story modernizes classic elements of the vampire myth and adapts it to its time with intelligence and definitely tongue in cheek humor. In fact, this self-aware comedy approach is what makes the film enjoyable, and it relies more on fun and laughs than in actual scares. The plot is rather simple, and lacks some character development, but it makes an interesting (although also quite simplistic) analogy between the troubles of youth and becoming a vampire.Visually the movie looks great, although by now it has that dated nostalgic look of a past decade. Still, the flamboyant visual composition fits perfectly in the film's time and context and it is one of the films biggest assets. Schumacher's fluid and energetic camera-work makes the movie flow at with a nice rhythm and the movie never becomes dull or boring.The cast is very effective and everyone makes a great job. Corey Haim is remarkably good and while he may not be a good actor, in this film he is perfect for the role of Sam. Jason Patric is less lucky and he is overshadowed by the very talented Kiefer Sutherland, who steals every scene with his charm and presence. Jami Gertz gives a somewhat forgettable performance but veterans Dianne Wiest and Edward Herrmann are both excellent in their roles and have some funny lines.""The Lost Boys"" suffers a lot from its own self-referential nature, it looks old and severely dated by now even when it's 20 years ago when it was released for the first time. The cleverly written plot is very entertaining, but somehow the lack of character development and the comedy take on the story make it to never reach its full potential. The premise is quite interesting but the ""Lost Boys"" theme is never fully explored leaving at a nice but a bit shallow experience.Definitely most of the charm of ""The Lost Boys"" is due to nostalgia, as the movie is now basically a time capsule of the 80s. However, it is hard to deny that despite being what one would call a ""popcorn movie"", in its time it was an intelligent, original and fresh take on vampires. While it may not be a landmark of horror of a life-changing experience, ""The Lost Boys"" is one of those films that will definitely deliver what they promise: a healthy dose of mindless entertainment.",The Lost Boys
96,ivo-cobra8,Masterpiece! The greatest Vampire flick ever made!!!!,10,8 November 2015,"The Lost Boys (1987) is one of the best and the greatest vampire flick's ever made! A true Schumacher masterpiece and a classic horror film! I love The Lost Boys so much, it is one of the best true horror movies ever made from the 80's! I always loved this movie since I was a child and the vampires in here are awesome! It encompasses everything that was so silly and cheesy and fun about the 80's. The hair, the clothes, the music, the attitude - it seemed like nobody ever took themselves too seriously in that time. Hell, look at Tim Capello's cameo in the movie, for Christ's sake! Super oiled-up buff sax-playing dude in tight purple spandex? Only in the 80's!The story is about Michael (Jason Patric) and his brother Sam (Corey Haim) who move together with their mother to stay with their grandfather in Santa Carla, California. One day Michael meets a girl and falls for her to know later that she is with a gang of guys who are vampires. They give him wine mixed with blood and Michael drinks it without knowing what it contains. Things change for Michael and he finds out the truth. He tries his best to resist the urge of becoming a vampire and fights it with the help of his brother Sam. This vampire movie is the epitome of excellent humor/horror. Just when you are sitting on the edge of your seat getting ready for the next scary scene you get a joke or a snide remark. As you are relaxed by the humor, you get hit with a nail bitter of a scary scene. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard; some of my favorite music came from this soundtrack. One of my favorite movies that I ever love a true classic, I think for once Joel Schumacher did a great job as the director, He screwed up Batman & Robin (1997) but he made this movie right! This film is probably the best vampire movie I have ever seen, one of my favorites and the soundtrack was awesome loved Cry Little Sister and all of the tracks. The cast all around was very solid too I think probably the best cast for a vampire movie yet. I miss the 80's classic films, like one of them was Fright Night (1985) this movie is released 2.years later and it is another Vampire movie and right behind him. Gosh I want more Vampire flicks from the 80's like this one is. The Lost Boys is like Twilight of it's late 80's day. The difference between the two is that Lost Boys is a rock-n-roll vampire flick mixed with some goofy humor to make it the cult classic is has become ever since it came and went from theaters to VHS.In this film are famous stars like are Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer from 24 (2001) TV show, one of my all time favorite TV shows. Corey Feldman and of course Alex Winter he played in Death Wish 3, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and it's sequel Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey gosh I miss those movies. Why can't they make movies like are this ones today? The Lost Boys, Fright Night, Death Wish 3, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey are classic movies where are they now?Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die. It's fun to be a vampire. When a single mother and her two sons move to the sleepy seaside California town of Santa Clara, they discover much more than they anticipated in this visually stunning blend of hip humor, horror and rock 'n' roll about the most compelling group of contemporary vampires ever to put fang to vein. That is actually the basic plot of the film! The Lost Boys is a 1987 American horror comedy film starring Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Corey Feldman, Dianne Wiest, Edward Herrmann, Alex Winter, Jamison Newlander, and Barnard Hughes. Anyway I am giving this film a 10/10 because the film deserves it and it doesn't deserve to be bashed and hated from people! I love this film to death I love it!!!",The Lost Boys
97,gab-14712,The Game-Changing Vampire Flick!,9,7 January 2021,"Two decades before Twilight arrived, the vampire genre received a boost with the game-changing The Lost Boys. Prior to this 1987 classic, vampires were seen as deadly creatures of the night a la Nosferatu or Dracula- older men with a neater, more distinct style. Joel Schumacher's vision, for the first time, allowed teens and tweens to take the spotlight within the vampire community. In addition, this is not a straight-out horror feature. The film walks the tight line within the genres of horror, action, and comedy. Thanks to the delightful Frog Brothers, there are some incredible, laugh-out-loud lines that shows the film does not take itself too seriously. I do not think it ventures far into campy territory as well. Just enough scares, enough comedy to make for an awesome cinematic adventure. I was not expecting much, so I was very pleasantly surprised. Also, the creature design is great. I love what they did to the fangs of the vampires. Really creepy stuff!
The film received its origin in 1985 by first time screenwriters Jan Fischer and James Jeremias. The screenplay circulated on the black market until an indie studio picked it up. Later, Warner Brothers came on board to finance the movie. This screenplay was modeled after Richard Donner's, who was set to direct, The Goonies. The age of the characters reflected that thought. After Donner decided to pursue other projects, Joel Schumacher came on board to direct. He also brought veteran screenwriter Jeffrey Boam to revamp (no puns intended) the script as he wanted the characters ""older and sexier."" Schumacher gave his cast freedom to improvise (was an actual requirement for actor Jason Patric) and the producers/studio worried this style of vampire movie would fail. Luckily for them, it became a minor box office success and a cult classic.
Lucy (Dianne Wiest) is a recent divorcee and along with her two kids, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim), is forced to move in with her father in Santa Clara, California (which was modeled off Santa Cruz). This town has been shaken by these adolescent bikers headed by David (Kiefer Sutherland) and these mysterious deaths. Sam doesn't mind until he meets Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) and his brother at a comic shop and claim that vampires exist. At an amusement park, Michael meets the local girl, Star (Jami Gertz) and she draws him far within the biker gang. Sooner than later, Michael begins to exhibit symptoms of vampirism including sleeping during the day. With influence from the Frog Brothers, Sam must be ready to save his brother. There is a plot line that I do not think is quite as strong, and that is the blossoming relationship between Wiest and a local resident, Max (Edward Herrmann).
I think it was a good idea to make the vampires ""too cool for school."" Kiefer Sutherland embraces that notion, and it works very well. Schumacher made an excellent casting choice after watching Sutherland's bully portrayal in Stand by Me. Corey Feldman continues his strong run of 80's films. Excellent humor decisions and has a deeper voice! Schumacher was surprised Wiest accepted this role coming off her Academy Award win for Hannah and her Sisters, but her presence is most accepted. I also liked Jason Patric's performance. His character makes questionable decisions, but I did like his portrayal.
Overall, I enjoyed the heck out of The Lost Boys. It mixes humor and scares effectively without going too far on each end of the scale. The ending is traditional in terms of big sets and loads of action, but the home invasion sequence was done very well. The soundtrack is awesome! Thomas Newman handling the score and some good songs headed by INXS and Foreigner. The story makes a wise decision to turn the vampires into much younger beings which ties into the themes of adolescence, thus making this movie an effective teen flick as well. The character designs are excellent (those fangs!). If you like vampire films or 80's teen comedies, give Schumacher's film a taste. You're bound to be thrilled and to laugh.
""Look at your reflection in the mirror. You're a creature of the night Michael, just like out of a comic book! You're a vampire Michael! My own brother, a ..., ....-sucking vampire. You wait 'till mom finds out, buddy!"" -Sam
My Grade: A-",The Lost Boys
98,Falconeer,Stylish horror comedy,6,30 September 2016,"Loved it when I was a kid, not so much now. I find ""The Lost Boys"" hasn't aged so well, and what looked 'super-cool' once looks a bit cheesy today. The problem is it's trying to be two different kinds of films; a Gothic, somewhat erotic vampire tale, as well as a silly comedy geared for younger viewers. I think the comedy kills what could have been a classic horror movie. And even as a young teen I found the ""Frog bothers"" to be tiresome and dumb, and something to be endured until the vampire gang was on screen again. The movie does have it's merits however, including some great atmosphere and sets, such as the sunken hotel/vampire lair. Jason Patric is the very definition of cool, and what every boy aspired to be in the 1980's. Jamie Gertz was beautiful and mysterious as 'Starr' and Kiefer Sutherland has created one of the most sinister and unforgettable vampire villains in 'David.' I always wished director Joel Schumacher had just stayed with this darker tone throughout the film. But the jarring comedy makes for an uneven and unsatisfying viewing experience. Certain horror films that I loved as a child I still love now; films like ""Cat People"" (1982) and ""The Hunger"" have fared much better over time, but I suppose those films were geared towards an adult audience anyway. ""The Lost Boys"" is still worth a look..",The Lost Boys
99,cchase,"""The BLOODSUCKING Brady Bunch!""",9,5 December 2008,"Naw, THE LOST BOYS isn't anywhere near as cheesy as the insult above hurled at one of the main villains in the movie, but hey, considering the history of the script, it could've been a helluva lot worse. In its earlier stages, the James Jeremias/Janice Fischer-penned tale had possible scenarios where it could've been either ""Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs-with-Fangs,"" or ""PETER PAN-with-Fangs."" Thankfully for us fans, the only thing retained from the ""Pan"" version is the title.So, let's go back, folks, to a time when the influence of MTV was already infiltrating popular culture to the saturation point. The reign of the ""Brat Pack"" was already in full swing, and teen dramedies had fused with music videos to give us such sagas as ""FLASHDANCE"" and ""FOOTLOOSE."" The more obvious signs of infiltration hadn't quite made it into the mainstream sector of the horror genre...until now.Originally intended for Richard Donner, (SUPERMAN, THE OMEN), he stuck with this baby through its most difficult birth pangs, until he read a nifty little something called LETHAL WEAPON. After several gazillion rewrites by almost every well-known name in town, and ditto the directors (one of them being PET SEMATARY'S Mary Lambert), the directorial chores were finally handed over to someone who had only directed one other film...Joel Schumacher. Imagine that - the man now infamous for having nearly destroyed a movie franchise (BATMAN), was also responsible for starting a remarkable trend...the ""cool vampire"" movie. And as it stands, THE LOST BOYS was, if not the best of the lot, the most AWESOME-looking. I mean costumes, art-direction and cast-wise. And even with its music video-ready pedigree, even the story (as it ended up thanks to a final going-over by Jeffrey Boam) had more substance than your average ""THRILLER"" wanna-be.Harried divorcée Lucy Emerson (an excellent Dianne Wiest), retreating from her ordeal has moved to the beachfront town of Santa Carla with her two teenaged sons, young Sam (Corey Haim) and older sib Michael (former Brat Packer Jason Patric), to stay with her loveably cantankerous father, (the late Barnard Hughes in one of his best roles), while she figures out her future plans...whatever they are.Well, if among those plans was the intention of shielding Sam and Mike from ""bad influences,"" I'm afraid poor Lucy failed miserably in that department. Lured by the magnetic Star (Jami Gertz), Mike encounters our titular Bad ""Boys"", led by David (Kiefer Sutherland at his most charismatic and evil yet; Jack Bauer was EONS away at this point!) Decked out in leather, cool bikes and 'Poison'-worthy teased big hair, these guys set the ongoing trend for the new look of badass, rock-and-roll vampires. In the opposing corner, comic book aficionado Sam runs into amateur vamp hunters and book geeks the Frog Brothers, (BFF Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), who tip him off to the fact that Santa Carla is a lot stranger town than its surface would indicate, what with all the mysterious disappearances of the townies and such. Adding to the dramatic unease and tension is Lucy's interest in a new guy, local video store owner Max (Edward Herrmann). It's bad enough for Sam to deal with that she has a new beau, but add his big bro's sudden strange behavior (sleeping all day and the sudden, involuntary ability to fly), and the warnings from the Frog Brothers about Max's possible background for imbibing human plasma, and the stage is set for ongoing confrontations that are by turns hilarious (a disastrous dinner party given by Lucy for Max) and horrifying (the Frog Brothers and Sam's first and nearly fatal attempt at opening up a can of whup-ass on the Boys.)Together with Eighties vamp compadres NEAR DARK and FRIGHT NIGHT, THE LOST BOYS rounds out the group to make a super ""Fearsome Foursome Feature Fang Feast""! Former art director Schumacher kept the focus on decade-rich style, while high-caliber actors Wiest, Herrmann and Hughes brought the substance. Not to dismiss the contributions of the younger cast members, who are all great as well (though the breakout performance award has to go to Sutherland), but the single most notable contribution of BOYS, if nothing else, goes to a killer soundtrack featuring the Bands and Singers Of The Moment (Echo and the Bunnymen, FOREIGNER's Lou Gramm, INXS with Jimmy Barnes, Mummy Calls and Tina Turner's sax player Tim Cappello.)I know this will ""out"" my deeply hidden inner geek, but the soundtrack highlight for me is by Gerard McMann, whose ""Cry, Little Sister (Theme From THE LOST BOYS)"" is one of those creepy and compelling songs that raise goosebumps on my forearms and has every hair on the back of my neck standing on end, but I will pop in the DVD JUST to hear the thirty seconds or so of this song that opens the movie. Hearing the voices of a children's choir singing what sounds like 'The Vampire Commandments' is just THAT ghoulishly good.So here's one more commandment - find the 2-disk Special Edition like I did and get it for your library...NOW!!!!",The Lost Boys

There's punk rockers and mullets everywhere.Despite all that, ""The Lost Boys"" actually is quite good dose of horror mixed with some comedy. Acting isn't anything to note about, as it usually is in the movies like these, but the diction is pretty good and some of the scenes actually look very nice.TLB tells a story about a family, a mother and two brothers, who move to stay with their grandfather after moms divorce. Younger of the boys soon notices, that there's something strange about the new home town, while the older bro stumbles to a vampire gang lead by David (Kiefer Sutherland). There isn't anything spectacular about the script and the movie is actually quite predictable, but then again it is a genre film.Joel Schumacher has very unsteady career in quality ways, but with TLB he's managed to do very nice film, that even has some minor statement about alienation from the society for all those, who differ the norm.My score 7/10",The Lost Boys

With two Coreys (Haim and Feldman) having a good time, you can expect this to be just as fun as THE GOONIES. That alone doesn't make it too easy to call this a chilling horror film which has nowhere to go but down. I won't think for a moment that Kiefer Sutherland and his band of razor-sharp cycle punks would make it look ""stylish"", a word many of us love to use in describing vamp flicks. Those who grew up in the 80s like I did will have found this extremely enjoyable, and just as much as any movie would shout out the words ""Death by stereo!"".

It's a movie that has a flair for comedy and thrills, as well as a surprisingly exciting story. This movie doesn't waste anytime with its fast-pace. The movie's comical dialog is quotable good! Joel Schumacher does a splendid job directing this movie, giving it a wonderfully slick look and a sexual vibe.

The Lost Boys also has an awesome rock soundtrack, the Gerard McMann song 'Cry Little Sister' is a great theme for this movie and the Echo and the Bunnymen cover of 'People are Strange' is a perfect touch.The cast is a true highlight. Jason Patric is both attractive and convincing as a teen who is fighting the urge to bite! Kiefer Sutherland may look like he just jumped off of MTV but he makes for a great villain as the leader of the vamp thugs. Jami Gertz is good as a young lady who has fallen in with the gang. Corey Haim provides some comic relief as our young hero who's trying to save his big brother. Dianne Wiest is great as the boys mother, as is Corey Feldman as a local kid/vampire hunter! Barnard Hughes is a hoot as the grandfather, who delivers one funny conclusion for this movie.The Lost Boys is great fun all the way and remains one of the most stylish modern vamp movies around. Defanatly worth checking out.*** 1/2 out of ****",The Lost Boys

113,Shattered_Wake,The definitive teen horror of the '80s.,8,12 August 2008,"Corey Haim and Jason Patric star as a pair of brothers new to the fictional California beach town of Santa Carla, 'the murder capital of the world.' There, they're split between two worlds: Sam (Haim) is drawn to the world of Vampire hunters (along with Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander); Mike (Patric) is invited directly into the world of the vampires themselves (including Kiefer Sutherland, Alex Winter, and Jami Gertz). Together, they find themselves mixed up in the wild world of the Santa Carla Living Dead.This was the beginning for The Two Coreys. Both had worked together previously, but none had reached the level of stardom (and friendship) that they achieved in this film. It has long been my favourite vampire movie and my favourite 80s flick. And, after all these years, that hasn't changed. The Lost Boys stands alongside Scream, Friday the 13th, etc. as one of the best teen horrors of all time. It's simultaneously thrilling and hilarious, and contains some of the best scares of the films of its kind. The acting is top-notch from a great and up-and-coming cast. Schumacher's direction worked well with the story. Everything worked. However, I do have a take a little bit off for the strange and out-of-place ending that I was never a big fan of. But, it wasn't enough to come close to ruining the film for me.Final verdict: 8/10.",The Lost Boys
114,baileycrawly,Entertaining,8,22 January 2021,"For someone who isn't a fan of the vampire subgenre of horror (most likely as a result of over saturation), The Lost Boys was a surprisingly refreshing and fun little film. It's just the right length, doesn't feel like it ever drags at any point, and it's consistently entertaining. The acting was spot-on, particularly from the Coreys (Haim and Feldman), who both give memorable performances. An honourable mention would be Kiefer Sutherland who, once again, perfectly fit the role he was cast in. He was born to play the villains, and he relishes in the evil.
The effects are pretty good, too. Far from perfect, but more than serviceable for a 1987 release being viewed through the eyes of someone all but desensitized to even the most elaborate CG. There weren't any effects shots that really cheapened the movie or took away from the enjoyment in any way, shape or form.
The Lost Boys is a definite recommend.",The Lost Boys

I thoroughly enjoyed watching this masterpiece on the small screen as it came out before I was born but it was equally just as good as it would of been on the big screen.The Lodt Boys ismt your typical vampire movie, its so much more than that, it studies the effects, the relationships you can seem to still have as a vampire, the eagerness to suck blood from any human non vampire you see, it really is quite a remarkable watch.I highly recommend checking this movie out, there are a few of them and I regret to believe that you will be disappointed as that is impossible in this case, classic entertainment!",The Lost Boys
117,TwistedContent,Of course it's fun to be a vampire,7,30 August 2021,"The vampire subgenre is admittedly not one of my favorite ones, but I haven't yet seen all the classics, and I was fairly confident going into this cult flick. It is what it promises to be by taglining ""it's fun to be a vampire"" - a stylishly directed, nostalgic adventure romp dripping in the best traditions of the 80's.I'd say it's quite a landmark of the 80's, with some of the vibes that Stranger Things has borrowed. The soundtrack is especially awesome. And it's not overly cliché or goofy like some 80's incantations, this one basks in what was 'cool'. Did I say it's a comedy horror? A good one at that too, right amount of everything. Comedic epicenter comes within the Frog brothers (Jamison Newlander & Corey Feldman), a teenage duo that swears their life mission is to hunt vampires. They help little Sam deal with a particular problem - his protagonist brother Michael (Jason Patric) hanged out with the wrong crowd of vampires and got turned into one by back then unknown and now iconic Kiefer Sutherland as the main baddie vamp David. The plot is quite simple, but there are plenty of characters going about it, making the movie feel full. Perhaps no loud laughs, but comedy's pleasant, and so is the atmosphere, and, of course, practical effects. I was, however, ready for more gore. That's saved for the climax mostly.I also learned that ""Cry Little Sister"" is not Marilyn Manson's original song... Altogether, ""The Lost Boys"" hit the nail on the head for being a highly accessible and fun 80's horror flick that still holds up high in its subgenre. 7/10.",The Lost Boys

The surrounding cast were all solid in the film, all being respected, and well-known actors and actresses that include Jason Patric, Dianne Wiest, Jami Gertz, Edward Herrmann and Kiefer Sutherland. The story is original, having a lot of comedy and scares mixed within each other beautifully. It's also a really tough tossup on which brothers have the better character duo, between The Emersons or The Frogs. The story also stays faithful to vampire lore and has some decent special effects. It seems the one thing that was somewhat lacking was the use of a good instrumental theme song or soundtrack. There are many who enjoy the music to The Lost Boys so that was something that wasn't really my taste. Although, the ending while entertaining and hilarious, it was rather predictable. Otherwise besides those gripes, The Lost Boys is definitely a one of a kind vampire movie, and even with strong competition it's easy to say it's one of the best.",The Lost Boys

Jami Gertz is one of the all-time greatest and unheralded 80's actresses, she doesn't even seem to get mentioned much in regards to this role either. Back then, I knew her from Square Pegs. Recently, I watched two seasons of her as the human mom on the aliens-next-door sitcom, The Neighbors. She's still got it. Jason Patric is great as the tortured Michael, Haim and Feldman, in their first of several movies together, are fun to watch.Lots of style and some substance make this a great movie.

120,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,1 February 2005,"One of the coolest films of the 80's, and one which still stands up to today's impressions of 'coolness', The Lost Boys is an entertaining mix of horror and comedy, filled with great performances, which had a massive influence on the both Buffy the Vampire Slayerm and teen horror movies of today. Made for the MTV generation, the films stars are all good-looking and charismatic, but unlike todays 'stars', they do not try to steal the spotlight or feed their own egos.Diane West and her two sons move to a new seaside town after a divorce, staying with her father while she decides what to do with her life. The town seems good at first, and she is quickly offered a job by a local shop owner Max. Meanwhile her sons explore the town, which seems to have a history of missing people. Her youngest, Sam played by Haim looks at the comic store where he meets the Frog brothers who insist on giving him a vampire comic which they claim may save his life. The older brother Michael follows a beautiful girl around, Star-only to find that she is part of a biker gang led by David (Sutherland). Michael finds out that David and his gang are vampires, and that if he wants Star he must become one. He completes the first stage by drinking blood. becoming paranoid, Sam believes that the town is full of Vampires and thinks his brother has become one, and they soon try to work out how to prevent Michael and Star changing. With the help of the Frog Brothers, Feldman and Newlander they try to work out who the Head vampire is, as his death will save the others. So begins many laughs and scares before the final fight.In the style of Home Alone, the film tries to be inventive with household goods being turned into weapons, giving the film that mix of comedy and horror; The vampires are coming, the kids must prepare, but all they have are water pistols. The two Coreys are particularly good, making us wonder why they never got bigger parts, and Sutherland shines as the boss of his gang. Many twists ensue, the music is effective in enhancing the mood, and there are plenty of one-liners to remember. Probably the most entertaining Vampire movie ever, dark but not bleak, funny but not absurd, The Lost Boys is influential and should be enjoyed by all fans of Buffy, and be respected by critics as it is not just a simple, bland teen film. 9 out of 10.",The Lost Boys

122,theshadow908,Okay horror/comedy.,6,15 June 2006,"The Lost Boys tells the story of a family that moves to a small town that is the murder capitol of the world. The older brother ends up getting sucked into a group of teenage vampires, and ends up becoming a half vampire himself. As he struggles to fight the change, his younger brother gets the help of two teenage vampire experts to find the head vampire and end the plague on the town once and for all. While this is an entertaining and sometimes funny movie, it is nothing more than another 80s teenager movie starring a couple of nobodies and b-actors like Jason Patric, Corey Feldman, and Corey Haim.The plot is a little fast and underdeveloped. There isn't really a lot of character development involved. The movie just kind of starts and rolls into the action right away. Not a whole lot happens in the movie. The plot isn't really complicated at all. I know, it's sometimes nice to sit down and watch a good movie with not much of a plot, and I admit it's better than a bad movie with too much of a plot, but I can't help the feeling that this movie could have been so much more. I have no problems with Joel Shumacher's directing. It's a common misconception that he is a terrible director just because he directed Batman and Robin, but that was a mistake. Those people seem to forget he directed St. Elmo's Fire, Falling Down, and Phantom of the Opera. This movie is kind of funny. The scenes where Corey Haim is scared of his older brother are the funniest scenes.The acting in this movie is okay. Jason Patric isn't an impressive actor, but he's okay in this. Corey Feldman and Corey Haim are always bad, no matter what they're in. Obviously, the best performance in the movie came from Keifer Sutherland, who plays a complete and utter bad ass teen vampire. I only wish his role was longer.Overall, this is an okay movie for a rainy day, but there was some potential lost on it.6.5/10",The Lost Boys
123,jayjaycee,Like some extended hair metal music video,7,12 October 2020,"""The Lost Boys"" is a 1987 horror film directed by Joel Schumacher starring Jason Patric and Corey Haim.
⚪
All in all, this late eighties treat delivers some bloody good fun by sinking it's teeth into a metaphorical premise that equates being a teenager with vampirism, and despite some structural flaws, it becomes an admittedly stereotypical, but nevertheless moody, atmospheric and stylish coming of age horror flick that has one of the coolest, antagonistic blood suckers of all time.
⚪
Ending the second weekend in Spooktober with one of the earliest horror flicks I have seen, and one that has been a good fun ever since. The late Joel Schumacher, also known for flicks such as the worst ""Batman"" flicks as well as beloved classics like ""St. Elmo's Fire"" and ""Flatliners"", created an important genre entry that I personally think is often overlooked and not sufficiently appreciated. It is undeniable that it is full of stereotypes and makes use of most of the genre's tropes, but the central metaphor of this film is still one of the most brilliant allegories I have ever seen in a feature film. It is already brilliant how the film's title is derived from ""Peter Pan"", where it is the name of the children who never grow up in Neverland. Furthermore, according to this film, vampires are the same as teenager, and, kept in perspective, there are in fact a lot parallels between bloodsuckers and youths. To say nothing of irreverent behaviour and no respect for adults, both stay up all night, party like there is no tomorrow and mostly sleep all day. It is as simple as that, but I think this comparison is brilliant, because, let us be honest, teenagers sometimes behave as if they have no soul at all. As soon as protagonist Michael engages with the local hoodlums, who happen to be the vampires, he slowly becomes one of them and loses his humanity. As a result of this, he tries to fight what he has become, and this battle is literally what the entire film focusses on. As mentioned above, the film brims over with genre tropes and, not only because the titular vampire looks like some wannabe glam rock band, feels like an extended music video for Twisted Sister. The acting is mediocre at best, the lines are mostly cheesy, and the plot is also predictable as hell. Jason Patric delivers a decent central performance as the longhaired, tempted newbie, Haim is generic as hell, and Dianne Wiest does what she is best at, playing the strong mother. Oh, and then there are the Frog brothers, who don't only share their names with a certain macabre author and poet from the nineteenth century, but also are as weird as a story of him. Aside from the odd fact that they call themselves vampire hunters despite having little to no experience in fighting the creatures, I also cringed at how the two pubescent boys try so hard to speak with a deep voice and that made the whole thing not funny, but utterly ridiculous. In reverse, though, the film is makes up for this joke by having one of my favourite movie characters of all time. David, the vampire with the light blonde mullet and exclusively black clothing, is one hell of a stylish antagonist. Kiefer Sutherland plays him with such an indescribable coolness and charisma, that I always root for him instead of the heroes. Let's be honest, he downright steals the show from everyone. It has a great antagonist and a decent premise, as well as a moody location, but there is still something that displeases me: the plot. It suffers from tonal difficulties, because even if it primarily wants to be a horror film, there is only little blood and gore, and the vampire prosthetics are not the most optimal either, and there is not enough done to classify it as a coming of age film with horror elements, let alone does it have enough jokes to consider it as a comedy. It is located somewhere in between and remains undecided throughout. And the ending, despite of having two decent kills, is extremely anticlimactic and criminally short. Like, the henchmen vampires are killed in an instant, and after only a few minutes of exclaiming corny one liners and wrestling mid-air, the final ""fight"" between David and Michael is over in the matter of seconds and doesn't do this iconic opponent justice. Oh, and the so-called plot twist that Richard Gilmore aka Max is the head vampire was obvious from the very beginning and equally poorly conceived. Why do I still like it, despite all those obvious flaws? Well, simply because it perfectly captures the essence of the eighties horror film, has a decent flair and always made me have a good time. It is like that favourite hair metal music video you have seen a million times: it never gets boring. That is what this flick is to me. Having said that, I think I am going to listen to some classic Skid Row songs now...",The Lost Boys

Joel Schumacher At His Best.",10,28 October 2013,"The Lost Boys is one of the greatest Vampire films ever made,an Excellent Horror Comedy that combines amazing direction,a brilliant cast,non-stop terror,great laughs,a wonderful script,a terrific score and soundtrack and fantastic special effects. All those elements make The Lost Boys one of Joel Schumacher best films,one of my favorite Vampire films and a true classic.The Lost Boys tells the story of teenage brothers Michael(Jason Patric)and Sam Emerson(Corey Haim)who along with their Mother Lucy(Dianne Wiest)have moved from Phoenix,Arizona to Santa Carla,California to move in with their Grandpa(Barnard Hughes). While in Santa Carla,Michael falls for a beautiful,but mysterious girl named Star(Jami Gertz)who runs with a gang and the leader David(Kiefer Sutherland). Unfortunately for Michael,David and his gang are blood sucking Vampires and want to bring Michael into the fold. Worried about Michael,Sam enlists the help of Vampire killers Edgar(Corey Feldman)and Alan(Jamison Newlander)The Frog Brothers to help Michael and kill the Vampires.The Lost Boys was the first Vampire movie I saw and not only is it one of my favorite Vampire films but is also one of the all time great Vampire movies and a classic because The Lost Boys is a film that is exciting and thrilling while also being a funny and over the top film that has a lot of style but great substance as well. One of the great things about The Lost Boys is the film's take on the Vampire genre. Instead of being another Vampire film with a Gothic setting The Lost Boys is set in the bright and sunny locations of Southern California with vibrant colors and neon lights which make The Lost Boys probably the lightest looking Vampire film ever made. What also makes TLB so unique and fresh is the way the Vampires look because David and his gang look like Rock stars instead of Dracula because you wouldn't think of David and his gang as blood suckers but as a Rock band waiting to perform at a concert. Their look is great and fascinating because it makes their actions so terrifying and intense. TLB is a Vampire movie that wonderfully balances the genres of Horror and Comedy mixing Suspense and laughs. The Horror works because of the scare and surprise scenes that are shocking and unexpected because the scenes happen so fast and quick putting viewers on the edge of their seat. The bloody and gory special effects are well-done and memorable but it's not too disgusting and compared to most Horror films in the 1980s the blood and gore is light. Despite being a Horror film the movie never takes itself too seriously and it's not really dark. The Comedy in TLB is hilarious because of not only the way the movie toys with the Vampire genre and it's trademarks but also the many lines and moments that happens throughout the movie where some the lines and moments are done in a straight manner or is offbeat and at times quirky. When you watch TLB you're scared but at the same time you want to laugh. TLB is a film about great style and being that the film was released in 1987 TLB is a reflection of an MTV Music video at the time with tons of music in nearly every scene,the look of the main characters and the flashy visual style with fast cuts and slow motion that makes the movie film at a fast pace that never slows down until the very end. The Lost Boys is like an MTV Music Video on Steroids. Michael and Sam are great characters because despite the things that happen to the two of them they are still brothers who love and care for one another because they are family and the relationship between the two has great depth. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam,Janice Fischer and James Jeremias is great and quotable with dialog that is funny and slick and with fun pop culture references as well as references to other Horror films. The Action scenes are amazing,thrilling and suspenseful and when the Action happens it explodes like dynamite and will punch you in the face. The ending of The Lost Boys is brilliant and filled with excitement,twists and thrills that will have you cheering and clapping. A terrific ending.The whole cast is wonderful. Jason Patric is excellent as Michael,with Patric bringing emotion and depth to the role. Corey Haim is brilliant and funny as Sam,Michael's little brother. Kiefer Sutherland is amazing and menacing as David,the Vampire gang leader. Jami Gertz is terrific and beautiful as Star,Michael's love interest. Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander are fantastic and hilarious as Vampire killers Edgar and Alan,The Frog Brothers. Dianne Wiest is wonderful and charming as Lucy,Michael and Sam's Mother. Barnard Hughes is outstanding and funny as Grandpa,Lucy's Father. Edward Herrmann is great as Max,a video store owner and Lucy's boyfriend. Brooke McCarter(Paul),Billy Wirth(Dwayne),Alex Winter(Marko)and Chance Michael Corbitt(Laddie)give good performances as well.The direction by Joel Schumacher is brilliant and stylish,with Schumacher always moving and going wild with the camera with close-ups.zooms and great camera angles that keeps the film moving at a tight pace. Amazing direction,Schumacher.The score by Thomas Newman is fantastic,thrilling,intense and adds to the film. Great score,Newman. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by Gerard McMahon,(Cry Little Sister,The Theme From The Lost Boys),Lost In The Shadows(Lou Gramm),Echo And The Bunnyman(People Are Strange),INXS And Jimmy Barnes(Good Times And Laying Down The Law),Roger Daltrey(Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me),Ritchie Zito(I Still Believe),Run-D.M.C And Aerosmith(Walk This Way),Eddie And The Tide(Power Play),Mummy Calls(Beauty Has Her Way),Clarance 'Frogman' Henry(Ain't Got No Home)and more. Amazing soundtrack.In final word,if you love Horror-Comedies,Vampire films or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The Lost Boys,an excellent Horror-Comedy,one of the greatest Vampire films of all time and a true classic that is Joel Schumacher at his best and is a film you will never forget.

After the painful experience I had with the Two Coreys, I never wanted to lay my eyes on Corey Haim and Corey Feldman ever again, but I was interested in seeing this film. I put my anger at them aside and watched this film. I really enjoyed this movie, actually, and I think I am able to forgive Haim and Feldman over their awful ""reality show."" They are actually pretty good in this film, as well as Jason Patric, Barnard Hughes as the unsettling but humorous grandpa. and Kiefer Sutherland. Speaking of Kiefer, I think he is exceptionally creepy in this film. He may always be creepy, but still, he was fantastic in this film. However, I do believe that Jami Gertz was a little robotic as Star, but she was overall okay. I still do not know why this film was rated R. There was nothing that bad in it. It deserved a PG-13 rating. The soundtrack of this movie is also very good and entertaining to just hear. From the Doors to the spooky theme song Cry Little Sister, this film is jam packed with memorable songs from the eighties.Here is the plot of the Lost Boys. Lucy Emerson and her two sons named Sam and Michael move in with the sons' grandpa to the town named Santa Carla. At a carnival Michael meets Star, who is a member of a motorcycle gang, lead by David. To become a member of the gang, Michael must do a number of strange things, including jumping into the fog and even drinking blood. Michael then starts to change. He begins wearing sunglasses all the time in the sun, sleeping all day and going out in the night, and more. Sam begins to think that he is a vampire after he is given a vampire comic book by two vampire hunters named Edgar and Allen. After it has become apparent that the gang is made up of vampires, they try to find the leader of the vampires. Sam suspects Lucy's boyfriend, Max, but they then doubt that. Edgar, Allen, and Sam then make a plan to kill the vampire gang. They, with the help of Michael, destroy the gang, but then find out that Max is the lead vampire. When Max tries to kill Lucy, grandpa then kills Max.Overall, this is a down-right awesome vampire movie. This is the first of its kind about teenage vampires and after a barrage of countless rip-offs, this is still the best of the best. The make-up on the vampires is fantastic, the directing by Joel Schumacher is solid and creepy, and the writing can be light-hearted, funny, and scary, not necessarily at the same time in the script, though. This may not be the scary but today's standards, but that does not mean that this is not a bad film at all.

One of the sons Mike falls in love with this girl called Star who is seen around the amusements with a little boy,the other son Sam makes friends with two boys who are vampire hunters and it just so happens Star's other sort of boyfriend and his punk 80's gang are vampires and they must stop them. When I first watched the movie I honestly didn't think to much of it,I thought it was kinda boring and crap. But when I decided to buy it on DVD, I watched it again and LOVED IT. Seriously, I loved it so much,the acting by Corey Halm and Corey Feldman was class.

133,joemamaohio,My Review,9,26 July 2008,"Still hailed as one of the best vampire movies out there, ""The Lost Boys"" centers around four teenage vampires in a small California town, who live like a vampire should live - with no fear of death.Michael (Jason Patric), Sam (Corey Haim) and their mother Lucy (Dianne Wiest) recently moved to California from Arizona, and Michael starts falling for Star (Jami Gertz), a girl he saw at the boardwalk.Sam runs into two comic book dealers Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan (Jamison Newlander), who tell Sam that the town is overrun with vampires. Sam doesn't believe it until the Lost Boys decide to choose Michael as their next initiation.Michael slowly becomes more vampire-ish, and Sam wants to save him, but the only way to stop Michael from being a vampire is to kill the head vampire.But who is the head vampire? Is it David (Kiefer Sutherland), the leader of the Lost Boys...or is it Max (Edward Herrmann), Sam's mom's new love interest...or is it someone else? They need to find out soon before Michael becomes a total vampire.A different take on vampire films, and seemingly the prototype for modern teenage-vampire movies and shows, ""The Lost Boys"" delivers in the thrills, chills and laughter, and is a romping good movie to see!",The Lost Boys
134,freaky_dave,Pleasant and surprising vampire tale from 1987,7,20 February 2006,"Two brothers, Sam and Michael (Corey Haim, and Jason Patric) move to Santa Carla, California with their mother (Dianne Wiest). Once there Michael, the oldest brother, falls in with a rough crowd for the affections of a girl (Jamie Gertz), and Sam falls in with two kids who work at a comic book store. Michael soon discovers that his new friends are really a pack of vampires, and his brother Sam soon discovers that the two kids working at the comic book store call themselves vampire hunters. In the middle of this is poor Mom who just wants to find a job and start a new life, but even she can't escape the trouble that surrounds Santa Carla.The Lost Boys was definitely up there as one of the better horror movies of the late 1980s. It had style and decent acting with some offbeat humor that kept me entertained. This movie was probably one of the last good films involving both Coreys. Even Kiefer Sutherland, who now plays a cop in the hit series 24, made the role of the seeming lead vampire one of his own. The weakness of the film comes in the last act when all the build up is nearly thrown out the window for a quick fix of an ending that becomes just a battle of Peter Pan proportions. Still it was good enough to be given a 7 out of 10Another 80s vampire film to go up on the same list with Fright Night which was another impressive movie about the same thing, though out two years earlier. Both have held up overtime, but Fright Night, in my opinion, was still the better film. Neither one is the greatest film of all time, but they were both entertaining and are still well worth seeing.",The Lost Boys

Its got a great haunting soundtrack to it by The Sisters of Mercy and that must have been what captured me at the time. Needless to mention Echo and the Bunnymen's cover of The Door's 'People are Strange'. Its a vampire movie, quite wicked at times. Sleep all day, party all night, its fun to be a vampire.

Conflicts ensue. In some quarters, this is reported as a cult movie. More straight to the point: this is a vampire story for the VERY noncritical Nickelodeon crowd, that more or less defines the decade in everything, from music soundtrack to fashion, sets and music-video visuals. Innocuous and nostalgia-inducing, to be sure, but still an obvious-at-every-turn, grand cheese-fest (Feldman's lingo, the beach concert, the obligatory romance... oh, brother!) that actually might work better if viewed as a straight comedy, because turkey laughs are plentiful. Too bad the bits MEANT to be funny, aren't particularly so for anyone over 14, either! Best thing in it is Sutherland, who makes quite an impressive vampire gang leader.

138,RhapsodyReviews,Highly Entertaining.,9,30 October 2019,"Review:
'The Lost Boys' is a horror film directed by Joel Schumacher.
I do remember liking this movie when I first seen it years ago and watching it now I can't believe how well it holds up. It is again a movie with flaws, but I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I was excited to talk about it.
The film is about two brothers, Michael and Sam (Jason Patric and Corey Haim) who move to California to a fictional beach town called Santa Carla, and end up fighting a gang of young vampires.
In my mind this is among the most brilliant of vampire movies ever made, in the modern film era. Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland are destined to blow away all audiences of this visual masterpiece. You can't go wrong with also having Corey Haim, Corey Feldman and Alex Winter in co-starring roles, especially in the 1980's. Everybody puts on a great show in this film.
It has an outstanding soundtrack that I will probably be listening to on repeat for the next few weeks. Visually the movie looks great too, although by now it has that dated nostalgic look of a past decade. But, saying that I still believe that the story was way ahead of it's time and I think we were all luck to have Joel Schumacher on board with this film.
Overall, this may be one of the best vampire films ever made, with enough comedy elements to lift the entertainment, without diluting the story or the tension.

139,LanceBrave,A gang of juvenile hooligans but the twist is they're vampires!,7,3 November 2013,"So how big a deal is ""The Lost Boys?"" Is it one of those universally praised horror films? A beloved cult item? Or was it just the people I hung out with in high school who liked this movie so much? The film obviously has enough of a following to greenlight two twenty years later DTV sequels and action figures and things. I saw the movie years ago and it never really grew on me. That's one of the things Halloween is about for me: Possibly reassessing potential classics.The central premise is actually fairly clever. It's a gang of juvenile hooligans but the twist is they're vampires! I'm not sure any movie did the roving gang of vampire teen things before this one. The film attempts to update the vampire for then modern audiences. That made the film successful in its day but has the effect of instantly dating it now. The style, fashion, and music is deeply rooted in the late eighties. Characters have perms, mullets, crimped, perfect hair-dos. They wear studded leather, denim jackets, and torn polyester. The heroes of the film dress in bright pastels. I'm partial to Echo & the Bunnymen's cover of ""People Are Strange"" but a lot of the film's music was only cool in the late eighties. I guess it shouldn't surprise that ""The Lost Boys"" is a powerful bit of nostalgia for many folks.The movie's biggest problem is that it's main character is the least interesting character in the film. Jason Patric's Michael is a typically brooding teenager. He grunts a lot of his dialogue. His romantic relationship with Jami Gertz' Star is completely flat. Michael spends large portions of the film treating his mom and little brother like a jerk. He is a stock boring audience surrogate.Luckily, the supporting characters make up for it. The appeal of the Coreys mostly escape me but I'll admit, Corey Haim is fairly amusing. I like his exaggerated comic reactions to the strange things that happen around him. Feldman, Corey the Second, puts on this bizarre gruff voices. The Frog brothers are entertaining mainly because they pretend to be experts when they are truthfully clueless fools. Kiefer Sutherland is clearly the star of the show. His distinctive voice lends him a commanding presence, which works very well for this character. Edward Herrmann is fairly consistently awesome in most things and has fun playing two types here: First, the square boyfriend who is far too normal. Second, the evil head vampire, which allows Herrmann to gleefully over do it. The best character in the film is obviously Barnard Hughes' Grandpa. He makes creepy taxidermy animals, is obsessed with his (usually stationary) convertible, swings root beer, and has an off-screen girlfriend. He delivers his dialogue with such an off-hand casualness. Only Dianne Wiest proves unlikable. She's the classic clueless mom and remains clueless for far too long.The horror content is comic book-like and light. The movie holds off on revealing the vampires up until the horror point. Before that, the creatures of the night are mostly represented by swooping shots. Victims are lifted out of the area but little actual bloodshed is shown. The patience pays off, as the reveal of the yellow-eyed, bumpy headed vamps works well. The last act is truly when ""The Lost Boys"" starts to move. Shades of ""kids-on-a-mission"" flicks like ""Monster Squad"" or ""Goonies"" poke through as Sam and the Frog brothers prepare goofy, creative vampire dispatching methods. The bathtubs and squirt guns full of holy water are actually clever, while the death by stereo moment is far sillier. The entire last act, the confrontation between vampires and the reveal of the big boss, works far better then the film that comes before it.Joel Schumacher gets a lot of crap but give the guy some credit. He knows how to make a movie look good. ""The Lost Boys"" is especially gorgeous on Blu-Ray. The nights are dark and full of billowing fog. The red tent in the house at the end helps the suspenseful tone. Sometimes, his music video tendencies go too far, like the painfully earnest love scene between Michael and Star, but usually it lends a stylish, memorable look to the film. It's probably silly to look for queer subtext in everything Schumacher does but it does become apparent at times. Why would a teenage boy like Corey Haim have a poster of George Michaels, in short-shorts, thrusting his crotch forward, on his bedroom wall? When Michael's vampire instincts first kick in, he nearly feeds on his little brother. While he's in the bath. Finally, the bro-mance between Michael and David is nearly homoerotic, especially since Jason Patric has way more chemistry with Kiefer. And then there's the Greasy Sax Man...Conclusion? ""The Lost Boys"" is perhaps too prickly at first but eventually develops a likable zany streak. I'm not converting to the tribe yet but it doesn't surprise me people love this movie.",The Lost Boys
140,lagriff05,A fun film for almost anyone,9,17 June 2007,"This is truly the only good horror movie I've seen that would qualify as 'family friendly', because it is. It's a high speed, energetic 80s action/horror flick with some pretty funny comedy parts blended in. The movie is short, the plot is simple, and the characters are enjoyable. Sure, it's predictable at times, and most of the action/horror clichés manage to warm their ways into the mix, but you'll be smiling the whole way through. I found myself chuckling at the amusing vampire hunting midgets called the Frog brothers, and I liked the campfire scene, very violent without tasteless gore or blood. The final battle scene was well done, too, very fun to watch. Directing and scenery were top notch, especially at the scene where Michael is 'turned', with the fog and lighting outside. The motorbike race on the sand was very cool. Overall the entire package has a vintage 80s sort of feel, free-riding and hard-hitting, not a care in the world.This is one of those films you re-visit every now and then for an enjoyable viewing, rather then a spiritual voyage. It's all very high quality and top notch, so film purists probably won't be disappointed. Recommended to pretty much anybody!",The Lost Boys

144,joelgodinho,"""YOU'RE DEAD MEAT!""",7,19 July 2020,"The Lost Boys is a 1987 horror comedy directed by Joel Shumacker and starring Jason Patric, Corey Haim and Kiefer Sutherland.Shumacker is a very divisive director, having made some really awfull films like Batman And Robin but he has also responsible some mostly well received works and one of them is The Lost Boys.The cast is definitely one of the best parts of the film, I really like Kiefer Sutherland as the main antagonist ( he turns out not to the vampire leader but I think it's fair to say he is the main antagonist as he acts like it for almost the entire film ), Corey Haim is also really good and so are Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander as the Frog brothers.The film is very entertaining and funny, especially in the scenes with the Frog brothers and Sam and the ending while very cliché is very fun as well. The film itself isn't particularly scary however the vampire's look and some of the sces with them are pretty spooky.This film is not a masterpiece nor is it very memourable however it is a very entertaining and fun watch and an overall pretty good film too.",The Lost Boys

146,Solnichka,Good old-fashioned fun ...,8,3 June 2007,"I saw this movie for the first time in years this afternoon on some cable channel; the first time I saw it was in the theater as a 16-year old boy in 1987, right after I got my driver's license (no pun intended to connect to the Coreys' later film).The music/soundtrack still stands out as one of the best parts of the movie. It still works 20 years later. The Coreys are ridiculous, of course, but this movie really doesn't try to be serious (does it?). It approaches the themes with light-hearted seriousness, if that's possible.Jason Patric probably should have played Jim Morrison instead of Val Kilmer; there's a particularly striking moment in the cave of the sunken hotel where he is standing in front of a Morrison poster. But in this movie, he just over-acts. Jamie Gertz does, too. Lil' Sutherland does what he does best in this movie; it's funny to see him now on ""24"" in such a different place from his ""Stand By Me""/""Lost Boys"" roles. Twenty years changes a lot.Overall, this movie is still entertaining despite all its flaws. It doesn't try to be anymore than it is: a silly romp through a legendary evil arena. For that mission, it succeeds. It's fun to watch, even after 20 years. It hasn't aged, because it wasn't trying to be more than it was at the time it was made.(By the way, having grown up near Santa Cruz, CA, where this was filmed, that's always kept it close to my heart.

It also predates the current fascination with vampires in youth culture by about five or six years, which makes it a tad pioneering in that aspect.Kiefer Sutherland has the dominate look in this movie...while the Coreys Haim & Feldman provide much of the comic relief as two of the vampire hunters.  Think of it as a more adult version of the Goonies.The movie provides a few memorable scenes, especially the trail trestle and the bathtub scene, that have been emulated or parodied in some way elsewhere.  The Lost Boys doesn't really live up to the title, but it is a fun film to watch...and definitely should be on everyone's vampire list.",The Lost Boys

It's great movie with all the elements of a Schumacher movie. Atmospheric and stylish. The music is memorable and fitting. Great camera shots. During the day it's sunny with carefree crowds. At night there's fog and a sense of emptiness and danger. The 80s rock style also felt fitting for the sinister vampires. The characters are full of personality and have memorable dialogue.

The main action takes place in the fictional beach town of Santa Carla, and if the locations look surprisingly like Santa Cruz, California, well, they should, because it was indeed filmed there, particularly, the board walk amusement park scenes.As to be expected, there are plenty of blood spraying moments nicely tempered with Corey Haim and Corey Feldman providing barrels of comic relief at precisely the right moments. Even Grandpa gets some scene stealing comedic moments when he casually confesses: ""One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach; all the damn vampires!""And like the legend that immortal vampires never grow old, The Lost Boys will cinematically be just as ageless and fun for future generations to discover and enjoy.",The Lost Boys

I can forgive the cheesiness of Lost Boys, because it's meant to be a comedy. Although it's not very funny. Unlike the serious attempt at a vampire movie from the same year: Near Dark, this movie knows its bad and doesn't try to be anything else. That it's not complete amateur, is because it's produced by Richard Donner and directed by Joel Schumacher and has, later on major stars in it, like Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric. What I cant forgive, however is that these vampires eat food and need light to see in the dark. Vampires are nocturnal creatures that only need to drink blood to stay ""alive"". And they have nightvision. But I would have preferred a darker more serious vampire movie. Knowing what a great actor Kiefer is and how menacing he can be and was in Stand by me, that came out in 1986, a year before TLB I felt cheated here. Not to mention the fact that he wasn't in the movie nearly enough. But he was busy that year, also appearing in Young Guns, where he is much better. So it's not like he wasn't famous at the time. Another actor that also appeared in Stand by me, was Corey Feldman. Like Kiefer he was also much better in Stand By Me. The effects are bad, but could be much worse. At least they don't attempt to show the vampires flying. There is a twist at the end of the movie that will be seen coming a mile away. I would have loved this when it came out, but I guess I'm too old now. I love vampire movies, but I prefer the first Blade movie and the first two Underworld movies. If I'm gonna enjoy a vampire movie it has to be believable and dark and gory. Even though this is R- rated, there is very little blood and no swearing.This was watchable but also forgettable.",The Lost Boys
157,JohnnyPHreak,A bloody good time,10,11 August 2000,"Joel Schumacher directed this fun, exciting and bloody 80's vampire film. And it has just about everything needed for any 80's blockbuster, the duo Corey, Kiefer Sutherland, loud 80's music, innovative camera tricks and violence. The story tells the tale of a mother (Dianne Wiest) and her two sons, Sam and Michael (Corey Haim,Jason Patric) who have just moved from Phoenix to sunny Santa Clara, California. The mother has just been divorced and moving the family in with her father (Barnard Hughes). During a night out at the carnival, the mother gets a job at with a mysterious video storeowner named Max (Edward Herrmann). The eldest son Michael meets the girl of his dreams, Star (Jami Gertz) and her assumed boyfriend (Kiefer Sutherland) and his gang. The youngest son Sam has a run in with two guys (Corey Feldman,Jamison Newlander) who run a comics store by day and hunt the undead in their spare time. After this one night they all will realize that Santa Clara isn't, as it seems. This film is pure fun, plain and simple. The actors have fun with their roles and don't play them too serious, just enough to get the point across. It makes for a more enjoyable film. What makes this film most fun and different is Joel Schumacher's direction. There are a lot of colors that make each scene standout from the next. The `attacks' are filmed in such a fast-paced action sequence style that they amaze and shock all at the same time. The CGI is pretty good and hardly anything looks really unreal. This film runs like MI2. You may have to wait for the intense action sequences but when they come put you seat backs and tray tables in their up right positions and get ready for take off.

The Lost Boys is an 80's masterpiece, with amazing performances by the entire cast. It shows that vampires were once modern and hip without being manufactured exclusively for thirteen year old girls. Sure, the Corey's were at the pinnacle of teen heartthrob status in 1987, but there is more than enough in the rest of the film to satisfy beyond that demographic. Kiefer Sutherland is possibly the coolest vampire ever on the silver screen, and the subject matter is appropriately dark without being overly disturbing or sacrificing moments of levity.Really, it's a great film that's held up very well over the years.

Perhaps Corey Feldman, but I was thinking more of Kiefer Sutherland. I just saw Freeway and Dark City again and I think he is one of my favorite actors. 3.) To see the 80's style! Skin tight jeans, mullets, rolled bandanas; in this area, this movie had everything. However, I was dissapointed in not hearing any rad 80's slang, but still interesting.

Starring Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, Jason Patric, Kiefer Sutherland, Jamison Newlander, Brooke McCarter, Billy Wirth, Alex Winter, Jami Gertz, Edward Herrmann, Dianne West, Barnard Hughes and Chance Michael Corbitt. The first collaboration between The Two Coreys and also Kiefer and Joel in this movie. This is one of those 80s films that will just pull you into the atmosphere of blissfulness with these characters, the music, and everything the way it's made. Love the soundtrack including the score by Thomas Newman and my fave is the theme song titled Cry Little Sister by Gerard McMann. This is one of the greatest vampire films ever made and movies like Twilight aren't even included in that list in my opinion. I know Barnard Hughes, Corey Haim, Edward Herrmann and Brooke McCarter are chilling up there with all the legends we lost and they will not be forgotten in our hearts. RIP",The Lost Boys
163,MatthewLong23,fun movie,10,7 October 2006,"This is just a pure good time movie. It has a good premise in it, great characters and a lot of great moments. Has an amazing cast in it, and a great ending. Has some good scares in it no doubt but i would not classify this as a horror movie though it is about vampires. The music in this film also makes it really cool. I have no idea what the name of the song is they use but it really adds a lot of emotional depth to the film and just makes it seem cooler whenever i'ts played. The ending isn't as good as I would have hoped but that's okay cause the movie is still pretty cool. The twist in the end is something you knew was coming half way through the movie",The Lost Boys
164,srobi280,This movie SUCKS,1,11 February 2007,"And I'm not talking about blood, either. I tried watching this horrendous 80s vampire flick the other day. I only got about 30 minutes into it, and for sure, it put me right to sleep. I woke up a few hours later, with my mind in a daze, wondering if I should try watching it again. I decided that if it put me to sleep that quickly, it wasn't worth even trying to watch. I mean, this movie is so BORING. I honestly don't have a clue what its about (teenage vampires, perhaps), what its supposed to be (a comedy? It wasn't funny), or what the whole purpose of the movie is, as it has not a single iota of entertainment value. My advice: stores should remove all forms of sleeping pills from shelves, and replace them with copies of the Lost Boys. It would be a whole lot more effective, without any negative side effects, plus, its non habit-forming! Imagine that...",The Lost Boys

The only reason it didn't get a 10 is because it didn't have enough action.  It's a good movie and let's face it, most movies dealing with vampires are either outdated or just suck!! The Lost Boys is a good movie that needs to be watched.",The Lost Boys
166,The_Triad,Solid fun film,7,1 June 2006,"The Lost Boys is a great film to watch as a ""guy's (or girls, or both) night in"" film. The plot is not too complex, but it does seem as though it is juggling a lot of characters. There's the family that just moves to a new town populated by vampires. There's the video shop owner, the motorbike riding vampires and two teenagers who run a comic book store. All of these characters interact with each other and produce an interesting, sometimes funny experience, that does sometimes work as a horror. Personally, I found the Frog brothers characters to be the most entertaining, Corey Feldman doing what he does best, and something only he managed to do - look cool during the 1980s. Though the film is okay taken as is, there are lots of little touches to the film that really make it worth the watch, the muscled, mullet haired, greased up saxophone player, the homosexual undertones in Corey Haim's character, great, I mean great, use of gore, the grandpa character all add little touches that make it a great watch with a group of mates. Corey Haim's acting is notably poor. Sorry, about the link there, but it's been on my mind. He really is bad, and the editor has had to work some miracles to make him look like he's reacting to what's going on, this is notable most in the scene where Grandpa brings him a stuffed animal. But this is okay in a film like this, where we're not expecting an Oscar winning performances, and to be honest, don't want them. So get some mates round and watch it.",The Lost Boys

Many thought it was great, I thought it was stupid. It's about a mother and her two sons who move to a beach town. The younger son befriends two boys in a comic shop who claim to be vampire hunters whilst the older son joins a gang of punks who turn out to be vampires.THE LOST BOYS has some very very cheesy dialogue (some of which is very cheesily 80's) and although it's a comedy, you'd be most likely laughing at it instead of with it.In conclusion, I absolutely do not see the reason why this film is being idolised by so many film lovers.

171,jerome_horwitz,The best vampire tale ever,8,5 May 2007,"Most people won't agree with my summary, but I stand by my opinion. When tales of vampires first began hundreds of years ago, to me it's a shame that this isn't the way it all started out. It seems as if most vampire movies are produced like stage productions. The Lost Boys refreshingly is from a different mold.The Lost Boys is an updated take on the vampire myth. A divorced mother and her two sons are forced to move in with her father due to financial problems. Eventually the boys run into trouble, and become involved with vampires themselves. They do their best to protect loved ones by solving the issue alone, unfortunately they are unable to keep their secret.Personally I am a huge fan of this film. I've watched it dozens of times over the years, and still enjoy it immensely. Joel Schumacher has directed many great films, and this is definitely one of them. The cast is 1st rate. The soundtrack is excellent as well, and adds only positively to the movie. The combination of comedy and gore are perfect in the movie, and the portrayal of being an 80's teen was hit nail on the head perfect. This is an excellent movie, and should be viewed by all. 8/10",The Lost Boys
172,waterman_harry,Slapstick Horror Goofiness,5,26 April 2015,"The Lost Boys came out far too early to be considered satirical, however during a contemporary viewing its cynical tone can't be missed. Whilst its thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish for a variety of reasons (the amazing soundtrack, the campy tone and Dianne Wiest's parodical enigma of a clueless mother) the film suffers from plenty of set-backs. The tone is inconsistent throughout and features many examples of how slap-stick nonsense can really water down a solid story. It is incredibly dated too but that makes kind of makes it even more interesting. Best part of the film is really its soundtrack - Cry Little Sister (of course) and a cover of the Doors track ""People Are Strange"" by Echo & The Bunnymen.",The Lost Boys

I just finished watching my super scratched up BlockBuster rental. It was ghetto, I played the movie full screen and then it skipped when they kill the head vampire. So I flipped it over and finished it on wide screen. Awesome film. Great music, I love the theme track throughout Lost Boys. Good story. Cory Feldman and a movie from the 80's everyone should watch if you love that time period like myself. Keiffer Sutherland plays a great bad guy like in Stand By Me which I recommend if you like this film as it has Keiffer, River Phoenix, and Corey Feldman.

176,kidwltm,Good 80's Camp Film,7,14 July 2003,"There were way too many movies in 80's that were just silly teenie slasher films.  There still too many today.  But ever once awhile they make movie that in the genre that is not only tolerable, it's actually good.  Like most of these camp classics, Lost Boys is quick to poke fun at itself instead trying to be serious.  Schumacher and Co. knew they weren't making Oscar material stuff, and anyone that expects otherwise and complains otherwise really needs to exercise common sense a little.  The Lost Boys does have a light horror fare, goes a little blood happy every once and awhile, but for the most part is tame.  it's more of a 80's teen drama, which can either be good or horrible depending on your preferences.  I'm somewhere in bewteen. The cast was probably one of the reasons this movie has endured so long. Jason Patric always turns in a good performance (see Narc for evidence), Kiefer Sutherland hones his skills as a bad guy, and The Cory's meet on screen for the first time.  It's a memorable cast filled with memorable actors who, despite what atrocities they may have made later on in their careers, are a least good in this one movie.  Schumacher does a good job of adding some style to the film, albeit 80's style.Bad hair, synthesizer music and levistic attitudes. It's what the 80's were about.  If you like the 80's, you probably already know and love the film. It was an odd period in mainstream film, and Lost Boys is rather good culmination of all that defined 80's cinema.

They have also figured they are better than mainstream humanity,which is right.They believe they are better than anybody else.Doesn't their claim remind you what the Hitler Junge believed in Nazi Germany?Max would be a good Fuhrer too,once he started getting more ambitious. It also has referances to Peter Pan.The Lost Boys are Peter Pan's gang.The vampire gang of this film has the same name.Peter Pan was cruel towards his enemies and towards everybody from his Lost Boys who questioned his authority.Doesn't Max behave in this way?Peter Pan and his Lost Boys had found a way to be forever young.Those Vampires found one too.Remember the movie ""Hook""about Peter Pan growing up and being a lawyer?Forget it.He has grown up being a vampire calling himself Max.

Now this film, in the beginning, I thought ""It's the Goonies all over again,"" Life's not life if there isn't a fair. I mean, it would just be so terribly boring, nothing to do. So, there's the beach, and there's the spectacle. Luckily though Bram Stoker's Dracula has enough substance to entertain any generation, if you only stay true to it and after the beginning this film DOES. It even adds a truly funny angle to it by introducing the younger brother / older brother aspect or more generally the ""one happy family"" one. Much speaks against that this should work: Corey Feldman, for instance. But heck!, it does.Now, I'll indulge myself and write a little about Jim Morrison and.why I really HATE the beginning. Morrison was a pretty normal guy, really. This whole.nautical yarn handed down to him from his grandfather... please! So he valued what is called ""culture"" in most parts of the world. And then he's turned into this... well... words fail me, but this look at California in the beginning of this film, it's Esau,alright, feeling home NOWHERE, always hustling, and California is like the promised land of Esau's descendants and Jim Morrison is their... idol?",The Lost Boys
180,jeffronthi,"A Supreme Fantasy-Horror, With Forgivable Flaws...",7,12 August 2008,"This set off the careers of much fine talent, no need to recite them here. I will just say this: Joel Shumacher can take anything and turn it into a force. I say this because Lost Boys was intended as a children's fantasy flick. If you pay attention, this film could have gone very badly on some of the writing alone. Not that it was badly written, it's just, even by 80's standards, very clichéd in spots. And with the wrong talent, this would have been so-so at best. On to the talent: Haim turns in a fantastic performance. He just pops with personality and really shines in his role as the pseudo-cool outcast...too bad this is one of his last greats. Get this if you want him in A-form.Feldman, ever the over-actor, is still believable (and unforgettable) because of the age of his character. We're all pretentious as kids, you know. That's why child actors don't always grow up to be fine actors. People lose favor with their imaginations.If you want to see the Corey's shine, this is the film.Jason Patric is great in this film. Great, great, performer he turned out to be. He almost rejected this roll because he thought it was going to be an exploitation film about kids. So, even at 18, this dude had his sh**t together.Sutherland is magnetic, in possibly his best roll ever. Disagree if you want, but he owned this film with authority and has never fully duplicated or come close. Even so, I like him. He was awesome in Freeway.The entire of ""tribe"" of vamps had a seedy, brooding, vibe.Dianne Weist was INCREDIBLE as the paternal, on her own, starting over, single mother. She just pops with sincerity. I have seen her in many rolls and this is one of her better moments, though she has had many.Grampa is freakin' awesome. Enough said.Jamie Gertz turns in a terrific performance that bests that movie she did with Ralph Machio. No, seriously, that girl is hot.Joel is very good at atmosphere and vibe.

The young Kiefer Sutherland does give a good performance, but the rest of the tribe are essentially props, present to look cool and menacing, and barely have any speaking lines. That's not a complaint though, because the focus of this film is more on the protagonist Michael and his family, in tandem with its stylized cinematography and rock 'n' roll/goth visual aesthetic and musical accompanimentultimately it's a well-made, Hollywood production with plenty of memorable scenes, on par with Near Dark and Shumacher's Flatliners, and immeasurably better than the Taxi-Driver-inspired fascist propaganda film he would go on to direct in 1993",The Lost Boys

188,KnightLander,One of the damn coolest and finest vampire movies ever,7,20 June 2005,"Recently, while browsing the horror section of my local video store, I discovered the new Special Edition DVD release of ""The Lost Boys"" - which, by the way, I had been meaning to see for some time now, as I am a fan of vampire movies. As soon as the film began, I knew I was gonna love it.""The Lost Boys"" involves a family - ex-hippie mother Lucy Emerson (Dianne West), tough-guy big brother Michael (Jason Patric), imaginative little brother Sam (Corey Haim) - which moves into Santa Carla, reportedly the murder capital of the world. At first, it seems like a cool town - Sam is pleased to discover a comic book store - but then things start to get weird.Sam teams up with two wacky young vampire slayers (Jamison Newlander and - ta-daa! - Corey Feldman) and begins to suspect his mom is dating a vampire (Edward Herrman); meanwhile, Michael becomes a half-vampire with his mysterious new lover (Jami Gertz). Can the Emerson family survive a week in this city of death? Whether they can or not, I sure as hell loved surviving the 97 minutes of this film. ""The Lost Boys"" is an 80's classic. The stars, the filming style, and the soundtrack all help to make it so. Joel Schumacher - recently made notorious for ruining the ""Batman"" film franchise - gives some fine direction from a terrific script by Jeffrey Boam, Janice Fischer, and James Jeremias.One of the highlights of the film is its excellent cast. Corey Haim, 80's fave Corey Feldman (who's hilarious, by the way), Jason Patric, and Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland's performance is classic and among his best as the leader of a young vampire gang.The soundtrack is excellent, including the score by Thomas Newman. The film's theme, ""Cry Little Sister"" by Gerard McMann, is perfect. In a way, it completes the film, wrapping around the film in a blanket which gives the film's message: ""It wasn't their fault, they were just young"".One of the greatest parts of the film is the vampire effects, which includes those perceptive, reddish eyes. Greg Cannom's special effects were ahead of their time, and help make some dark scenes truly creepy.I find ""The Lost Boys"" to be quite underrated. Most people say it was dumb, childish, or not scary. What they don't understand is that for the most part, the film's not trying to be scary. It is a COMEDY. Even the extremely bloody final fight isn't really scary (by the way, the film is worth seeing if just for this scene).""The Lost Boys"" is a classic of the eighties, and I think we can call it a horror classic as well. It has everything a film should have - great acting (and cast!), fine direction, an original script, terrific effects, and a fitting soundtrack. ""The Lost Boys"" is quite possibly the best vampire movie ever and is essential for horror fans.",The Lost Boys

Moving in with their eccentric Grandpa(Barnard Hughes),the boys find life in the small town quite different to Phoinex,Arizona where they had moved from. For a start there is the incredible amount of unexplained, mysterious disappearances that seem to plague the area. It's not long  before the youths find themselves caught up in a whole load of trouble. Michael falls in with a gang of enigmatic bikers lead by the charismatic David(Kiefer Sutherland)while Sam meets a couple of boys.The Frog brothers(Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander)who's parents own a comic book store. The feisty lads try to convince Sam that Santa Carla is infested by the supernatural undead ie.Vampires. But by that time it's too late as Michael discovers when the true identities of his new biker pals are revealed to him. When Sam finds out the truth about Michaels new pals and what his brother is becoming. He tries to warn his mother. But with little success. Now with only the Frog brothers to turn to and with Michaels love for David's main squeeze Star(Jami Gertz) being the one thing thats holding him together. The pair of them have to help one another to stand up against and defeat the evil in Santa Carla. As one of the more well known teen horror movies of the late eighties.'The Lost Boys' although by no means entertaining and with a healthy dose of tongue n' cheek  humor, is no classic. Directed with the stylish and enthusiastic energy you would have expected from Hollywood veteran Joel Schumacher. Its a perfect example of a movie that lets style take a back seat to substance. After all this was merely the 'Breakfast Club' meets 'Salem's Lot'. An excuse to make a vampire movie for the teen crowd. The mostly young cast all gave wonderful, spirited performances. Even Corey Haim. An actor who along with his more talented counterpart,Corey Feldman. Found himself relegated to direct to video dross. Sutherland was suitably chilling in his roll as lead vamp David. While Patric showed the promise of a future star. Sadly however he never quite made the grade. Speed 2 didn't exactly do him any favors. The older actors were also good value. Dianne Wiest was her usual reliable self while screen veteran Hermann is good value. Ultimately for me the best character has to be Grandpa. Played with charming, comic brilliance by Barnard Hughes. He was only equaled by the Frog brothers(Feldman and Newlander).Together they ultimately made the movie. Surprisingly the visual effects have aged well and there is the odd chilling moment. That said there was something lacking that I cannot quite put my finger on. Something that lapses the movie in to mediocrity. That said the movies climax as the kids fend off an attack by the remaining members of Davids gang of Vampires does set your pulse racing while the last line of the movie which is uttered by Hughes is unforgettable. Even though 'The Lost Boys' isn't a movie classic. It does have that nostalgic quality for me. Enough that I would want it for my DVD collection. But if you get the chance don't expect too much from it.For me the better movie of the late eighties was possibly Tom Holland's 'Fright Night'. It's no classic either. But sadly under valued and under looked. But if you get the chance. Do give Schumacher's pic a look see.   Robs Rating: * * *",The Lost Boys

On to the movie... I like this movie, it does have some quirks that SPOILERS can show (the scene with the motorcycle lights outside of the house being one of them) but the soundtrack is great (save for Elton John's out of place contribution), the movie has a surreal campy atmosphere (Joel Schumacher didn't want this feeling in this movie, but too much editing for this effect would've hacked this movie!) that I particularly like, the night shots seem to score the movie's intention.

It has a genuine 80's look and feel, as well as an awesome soundtrack and some fantastic performances by 80's legends like Corey Feldman.This movie really draws you into it and makes you feel like you're right there in Santa Carla. The music fits the film perfectly. Nothing would have worked better. The setting is perfect. If you were a vampire and you were never going to die, where else would you want to spend your time? The amusement park, the abandoned cave with all that great stuff in it, and the railroad tracks (trust me, you'll understand after you see it) are absolutely incredible. The way Joel Schumacher uses certain POV shots and the eerie fog only add to the mood and atmosphere of the movie.The gore and special effects are great! Since this is an 80's movie, there is no CGI thankfully, so everything you see is really real. The make-up of the vampires is excellent with their piercing eyes and long fangs. The gore doesn't really show itself until the end, though there is a very bloody (but quick) campfire attack in the middle. Once we do get to the blood and guts, it's great! There's a melting vampire in holy water, an exploding vampire, two excellent impalings, and more where that came from.Finally, the acting is great. We have a very good cast, especially Kiefer Sutherland, who puts everyone else to shame. Jason Patric is a little dry, but he's great in his role. Max and Lucy have good chemistry, as well as Star and Michael. The Frog Brothers are classic and are responsible for most of the humor. Superb performances by all!The Bottom Line: A true 80's flick, with great performances, awesome special effects, a rocking soundtrack, and Corey Feldman!!!",The Lost Boys
193,KillerK1991,Campy Fun,8,19 November 2008,"This movie, along with From Dusk 'Till Dawn(A film I still haven't seen), has alluded me for quite some time. I just never got around to seeing it until now, though that can be said about many other films. From what I've seen, Vampire flicks are either really good or really bad, very few fall in between unlike slasher and zombie flicks. This teen romp is the former, as for all of it's visible faults, it is still one of the best vampire movies I've seen. It surprisingly feels modern and up to date despite some 80's stylings. The cinematography is superb in that it really proves that Schumacher did some work on location. There's definitely a reason why I've heard (from rumors) that this film is shoved down the local residents throats by being played in theaters at all times. The soundtrack is good, but I though the angelic chanting of the main theme grew very tedious towards the end. The acting for what it's worth, is pretty good. The cheesy lines are delivered well with a few exceptions mainly on the younger cast members accounts, but that's expected. Kudos to Keifer Sutherland for avoiding this despite having what could have been the cheesiest deliveries and a mega-mullet to boot. The plot is simple and executed well- the characters for the most part act as realistically as they can for their situation and avoid doing anything completely stupid. I felt the film could've been a tad longer, there just didn't seem to be too much vampire action or character development(besides Jason Patric) by the time the final confrontation happened, though that's probably for the best, as most of Shumacher's movies seem a little too long anyway. Those who haven't seen it should check it out, it's by no means scary(Neither does it intend to be), but it is definitely worth a view.",The Lost Boys

The music is killer in this, and the vampires are all badass and so '80s... I love it!!The amusement park setting gives the film a campy vibe, and the teen slang makes it appeal to a younger audience. The casting couldn't be better!

They set about recruiting the older teenager,the rudderless Michael. In their path is his younger brother Sam, who along with his friends the comically humourless Frog brothers set about to kill the vamps. Joel Schumaker wisely keeps his trademark campness to a minimum here and avoids doing any political 'gay' elements which would have alienated the audience, instead he keeps the social commentary in the background with the affecting shots of homeless teens eating from rubbish bins, easy prey for society's predators - undead or otherwise.

That haunting boy choir melody takes me immediately back to the first time I saw it and gives me a chill!This is a film that beautifully blends two elements that don't always go well together: comedy and horror. It gets it so right I'm not even sure how Joel Schumacher pulled it off. The serious and scary characters like Kiefer Sutherland's menacing David are offset beautifully by Sam, and the Frog brothers.These two sides of the film sit neatly beside each other without ever really coming together until the climactic end. It would have been very easy indeed for this film to end up neither funny nor scary but somehow it manages to be both through neat dialogue, simple jokes, and outstanding pacing.I sat through this again last night for the first time in years and I savoured every minute, and was stunned to see a lowly rating of 7.2 on here.

208,connorwburnett,Very funny,8,23 August 2021,"The Lost Boys approaches its story with just the right amount tension and stakes to engage you with the characters whilst also operating as a, frankly, hilarious comedy.The plot is centred around two brothers who have, unknowingly, just moved to an area infested with vampires.Just reading the synopsis to me sounds wild and, if you also think so, Lost Boys will certainly live up to your expectations. Lost Boy's mixture of expert line delivery and purposeful direction come together tremendously to create an experience which is genuinely funny and quite timeless really.The standout performances are, surprisingly, from the younger actors, something which is becoming increasingly uncommon in films. Corey Feldman really blew it out of the park and Kiefer Sutherland was also great.My main complaint with Lost Boys would have to be the camera work and cinematography. There were some shots, especially near the start, where I was just begging them to hold the camera still. It shakes too much in some scenes which is quite irritating. I'm not saying that a, primarily comedy, film's focus should be on their framing however its always appreciated and is one of the easiest elements of film to pick out as flawed.Tied to the previous point, I noticed some editing mistakes through my watch. These were only slight continuity errors but altogether it made the flow of time between shots seem slightly abnormal.Sometimes the characters would speak very unnaturally and change their minds on a whim. I think this was unintentional at some points however, regardless it definitely helped to make the film even more entertaining.The Lost Boys is not at all flawless, yet its undoubtedly worth your time even just for its comedic value alone.",The Lost Boys

Funny, spooky, good-looking and weird, this is the film I have seen the most times by far. Kiefer Sutherland is the greatest in this film, and everyone else, especially Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, are also quality. I cannot ever get bored of this, this is the perfect cult film, the best film to put on video when you want to be entertained. The critics hated it, but what do they know? This is the best film of the 80's, and of any time. The soundtrack treads uneasily between brilliance and badness, but when it's good, it's really good. Forget Fright Night, Vamp, Weird Science, The Breakfast Club or any other contemporary 80's teen movie. As good as they are (and some of them are really good), they don't hold a candle to The Lost Boys. Just where are all of these actors now? I haven't seen Jamison Newlander (who plays Allan Frog) in any other film, as well as Brooke McCarter and Billy Wirth (the two lost boys who aren't Sutherland and Alex Winter). Some of the scenes in this are brilliant, truly brilliant: the bit when The Lost Boys lead Michael (Jason Patric) to the edge of the cliff on his bike is superb, and the scene on the train bridge is genuinely creepy. Hey,the film's not perfect, who cares? For the most part this film makes my night. 80's entertainment at it's best!",The Lost Boys

211,darko2525,"Funny, Scary, One of the Best of It's Kind",9,17 July 2002,"The Tsunami-size wave or horror movies with a self-conscious sense of humor is always traced back to Wes Craven's Scream, but here we have a movie that serves as the granddaddy of the modern, hip, funny horror movie. The Lost Boys (a great title, as it alludes to Peter Pan, and the whole stay a boy forever thing) turns vampire lore on it's ear, transporting the legend from gloomy Europe to the sunny world of southern California, centering on a flock of teen vampires, headed by a menacing Keifer Sutherland that try to bring a naive newcomer Michael (Jason Patric) into the fold. the script is peppered with great humor, much of that coming from Corey Haim as Michael's brother, and Corey Feldman as one of the young ""Vampire Hunters"" enlisted to help. Schumaker does a great job of balancing scares with laughs, and the talented young cast does a terrific job.  Standouts are Patric, who would eventually star in Barry Levinson's Sleepers, and Haim, who in spite of his one-dimension as an actor, was quite a charming, appealing young male lead in his time. I love the way this film glamourizes this vampire lifestyle.  it's vampires are handsome, magnetic, and the life they lead is one of mystery and excitement. never grow old, never die. And the use of the Doors song People are Strange, along with Jim Morrison's image in the Vampire's lair does a great job of giving them that air of something important, hip, romantic.  for, as with the young death of Morrison, there is a romance tied to being young forever. and this film is about the temptation to succumb to that, or to lead a normal life, as symbolized by Michael's relationship to his brother, and to his mother, the wonderful Diane Weist. Brilliant. I count it among Near Dark (1987) and Fright Night (1985) as among the best of modern vampire tales.",The Lost Boys

Kiefer looks like a great villain or vampire, but he seems to be a mentally challenged biker in this movie.  In fact, everyone seems mentally challenged.  The actions of the characters, the plot, seems to follow no logical pattern.  Maybe this movie explores some unorthodox attribute of vampirism where any environment with vampires becomes a mire of morons. The action sequences almost don't exist.  You don't see anything.

And when I say jokes I don't mean jokes like farting or anything like you seen in those scary movie series. The jokes follows with the script and not ruin it. And it makes good quotes. It's more of a teenager vampires. Actually punk teenagers. Love the costume. Welcome back to the 80s!!! The story goes like this. A mom, Lucy, and her two teenage sons, Michael and Sam, goes to Santa Cruz to stay with their grandpa. Then Michael saw a girl, Star. He follows her. He found out she is in this gang who is led by David. He then found out that they are Vamps and he is becoming one. Sam found out Michael is a Vamp. He called his new found friends, the Frog Brothers, who are vamps killer. This is where the fun starts.The lighting is brilliant. The makeup is perfect. They really look like vamps!!! Camera work is good. As I said before the costume are great. Brilliant script. It never gets boring or make you want to get off you butt just to get some drinks.This is truly one of the best vampire movies EVER! Of all the vamps movie i seen, this ends up on my Top 5.

The soundtrack to this movie in particular stands out for me, even today.The whole vampire craze among movie fans is greater today than it was in the 80's, and although this film might pale by comparison to a lot that have come along since, it's still a fun watch and is actually one of the ones that over time is fun to watch again... which is something I can't say for a lot of other movies of it's time.Just have fun with it, and don't take it too seriously or it will definitely leave you wanting.6/10 + 1 for ""Cry little sister"" song = 7/10.",The Lost Boys
220,Newguy,An 80's Classic - Yet Still Underrated,10,6 October 1999,"I can remember seeing this one with my friends in the theater the day it came out.  The Lost Boys is by far Kiefer Sutherland's best work.  The film evolves around two brothers, who along with their mother move to the seaside town of Santa Carla to live with their grandfather.  It just so happens that Santa Carla is also known as the ""murder capital of the world"".  People disappear in this town like its a bodily function or something.  Michael, the older brother, while in pursuit of the soon to be love interest (an incredibly sexy Jami Gertz), manages to fall in with the not so in crowd of punks who live in Santa Carla (actually, they're a group of vampires.....no, this is not a spoiler).  Lets just say that the story progresses from there and becomes a well written drama with tremendous comic overtones.  The actors were perfectly cast, from the innocent mom (played by 2 time Oscar winner Diane Wiest), to hip little brother Sam (Cory Haim's only good role), the incredibly alluring Jami Gertz and the sinister and devious Sutherland as David.  Not to mention, Cory Feldman is spot on as one half of the Frog Brothers (Santa Carla's underground vampire mercenaries).  I wound up seeing this one 8 times in the theater and still love everything about it. The soundtrack is excellent, and Schumacher actually does a great job directing as well as setting the feel and look of the film (unlike his blunders with the subsequent Batman films).  This film is pure entertainment from start to finish.  The plot constantly moves and provides a few interesting turns here and there.  I really can't say enough about this film.  Every time I watch it something else about it effects me in a whole new way.  I own it, and would recommend purchasing it to anybody who thinks about it.

One moment, you're looking at all the killings, next your laughing yourself silly. This is another good teaming of Kiefer Sutherland and Joel Schmacher, who teamed up for the even better films A Time To Kill (1996) and Phone Booth (2003). They also teamed up for Flatliners (1990), but I haven't seen it yet.This film tells the tale of a family, a mother and 2 sons, who move to Santa Carla with their weird, but funny grandfather (Barnard Hughes). The oldest son Michael (Jason Patric) has a crush on Star (Jami Gertz), so he tries to fit in with the gang she hangs out with, which is led by David (Kiefer Sutherland). But when David offers Michael a drink, it turns out to be vampire blood, which transforms Michael into a vampire. He seeks help from his brother Sam (Corey Haim) and the Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander) to stop him from completely transforming and kill the vampires.The Lost Boys is a very funny horror film. The Grandfather is just a crack up, especially in the garage scene. And when Sam is singing in the bath. Funny as.

He quite often fails to get anything resembling the best out of his actors or script, and has a tendency to ramble on, taking meaningless side trips through his own form of reality.Thankfully, this movie is a rare exception.Hollywood has been doing vampire movies for about as long as film has existed, and the stories have gotten quite old... most modern day vampire movies, in fact, don't even follow the 'rules' of vampires.""The Lost Boys"" does stick to traditional vampire lore (for the most part), but it adds its own modern twist: most vampires you see wear the standard evening dress, sleep in coffins, linger in old mansions... this movie shows you what it's like to be a young, hip vampire. Why change your habits and lifestyle just because you're Undead?The performances are nothing spectacular, though they are interesting... and the movie is short enough that it never gets boring. The camera work is decent enough, if nothing special. The soundtrack is good, but doesn't match the modern radio / music video soundtracks of recent years. The special effects are mostly not there... camera tracking takes the place of flight, with a few prosthetics and some heavy makeup completing the list of anything fancy.But none of that really matters.It's often said, but just let yourself go when you watch this movie... you don't have to get so totally into it that you believe every word and gesture, but just sit back and relax - enjoy it for what it is.Some of the performances are so dead serious that they almost verge on satire, while with others you can see them having fun with their roles. Which is probably a good reason to make a movie in the first place... if you can't have fun with a character, why bother?As of 2003 this movie is 16 years old, but it has aged well. A bit cute to see some of the stars in it, and compare them to where they are now... Kiefer Sutherland, for instance. Compare him to 'David' in this movie, and 'Jack' in the Fox series ""24"". Or Jamie Gertz, or Dianne Wiest, or Edward Herrmann. Just seeing these folks in their 'younger' days can be fun... but that's not the reason to watch the movie.It's not scary, it's not really tension filled, it's not riveting. But it is fun. Sleep all day, party all night... never grow old, never die. This movie is a good - if somewhat mindless - look at what 'California vampires' would be like, what eternal youth can really be.",The Lost Boys

228,buonanotte,"Beer, blood and bubbles",7,3 January 2008,"I'm currently screening many films in this period and I think ""The lost boys"" deserves a special mention because it made me reflect (once more) on the American ability to build up such reliable screenplays. Joel Schumacher made a great job handling a story that involves stuff like: monsters, flying people, gore and motorcycle accidents. I think that when you have to set up this kind of scenes you really need a script that ""holds you tight"". The characters of ""The lost boys"" are edgy and well designed. You see one of them, you listen to what he says and you feel like... Uh, this guy's got something to hide! And until the very last line, there's something that you wish to know. Why is granpa so keen to alcohol? He grabs a beer from his personal shelf of the fridge (It is his own fridge, but he has his specifically own shelf!) and he has the first sip straight away. He opens the fridge, he grabs and opens the bottle, he sips and finally closes the fridge. He's pretty much of a weird fella but he's got a wise side and you would never call him an alcoholic in his sixties. If you think about other movies (""Frida"", ""Mysterious skin"", ""A bigger splash"") you feel just astonished from their visual beauty and you enjoy them because it just carries you away. ""The lost boys"" may not carry you away, but takes you to the end warm and excited. And that's all we ask from a movie about vampires.",The Lost Boys

The brilliance of this film is undescribable, I first saw it when I was about 11. It changed me! I wanted to be a teenage vampire and live forever! I have probably since seen this film more than any other, I haven't a bad word about it. Fantastic effects, acting, writing, and the music, believe me you'll be straight out to buy the soundtrack once you've seen this, and play it as if it was one of your favourite albums. Everyone is great in this film but Feldman was born for this part, he's like an older version of 'Mouth' from The Goonies, in many ways this film like an older brother to Goonies and cousin of American Werewolf. They truly don't make movies like this anymore, they finished in the 80's (Gremlins, Fright Night, American Werewolf in London, Return of the Living Dead, Evil Dead, I'm sure there's more...).

230,timesplitterz,One of the few fun loving Vampire films!,8,14 June 2008,"The Lost Boys is one of the VERY FEW fun loving vampire films, its a movie that nearly the whole family can enjoy (despite it being rated a 15). its a great cute little horror film, its not as soft as ""The Little Vampire"" but it has a lot of cheeky funny moments that sometimes makes you feel like your watching a great Disney movie. ultimately its another great addition to the cult classics and a fine addition to the vampire department. Jason Patrick does a fantastic job of playing the older teenager son, who is struggling to deal with the fact that he's turning into a vampire. And Kiefer Sutherland also does a great job playing the creepy vampire leader of the lost boys. generally the cast here was well picked and all play their role the way it was intended and slightly beyond. The Lost Boys has a fantastic cute little story line that doesn't make you feel left out or confused its quite basic to follow. however a warning to parents, The Lost boys does have a few strong violent scenes but these hardly last very long and there are only a few. Many of you will have watched this from your childhood or teenage years and by now you either love it or not, however if you haven't seen this film and are into vampire films and don't mind fun plots in horror films then you should defiantly give this film a look. I'll give this film 8/10 it has a fine cast a GREAT soundtrack, and has a fun adventure like plot.",The Lost Boys

232,suburbannightmare,fabulous late-80s vampire fare....,10,3 November 2006,"This film was made in 1987, and it still looks cool. Kiefer Sutherland sports a height-of-eighties-fashion bleach-blonde mullet and he still looks cool. It's a fabulous mix of vampire/teen/comedy/horror and nearly 20 years after it's release, it still remains a favourite amongst many movie fans, and this has to be one of the most popular vampire movies of all time. Every child of the eighties knows and loves it, and the plot rings true with anyone who's been roped into doing something slightly dodgy by some git who's cooler than you are.The story centres on Michael Emerson. He, his mother and brother have recently moved to Santa Carla after his mother's divorce. With nothing to do until school starts, he spends his evenings mooching around the beachfront's boardwalk and eventually falls in with a motorcycle gang. Who just so happen to be vampires. Nothing unusual there, then. Egged on by the gang, Michael unwittingly drinks blood, which gradually transforms him into a vampire. Michael's brother enlists help from a pair of vampire hunting brothers to save Michael (and the rest of the town). The cast are superb  they're all pretty 80s youngsters, obviously employed because of their market value at the time, but decent actors nonetheless. Jason Patric is perfect as Michael, the gorgeous but gullible new kid in town, who falls for the beautiful Star and unknowingly, descends into vampirism to get closer to her. Kiefer Sutherland does a great turn as the ultra-cool, menacing (but seductively persuasive) leader-of-the-pack-vampire, David. The vampire gang are impossibly cool, the epitome of 80s fashion and teen attitude. Not to mention having cast Alex Winter as Marco - Bill S. Preston Esquire with fangs! Jami Gertz's Star is fittingly mysterious and evasive, but for me, the real stars of the show are the Frog brothers - teenage vampire hunters/comic bookstore owners, fighting the good fight for Justice, Truth, and The American Way. Michael's brother Sam enlists their help to put a stop to vampirism taking over his family (and, eventually, the town). With lines like ""Kill your brother. You'll feel better"" they're the best bit of comic relief in this movie. Corey Haim manages a good performance as Sam, Michael's younger brother and Diane Wiest is fab as their unsuspecting mother.The entire film really looks good too. It's comically gory, lots of body parts exploding, stakings and burnings. And it contains some of the more 'realistic' vampire-esquire makeup effects  the vampires look like they really would like to tear your face off. Although the movie is nearly 20 years old, apart from certain elements of hairstyles and clothing, (like David's choice mullet and Star's exploding-poodle-style perm) it doesn't look that dated at all, and has a cracking 80s power ballad soundtrack. Set in Santa Carla's beachfront (so named to avoid associations between Santa Cruz and the film's gang-related themes.) it's full of carnival music, twinkling lights and sparkling nighttime beaches, which give it a slightly surreal atmosphere. Think what it'd be like living in Blackpool permanently. I think I'd turn to vampirism just for something to do. Of course there's always the token struggle between good and evil, from Michael's Mother nearly sucumbing to the charms of the head vampire, and Michael almost being shoved across the line into fully fledged vampirism, but it's all still very entertaining. Slightly darker than a teen movie, but just as fun, this will remain a firmly beloved classic for at least another 20 years.",The Lost Boys
233,adisgolos,Strictly for teenagers-hugely overrated,1,28 December 2020,"This is one of the worst vampire films I have ever seen. It is not scary at all, atmosphere is like the one in Gremlins or ET. Totally unconvincing, even boring, terribly shot with reddish tones and irritating rock music, I wouldn't call it a vampire film at all, rather teenage comedy with parody of vampire films. But miles away from Polansky's classic and not even in the same league as Nosferatu or even Hammer films. This one in fact started the era of bad vampire films and it is the mother of them all, setting the standard of stupidity for those that followed.",The Lost Boys
234,evolbaby,Monster Movie Fun At It's Best!,10,1 February 2008,"This is one of the rare few movies that epitomized summer monster movie coolness! I had so much fun at the movies watching this film that it for me defines my 80's movie going experience. Wish I had seen it at the drive-in! I'm the same age as the actors and was going through a similar situation in my life as the character Michael. I also work in comic books and at that time almost was drawing toons for the company Blackthorne seen in the movie so this flick hits home for me on many fronts! It's a great story, great cast, kick butt soundtrack and has everything a movie is supposed to have.I at first thought it would be some dreary vampire movie but the comedy level didn't overshadow the horror and suspense and good old fashioned storytelling that makes the difference between a mere movie and a work of cinema.The cast just rules in this movie and what's extra cool is that Keifer Southerland hangs out in my neighborhood. I would see him every night at his favorite bistro and I was a fan of his for years as he was also a rodeo expert. I always left him alone though as I know it is rough being a celeb and all the crap they go through. However you have to hand it to him in this movie. He ROCKED this movie and gave us a villain that stands out. Being a vampire villain of note takes lots of character and ability as you have such a long history to prove yourself against.When I scored a copy of the DVD I'll never forget that there was only one copy left in a humongous video store and I snagged it, walked up to the counter and a fellow saw my purchase and screamed out ""Great choice! Awesome movie!"" and we chatted about how cool it was and the theatre going experience it provided.Surreal, funny, suspenseful, action, horror, you can't beat this flick for being one of the rare pound for pound ""good ones"" Hollywood has produced.Sure there are mullets a-plenty but that was the style back then and the flick still holds up.Did I mention you couldn't beat the cast? Just superb.This is a must have movie for those Saturday afternoons and evenings when the gang is around the house.",The Lost Boys
235,sblair80,The Lost Boys,7,21 January 2008,"The Lost Boys offers what is considered on of the best twist on the modern vampire and is to be in the company of Fright Night and Near Dark of the 1980's. Schumacher gives us the famous ""Cory"" duo for the first time in film, and Kiffer Sutherlands first major role as the leader of the Vampire gang. To accompany this, there is good acting across the board through great direction and writing. The gore is fun and the comic timing of The Lost Boys has contributed to some of the best one-liners to come out of 80's pop culture. By far a worthy classic amongst the Vampire genre and not to be missed even by some of the most jaded of movie critics. A borderline 8 star held back slightly to a 7 because it is a product of its time and can be dated. However it's very re-watchable.",The Lost Boys

After their push-over mother moves to Santa Carla to her father's house to start a new life after a recent divorce, her sons, Michael and Sam begin noticing that the town is not the typical suburban life that they are used too. The town seems to revolve around the boardwalk and amusement park where several burn outs, dead beats, and any petite thugs might want to hang out. During a lame new-wave rock concert(if that's what it was) on the fair grounds, Micheal notices a girl name Star that he becomes attracted too. What he doesn't know is that she is part of a cult of motorcycle riding vampires who feed off the living and live in a secretive cave down near the bay area. The leader of the vampire pack, David, convinces Michael to drink a sacred bottle of blood (in which Michael presumes is just red wine) to prove that he has what it takes to prove that he is worthy enough to be with Star. Meanwhile, Sam makes friends with owners of a comic book store on the boardwalk, Edgar and Alan Frog, and they warn him about the vampire infestation in the streets of Santa Carla.After hanging out with with the vampire cult and noticing dramatic changes in his body and lifestyle, Michael begins to realize that he himself is turning into a vampire and is having second thoughts. But Low and be hold, thanks to comic books, his brother finds out that in order to have his brother changed back into normal, they have to kill the leader of the vampire cult. Clever, huh. To protect their family and brother, they use every bit vampire remedies (Garlic, Holy Water, Wooden Stake) to defeat the vampire gang that is about to attack them and their grandfathers home in an act of revenge from a previous murdering of one of their own vampires.The film is slow and doesn't pick up till the end where they have a final battle between the vampires in a ""Home Alone"" type household. Not really that exciting but, the message of getting into the wrong crowd is definitely apparent and forewarns the dangers of joining the wrong crowd. I can't figure out the purpose of the theme park but it looked cool with all of it's colorful flashing lights, as I am sure was the only driving force that Joel Schumacher was trying to get at. No real point of the film rather than to have intense transformation scenes. I can picture a bunch of ""socially challenged"" 9 year old kids laying around at a sleepover, contemplating what they would do if they ever got into a situation. I would say that the film is worthy enough to fall asleep too but that's about it. And Corey Haim is annoying as hell in this film.",The Lost Boys

It's hard to believe that an enthralling performance that held such passion and presence was made when he was barely twenty! Most of the film's best moments belong to Sutherland - Apart the Frog Brothers - and although there is a clear absence of the fashion police it's still a cool, slick movie It tells the story of a divorcée and her two sons Sam and Michael as they move to the 'murder capital of the world' Santa Carla. Eager to make an impression, Michael becomes smitten with a local girl called Star who lures Michael into a world of a Motorcycling vampire gang led by David. At first he sees David as a love rival for Star but quickly realises things are a lot more sinister... Aided only by his brother and his Kooky comic store buddies Edgar and Allan Frog. Michael does battle with David in a bid to save his family and his own mortal soul.

247,somme22,The Lost Boys offers thrills and is a trip back to the 1980s.,10,18 October 2005,"From the first time I saw The Lost Boys, I thought the film was fantastic. I was fascinated by the visual impact of the movie. The amazing carnival scenes, the beach-concert scene-all of these scenes helped to establish a great atmosphere in the movie. The Santa Carla Boardwalk was made to be the place to be at night. Then the audience saw The Lost Boys. We got to see them visually. The camera and Schumacher established that they were rather shady characters-very dangerous and fun-loving. They didn't speak, but the audience could see their impact on the boardwalk, and later on the main character, Mike Emerson. To give a short summary, the Lost Boys is a film that centers around the lives of two brothers,Sam and Michael Emerson, and their mother Lucy as they move from Phoenix to Santa Carla one fateful summer. The brothers each face their own conflicts: Mike feels like he has to fit in the cool crowd, and Sam feels that Santa Carla has nothing interesting to offer him. Lucy too has a problem: she's flat broke and needs to find a job. Soon Mike falls into the wrong crowd when he meets Star, and he starts hanging out with four young wild bikers-David, Paul, Dwayne and Marco. When Mike starts to change his behavior(and levitates off the bed) Sam realizes that it is up to him to help Mike. But it all starts to get complicated when Sam and Mike's mother starts to date Max, her boss. Sam ends up with the conclusion (with the help of the Frogg brothers, who he met at a comic book store)that Max has something to do with his brother's transformation into a vampire. When their plan fails, the Frogg brothers come up with another conclusion: perhaps the reason Mike is transforming into a vampire is because of David and his friends. It is then that the trio come come up with a new plan...I will leave out the rest of the movie, because I don't want to reveal too much. The Lost Boys is an excellent film-it's thrilling, it's funny, and the visuals and 80s music are great. I personally liked to see California as it was back in the 1980s. The songs in the film, such as ""Cry Little Sister"" and ""People are Strange"" were and are my favorites. The participation of Kiefer Sutherland in the film helped a lot. He was perfectly cast as David. He added an air of danger to his character, and he was eternally ""cool"" in the role. The other actors- Brooke Mccarter, Billy Wirth, and Alexander Winter-were all perfect in their roles as vampires too. For their part, the two Coreys and Diane Wiest completed the rest of the movie with their participation in the Lost Boys.

248,iDontSleep-iDream,Stays in the Eighties,8,9 July 2007,"I saw this film because I judge films on their titles, and this one had quite the snapper. Basically, this film is amazing. It follows two brothers who move from their home in Arizona to Santa Carlo. Once they get there, strange happenings begin happening, which leads both to the eventual conclusion that the town has a fair number of vampires.This movie is funny, interesting and, if you are younger, more than a little scary. The score I really appreciate, and was actually one of the first scores I ever did pick out to love. The humor is that kind that is both intended and not. A lot of the jokes and scenes are funny, but at some points there is just a time lapse and you release just how ''80's"" the film is, which, as stated, is humorous. The plot is sound and the characters likable.

250,zender8584,Hits on all cylinders,8,1 June 2017,"The late 80s brought a bit of a transition from pure teen slasher to more glitzy horror films featuring a prominent soundtrack, attractive actors and humor. The Lost Boys epitomizes this genre like no other.Why does it work so well? For one, the premise, nicely summarized in the movie's tag line ""sleep all day, party all night, never grow old, never die. It's fun to be a vampire"" captures the desire in all of us, especially in our teen years, to resist moving on to adulthood. Obviously, the Peter Pan reference in the title is no mistake. The movie is well acted, Southerland clearly has fun with the role and steals all his scenes. The two Coreys have great chemistry. It is perhaps helpful that they are teenagers during the filming rather than the common practice of casting 20-somethings to play high school kids. Jami Gertz is beautiful but not just a helpless damsel in distress. The adult supporting cast are all believable in their roles. While it is unavoidable for the soundtrack to be dated, Echo and the Bunnymen's cover of the Doors ""People are Strange"" works so well in this movie, it is hard to listen to EITHER version of that song and not think about The Lost Boys. Simply put, the music just works to keep the story moving along. It adds to the coolness factor of being a vampire.Though there is gore here, it is just enough to remind us this isn't a teen comedy. Nothing we haven't seen dozens of times by now, and for the most part done in moderation. Setting the movie in Santa Cruz (errr Santa Carla) also adds to the visual impact of the film. Things do get a bit disjointed in the climax, and predictable 'twist.' It still satisfies when you reach the payoff before the closing credits.There is a lot to like here. The Lost Boys proves that you can make a movie about teenage vampires and make it fun to watch. Twilight I'm looking at YOU.",The Lost Boys

Some may disagree as it has gone from a box office smash, to a cult movie and now to a hot topicified film, but leave the Hot Topic children alone. They just want attention from other people who have seen the movie. The movie was well worth watching and compared to Schumacher's other garbage, this was his zenith.

255,myavalon,Think of it as a survival guide,9,4 June 2006,"A sort of comibination comedy-horror cult film, The Lost Boys has a special place in my heart. It not only has one of the sexiest, most charismatic vampires on the screen (Keifer Sutherland before he played good guys), it appeals to the horror nerd within the viewer. Who wouldn't want to think that years of reading cheesy comics was good preparation for fighting the undead, or that squirt guns can be used as deadly weopens? The initiation scene is perhaps unintentionally erotic,k and the whole movie has a nice atmosphere. It's a little too slick, which may bug you, but on the whole, it's a must for vampire afficianados.",The Lost Boys

The humour is dark and funny without ever becoming silly, and the characters work very well together. That said the main thing that pushes this film in to my top 5 is its brilliant soundtrack. This is my favorite movie soundtrack, and was around a long time before they were in fashion.

However I find myself sitting and wondering how? Why is it much beloved and mentioned?
Sure the character designs are great, even in this day in age many years later I have to admit .. I want to dress and look like a member of this group of young vampires! I'd even bleach my hair in vain to try and look as cool as Kiefer Sutherland did, but fanboying Aside I didn't like this film.
I came into this only seeing the poster and a few stills and the 7 star average review, I knew nothing about the story or the genre of this film, which if i could class it myself I'd say it's a goofy horror.The film doesn't really flow or present the story well, and it just clips back and forth until you accept what's happening all the time wondering what's going on?Visually it's rather dated now, but it still does a great job and I can't fault that at all! I did enjoy the camera work sets and effects, and for that reason alone I'll sit in the middle of the 1-10 scale, if you read this and then want to watch the film set your expectations low, and use it as inspiration for bringing back 80's fashion or the bare minimum a kick ass Halloween costume don't come for a compelling story.",The Lost Boys

Lost Boys is very much a product of it's time, and should be appreciated in such a way.The story is of a family moving to a new town only to become embroiled in the plans of the local vampire gang. It really is as simple and silly as that. The soundtrack is wonderfully cheesy. The performances are exaggerated and overblown but it all adds to the fun of the fair.This film is perfect for a summer evening. The Corey's are a solid addition to any 80's film. I still believe this is a great kids film and should be appreciated as such.",The Lost Boys

On the other hand, people should not come on this site saying bad stuff about this (or any) movie, which they ""saw on tv"". I mean, when has there EVER been a good cut of a movie on tv? Television always butchers movies, and this one is no exception (and, yes, mullets were once in. It was called the 80's. Look into it).The Lost Boys is kind of like the family horror flick. It's not really scary, nor was it meant to be. It just deals with the traditional horror figures of vampires in a fun way, as juvenile delinquents. So rent it, try it out. If not for Coreyx2, do it for Kiefer Sutherland. He really makes this movie.",The Lost Boys

Although it may seem like a typical teenage vampire movie, don't let this stop you from watching it coz u'll regret it! It totally blows away all the stereotypes of teenage vampire movies because its so excellent. Its the definition of a brilliant vampire movie and just simply an excellent film altogether. The soundtrack contributes largely to enhance the greatness of the film even further. its a mixture of horror and comedy and captures the watchers attention throughout the whole movie. Its the sort of film that you watch again and again without ever tiring from it!! (i watch it once everyday at the very least, its that good!)

270,jacob-grant101,Michael...Michael...Michael...Michael...,6,30 April 2015,"This film is a cult classic that many seem to either love or hate. Personally, I'm' sort of somewhere in the middle. Overall, it was a decent enough film, but it is unfortunately bogged down by the atrocious performance of main actor Jason Patrick. I haven't seen his other work, and I understand that this was an early role for him, but it was literally one of the worst performances I've ever seen. His mother (played by Dianne West) was equally annoying as the timid victim-type mother who let people walk all over her. Corey Haim was surprisingly entertaining as Michael's little brother, while Feldman and his on-screen brother who may as well have just been a mannequin, are self-proclaimed vampire hunters who have never even seen a vampire before. The best performance in the film came from Kiefer Sutherland, which should come as no surprise to those familiar with his other work. The only other really notable performance was that of the late Edward Herrmann as Max.This film does have it's funny moments, but I found they were just funny enough to make me let out a quick chuckle. The vampires are cool, but they are not revealed in their full glory until late in the film, which I found a bit disappointing, mainly because the rest of the film just isn't strong enough on it's own. There is also an attempt at a romance plot between Michael and Star (Jami Gertz), but it starts up like nothing and has absolutely zero substance to it.Some may say I'm taking the movie too seriously, and I understand it's supposed to be silly, but I honestly didn't think it was that funny overall. It kind of felt like the sort of movie you watch while having like a drunken movie night with your buddies. I give this film a 6/10.PS: The title of this review will make sense if you decide to watch the film.",The Lost Boys

Every single character is perfect in their respective roles and you will NEVER find a vampire gang as cool as David, Dwayne, Paul and Marco. Sam and Michael work great together as the chalk and cheese brothers while Edgar and Alan are hilarious and yet dangerous at the same time. Max as the infamous head vampire is just perfect and all other characters give solid performances. I think I've seen this film close to 100 times. All in all.

It truly has it all: horror, romance, action, comedy, drama and a terrific soundtrack...oh, yeah, and the infamous Two Coreys.

277,theb_ronster,Schumacher mocks the shoes off vampires!,10,25 November 2004,"Without a doubt, among the most brilliant of vampire movies ever made, in the modern film era. Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland are destined to blow away all audiences of this visual masterpiece. However, the twist at the end, which I plan not to give away, was made slightly obvious, though well hidden at the same time. Joel Schumacher does a splendid job directing this true work of art. The frog brothers did a great job of adding humor to this otherwise, mainly serious film, without spoiling the suspense. That made the film far more enjoyable to people with interests in multiple genres. Jami Gertz looks absolutely attractive in her role as Star. However, the show is undoubtedly stolen by Kiefer Sutherland, in the role of David, the rebellious, dangerous, rude and rambunctious, teenaged vampire, who seduces Michael (Jason Patric) into joining his gang of vampires. The story is of a woman (Dianne Wiest), and her two sons, Sam (Corey Haim) and Michael (Patric), who move to a small Californian town, called Santa Carla, often referred to as the murder capital of the world, to live with her father after getting divorced. Little to their knowledge, the town happens to be inhabited by a motorcycle gang of Jim Morrison obsessed, teenage vampires. While the mother begins to fall in love with her boss from the video store, where she has been employed, Sam spends his time reading vampire comics, which were given to him by two brothers (Corey Feldman, Jamison Newlander), who claim the town is infested by vampires. He does not believe them, but grows to almost immediately, upon realizing that his brother, Michael, has been seduced by the beautiful half-vampiress, Star (Gertz), and joins the gang, led by David (Sutherland). He realizes that neither Star nor Michael are true vampire until they make their first kill, and they will not become normal again until the head vampire is killed. So, he calls up the brothers Frog, and gets them to come in and help him solve the job, though he is scared that he might have to kill his brother. Overall, a cinematic masterpiece. The directing, acting, writing, camera work, special effects, stunts and, of course, the epic cinematography work with the astounding score to bring together one of the most loved films of all time. The story is in fact an allegory to that of the lost boys of Neverland, from Peter Pan. A contemporary, without the temporary, classic.",The Lost Boys
278,jomyers2010,Best film of the eighties,10,29 August 2013,"The Lost Boys is, in my opinion, the best film of the eighties. I was born during the 80s so only watched this later on but still haven't changed my opinion of this. The characters give a freaky subject perfect sex appeal and also add a comedic value to the macabre topic. Back in the 80s the only vampire films out where traditional drink your blood types and this has so much more to it. The director has made this film perfect. I would describe it as an early twilight style film but without the lovey dovey story line. Keifer Sutherlands character makes the film what it is. It's his best performance as far as I am concerned and he even outshines Jason Patrics character Michael. The film centres around Michael and his change to become a vampire. Keifers character is the leader of said vampire gang and torments Michael beyond belief. Michaels brother Sam makes friends with two comic book geeks (Corey Feldman is one) and becomes a vampire hunter only to find that their mum is dating the head vampire max.

The soundtrack is marvellous and like the whole movie, is very very modern. All the actors, specially the vampires, have a wonderful look. Schumacher made everything in this movie to look extremely modern, and he actually did. I can hardly say this was the most ""ahead of its time"" movie ever made. It's certainly the best vampire movie ever made. When I say everything is good in this movie, I really do. If you don't agree with me, do what I am going to say: compare the ingredients of Lost Boys with the others vampire movies (like Fright Night, Interview with the Vampire, Near Dark,Vampires) then, remember Lost Boys was made in 1987 (above his time), finally you will notice how good Lost Boys is.

The soundtrack was padded with (at the time) modern covers of hip older (and even not-so-much-older) songs. It had Keifer in a spiked mullet and earrings. It had the Coreys, Feldman as Rambo, and Haim as a smirking saved-by-the-bellian. As for standing the test of time, it is still fresh, well-paced and smart.

If you are looking for a good vampire movie stop looking because you found one.This movie also has several plot twistsand really explores the mythology of the vampires. It tells us how toprotect yourself from vampires in a fun way while also being very serious. It also features the Frogg brothers who are hilarious.

289,hallam-953-739700,Homo-erotic bloodfest,9,20 March 2014,"Sweet mother of Moses. If the quality of a film is to be judged on its homo-erotica and/or penetrative incest, then this movie gets a near perfect score. As Michael and Sam made doe-eyes at each other, body fluids exited my lady orifice with gushing ecstasy. Tears of blood also came unbidden, which - being a vampire myself - I lapped up eagerly.I have to say that the film was very true to the vampire lore. Yes, I have an aversion to holy water, and when I drank some by mistake last Easter I had a stomach ache for *days*. The not so good points: When the older brother pretended like he was attracted to that girl when in reality he was obviously much more interested in his brother. The farce was embarrassingly obvious and the self-denial palpable. Another drawback: The brothers' sexual tension was consummated off- screen! DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING. I hungered for a bloody bout of love- making but was left with only the furtive glances and triumphant glow in the boys' faces post-coitus. Fluent in subtext, I counted roughly 700 occurrences of off-screen love-making, so there was certainly more than ample opportunity for the negligent director to capture cinematic gold. Besides this, the film delivered a self-assured and wonderful tale of vampires and brotherly romance, leaving my armchair upholstery embarrassingly damp. 9/10",The Lost Boys

The music is eeringly effective as is Joel Schumacher's direction.  This movie would probably be more successful if it was released today given the popularity of horror films in the late 90's (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer).  Probably Corey Haim and Corey Feldman's most memorable performances.  Also rating a big mention, Jami Gertz who has a great screen presence in this movie as the 'lost girl' - 'Star'.

And let us not forget the cool gang of vampires with the ever-so-hot Keifer Sutherland.  Then we move to the story that takes place in Santa Carla, murder capital of the world.  The story is great and just gives off this awesome dark feeling.  It's even funny with these witty one-liners.  Oh, and then the soundtrack!  The soundtrack is amazing and fits this movie perfectly.

I really liked it, I stayed up all night and watched it over and over again the first night I saw it.I was a movie where I wasn't scared by it but by my surroundings for the rest of the night. I recommend it to any friends I can.I can see Lost Boys in almost every movie I watch now and I'm like Hey that's the wrong movie?!?!?This movie will have you believing: the impossible, in love,the power of a family bond, and in what kids can really do.I think anyone could love this movie if they just took the time to see it's beauty!",The Lost Boys

305,svetomesto,Oh Joel,4,4 October 2021,"Joel Schumacher has made some good movies in his career, sadly this isn't one of them.It came out the same year as Near Dark (a much better vampire movie), and unfortunately completely overshadowed it. The Lost Boys was a large studio production (Warner Bros), a luxury Near Dark didn't have. The marketing and the young hip cast did their thing and it was a hit.Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing wrong with being campy. However, there is good and bad kind of camp, this like all Schumacher campy affairs is the latter category. Horror comedies are a tricky thing and rarely successful. The two most subjective genres in cinema. The humour, unfortunately mostly falls flat and it isn't the least bit scary.Four stars for the effort, though.",The Lost Boys

Everything about it is superb such as the acting, the music, and just the pure 80's atmosphere. This is just one of those movies you can sit for hours watching it over and over again if you wanted to. I'm still trying to snag a copy on dvd since i only have it on vhs. The bottom line is anyone who hasn't seen this movie and has come here to read the reviews to make up their mind weather to buy it or not, i would say definately buy. Just look at all the other reviews too and you can see why.",The Lost Boys

What happened to the clever black-comedy? Lost Boys still after all these years is yet to surpassed. It's clever, funny and stylish (apart from the clothes and the haircuts). I find that one of the most unbelievable things about The Lost Boys, is that the quality of the cinematography is still really good for a film which is over 15 years old, and the soundtrack still sounds quite fresh, compare other films of the same era and they sound and look really dated and most of the time you feel slightly embarrassed that you liked them in the first place. It's a shame that Hollywood lost the ability to make a decent horror film, now all that remains for us to see is if anyone out there can you rescue this dying genre.",The Lost Boys

See it, Rent it , or Buy it you will not be let down, Besides with the Corey's and Kiefer Sutherland what's not to love or lose! Sleep all day. Party all night. Never grow old. Never die.

The boys discover the town is infested with vampires. This film was extremely well done and had a fun and lively feel to it. The town was interesting and the characters were all very different. From strong leaders to carefree grandfathers, this movie had it all. The plot was simple but kept many things hidden until the end, dropping only subtle hints. The film has many comic moments from the frog brothers to the rowdiness of the teenagers it deals with issues of peer pressure and facing the reality of a new town and a new life. This movie was intense and the characters were very complex.",The Lost Boys

First I must say I have been a huge fan since seeing the flick in 1987 at the theatre and growing up I have watch it more that 100 times. I haven't watched the movie in a little while and was curious to see how the movie would hold up now that both the film and I are both 25 years older. I was blown away how great the movie still holds up. I will be honest the first 20 minutes dragged a little watching it, but then I was totally lost in the film like I was watching for the first time. If anyone hasn't seen the movie it is a must have. It was also great seeing Corey Haim one final time on the big screen.",The Lost Boys
314,marys_poison,'The lost boys' has to be one of the best teenage...,10,19 April 2004,"'The lost boys' has to be one of the best teenage vampire movies of all time. It was the first movie of the genre to create a stylish, sexy gang of vampires who invole themselves in the contemporary teenage lifestyle. This strayed from the stereotypical idea of the conservative lone vampire which had dominated most movies in the genre around that era.A stunning cast including Jason Patric, Corey Haim and the extremely talented Kiefer Sutherland as David the intimidating leader of the vampire pack bring a contemporary take on the teenage comedy horror flick to life.With rememberable lines such as 'death by stereo!'this movie will allways be a classic. Even seventeen years on it looks as fresh as ever but with an eighties feel which will forever remind us of how brilliantly outrageous the fashion industry was then!.Set in the picturesque calafornian costal town of santa carla which suited the movie perfectly and made it visualy stunning in another way apart from the graphics and makeup. Unfortunately many of the sites seen in the movie were destroyed in an earthquake in 1989.The characters are unique and interesting adding more depth to the plot. This is some of the casts best work ever.A must see film for any horror/comedy fan or any fans of the cast members. my personal favorite 10/10!!!",The Lost Boys

316,honey11984,"I'll pray, I never need to call ya.",8,20 May 2004,"THE LOST BOYS is one of my favorite Vampire films. Its funny and thrilling at the same time. But you could definitely tell who the Head Vampire is right from in the first 20 minutes. Its kinda obvious its not David. Hint hit. You know who I'm talking bout. One thing about some vampire movies, is that you can tell who betrayed who, or who did this and that. I do however, love the music in this movie. Very 80's and a good selection for the film. My favourite song in this movie is CRY LITTLE SISTER. (The theme song) I just wish there was a bit more blood and gore. Thats what the movie needed to make it a bit better. Other than that it was great.",The Lost Boys
317,estefania_tapia2002,this film is alright,7,24 July 2006,I saw this film in Saturday night around 11.00pm and I thought it was good. It's basically about a divorced woman played by Diane Wiest and her two sons played by Jason Patric who plays Michael and Corey Haim who plays Sam They move to a small part of California were in the night the two brothers and their mum go to a amusement park where the mum goes to look for a job in a videostore and the older brother fells for a girl named star played by Jami Gertz but she turns out to be part of a group of teenage vampires.

By doing this he has to drink some blood and just then he is turned into a vampire. But Sam befriends two brothers played By Corey Fieldman and Jamison Newlander who are called Elgar and Alan in a comic book store and the two brothers warns Sam that in the town there are vampires but Sam thinks they are talking nonsense until one day Michael returns home and Sam realises that his brother has turned into one. while the mother is dating the owner of the video store who is the head vampire of the town. Sam calls the two brothers to help him before it's to late....,The Lost Boys
318,lizaclear,Review,10,19 August 2013,"The story is not very complicated but it's very grabbing and interesting. I've seen this movie hundreds of times and it never gets old.The acting is pretty good, no one really stands out but they all gel together well, Corey Haim (RIP) was a favourite of all teens at the time. Although Jason Patric as Michael and Kiefer Sutherland as David are the most interesting characters are best friends off set.Most fans recognize Corey Haim as Sam and Corey Feldman as Edgar Frog, also known as ""The Coreys"" by fans are bff off set and starred in heaps of films together. The cute hottie with the comedian duo type is a show seller.Barnard Hughes as Grandpa is the movie stealer though with his one liners and old style charismatic charm. Eccentric, mysterious and quirky yet with a hidden and vast knowledge. I loved his character.The movie has great cinematography, colorful and at times Gothic. The amusement park backdrop is cheery yet suspiciously eerie. The scene of the flying vampires swooping down for their attack is bloodcurdling.The special effects are mostly vampire make-up and blood. A few death scenes are chilling yet funny and are not overdone with hardly any blood and gore.The soundtrack is amazing with awesome 80s songs that still seem rockin today. Cry Little Sister by Gerard McMann is the highlight of this movie, very creepy and disturbing, it is the perfect song to set the mood.A perfect mix of drama, mood, colour, special effects, soundtrack and acting. It has achieved cult status and deserves it. This is the best Joel Schumacher film in my opinion. It has just the right amounts of gore, horror, comedy and romance.If you haven't seen this yet do yourself a favour as it is a must for all horror fans alike.",The Lost Boys

Although the town is strange to them, they do their best to settle down. One night while out at the carnival, Michael and Sam go their separate ways, and Michael meets a mysterious but beautiful girl, Star, which is where the story really begins. Michael then meets Star's companions, a small group of trendy bikers who ooze sex appeal, the main one being David. David's intimidating behaviour towards Michael leads to a bike race, and they end up in a cave next to the ocean. This was their home and it is that night Michaels life changes forever as he, oblivious, is given blood to drink. Sam notices Michael's behaviour is becoming increasingly unpleasant but behind the anger is something even more scary...the truth. With the help of Sam and the Frog Brothers Michael must find the head vampire so all half-vampires will return to normal - Michael and Star, who by now he has fallen in love with. Together they must battle the blood-sucking creatures of the night, and now the excitement really begins!! Excellent performance by all of the cast and an amazing soundtrack.

Seeing it again made me fall in love with it. The humor is spot on, the one-liners brilliant, the acting great and the soundtrack really fits in with the film.  My favorite part had to be the exploding vampire, not the greatest effects but still great. It has its flaws, continuity errors but all in all I really enjoyed this film.",The Lost Boys
323,Crimm Zeal,Great mood and atmosphere. Stunning.,10,6 December 1999,"This is definitely one of my favorite vampire movies.  True, it doesn't stack up to Interview, but hey, Interview was made from a novel, and a very stunning novel at that.  The comparison isn't fair.  What strikes me the most about The Lost Boys is the mood and atmosphere generated by the film. The ocean wind, the crashing waves, mist gently swirling below the railroad trestle, the eerie music integrated seamlessly into the scenes, the simultaneous decadence and horror of the Boys' existence.  Michael struggling with his own golden-eyed beast as the Boys ruthlessly tear apart the beach party.  David, on top of the bluff, ""How far are you willing to go?""  Now, it's true that the humor can get a little old, especially if the Coreys irritate you.  And it's true that there are a few(only a few) painfully horrid lines uttered by said Coreys.  However, Kiefer Sutherland more than makes up for it, and after you see the shimmering blue-black ocean flying by beneath you and hear the swishing of long coats and the demonic laughter that is uniquely David's, you may just feel tempted to put on a dark coat and skulk around on your local carousel, and you will almost certainly think twice before heading to the amusement park after sundown...",The Lost Boys
324,Quade-3,"This id the Best Vampire Film of The 70's, 80's and 90's. 2K here it comes.",10,17 January 2000,"Honestly it is. The only competitor is Dusk till Dawn and I don't count that as it doesn't have a real plot and is a bit of a spoof. This film however has an excellent plot, making Vampirism come into modern day as a kind of drug, a youth culture type thing. It is scary in places, it is very funny in places. The set pieces are excellent and the memorable lines even better. My favourates include:1) Edgar Fogg: ""Holy Shit! The attack of Eddy Munster!""
2) Sam: (Seeing his Brother MIcheal has no reflection in the) (mirror) ""Your a creature of the night Micheal. My own brother a god damn, shit-sucking vampire! Yeah well!

Also the Attire is to die for. The most memorable part of the movie was when David(Keiffer),Paul(Brooke),Dwayne(Billy),Marko(Alex) where in the tree and called Michael(Jason) over to the tree and Vamped out and killed all those surf-Nazi while trying to get Michael to turn into one of them but Michael didn't.

The sound track by the Doors is good to. Sutherland, like his father in many films, gives a very good performance.Patric is also good, and there is a comical but well played role by Fieldman of Goonies fame and lesser known Mork and Mindy.

Being a resident of Santa Cruz, I recognize most of the locations where the movie was filmed. It was a lot of fun, and being a big fan of (most) vampire movies I knew I'd love it.Aside from the excitement of being there while it was being filmed, I find I never get tired of watching this film. It's the perfect combination of comedy & horror, with very little gore. In addition to being a great movie, the soundtrack is one of the best compilation albums.There are several great lines in this movie, some still ring true in the area today, such as Jason Patrick asking a local if there are any jobs here, and getting the response ""nothing legal.""",The Lost Boys

Seems like this movie is only liked by people who were alive in the 80's, and appreciated for the nostalgia. The overall aesthetic of the movie is okay, and the soundtrack is just a tad better, but everything else is extremely 80's and I can't see the appeal. The behavior in here is so grating. I absolutely hated The Frog Brothers, and just the way the characters in general interact with each other. The scenes take massive jumps in between and just expect you to become attached to these characters and imagine chemistry between them.

It's love at first sight for Mike but what Michael doesn't know is that this pretty girl is deeply involved with a dangerous group of hip young vampires lead by Kiefer Sutherland (who is excellent in this movie).

This movie is good if ya just watch it for fun with a bunch of friends and even better if ya watch with friends who have already seen it.

I decided to watch it along with my kids who were about the same age I was when I first watched it. I watched it from about 10 years and all throughout my teen years because regular TV aired it a lot. I had a huge crush on Corey Haim...he was so adorable and funny. Yes Jason Patrick was bomb back then too. It was eye candy and the movie was scary just enough! Corey Haim you had a lot of Black fans too. My best friend SL-G was a big fan of Lost Boys and we would always refer back to that as being a good old school movie. Remember sis? Oh Corey will miss you and remember you.

Being only fifteen, many people my age aren't aware of ""The Lost Boys"" or any other movie from that era. So, if you are a fifteen year old kid sitting at home with nothing to do, thinking ""I want to watch a vampire movie"", chuck ""Twilight"" out the window along with all your preconceived notions of any movie made before 2005, and be ready to be sucked into the world of ""The Lost Boys"".""The Lost Boys"" centers around Michael(Jason Patric), a young man who just moved to Santa Carla(Whose welcoming sign has ""Murder Capital Of The World"" inscribed on it's back in blood red paint, I may add) with his newly divorced mother Lucy(Dianne Wiest) and his younger brother Sam(Corey Haim). Lucy, reluctant to force a ""huge legal battle"" upon herself and her boys, is flat broke and moves in with her eccentric and, for lack of a better word, silly father(Barnard Hughes).That night, Sam and Michael go to the town boardwalk where they see a concert (because what movie is complete without a greased up muscle man playing the saxophone?) where Michael spots Star (Jami Gertz). He becomes infatuated with her and starts to go after her. (Not in the creepy stalker way, but the whole 'I just want to talk to her' way). Michael soon catches up with the girl, but is too late as he sees her on the back of David's (Kiefer Sutherland)'s motorcycle. The next night, the same thing happens, but this time David seems interested. He challenges Michael to a race. Michael, skeptical of his chances against David's expensive bike, says ""I can't beat your bike."" David then says ""You don't have to beat me, Michael. You just have to try to keep up."" They race, and David easily beats Michael, with the help of his friends Dwayne (Billy Wirth), Paul (Brook McCarter) and Marco (Alex Winter). Michael gets angry, and physically pushes David, shouting ""Just you, man! Just you!"" David then says ""How far you willing to go, Michael?"" David then takes Michael back to his lair, and after a few mind games, has him drink from a bottle of wine. However, it wasn't wine he was drinking. Star warned him that it was blood, but he didn't believe her. He drank. Soon, he started to experience strange symptoms, such as sleeping all day, longer fingernails, and irritability. He thinks nothing of it until he has a strange craving for his brother's blood, and is attacked by Sam's dog Nanook. When he sees his reflection in the mirror, he is translucent. Sam, at first is afraid and is convinced that Michael is trying to kill him, but soon realizes that Michael is as much in the dark as he is. He agrees to help, and enlists the help of the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman & Jamison Newlander), two 15-year-old self proclaimed Vampire Hunters. Michael learns that he is only a half vampire until he makes his first kill, and to be turned back to normal, the head vampire has to die. So, Michael must fight his rapid transision into a creature of the night while he tries to kill the one who turned him.This is an amazing movie. It truly is. Jason Patric is a very good eye-candy type lead role; Corey Haim, Corey Feldman, and Jamison Newlander are hilarious. But, I must say, this film is carried by the performance of Kiefer Sutherland. He truly brought his character to life and made this movie what it is.""The Lost Boys"" is a different kid a vampire movie. It truly set the standards for vampire movies to come. What I like most about it is the fact that isn't too serious. It is a very youthful, and, quite frankly, a funny movie. 5 stars!",The Lost Boys
345,sanders-baden-0-330110,it wasn't the best,5,13 March 2011,"i believe that this film is not the best of vampire films, but this is possibly the high expectations i have these days. i thought that this film can relate to younger viewers because of the plot. The gang violence and the drugs and alcohole (the blood). peer pressure is also a factor in this movie as the eldest brother decides to join a gang because he is the new kid and had no friends. I didn't really like this film because it was kind of old. but some parts of the movie were quite good. the effects could possibly be the best part of this movie, even though i don't remember much of this movie but i still remember some of the effects",The Lost Boys
346,amosman122,The Lost Boys,3,13 March 2011,"When I first started watching this movie, I had no idea that it was about vampires. Though I found out that is one of the best vampire movies in modern era. Basically, Michael (the older brother) chases after this girl and who he finds out is hanging around vampires in a mean gang, and then Michael ends up trying too impress the gang leader and failing at the first task.The directing, acting, writing, camera work, special effects, stunts and the astounding cinematography made the film look epic, and made me fell intrigued.There should be a number two of this movie if there already isn't one, because a lot of people would be interested in watching it.Al-over, great movie, intriguing and great vampire movie! We need vampires here, then things would get more interesting..If vampires were real here, would you still live here?I think what made the film so interesting, was that it was set in 1987, where they wore different clothes, spoke differently and the towns looked nothing like the ones we live in.They should make more films like this, just too be different..",The Lost Boys

350,abidabidooo,Review! Plus my little obsession with The Lost Boys.,10,13 August 2011,"Wow! What an excellent film! This is definitely one of my favourite films, even though it is quite old. I watched this film when I was really young (I even have it on video which proves how ancient it is haha). I bought it on DVD years & years ago because I love watching it. Its usually on the TV so I grab the opportunity and watch it, it never gets old. So if you haven't watched this brilliant movie then please do.Two boys and their mother move into a new town in California called Santa Carla (also known as the murder capital of the world) to live with their Grandpa after their parents divorce. The brothers soon start to discover that the loud, crowded town is swarming with blood sucking, brutal killers: Vampires! Michael, the elder brother, chases after a gorgeous girl called Star, who has recently become a vampire as well her son. Michael accidentally mixes into the vamp group, oblivious to what they are. David, the rebellious, dangerous vampire in the group, tricks Michael into drinking his vampire infested blood and he becomes partly one of them. He later realises that until you make your first kill, then you are only a half vampire. To become normal again, they have to kill the head vampire, which seems simple enough.. but they don't know who it is! Meanwhile, their mother starts working in a comic book store where she soon falls in love and starts dating the owner. He seems quite charming and lovely enough but the sons do not seem to grow a liking to him. The Frogs, who work in this comic shop, are two strange but hilarious brothers who completely hate vampires! They try to convince Sam, the youngest brother, that vampires exist by showing proof and giving him vamp comics. Sam finally believes that vampires are real and starts to help his brother become cured, although he is scared he will have to kill him.Ladies and gentlemen you will have to watch the film to find out the big but kind of obvious twist what happens. Trust me, this is a fantastic film (although it wasn't that scary for me, so if you are looking for a real bloody, gruesome, terrifying film then this is not for you). It is just classic film which is a must see as the acting and everything is just amazing. Please, give it a try :) Enjoy! I gave it a 10/10 - (I cant believe it only has 7/10 as it deserves more).",The Lost Boys

Ever since I first watched this movie with my brother when I was five years old, I've been hooked. No, it may not be the scariest horror film that you've encountered, but it is a GREAT one!

It is a classic movie of the 80's that has romance, suspense, horror, comedy, drama, and action. Got to admit, Jason Patric is sexy in his black leather, earring, and long curls! Keifer Sutherland plays a role that you don't usually see him play. The music is wonderful! I would recommend to anyone to watch this movie! I find myself engulfed in it when I watch it! I have always been into ""the wild bad boys"", and these guys bring it to the table! Joel Schumacher did a wonderful job on the making of this film! His best ever. Corey Haim and Corey Feldman play a great combination together in this movie! Two thumbs up!!",The Lost Boys
353,traveler106,Was the setting intentionally ironic?,9,22 June 2012,"I lived in Santa Cruz, the place where this movie was filmed, when I was a kid. When I watch the movie, I wonder if they intentionally chose Santa Cruz as the setting out of irony, because Santa Cruz is one of the safest and most peaceful places in the U.S.At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's not what one would call a ""good"" movie. It's not the kind of movie that's going to change the world, but it's entertaining, and that's what movies are supposed to do.To sum it up: If you grew up in Santa Cruz, you'll love this movie because you'll keep recognizing places at the Boardwalk (The Giant Dipper) and the caves. You might also notice that it's an entertaining movie.If you didn't grow up in Santa Cruz, it's probably an 8 or 7. At any rate, it's a fun movie to watch.",The Lost Boys

Rock & Roll.... throw in some wickedly cool Vampires and you have one awesome flick. The casting was spot on, Kieffer was excellent as David, Jason and Corey played Michael and Sam to a tee and even Diane Weiss was wonderful as Lucy. One of the coolest soundtracks ever associated with a movie (non musical). Lost Boys made Vampires cool and sexy.Some movies should never be messed with and this is one. It's a damn shame that they went and made 2 really crappy b-grade sequels and an even bigger shame that Corey Feldman starred in both.",The Lost Boys

The coolest part of it was all the 80's stuff. i grew up in the 80's and have watched a lot of movies from this era. and this movie had it all, the 80's music, the style, and cloathing!! It also had some cool scenes and great FX make up. but this movie is best suitable for 12 year olds who might still find this movie to be scary, and at the same time learn all about the 80's. myself, i need something like, the ring, or the exorcist to get the chills.",The Lost Boys

All my friends had been talking about it for months...I couldn't wait...I start to watch...""People are Strange"" kicks in...I am hooked. It was definitely a film for my generation; regardless of how good it actually is, everyone of roughly my age (I am now 27) who saw it when they were younger absolutely loves it...it's the same with Big Trouble In Little China...it the cinematic equivalent of smoking...it's cool and it has an effect on impressionable youngsters!!

I'll never forget seeing Lost Boys at the Pictures for the first time as a 17 year old with a girl whom I took as a first date. She was so impressed, we dated for like 3 months (WOW - Milestone for the 80s). My own impressions of the ""Lost Boys"" then and now was and still is ""WOW"". AND the reason I dropped my girlfriend was because I discovered I was in Love with Kiefer Sutherland more than her - ha ha ha JOKIN !

It is just a very well produced story with a solid script, awesome acting, and a soundtrack that is no less than phenomenal. this movie was WAY ahead of its time, and is still a movie that can be watched any number of times. I live less than an hour from Santa Cruz, and have been to many of the places shot in the movie, making the experience seem more ""real"" than a middle America slasher flick. nothing seems really out of place in this movie. there isn't so much violence it's boring (see mortal combat), and has just the right amount of comic relief and story building.

For a female, it has a host of wonderful looking male vampires & cast members, for a guy - it's a great way to entertain your lady. I am very big vampire movie lover and though I agree, this move could have been way more scary, put it in perspective - it's a horror/comedy - this means funny parts to break the moment. This movie has some great one liners that still make me smile. Also, as someone who lives close to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, it's fun to see the landmarks I know so well in this movie. Brings it closer to home. Any movie will fail if you hold it up to too many standards. Take this movie as a fun vampire movie, set in the 80's with a load of flash backs for those of us that are children of the 80's!",The Lost Boys

362,jennab-writer,The Vampire Movie for Anyone Who's Sick of Vampire Movies,10,16 September 2014,"It was the late 2000s, and the inexplicable Twilight frenzy had descended in all its sparkling, full-forced madness. I'm sure we all remember the ensuing scramble to vault onto the paranormal bandwagon, and how quickly the media became glutted with all things supernatural. So it goes without saying that when my mom dragged out a vampire movie, I wasn't thrilled.But I guess that's just another example why people go around saying ""Mother knows best.""The vampire movie was director Joel Schumacher's 1987 film The Lost Boys, and it's now one of my favorite movies. Despite the fact that it's over thirty years old and has been followed by a tidal wave of movies and books on the same subject, The Lost Boys remains a fresh, unique take on vampire lore.Unlike many recent paranormal stories, the film doesn't try to turn its subject completely on its head in order to carve out an original place for itself. The vampires are dangerous, careless, and strangely magnetic--in keeping with their roots. However, they've also been updated, given a modern edge. Rather than stuffy Transylvanians skulking in castles, they're a motorcycle gang racing around the cliffs of California. Instead of red-lined capes, they wear leather and piercings.The film opens with brothers Michael (played by Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim)--plus their mom--moving to California to live with their grandfather. Their mother begins seeing a new man, and Michael (the older brother) soon falls in with the aforementioned motorcycle gang. Meanwhile, Sam passes his time with comic books. At the local comic shop, he meets two boys his own age. They introduce themselves as the Frog brothers and warn him that the area has a vampire problem, explaining that they're vampire hunters.Sam doesn't exactly take their words to heart, but before long, he needs to. The motorcycle gang pressures Michael into drinking from a bottle of ""wine"" as an initiation rite. He downs it without realizing it's actually blood. However, because he hasn't killed anyone yet, he only becomes a half-vampire. With some help from the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), Sam and Michael learn that Michael's vampirism will be reversed if they kill the leader of the vampire gang (Kiefer Sutherland).Plenty of great story elements follow. There's a little bit of something for everyone: plot twists, action, romance, humor--and even water guns filled with holy water. For me, however, one of the most compelling things is the dynamic between Sam and Michael. It's never heavy-handed or all that sentimental—""No chick flick moments,"" as Supernatural's Dean Winchester famously insisted—but the brothers' relationship is at the core of the movie. Their bonds with their mother and grandfather are also fleshed out, giving the film a strong, family-centric backbone. Then, of course, there are the vampires: the eternally young ""lost boys"" the title refers to. For quite a while now, it's seemed like vampires have progressively been getting watered down. This one strolls through sunlight. This one's actually a really nice guy, if you give him a chance. That one drinks from Bambi, for Pete's sake. After being bombarded by all that, I was relieved to find vampires who could be menacing again. My only complaint is the relationship between Michael and another of the half-vampires, a girl named Star. While she's the one who gets him involved with the gang in the first place, I don't feel like their relationship adds anything to the movie. It seems more the studio tossed it in because they felt like a potential Hollywood hit would need some romance in the mix. However, I think that time could've been put to better use by focusing it more on the vampires themselves, or on brothers' relationship with each other or with their grandpa. All in all, this is one of my go-to favorites for recommendations or movie nights. The horror, action, and humor strike a great balance, and aside from the '80s hair and some of Sam's fashion choices, this one stands the test of time beautifully. If nothing else, it's a blissful reprieve from all the sparkling and humanity of today's vampires—a nod to tradition without bending backwards for it. I recommend this film as the vampire movie for anyone who's sick of vampire movies--because that's exactly what it was for me.",The Lost Boys
363,garyofdonny,My all time favourite film!!,10,16 June 2005,"This has to be the best film ever made, purely on an ""Enjoyable, but yet...cool!' factor! Being quite a fan of the eighties fashion (though not necessarily a religious practitioner) and music, I just think the matching of music to the scenes and how predictable it is kind of makes it a film you would expect to see. You expect vampires to live in small, mildly inbred coastal towns, wear black leather and ride motorbikes whilst being generally unruly. Michael and Sam are your typical 80s teenage brothers rebelling after their parents divorce. This film isn't meant to be scary, life changing or a comedy, its just meant to be good, and on that it delivers!!Also film for best quote - ""Death by stereo!""",The Lost Boys
364,sturmhard-tempelton,So 80s.,6,17 April 2016,"If you want the ultimate feeling of an 80s movie, you will receive it from the very first beginning. Nice and funny and kind of nostalgic, but gets weaker as the plot moves on. Even the cast is exemplary for a movie from this decade. I really like to see Corey Feldman acting as the though guy even though he is still not a grown up. There are some parallels to the movie Stand by me. Although Alex Winter is playing just a short role, he is fun to watch. Not very believable in his role, but very likable (almost always grinning). The soundtrack is nice and totally fits. On the whole Jan Fischer couldn't decide what he wanted the movie to be. Horror or Comedy? In the end it's not a mix but an alteration of both and I don't think that worked out well enough.",The Lost Boys

Directed by the man who would 10 years later RUIN the Batman franchise. Kiefer Sutherland is the real breakout star here. Both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman also contribute to the film's clasicality. The best film of 1987. I loved all aspects of this film. While some may find it boring, I think it makes up for it's lack of major gore with explosively funny and engaging chemistry between the cast. Another title for this film could have been something like: ""Teenage Vampires"", or: ""This Sucks"".The ghostly and eery opening sequence will send shivers down your spine.",The Lost Boys

As a 14 year old boy i saw a trailer and knew this was going to be a great flick.
But... i live in the netherlands and movies did not come out here in theatres. So i had to wait for a video release. After a couple of weeks it was available because of piracy. Long live piracy. I picked it up at the videostore and rented a video recorder as well. I had one myself but i wanted my own copy.
After the first time i saw the movie i was really thrilled! And the soundtrack. Incredible! After that i watched it every day right after school for at least a half year.
Just like i did with The goonies and back to the future. The 3 movies i love the most.
Now i am 45. Have 2 kids and showed it to my oldest when he was 13. The youngest is still 10 so he has to wait a littlebit longer.
I really was jelous of Corey Haim. He had the greatest life a kid could have i thought.
I watched all of his movies (and feldmans) and did not know at the time that his price was high. He died way to young.
After all these years and thousands of movies i watched after that, this movie is still in my top 5 of greatest movies ever made. And nothing is going to change that ever.",The Lost Boys

371,bill-1273,Strange Days have found us - a movie for us Doors fans...,9,27 December 2018,"As a long-term fan of the music of Jim Morrison and the Doors, I found 'The Lost Boys' to be a guilty pleasure. Along with the excellent use of cover versions of 'People are Strange' at the start and end of the film, there is of course the huge 'Young Lion' poster of Morrison in the vampires' cave. To take the Doors connections further, I'd argue that the striking similarity in appearance of Jason Patric to the Summer '67 vintage Jim was anything but accidental. Beyond that, the film is centred on the moonlit fairground weirdness of Santa Cruz / Santa Carla - down by the ocean side. The reference(s) to the band's classic, eerie 'Strange Days' album are immediate and apparent - and it makes for a great film. Strange days indeed have found us.",The Lost Boys

373,MissMimiH,Captures the true essence of Vampires,10,17 July 2006,"**May contain spoilers** I first saw this movie about a year ago, it was my mom's idea to rent it. When she told me it was scary I didn't believe her. But she was right. Its kinda un-nerving.The Lost Boys just screams 80's but thats whats so awesome about it. The performances by all are outstanding. Dianne Wiest is perfect as Lucy Emerson, the mom trying to rebuild her life with her sons after a divorce. Corey Haim and Jason Patric, have really good screen chemistry(being brothers) and give realism to the movie. Grandpa (Barnard Huges) is funny, as the eccentric old man, and who could forget the amazingly funny Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman, and Jamison Newlander, loved the Chuck Norris/Rambo voices!Jami Gertz is good in her role as Star, the only girl vampire in the movie, her and Jasons chemistry is breathe taking. Max (Edward Herrmann) is really versatile, being able to play the lovable video clerk, as well as the deranged head vampire. The Lost Boys (Dwayne, Marko and Paul) all play their roles wickedly, with just enough humor to be likable. Lastly there's David(Kiefer Sutherland) the leader of the head boys, his portrayal of David is hauntingly refreshing, he's charismatic enough to lure you in, but evil enough to make you want to run, he steals the show, IMO. Overall this movie is one of my favorites, it's a cult classic, with just enough of a mix of humor, romance, action, and horror, to appeal to almost anyones tastes.",The Lost Boys
374,JenniferKMelton,This Is My Childhood,9,20 August 2021,"I can't remember the amount of times I watched this movie, I practically ran it into the ground. It basically raised me. One of the actors, Billy Wirth, who plays Dwayne, is how I started my fascination with Native American actors. I'm not sure if Billy Wirth is part of this ancestry, but regardless of his race he brought to the screen a presence as a background character to be noticed, at least by my perspective. Not only has this movie made itself into film history, it's also a cult classic. It's earned that title by the originality, cast, and costumes (vampires).As a young girl and into my teen years I would put myself into one of those vampires and pretended that I was one of the boys. I got to say that I'm a little relieved they never made a Lost Girls in the nineties, I'm sure audiences everywhere would have to endure skanky women and their over the top acting. I may be bitter about this fictional movie that has yet to be made, but I'll let that one lie. Fans of this movie dress up every Halloween and at Comic Con, it's going down in history as part of a collection of grand titles. I'll go ahead and stop while I'm ahead.",The Lost Boys
375,illbeoneasystreet,Being Dated Only Adds to the Charm,9,11 September 2011,"The Lost Boys screams eighties, but that is part of the reason it is so much fun. And you don't have to have grown up in the eighties to enjoy it. Is it campy? Absolutely, but a mixture of well used horror tactics, iconic lines that you will never forget, and a well rounded cast make it great. The true star of this movie is Kiefer Sutherland who delivers an astounding performance with mullet in tow. Jason Patric gives a suitable enough performance, although pales in the blinding light of Sutherland's character. Corey Haim is absolutely adorable in this and shows that although he might not be the greatest actor has more then enough talent and charm to worm his way into your heart. (Too bad he never got his comeback I personally believe the man could have gone places.) Feldman and Newlander provide comic relief as the Frogg brothers but I must admit that they get a little annoying after multiple viewings in my case anyways others might disagree. Add on top of that astounding performances from the casts veterans and you have a great movie.",The Lost Boys
376,voodoor7,looks over substance can get you in trouble with immortal creeps,5,19 March 2006,"Two Fatherless girlie like brothers get rescued from vampires by two other ""alpha male"" brothers.Nice carnival on the beach side scenery in-between.The soundtrack is great too, till one develops tastes.there was a novel idea or two also, like using squirt guns with Holy Water, thought up by the mortalsand turning Chinese food into real live worms by the immortals, well an illusion of squirming worms anyways. You have to wonder if they were insinuating that Chinese food turns into worms cause Chinese people eat dogs??? a play on HeartwormsIF I was a Chinaman I would be contacting the ADL or somebody.",The Lost Boys
