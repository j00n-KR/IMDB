0,MartinHafer,"A bit confusing, actually...and a great illustration of the phrase 'TMI'",7,18 September 2011,"Whether or not ""Incendies"" is a good or bad film, one thing that struck me was that for the longest time I had no idea where the film was taking place or the context for the film. I am sure I am not the only one who felt this way watching the move. I thought that perhaps it was taking place in North Africa or Lebanon--I just wasn't sure. A bit later, it became more obvious--but only because I knew a bit about he history of Lebanon and their long and amazingly destructive civil war. Because of this, it really would behoove the viewer to read up on the war BEFORE watching the movie--then it will be a bit easier to follow.The film begins in the French-speaking portion of Canada. Two young adults are at the reading of their mother's will and are in for some surprises. First, their father, despite what they'd been told, is NOT dead. Second, they have a brother! The rest of the film consists of the daughter going in search of these folks and eventually the brother going to Lebanon in search of his sister--who seems to have just disappeared.From this point, the film bounces back and forth from the past to the present day. This can be a bit confusing--you have to really pay attention to keep track. I know that this sort of yo-yo cinema has become more popular in recent years, but I really wish they'd stop doing this and make films in a much more linear fashion. You do learn that the mother's life was hellacious but you also learn that the two children certainly did NOT need to know about their hidden past! I am pretty darn sure I wouldn't want to learn what they learned about this. And, I also predicted this awful truth well before it was divulged in the movie--making it a bit of an icky anti-climax. I thought the film was interesting but also pretty unpleasant from start to finish.By the way, the film is very, very adult--with many adult themes and lots of bloody violence. Now I am NOT saying it was gratuitous--but it's not a film for kids or anyone who doesn't a realistically violent film. Folks getting burned alive or getting shot in the head at close range are among the things you see and, fortunately, the rapes are underplayed but still make this a super-adult film.",Incendies
1,TheLittleSongbird,A promise is very much a sacred thing,9,16 September 2017,"The main attraction into seeing 'Incendies' was that it was directed by Denis Villeneuve, having loved 'Sicario' and really liked 'Prisoners' (apart from the ending). Reviews for both films recommended 'Incendies' highly and with people calling it one of Villeneuve's best, so seeing the film was definitely on the cards.Seeing it, 'Incendies' turned out to be every bit the great film as touted. Although more needs to be seen from Villeneuve, 'Incendies' to me does contain some of his best work seen thus far and my second favourite after 'Sicario'. It is a tough watch, often incredibly hard-hitting, and will have things that people will love and others won't (some will, and have done, find it contrived and melodramatic), but again to me 'Incendies' was so exceptionally well made all round with such a strong emotional impact throughout that although it is not perfect it was hard not to be hard on it.'Incendies's' weak point is the ending, it is certainly unexpected and has some power but also seemed rather contrived and like it went on far with the number of coincidences, almost as credibility-straining as the ending of 'Prisoners' if not quite.However, 'Incendies' is superbly made visually, especially in the stylish and brooding cinematography, with deft use of close-ups and long shots, that captures the horrors of the story wonderfully, even if Roger Deakins did it just a little bit better. The scenery is similarly audacious while also highly atmospheric. The music is suitably haunting, with great use of Radiohead's ""You and Whose Army"".Villeneuve's direction is some of his career's best, he specialised in giving his films a darkness that was beautiful and brutal but also a hard edge that didn't hold back for the better. That can be seen in 'Incendies'. While not as tight as the script in 'Sicario', the script has a lot of emotional impact and provokes thought.When it comes to the story, 'Incendies' is also hugely successful. It really hits hard without overdoing or sugar-coating things, it's very much authentic, and is also very moving. The bus massacre in particular is a highlight that shocks one to the core. The parallel split-time structure of the story is very interesting, neither story line is hard to follow and they tie up neatly at the end, while the numerous revelations and twists could have been credibility-straining and illogical if not done right but Villeneuve keeps it all under control. Anguish, confusion and regret has not in a while been seen by me so poignantly on film.Performances are strong across the board, with powerhouse turns from Lubna Azabal and Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin. The film does a particularly great job in creating sympathy for the protagonist, who is developed beautifully, one where she is easy to root for every step of the way and comes over as a compellingly real one.Overall, great film, a near-masterwork though the ending is not as good as the rest of the film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Incendies
2,SnoopyStyle,epic Greek tragedy,8,6 September 2015,"Twins Simon and Jeanne Marwan are given instructions at the reading of their mother's Will. They are to deliver letters to their father and a brother they know nothing about. Simon dismisses their mother's weird wishes but Jeanne decides to discover the truth. In Lebanon, their Christian mother Nawal Marwan had an affair with Arab Wahab. Her family killed Wahab. Her grandma saved the pregnant Nawal. The baby was given to a mysterious woman. Narwal would go off to look for him.Director Denis Villeneuve delivers some compelling images. It's a dark murky tale of religion and family set in the middle of a sectarian war. There is a point in the middle where the story double down and make this a true Greek Tragedy. I have a small problem with the dying nurse telling the twins about the babies born in prison. They should be able to figure that part out by themselves. The last half is stretched out a bit. By the midway point, I wish the movie picks up the pace to get to the big reveal. Nevertheless, this is a brilliant tragedy.",Incendies
3,claudio_carvalho,One plus One is Equal to One,8,26 March 2012,"In Canada, the sixty year-old immigrant secretary Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) passes away and the notary Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard), who had been her employer and friend for seventeen years, reads her will to her twin son and daughter Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and Jeanne Marwan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin), who is a mathematician.Nawal requests to be buried naked with her face down and her tomb without a gravestone; further, she leaves three sealed envelopes addressed to the twins' father that they believed had deceased in the Middle East; to their unknown brother; and the last one to themselves to be opened only after the delivery of the other two. Then, they may put a gravestone on her tomb. Simon is reluctant to respect his mother last wishes, but Jeanne decides to find her biological father and brother.She travels to the Middle East to track down the past life of her mother and she discovers who she was before moving to Canada. She feels disturbed with the revelations and asks Simon to come to the Middle East to assist her in her journey. Simon discovers who his father and his brother are and concludes that one plus one may be equal to one.""Incendies"" is an intriguing film about the journey of two twin siblings that travel to the Middle East to fulfill the last wish of their mother and end discovering the disturbing history of their family.The screenplay is very well written and discloses in parallel to the journey of Jeanne first and Simon later, the brave history of their mother in an unnamed country in the Middle East. The plot point in the conclusion is totally unexpected and heartbreaking. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Incêndios"" (""Fires"")",Incendies
4,classicsoncall,"""Death is never the end of the story. It always leaves tracks.""",10,5 November 2017,"I don't know if I've ever seen a more heartbreaking and shocking story. Check that, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" was another film that served a solid punch to the gut that remains with you a long time. I have to credit some other reviewers for this film to identify the location of the story and place it in context of the Lebanese civil war. I might have considered it myself if I hadn't been so absorbed by the story and the intricately detailed revelations regarding Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) and her twins, son Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin). One must pay attention though, to the non-linear story telling style of director Denis Villeneuve, as well as the identity of the Christian and Muslim factions involved in war time brutality and atrocity. Apart from the principal story, the scene that will stay with you for a long time involves a Christian militia attack on a busload of Muslims attempting to flee their war torn and devastated city. A noble sacrifice on Marwan's part turns into a horror spectacle when a young child is gunned down by the militants. The picture exemplifies the terror of war and it's heartbreaking effect on those fortunate to survive.",Incendies
5,gavin6942,Dark Roots,7,1 July 2015,"Twins journey to the Middle East to discover their family history, and fulfill their mother's last wishes.Many of us, sooner or later, get interested in our family history and want to know our roots. Do we have a famous ancestor, or do we have connections to an Indian tribe, or maybe something else completely unexpected. Often, the journey is fascinating and can spark a real interest in history and a connection to our fellow man.Sometimes the journey is not so good. Many of us have Middle Eastern blood in us somewhere. Go back a hundred generations and we can trace our path just about anywhere. And the Middle East, as a whole, is a great place... but this film shows what can happen if the path goes askew.",Incendies
6,lee_eisenberg,Arab Spring's origins,10,30 June 2011,"World attention throughout much of this year has focused on uprisings in the Arab world. The Tunisian people forced the country's dictator to flee, and the Egyptian people overthrew Hosni Mubarak, while protests continue in Bahrain and Yemen.However, it's important to understand the roots of these uprisings. Denis Villeneuve's ""Incendies"" shows some examples. The movie focuses on Nawan Marwal (Lubna Azabal), an Arab immigrant in Quebec whose final wish is for her son and daughter to give some information to their father (whom they have never met) and their brother (who they never knew existed). So begins the children's journey to find out why their mother fled her native country.The native country is never identified, although it appears to be Lebanon. And in finding out what Nawan saw in her native country -- told in flashback -- we see some VERY ugly stuff. The movie leaves practically nothing to the imagination. But it's all part of the children's learning the family history. And certainly, the horror that Nawan witnessed should give the audience an idea of why the Arab world has been rising up for the past six months (in that respect, it probably would have been appropriate to give ""Incendies"" Best Foreign Language Film). Above all, it's a very good movie, although very gut-wrenching.Also starring Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin, Maxim Gaudette, Rémy Girard and Allen Altman.",Incendies
7,grantss,Intriguing drama,8,18 April 2014,"Intriguing drama, nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2012. Hard to get into at first, as it starts very slowly and without a clear direction. This can be quite off-putting, as it looks like it is going to just be 2 hours of drifting.However, from a point it becomes a very intriguing mystery. Plus, it becomes an exploration of religious intolerance and the effect of civil wars on the civilian population. No punches pulled, the war scenes are searing and graphic.The conclusion is quite incredible in terms of unexpected, perverse twists.Not perfect though. As already mentioned, the start is slow, and feels padded. More importantly, some parts of the plot, especially towards the end, seem a bit forced and contrived. Not 100% plausible, ultimately.Still, a great movie. The intrigue just builds and builds.",Incendies
8,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Incendies,10,13 August 2011,"The film begins in sweeping slow motion, centered around a harsh cemented premises with a bunch of boys undergoing the shaving of their hair ala military fashion, with the camera centered on one boy possessing this crazed looking eyes, before cutting to Canada where twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette respectively) arrive at a notary's office to accept the will of their recently deceased mother Nawal (Lubna Azabal), where they are left with letters to deliver to a father and brother that they do not know. In the meantime, they are to bury their mother in a certain strange way until their quest has been completed, with the notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard), Nawal's boss the last few years, ensuring that her last will and testament is completed the way it was intended.Incendies, based upon the play Scorched written by Wajdi Mouawad and adapted for the screen by director Denis Villeneuve, was this year's Best Foreign Language Film nominee from Canada, and there's every reason why it was a nomination well deserved. Set against a mystery to be unraveled so slowly, bringing together seemingly disparate events together in shocking fashion by the time we're through, the narrative is split into two different timelines, with the current one being the twins' journey to an unnamed Middle Eastern country in search for clues to their unknown father and brother, while with each milestone achieved of sorts, we get to see a flashback to the time of their mother, brought up in a harsh environment involving the staining of family honour, as well as religious zealots and militants who set her off in a tale of an avenging angel, and sacrifice.And the story sprawls in many directions, though with Villeneuve always having an assured hand in not having this fall into melodramatic terms nor have any wasted scenes, highlighting issues that still exist to this very day involving hatred, revenge and forgiveness, but not before laying down a number of surprises that will shake you to the core especially when the mysterious equation finally gets solved – you may get a hint of what's to come, but this got handled so expertly without being verbatim, that it accentuates and compounds the myriad of complex emotions felt by all the characters involved.With sweeping cinematography that's achingly beautiful to gaze at, one of the best scenes involve the brutal, cold blooded mass murder where militants spray countless of rounds into a packed bus, culminating in that shot of a burning bus shrouded in thick black smoke against an endless sandy environment, with Nawal finally snapping into making a decision to take matters into her own hands from then on. Between the two stories, perhaps it is Nawal's painful journey that makes this compelling viewing, from having her lover forcefully and terminally separated from her by family during her teens, then her volunteering and sacrifice leading to imprisonment and ill treatment within as punishment. What she did as part of reconciliation is in part a masterstroke in inflicting inexplicable pain in return to her perpetrator, is what made this film a winner, although it will stun you into silence well after the end credits roll from the devastation the narrative left in its wake.The other half of the narrative deals with Jeanne and Simon's journey to dig through unwritten laws, and reluctance of tightly knit communities that prefer to keep the status quo and not dwell and reopen wounds inflicted from their collective shameful past, some in denial, while others happy to have seen a more favourable outcome from Nawal's hardships. It is this piecing together of the mystery like an investigative drama that makes Incendies unique, and what more, Radiohead also features in the soundtrack – strange but true, and very powerful if you ask me.Comparing the ratings between this film at M18 and Womb at R21 reveals what the censors allow and not allow when dealing with more mature themes, likely centered around the intention of its more controversial scenes. It's anyone's guess why was was given the highest rating possible, and the other one rung lower, given that both actually didn't have anything explicit, except perhaps one was used as an unintentional weapon of torture and destruction in the psychological sense, while the other was a love story gotten out of control! Still, for its strong story and excellent production values, Incendies becomes that must watch film in 2011, especially during this season of noisy summer action blockbusters that absolutely don't resonate as much as this film. Highly recommended!",Incendies
9,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Incendies (2010) 7.9/10,8,15 May 2021,"""The narrative bifurcates and alternates between Nawal's checkered past in her war-riddled fatherland (an unnamed country, but the events alluding to Lebanese Civil War, and her actions take a leaf from the book of a Lebanese woman Souha Bechara), and decades later, the twins' journey (Jeanne goes first and Simon will join her later) to their provenance, to discover the inconceivable story of their parentage. As an audience, you are granted an advantage of first-hand information from Nawal's POV, while the twins slavishly track down breadcrumbs, gather details in dribs and drabs, so the film hooks you by this tack, you are one step ahead in the game, until the riddle is solved, you are in utter shock, like the twins. If you think finding out they are the offspring of a rapist is a major hammer blow, you are too naive!""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks.",Incendies
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It pulls you in close, never letting go until the last frame finally releases you and allows you to expell all your emotions in one gut-wrenched gasp.",8,11 July 2018,"Though sometimes it seems as though information is given to us slightly too early, this often leads to some decent dramatic irony and does 'distract' from - and thereby make all the more impactful - the flick's big, blindsiding final reveal which is essentially as shocking as it is sickening, a harrowing revelation for both the audience and the picture's principle characters that has massive repercussions for both, and serves to recontextualise everything that came before it in a significant yet suitably subtle way, mostly making up for the slightly slow pace and occasional meandering that had marred the piece before. Once you've settled into the strange pace and presentation of 'Incendies (2010)', you're treated to an increasingly dark exploration of a woman you know to be dead, whom is still as strong a presence as any other character, and the children who slowly learn about her life alongside us, as we both inch ever closer to an ending that will haunt our memories for days, a tragedy of Greek proportions set against a backdrop of tragedies that all meet that same standard. As each new revelation ratchets up the suspense and plumets us in to increasingly dire territory, an unexpectedly grim realism begins to perforate the entire piece, steeping it in an often unspoken sadness and a thick air of mystery. It's this that gets under your skin and pulls you in deeper, never letting you go until the last frame finally lets you slump back in your seat and release all your emotions in one gut-wrenched gasp. It's an ever-escalating devestation of our expectations. It isn't darkness for darkness sake, rather an exploration of the characters within these situations. It's also the rare film that rests upon withholding information that would seem fairly simple, yet doing so for legitimate narrative reasons, and providing it in intelligent, usually exposition-light ways. While the tragedy exists for a reason, it is indeed tragedy. Blindsiding, unflinching tragedy, at that. The film knows when to show and when not to. All in the aid of making each moment the most impactful it can be, making you feel like you are the child of this poorly-treated, mysterious mother as you learn of her past. You'll often find yourself asking: how can things get worse? Trust me... they do. It's brilliant. 8/10",Incendies
11,ThomasDrufke,Where Does Your Story Start?,9,8 June 2015,"I was absolutely blown away by this film. It's one of those movies that sticks with you awhile after watching. I cant get this film out of my head. Not only is a beautiful looking film, the story is told in a beautiful way. Sure, it's a story that takes place during some of the middle east conflicts, but that's not what you will remember from Incendies. You will remember the characters and the relationships or lack of relationships that each of them have. Denis Villenueve gave us yet another masterpiece here.The film deals with twins who are looking over their mother's will when they find she has given them each a mission before they are allowed to bury her. The mission is to find their brother, who they didn't know existed, and their father, who they assumed was dead. It's such a unique and interesting premise. Definitely one that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. But what's great about Incendies and Villenueve's directing is that it doesn't rely on actual suspense like scenes to make you feel suspenseful. In other words, the film can be shocking but it doesn't rely on big shootouts or real life dangerous scenes. I just loved that the film was able to pull off vulnerability without cheapening the shock value. The film is told through two parallel stories. The mother, Nawal, in her younger days traveling through the middle east going from jail to jail. And her kids, looking for the brother and father through various people who knew Nawal back in the day. The first half of the film when the mother and daughter are both going on their journeys I felt was more interesting than the brother's arc, but they all turned out to be valuable in the end.I loved the subtle emotional acting that the children gave. Often, Villenueve would keep the camera on their faces for a long period of time while they hear something life changing. It proved to be a great technique in creating more emotion than the scene would have otherwise called for. Of course, this film is known to be shocking and have loads of twists and turns, but I never felt the film reached for too much shock value. Every twist seemed possible and something that actually could happen. And it's a tribute to the lead actors that they were able to ground the film in reality enough to never take me out of it. Incendies is one of those films that I put off seeing for awhile because I didn't think the story interested me enough, but I'm now jealous of anyone who hasn't seen it and will be able to experience it for the first time. It's a film that is both devastatingly beautiful and beautifully devastating. I absolutely loved this film.+Lead performances +Shocking twists and turns +Villenueve's directing style +Edge of your seat drama +Parallel storytelling 9.4/10",Incendies
12,secondtake,"Gutwrenching, intense, beautiful, searing (yes, scorching)...",9,14 January 2014,"Incendies (2010)Scorched is a good translation of the French title. That's how you'll feel by the end.This Canadian movie, based on a play by a Lebanese writer, is set mostly in Jordan and is a tale of a twin brother and sister (son and daughter) looking for their roots after the death of their mother. It's quite amazing.Don't think this is some feel-good flick. What it shows first of all, better than almost any movie I've seen, is the reality of life in wartime in the Mideast (pick your country). The ruthless, bloody, sectarian violence is made intimate in the worst way, or best way cinematically—you hate it, and feel it. This is the huge strength of the movie, giving light to the dilemmas of ordinary people trying to survive, literally, the mayhem.Equally important is how the daughter's view of her mother changes as she learns more and more about her. The daughter is forced to do this because of a request in her mother's will, but she takes it on, in a more recent Jordan, with utter determination.The movie is divided into two time periods. The first belongs to the mother in an ongoing series of harrowing flashbacks. The second belongs to the daughter, and eventually the son, as they look for surviving members of the mother's past. The steely force of will of the daughter turns out to be a mere shadow of the strength of her mother, and you droop in admiration and sympathy for all of them.The huge, dramatic hook of the movie, which you only learn as the characters learn it at the very end of the movie, isn't something I can talk about here. But for outrageousness it puts Shakespeare to shame—and it was for me also a distraction. Your jaw drops and you think, oh how awful (and more)! But a part of my brain was also saying, this is too much, it isn't contributing to the truth and emotional depth of these characters.It might even undermine them slightly, reminding us this is a stage play, an artifice.But that's a nagging quibble. This is really a powerful movie, beautifully rendered, and acted with unusual intensity. It's rough (realistically violent) in a few spots, but it's worth it. Wow.",Incendies

14,Bored_Dragon,Overall impression + spoilers + my ideas to improve the story,7,30 October 2016,"Great idea but a weak realization. The story has strength and depth and, if it was made by the book, the book probably kicks ass, but the movie left me indifferent. I cannot say what is the issue, if it is acting or directing or music or what... but until just a few minutes before the end I had absolutely no emotions towards what I was watching and I was bored. For the idea and the very end of the movie... 9/10, but the overall impression is about 5/10.!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!Christian girl gets involved with a Muslim refugee and gets pregnant. Christian police kill the Muslim and her child is taken away at birth and sent to an orphanage. Many years later she gets revenge for the tragedy of her youth by killing the leader of Christian police. She ends up in prison where she is raped by the cruelest guard. She gets pregnant again and gives birth to twins. After she is released from prison, she takes her children to Canada.After she died her testament sends her children in a quest to find their father and brother and deliver letters from her. The daughter goes to search for the father and the son searches for the brother and they both find the same person.The orphanage was destroyed in the war and the child was adopted by attackers and trained to be a killing machine. He ends up as a prison guard where he rapes a female prisoner, not knowing it was his mother.Twins first get to know that their father is not killed in the war, as they were told. They find out that they are a result of their mother being raped in prison while she was serving sentence for murder. Then as icing on the cake, they find out that she was raped by the long lost son. So, in adult age, you find out that your whole life was a lie. Your mother is a murderer, you are a rape child, the rapist is your older brother, and you are just a side effect of sadistic, incestuous rape, and now you are expected to continue with your life as a mentally stable person... yea, right, like it is possible...So, I would like to improve this already sick movie by adding some epilogue to it:a) Father/brother receives both letters and, when his brain finally realizes shocking truth, he drops letters on the floor and jumps through the window (shoot himself in the head), while twins end up in a closed section of a sanitarium.or, for those who root for a happy ending...b) Twins cry in embranchment, which ends up ""horizontally"", and father/brother accepts his newfound family and joyfully awaits the birth of his grandchild/nephew and they lived happily ever after.P.S. Yup, I know, I'm sick.7/10",Incendies
15,851222,Powerful Story,9,13 September 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Incendies"" (2010) strength lies in its powerful and hardly forgettable story, which at the end left me speechless - literally. This movie is also wonderfully crafted - cinematography was amazing, it should have been nominated for Oscar in that category. Acting was good, especially by the lead who played Nawal Marwan. Directing was very solid by now famous Denis Villeneuve - he was a great guide in this at first kinda tough story. There are many names and places in this movie, but what matters most is what it tells at the end, which i definitely won't even hint at. Sure, the coincidence is one in a million, but this is a movie, and a very powerful one.Overall, ""Incendies"" is a highly recommended drama / mystery / war.

16,paulclaassen,One word: INCREDIBLE!,8,16 November 2019,"Initially, the film can be a bit confusing due to them continually jumping back in time. Once you get the hang of it, though, and get to know the characters, it is easy enough to follow.This is essentially two films in one: the story of a mother searching for the son she had to give up at birth, and a story about twins searching for their father, and a brother they never knew they had. The film takes us on an incredible journey filled with action, suspense, drama, and more than just a few twists.'Incendies' effectively illustrates the horrors of war, and killings in the name of religion.

Weaving between two timelines, we slowly uncover the story of Nawal and the secret of who is really the father of her children. Although not much happens in the investigation plot-wise, the events still feel compelling due to the emotional toll on the siblings and the destructiveness of the war surrounding their mother.

18,Thanos_Alfie,Search of everything...,7,17 March 2015,"""Incendies"" is a mystery movie in which we watch a twins who they just lost their mother. In her testament their mother had some wishes and in the next time we watch the twins traveling to Middle East to discover what their mother wants about their family history and to fulfill their mother's last wishes.I liked this movie because I found it interesting and the plot had many swifts, something that made this movie even more interesting. I also liked this movie because of the interpretation of Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin who played as Jeanne Marwan and she was very good at it. Another interpretations that I liked in this movie were Maxim Gaudette's who played as Simon Marwan and Lubna Azabal's who played as Nawal Marwan.Finally I have to admit that I did not expect to like this movie but I was mistaken. ""Incendies"" is a great movie to watch and I strongly recommend it because its a lesson about life and the fight for it. It also combines very well mystery with a drama of a family and of course war, and this is something that makes this movie even better.",Incendies
19,eddie_baggins,A stunning and powerful thriller,10,8 May 2018,"Want to see where one of the modern era's hottest directing streaks started? If you do, then Incendies in the film for you.Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who went from this French/Canadian co-production to move onto Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival and last year's brilliant sequel Blade Runner 2049, Incendies is the Oscar nominated film that put Villeneuve on the path he finds himself on now and remains a film of substantial power these years on from initial release.Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name, Incendies is a multi-layered narrative that spans both numerous countries and numerous characters over various timelines but Villeneuve controls his film perfectly as the mystery that lays at the heart of this tale about family, war, life and death never gets muddled as we're drawn further and further into a film that wraps us up in its web and refuses to let us go.There's not the abundance of filmmaking and visual flair that Villeneuve has started to become known for over his more recent Hollywood productions but Incendies power comes almost exclusively from Villeneuve's deft hand with his performers, his handling of a script that other filmmakers would struggle to bring to life and his ability to slowly ebb out more information as we go, that by the time we come to realise just what lays in store for the films characters, the power of Incendies becomes even more apparent.Saying to much about this story would be a disservice to a film that takes many various turns and pivots. Essentially at its core, a story of both twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan trying to uncover the secret of their father they've never met and find a brother they never knew they had after their Middle Eastern born mother Nawal passes away, Incendies becomes so much more than a typical family drama as it showcases time in the conflict of the Israeli and Palestinian Holy Wars, as well as the twins journey back to their country of nationality.The film in many ways showcases a different side to Villeneuve and proves the director is just as at home handling a $150 million plus Sci-Fi for a major Hollywood studio as he is behind the camera of a small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative and characters. Proof the filmmaker is a man of many talents and a director to be cherished by those that love cinema.Final Say - For any fans of Villeneuve's work, world cinema or powerful character driven dramas, then Incendies should be a film you seek out as soon as possible. Losing none of its power since its initial release, this sometimes hard to watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking and the official blasting off point for one of the modern era's great filmmakers.5 swimming pools out of 5",Incendies
20,johnnyboyz,"If its title translates out of French and into English as ""Scorched"", then this is a near red-hot drama making the difficulties of taking this subject matter on look easy.",7,9 February 2012,"The opening scenes of Incendies paints an image of a cantankerous elderly women whom, even in death, is forcing her children to run around on goose chases after a series of eccentric entries to a will that does nothing but pose further questions and cause further action when closure and other such things are all that's desired at such a difficult time. We feel sorry for the kids, a Canada residing brother and an elder sister; we feel a little bitter towards their recently deceased mother and then we witness a duel pilgrimage across the Eurasian border so startling that words such as 'humbling' don't really do it the sorts of justice it requires.The family to whom all this bother is unfolding are the Marwan's: siblings Jeanne (Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Gaudette), here in the present day, and then that of Lubna Azabal's Nawal, way back when. Needless to say, I'd rather have the modern-day set bother and the strife of the siblings than that of Nawal's. Jeanne and Simon sit silently in a solicitor's office, an odd air of grief and frustration abound as these requests documented by Nawal are read; requests more broadly encompassing the apparent need for the two to journey great distances and find a specific someone which will reveal all. Jeanne is the one who takes the plunge and ventures away from the niceties of her first world, economically developed living quarters to that of where Asia meets Europe. In the solicitor's office, Jeanne chirps up ahead of Simon when asked if there are any problems or inconveniences with what is being presented to them – yes, there is and the labelling of this person as being the sort to initially put the foot forward is established when Simon only begins to enquire once the green light has been instigated.A maths teacher, so good with problem solving and equations which are seemingly impenetrable, Jeanne heads out to a place which is ambiguous in its actual identity and that people appear to entrust is more broadly representative of Lebanon, in spite of the fact a Palestinian flag is very briefly identifiable in the corner of the frame at on one fleeting instance. Her journeys take her there so as to look for what the will says is a long-lost father as well as another brother whom neither she nor Simon ever knew of. Unfolded in crisp tandem is the tale of their mother some thirty-odd years ago, and Nawal's own hardships born out of persistent rejection from peers; religious circles and family members. It leads her to exploring this free-spirited characteristic embedded within by herself, and on a very dangerous line throughout, as she attempts to look for a son born out of wedlock and to a certain individual of a certain ilk many of whom within Nawal's initial circles take issue.The parallel between either journey mother and daughter undertake, similar in structure and scale, is fairly clear; the quest taking either woman all around the houses, from bombed out orphanages to grotty prisons. There is one sequence, a sort of grotesque centrepiece in its content but quietly beautiful in its harsh and thoroughly professional depiction, which is absolutely terrifying: a sequence which depicts a bus full of Muslims being ambushed by that of a Christian group of militants during this, a Civil War which has broken out in the undetermined nation. It is a sequence remarkable for its stark nature anyway, but additionally because it isn't necessarily the emotional crux of the film. The scene is made more impacting given the happenings within recent years of the film's production in nations such as Pakistan and Angola, and attacks relayed onto that of sporting personnel whose tales have graced news reports when their buses have come under fire and lives have been lost. Additionally, the sorts of brutality aimed at those within does well to subvert the idea of anonymous Muslim aggressors, of whom are shrouded in mystery and come complete with towels around their faces, attacking innocents and children by reversing the religious backgrounds as well as the respective roles of victimised and perpetrator. Here, Christian soldiers go on a rampage thus destroying a small, and often easily demonised, Muslim congregation. Regardless of that individual sequence's affecting qualities, Denis Villeneuve's film is a real sucker punch of emotion and biting self-discovery which, at certain stages, crept up on me; a really ambitious and worthwhile piece.",Incendies
21,Red-125,"Powerful, gripping plot with great direction and acting",10,26 June 2020,"Incendies (2010) is a Canadian film that was co-written and directed by Denis Villeneuve. The movie stars Lubna Azabal as Nawal Marwan, ""The Woman Who Sings."" In the opening of the film we learn that Nawal has just died, leaving some unusual instructions for her two children in her will.Then, there's a flashback, where we learn that Nawal, as a teenager, has given birth to an out-of-wedlock infant. The rest of the plot follows from those two starting points.Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin portrays Jeanne Marwan, and Maxim Gaudette portrays her twin, Simon Narwam. Désormeaux-Poulin has the larger role, and she is superb. Lubna Azabal is equally good as Nawal.The plot involves a quest journey, and the quest is achieved. However, for me the point of the movie wasn't whether or not the mystery would be solved. The point was to see that war--especially sectarian war--causes immense suffering to everyone involved.This isn't a feel-good film. Yes--we know the answers in the end. However, except for one powerful scene involving a nurse, there's no joy or happiness for anyone. That makes the movie hard to watch, but it's so powerful that it's
worth watching anyway.The movie worked well on DVD. It has an incredible IMDb rating of 8.3. (This may be the highest rated film that I've ever reviewed.) I thought it was even better than that, and rated it 10.",Incendies
22,TheMovieDiorama,Incendies explodes into a thrilling mystery-drama that tackles both family and history.,9,21 March 2019,"As a fan of Villeneuve's work, it was imperative that I experienced his earlier work. To cement the accolades and acclaim that he receives, not just by me, but the film industry. He is rapidly rising to be one of the most influential directors working today. So, Incendies. His big breakthrough before Hollywood snatched him up and blessed the world with his talent. I set myself ridiculous expectations. Quietly hoping this would be a masterpiece. And as soon as the credits rolled, sitting there in absolute silence, I gently closed my eyes. The overbearing pressure dissipated and my body was overwhelmed. This. This is cinematic gold. An undisputed classic in the making that relishes in the brutality of civil war and religious hatred. Two Canadian twins travel to their mother's home country in an attempt to uncover her hidden past, where they must find their father and long-lost brother.It's a tragic tale of love, loss and life amidst a brutal civil war, caused by the opposing ideologies of Christianity and Islam. A family who believed their mother to be mentally unstable, uncovering her shocking past at her last behest. It portrays the idea of redemption, even at death. The journey that these twins go through in the present day equals that of the harsh experiences that their mother encountered during the civil war. Villeneuve ingeniously integrates these two timelines to perfection, each separating chapter introducing a pivotal character or place. The meticulous pacing envelops you into, not just a broken country, but a broken family. We witness the flashbacks of the mother's past life, and it is savage. Honestly, the unembellished acts of violence she went through completely shook me to the core. Villeneuve does not shy away from children getting shot in the head or innocent Muslim refugees getting massacred on a bus, and it grabs you. The sheer power and ferocity of the blazing imagery takes hold. Unable to let go. Brilliantly elegant, yet audacious.The minimal amount of characterisation surprisingly works in the narrative's favour. The twins are not investable characters, and they shouldn't be. It's the mother. A screenplay with an intricate amount of depth to her character, leaving small breadcrumbs for the final revelation. And what a reveal that was! I gasped, put my hands towards my gaping mouth and widened by blood-shot eyes. Too much of a coincidence? Perhaps. But what it does do is solidify the tragic life that Nawal had the misfortune of surviving. And despite the outcome, it made her who she was til her death. A loving mother to her children. Played exceptionally by Azabal whom of which did not garner enough acclaim for her performance. She was able to show vulnerability within her stone-cold exterior, conveying the amount of loss she had experienced with just one gaze at the camera.Villeneuve's directing style, as always, is masterful. Dartonne's editing, especially splicing the two timelines, was near-perfect. The right amount of time is spent on each scene, such as the blazing bus, to conjure up an emotional connection. And Turpin's cinematography was gorgeous. The landscape shots of the war-torn unnamed middle eastern country (heavily implied to be Lebanon) were both stunning and devastating. To put it simply, Incendies is a masterclass in technical excellence. In fact, the film is a near masterpiece. A few pacing issues here and there, which could've been alleviated with a tighter runtime. However that does deter from the overall sprawling devastation that Incendies brings to our screens. It is a heart-breaking tragedy, and one of Villeneuve's best.",Incendies
23,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Mind Shattering and Heart Dissecting Masterpiece with an Unbelievable Tragedy. WOW !!!,9,1 July 2020,"Incendies (2010) :A Mind Shattering and Heart Dissecting Masterpiece with an Unbelievable Tragedy. I am shaking while writing this. Wow. Wow. Wow. What did i just saw.. Unthinkable. How could any film have such a tragedy that totally squeezed my heart and completely shattered my mind. This Canadian film teaches one of the Most Unique storytelling method in modern cinema. We have seen films with multiple plots, mostly thrillers which either open or connect all the plots at end. Incendies is not particularly that kind of film, call it a thriller if you want but this is a new Achievement in storytelling because the uniqueness is damn too high. Incendies has multiple plots involved in one narrative but unlike other films which keep storytelling either straight forward or reverse, this film introduces unique and new method where main plot runs in reverse from present to past and Sub plot runs in the reverse mode. It's Mind-Blowing. I haven't seen any film having 2 plots running in opposite directions and yet making sense with high accuracy. Incendies is a wanna be thriller but it is not. It begins with so many unanswered questions and keeps unfolding many facts subsequently but more than a thriller it is a powerful tragic tale in the climax. After watching so many top class thrillers i couldn't predict that this would happen in the climax. It was thrilling already but more shocking and heart wrenching. Acting wise every actor in the film did a great job to make this one look realistic and artistic film. Screenplay is not too slow, it has couple of flaws but those pale before excessive tragedy in the end. I haven't seen any other Denis Velleneuve film and i read so many comments that this is his best film and i cannot agree more. After watching Incendies i am eager to watch his other films because he has left such an impact on me. In short, A MASTERPIECE and A MUST WATCH !RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",Incendies
24,Vartiainen,That ending...,5,26 February 2018,"Twins, who have just recently lost their mother, travel to Middle-East to search for their father, who they've believed dead, and their brother, who they didn't even now existed. At the same time we follow their mother in her youth in the middle of a bloody, religious civil war.I don't particularly care for Denis Villeneuve as a director. His scifi films, Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival, have both been decent, with the former edging into being downright good, but his more realistic drama films have always left me feeling unclean. Too much grittiness, too nasty a tone, too much needless misery, bleakness and depression. In Villeneuve's hands the world shows itself as a grey place, where even the most decent people hide monsters within and the only justification for existing is sheer lack of choices. Not something I want to subject myself to, if given a choice.That being said, this film works pretty well. Perhaps it's the background of war, but somehow Villeneuve's usual tricks didn't bother me as much. It's perhaps a bit weird that war is the justifier for all these horrible things, but the fact still remains that while it was still horrible, it didn't feel over-excessive.Except for that ending. I saw it coming. I saw it coming a long way ahead. How, you may ask. I simply imagined to most nasty turn the film could take. The one that would make me gag. And there it was. The worst part is that it doesn't even make sense within the film. The story has to bend over backwards for these events to take place and it completely shatters the suspension of disbelief. And for what? Did Villeneuve really want for his audience to throw up that badly?Then again, the film is very well done. The first half is told phenomenally well. The characters are interesting and the horrors of war are given their just due. It's just that ending...I think I'm done with this guy. Please, no more.",Incendies
25,Turfseer,Contrived motivations and director's political bias undermine Lebanese Civil War victim's compelling tale of survival,5,20 November 2011,"Some viewers may regard the climax of 'Incendies' as the most effective part of the film, but I must wholeheartedly disagree . If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene, that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists, the passengers react confused and frightened, the bus driver is murdered, the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers, Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus, Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother, only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.With such an unforgettable iconic scene, as listed above (along with a few others, such as the 'honor killing' at the beginning of the film), why must 'Incendies' ultimately be labeled as contrived and dishonest? For starters, Villenueve only vaguely alludes to the film's main setting. We know that Nawal's journey occurs in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War but the country, along with the right wing Arab Christian party, the ""Phalangists"", are never mentioned by name. When Nawal's family members murder her lover, they refer to him as a ""refugee"" not as a ""Palestinian"". Despite stripping the events depicted in the film of their political context, Villenueve clearly cannot hide his bias. Nawal decides to become an assassin for the Muslims after her Muslim lover is murdered by her own Christian family and she's a witness to the bus massacre by Arab Christian terrorists. Only a ""kindly"" Muslim warlord (""Chamseddine"") happens to tell Narwan's son, Simon, the truth during the search for the ""son"" and the ""father"". And that truth is that the fighting is tit for tat—one reprisal begets another. Nonetheless, Villenueve still implies that it's the Muslim side who are clearly the wronged party here. By no means am I trying to defend the brutality of the right-wing nationalists during the Lebanese Civil War, but there were two sides to the story and certainly that's lost in Villenueve's narrative.As to why the film should be considered contrived, it's not so much the wacko ending which is designed to point out the horrors of war (and hence its pointlessness) but the whole idea that the mother would send her children on a wild goose chase, making them face the truth about HER situation, instead of telling them what happened on her deathbed (she was able to blurt out the main points to family friend, the Notary Lebel) or allowing Lebel to explain it to the kids without having them experience the full impact of the horror by traveling to Lebanon, dredging up old wounds amongst people who they didn't know (and didn't even speak their language). I question whether any mother would have put her children in such a position—why was she so insistent on having them learn the truth about their parentage? After all, the revelation that her son was actually her other children's father, basically drove her insane and led to her death. This from a woman who always claimed she would do anything for her children. And here they would end up in a foreign country, asking sensitive questions which could place their lives in jeopardy.While a series of chilling events, clearly molded Narwan's character, there's little character development when it comes to the son. He has that most disagreeable chip on his shoulder (until he finally bonds with his sister in the swimming pool), but for most of the film, he is an unwelcome, one-note presence. And what's with that lack of hesitation with taking a ride blind-folded with the Warlord's bodyguards? The guide's assurance that ""everything is okay"" is enough for him to take a ride with a duo of potential killers. How does he know that his guide can be so sure about the Warlord?And what about Abou Tarek (the 'son' and the 'father')? The Warlord trains him to be a crackerjack sniper but becomes disaffected by war and switches sides, ending up in the Christian Arab prison, as Narwan's torturer. Even though we hear the explanation from Chamseddine, it seems a little too convenient that Tarek so easily switches from the Muslim to the Christian Arab side with so little explanation. Of course without him doing so, there's no 'twist ending', designed to shock.I understood that the two letters which Narwan has her children deliver to Tarek reflects Narwan's ambivalence about how she feels toward him. But again, why involve the twins? How is Narwan so sure that her revelation to him that he's her son, will impact his conscience? It's already been established that he's a psychopath so I would hardly think that he would care who his mother is. For all we know, Tarek may have decided to go after the half-siblings, as they could reveal his dark secret publicly and cause him a good deal of trouble.'Incendies' manages to keep one's interest despite the main character's motivations that don't add up and the director's clear political bias. It's worth seeing but hardly deserves the accolades that have been heaped upon it since its heralded release.",Incendies

28,estebangonzalez10,"Incendies, A Modern Greek Tragedy",10,13 June 2012,"¨Death is never the end of a story. There are still traces. If you want to find your brother, you'll have to go back into your mother's past.¨Incendies is a very powerful and emotional film from Quebec director, Dennis Villeneuve, which won almost every award in Canada, several international awards for Best Foreign film and it was also nominated for an Oscar. The movie is based on Wajdi Mouawad's play and it actually plays out as sort of a Greek tragedy. It has several interesting twists; it jumps back and forth in time, and has a very emotional and shocking last twenty minutes. I really never guessed what direction the movie was going to go next as it mixed some romance, drama, and interesting thrills in ways I never imagined it too. The first half hour I have to admit I was kind of bored with the story, but as things began to intertwine and develop I was totally hooked and the final payoff was really worth those long first minutes. The story is really well told and that is perhaps what I enjoyed the most about this film more than the cinematography or the performance from the cast. The film has a very solid and well structured story that allows us to gather information little by little and figure out how all these different characters end up being connected to each other. The story sticks with you long after the film has ended, and makes you want to go back and see everything from the beginning again. I really enjoyed this film and was shocked by the end.Twins, Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon Marwan (Maxim Gaudette) are surprised to discover that they have an older brother whom they have never heard of and a surviving father who they have never seen when their dead mother leaves them the task of finding them and delivering a letter to each in her will. Simon has no intention of following her mother's wishes once he hears the news from the Notary Jean Lebel (Remy Girard) who was very close to his mother. Simon claims his mother was always absent minded and may have been a great employee for Jean, but as a mother it was a different story. Jeanne on the other hand is intrigued about finding out who her father and brother are, so she decides to travel to the Middle East and trace the steps of her mother as the past may reveal several clues as to who her mother really was. While Jeanne is in the Middle East searching for her brother and father, we have flashbacks of her mother, Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal), growing up during the dangerous civil war and fights between Christians and Muslims. She is sent away from the village where she lived in for falling for a refugee and getting pregnant. They kill him, but Nawal's grandmother spares her life and the life of her son. She sends her to live with an uncle and study, while she gives her son for adoption. Nawal promises her baby boy that she will one day come back for him, but when the civil war broke out she lost all contact with him. Jeanne begins to see how one terrible act lead to another as the horrors her mother lived through escalate. Incendies is a Canadian French production but most of the film takes place in the Middle East. I thought the actors gave a convincing performance, and they let the story be the true star of the film. Every scene is connected to another in some way or another, although you don't quite understand why some scenes were shown until the end of the film. I had to go back and rewatch some of them just to see what I had missed. There are several hints and clues that the director leaves on the way as to what the final outcome is going to be, but I really wasn't expecting the shocking finale. I like these kinds of thrillers that have convincing twists without trying to fool the viewer. If you go back and watch the scenes again you realize that everything was there and you could have made the connection long before the end. Incendies shows us how one hateful act can lead to another and only make matters worse, it also shows us how religious wars blind us and make us do things we'd never do in a million years. It will be hard to get this movie off my head and I absolutely recommend it because it's a very powerful and emotional thriller.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Incendies
29,kluseba,Probably the best drama of the last few years!,8,12 October 2010,"I decided to watch this movie because I have read many excellent critics and because this book is used in Quebec's ""cegeps"", some kind of a post-high-school, and my girlfriend talked about it with me. Indeed, I am very happy to have seen this intense movie. It is really a great and close to perfection. Even though I have even seen one or two better films this year, this movie is at least the best drama I have seen in the last five years.This movie is absolutely convincing. It has very intense images and words and has a very slow paced and sad atmosphere. The movie begins very calm but the tension raises very fast and you really feel more and more with the tragic characters. This movie makes you cry, it makes you angry, it shocks you. Once again, it is a Quebecker movie that is cut into pieces and may mix you up a little bit in the beginning. You see scenes from the present where Jeanne and Simon are first parallely looking for the truth and trying to fulfil her last will, you see scenes from the dramatic past of her mother at different stages of her life and you also see scenes from the past of her family. The movie shows not only a couple of interesting and diversified characters (played by mostly unknown and indeed extremely talented actors), but also magnificent and intense landscapes, shocking crime and war scenes and insights of a foreign culture and the clash of the generations and ideologies in the past and the present. The movie is much diversified and very intellectual.Many people were surprised by several twists and a very intense and dramatic ending. It is true that the development the movie takes is really shocking but I have seen a few things coming and wasn't that surprised in the end, but that almost does no harm to the atmosphere and tension of the movie. The movie tells in a very philosophical way about the irony of fate, peace and war, love and hate, vengeance and forgiveness, saints and sinners. It is uneasy to watch the movie and you still think about what you have heard and seen for quite a while after the movie.Almost everything is perfect in this movie. There are two minor reasons why I don't give the best note. First of all, I was somehow able to predict some of the punches at a certain point in the movie and I have already seen more intense and shocking dramas that very even more uneasy and heavier to watch than this one, for example ""The pianist"". Second, some scenes in the beginning of the movie are not done very well by the camera man. In the scene where Jeanne is in her mathematic class and when she looks for some accessories in her room, the camera is disturbingly shaking and moving all the time but not to create an effect of uneasiness, because there are no similar scenes later in the movie during way heavier scenes. Those two scenes (that would not have been complicated to produce or film again) are just not well done and the director should have seen and corrected that before sending the final product to the festivals and cinemas. In a perfect and intense masterpiece, this little detail is really something that could harm the reputation and professionalism of the whole brilliant work. The next time, they should be more concentrated on the movie's perfection and keep their eyes open or invest the money in a good camera director instead of some war scenes.But all in all, I think that we can really talk about an extremely good movie here! It is surely worth watching it and I agree with those ones who would like to see this movie represent Canada at the Oscars.",Incendies

""Incendies"" (or ""Scorched"" in English) is from Canada, with the dialog mainly in French and several Middle Eastern languages. I am thankful that this movie got that Oscar nomination, or else I would have missed a very well-plotted and executed dramatic film.This movie starts very slowly with the reading of a very strange will. Upon her death, a mother instructs her twin children to deliver mysterious two mysterious letters to their father and a brother they never knew. Only upon accomplishment of this request will she allow a tombstone with her name engraved to be placed on top of her grave. This quest brings the twins Jeanne and Simon out of the comforts of Montreal, Canada into the harsher world of Lebanon as they discover the intricately tragic life their mother had.Despite the slow pace, the story is very compelling as the story shifts from the present into the past and back following the life of Nawal Marwan, and her children's quest. You will intently follow the progression of the story as facts unfold piece by piece until the jaw- dropping major revelations towards the end. The Director handles the story with much control such that the audience's interest and attention are held to the very end. This story was told in the best possible way.An excellent film!

It's as if there is a aeroplane circling overhead, with each circle pulling back a curtain over time, and on each circle dropping yet another bombshell on the viewer. Wonderful cinematography, rich colour, many panoramic vistas of the Middle-East, for this alone the film has power. As the tale swept over me during it's length I could see the honourable statements the filmmakers were making about war. I took a point off for the ending, which, for me, strayed off message and was one bombshell too many. It did explain the two parallel stories however, so, alas, I am forced to take another point off the score for that as well.

34,jadepietro,Imagine When 1 + 1 Doesn't Equal 2,7,25 June 2011,"This film is recommended.  Imagine there's no countries, It isn't hard to do, Nothing to kill or  die for, And no religion too.  -Lyrics from John Lennon's Imagine   Religion has always been a unifying and emotional force to some and a  polarizing and divisive one to others. It has shaped and guided our  world with the holiest of words and actions and also destroyed and  misled many under the philosophical guise of good and godliness. It has  provided insight and strength to one group while blinding and weakening  another with overt powers over its most devout believers. This dualism  is ever present in the thought-provoking Oscar nominated foreign film,  Incendies, directed by Denis Villeneuve. We are forced to examine the  far-reaching effect of religion and its aftereffects in its tale of two  siblings who begin a spiritual journey to fulfill their mother's last  wishes.  The plot involves a twin brother and sister who are forced to confront  their mother's past deeds and secretive life. Jeanne and Simon (  Melissa Desormeaux and Maxim Gaudette ) are given two letters from  their dead mother, Newal ( Lubna Azabal ). They are asked to locate  their brother who they never knew had existed and deliver an envelope  to him and also find their lost father. This request takes Jeanne to a  Middle Eastern country as she tries to unravel the mystery while Simon  looks elsewhere.  Told in flashback, mostly from Newal's point of view, we learn about  her unknown past and her loves. Just as Jeanne and Simon unravel the  threads of her lifestory, we discover the impact that politics and  religion formed upon her mother and Newal's ultimate choices that led  her to a violent conflicted existence.   The film takes its bleak depressing subject matter and immerses itself  directly into the world of civil wars, martyrs, violence, and religious  zealots. Director Villeneuve successfully shows this clash of cultures  between Christians and Muslims and the consequences of hatred and  pointless bloodshed throughout the years. However, he weakens his own  film by allowing some scenes to go on too long, causing less tension  and suspense with his narrative. With his cumbersome flashback  structure, he also divulges key evidence in the ongoing investigation  to the movie audience before his present day characters can unravel the  intricacies of the mystery itself. ( I, for one, figured out the  supposedly shocking climax with a half hour left before the film's end  credits appeared. )  Still, the film contains powerful images, mostly when dealing with the  film's violent nature ( a bus and its passengers set afire, close-ups  of battered and bruised legs of political prisoners, a frightened child  cold-bloodedly shot as she tries to flee for safety ) and strong  performances by its cast, especially Lubna Azabel as the sad and  tortured woman whose death begins this tale.  Incendies presents both worlds with a haunting clarity, one steeped in  traditions and servitude and another trying to break free of its bonds.  This is serious and fearless filmmaking that leaves one feeling moved  and helpless at the same time. The moviegoer leaves the theater hoping  the world will live as one, even if the equation can never be solved.  GRADE: B",Incendies
35,pc95,Very Good Until Becoming Too Contrived,6,8 October 2011,"""Incendies"" is one of these movies that really disappoints - The ones that for a good portion of the movie are highly enthralling, but then comes crashing down. (Major Spoiler) I had an inkling that the filmmakers might pull what they ended up trying to smear on the viewer, and it was so, so disappointing. Suffice it to say to twist the plot around and pretzel it like they did, the filmmakers stooped to utter contrivance. They blew up logic and believability for the sake of sensationalism. How probable could all of this actually take place in such a sequence (?), quite improbable. Additionally I had a hard time understanding what exactly transformed the mother into a killer(?) The ending became marginal and a continuation of the contrivance. Too bad - it had a great story going up until the last quarter of it's run-time.",Incendies

As is common in many French based films, there are long periods of silence, deep intense staring and fellow actors and a lot of shouting that is intended to pass for good acting. I cannot believe the high ratings it got here and wish to inject a dose of much needed realism here. It's pretty horrible and not worth the effort to watch.",Incendies

Nawal's will makes reference to not keeping a promise, denying her a proper gravestone and casket, unless Jeanne and Simon track down their mysterious brother, whose existence they were previously unaware of, and their father, whom they believed was dead.A series of flashbacks reveal Nawal came from a Christian Arab family in an unnamed Middle Eastern country, and that she fell in love with a Palestinian refugee, resulting in her pregnancy. Her family murders her lover and nearly shoots her as an honour killing, but her grandmother spares her, tattoos the baby and abandons him, and sends Nawal to the fictional city of Daresh. While at school, a civil war and war crimes break out as Christian nationalists attack Muslims and refugees, with Nawal opposing the war on human rights grounds. Her son's orphanage in Kfar Khout is destroyed by the nationalists, and unknown to her, her son has been rescued by a Muslim warlord, Chamseddine, who converts him into an Islamic child soldier. Seeking revenge for the loss of her son, Nawal joins the Muslim fighters and shoots a nationalist leader. Afterwards, she is imprisoned in Kfar Ryat and raped by torturer Abou Tareq. She consequently gives birth to the twins.",Incendies

40,meddlecore,A Brilliantly Constructed Dark & Disturbing Mystery,10,29 September 2011,"Denis Villeneuve's ""Incendies""- an adaptation of Wajdi Mouawad's play ""Scorched""- is a film about a soul being put to rest.This dark mystery is a disturbing, yet moving, tale of a mother, Narwal Marwan (Lubna Azabal); her twin son- Simon aka Sarwan (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter- Jeanne aka Janaan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin). After their mother's death, the two siblings are sent to Lebanon where they are to investigate their mother's past- her final wishes. As the plot of the film unravels, flashbacks from the past are cinematically woven together with images from the Twins' modern day investigation, in a non-linear fashion.The film begins with the reckoning and death of Narwal, after which her twin children are called before the trusted notary Jean Libel (Rémy Girard)- whom Narwal had worked under for many years prior to her death- for the reading of her will. Each of the siblings is given a letter and left with a task that must be accomplished before their mother will allow them to mark her grave with a stone and any sort of recognition.Simon is dealt the task of tracking down their brother. While Jeanne- a mathematician who works on unsolvable equations and the realization of the woman her mother was meant to be- is entrusted with the task of tracking down their father. Both of whom are thought to be back in Lebanon- the country that their mother had emigrated from. While Simon first thinks his mother had gone insane, Jeanne- intrigued by the impossibility of the task at hand- heads off to Lebanon to see what she can find out; possessing only two names and an old photograph.As Jeanne's investigation progresses, we are shown flashbacks from Narwal's life in Lebanon before she had come to Canada. These flashbacks provide us with information prior to the Twins becoming privy to it, and as such, allow us to put the mystery together one step ahead of them. Although, Villeneuve does cleverly try and throw us off by having Jeanne ""put things together"" wrong in the first half of the film...by which I mean how she thinks Wahab is their father and Abou Tarek the father of their brother (when we know this clearly cannot be the case).As Jeanne is joined by her brother, it becomes evident that the quest they have been sent on is not only a journey to discover the truth about who their mother really was; but also one of self-discovery- as they soon realize they are exposing the truth about their own story as well. The ultimate closure the siblings could achieve for their mother; and their mother for themselves.The Twins reveal how their mother was a Christian woman living in a Lebanon during a time in which tensions between the Muslim and Christian Nationalist communities were becoming increasingly strained and violent. They discover how she had fallen in love and become pregnant by a Muslim man- bringing disgrace to her ultra-Nationalist family; and how she was forced to give up her child- their brother; only to dedicate the rest of her life to tracking him down.As the two delve deeper into Lebanon and the truth we discover more and more about the hardships their mother had to endure. How, after being run out of town by her family, she set out to find the orphanage her son had been sent to- only to find it had been razed by the local warlord.What happens next (in combination with the conclusion) gives the film it's title.In order to continue the search for her son, Narwal needed to get to the town of Daressa. To manage this she was required to disguise herself as an Islamic woman and catch a bus that was bringing a group of Muslim passengers into the town. Before they were able to reach their destination, though, the bus is stopped at a checkpoint by a group of armed Christian Nationalists who inexplicably pepper the bus with bullets- killing most of the passengers.Narwal manages to survive alongside a woman and her daughter, but when the men start to cover the bus in gasoline...she has no other choice but to reveal herself to be a Christian. The men spare her life, but force her to watch a horrific massacre unfold- which includes the woman being burned alive and her young daughter being shot down in cold blood right before her eyes.Ashamed by the actions of her people, and greatly traumatized by the events she just experienced, Narwal gives up the search for her lost son and joins the Muslim revolt- agreeing to assassinate the leader of the Christian Nationalists.Her children discover that she not only successfully assassinated the man; but was also arrested, imprisoned and tortured- which included being raped repeatedly- for 15 years in one of the Country's most infamous prisons. During which she became known as ""The Woman Who Sings"".As the Twins wrap up their investigation and get to the bottom of the story they were sent to expose, they are hit with a series of disturbing revelations about their mother; lost brother; father; and even themselves. I love how Villeneuve foreshadows this prior to revealing it cryptically in the ""how can 1+1=1"" scene; then explaining it more concretely in the film's conclusion.With ""Incendies"", Villeneuve has brought us a brilliantly constructed dark and disturbing mystery that allows us as the viewers to be the sleuth- which is half the fun! A wonderfully shot film with lots of stationary shots from a distance that possess a sort of Haneke vibe. The entire cast does an excellent job, but Belgian actress Lubna Azabal really steals the show. And on top of all this it's a Canadian film! A Must See. 10 out of 10.",Incendies
41,cultfilmfan,Incendies,10,10 February 2011,"Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.",Incendies

43,gelman@attglobal.net,Just Short of Perfect,9,15 July 2012,"Were it not for the fact that the plot is tied in too neat a bow at the very end, ""Incendies"" would be a perfect movie. Told in both the present and the past, the film traces the efforts of twins, Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette) to carry out the wish of their dead mother (Lubna Araval) to find and deliver letters to their father and lost brother. The twins go to Lebanon -- Jeanne with conviction, Simon reluctantly. They don't quite know where to begin. The brother, their mother's illegitimate son, was sent to an orphanage. That much is quickly established. But from there on, the film follows the search and also plays back the events in the Lebanese Civil War which separated their mother from her child and from the father or the twins. Once the search was fully under way, this viewer was initially bit confused as to which parts were present and which parts were past because Ms. Desormeaux-Poulin looks at times much like Ms. Araval, so I didn't always know whether I was witnessing the search by the daughter or the war time travails of the mother. It's a minor problem because, soon enough, the two elements -- the search and the war -- diverge and the context identifies daughter and mother. The two women each handle their roles superbly. Simon is a necessary player but M. Gaudette is no more than adequate in the role, which is, in any event, subsidiary to that of mother and daughter.I won't reveal the ending. However, the war time scenes are depicted with convincing brutality, and the indifference to suffering that characterized the Lebanese Civil War is as appalling on film as it might have been if one had actually been there when it happened. In addition, the cameras are focused on the bleak landscape outside the villages and towns, which adds to the sense that this is as close to real life as it is possible to get.As suggested in the beginning of this review, I found the ending too pat and much too convenient, but it is certainly dramatic -- and others may find it more convincing than I did.",Incendies

Throughout the runtime, the plot switched back and forth between the past of the mother and the present where the twins tried to learn about their mother. The flashbacks had some brutal scenes. Denis Villenueve, with the great direction of cinematography, showed the harshness and devastation of the land because of the civil war. The raw and a bit low in quality camera enhanced this harsh atmosphere even more. One of the harshest scenes was the one with the bus. There was no need for any background music to see how unforgiving and brutal the scene and the movie as a whole was.I would be lying when I said that I was hooked through the whole movie. It was slow and took time to have the characters explored their mother's past. It was a bit dragged for me.When the twist hit, I initially refused to believe what I had in mind.

45,Blue-Grotto,Tenth anniversary!,10,21 September 2020,"It is a rare person who understands themselves fully. Few people even try to understand. So when it comes to knowing others deeply, even those close to us, the task is nearly impossible. Incendies delves into this seemingly hopeless undertaking.Upon the death of their unusual and troubled mother, Nawal, twins Jeanne and Simon are given surprising and difficult assignments under her will; tracking down a father they thought was dead, finding a brother they never knew they had, and delivering mysterious letters from their mom to each of them. The journey begins in Lebanon where Nawal's footsteps are retraced. Shocking revelations are revealed about Nawal including; forbidden love, an honor killing, a stolen baby, violent militias, refugees, prison, torture, massacres, assassination and more. The twins discover a country caught in a chain of anger from which it struggles to free itself. Within the conflagrations are keys to understanding their mom, their family, and themselves.Incendies is a deeply moving and explosive (literally and figuratively) glimpse into the heart of Lebanon and human nature. It is my second favorite film of all time. Scenes are raw and jolting, and none more so than the final revelation. This is part of Villeneuve's genius; the surprising scenes that come without the usual preludes (the revealing music like in Jaws, the intuitive responses, and obvious build-ups). He suddenly cuts through sense and emotion simultaneously. Boom! Through flashbacks and ambient sound contrasted with eerie Radiohead tracks, Villeneuve crafts something unique and thrilling. Lubna Azabal (Nawal) is perfect for the part. Incendies is based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad and filmed in Jordan and Quebec. I love Incendies mostly because it carries a profound and urgently needed message about how we judge and diminish other people and cultures, and how we can otherwise lift them up through sympathy, understanding and mercy.",Incendies
46,SquigglyCrunch,Fantastic,9,3 November 2015,"I was super excited to see Incendies after watching Denis Villeneuve's latest film, Sicario, and I was not disappointed, despite how different both movies are. The plot is simple yet compelling. The way it's presented, with flashbacks to the mother's life and then switching back to Jeanne on her journey is a really cool way to do it. Although I got confused a few times at the beginning as to whether we were watching a flashback or not, I caught on very quickly. Sure, it's a little slow for the first bit, but as you get further and further in it gets a whole lot more interesting. The characters are pretty well-developed, with the audience knowing exactly what they're like from the get-go. There isn't a whole lot of depth to them, but there's enough to keep you interested. Incendies is, similarly to Sicario, brutal. Villeneuve does not hold back, which is something I admire about him. He's willing to show what other movies are unwilling to. It made the movie feel much more real, despite the fact that there were yellow subtitles across the bottom of the screen. Overall Incendies is nothing short of amazing. The plot is intriguing, the characters are solid, and it's brutality makes it much more immersive. To me one scene can make or break a movie, and this is a perfect example of when one scene made the movie. If your interested, then give it a watch, it's great. If you didn't like it, then that's really too bad. Your missing out on something great. I personally would highly recommend you check this out, it's well- worth your time.",Incendies
47,christophe92300,Badly structured + improbable outcome,4,29 December 2013,"The story dreadfully drags on for a good hour at a false rhythm favourable to boredom, the plot then accelerates in the last 35-40 minutes, but unfortunately this regain of interest is completely annihilated by the highly improbable aspect of the outcome.The narrative structure therefore turns out very blurry and this feeling is emphasized by a very confused editing alternating past and present, for example you get the mother and the daughter mixed up, especially at the beginning, because they resemble too much, and the temporal referential isn't very clear so you never now which period it is or how much time has passed.Moreover, and more importantly, nothing is explained regarding the historical context in Lebanon during the 70's, we're offered raw data that isn't supported and unless you're aware of this civil war episode, the movie tells nothing on that subject even though it occupies a primordial place in the story.Therefore, it's hard to understand the enthusiasm for Incendies and the raving critics it arouse since the content is so weak and hardly compensated by a rather catchy photography and seamless direction.",Incendies

49,andrewroy-04316,"The build is tense and well crafted, but the twist is more shock value than adding depth to the story",7,7 September 2019,"There's no doubting Villeneuve's skill in building tension and emotional stakes through his characters and shots. While it's in a very different way, like in Enemy the shocking twist ending doesn't really add to the story and feels forced. The difference is while in Enemy the ending was insane and left the meaning and plot completely up in the air, in Incendies what happened is entirely clear and just isn't that satisfying. The most cogent point Villeneuve makes in the film is how the atrocities of war can shape people and turn them into monsters. The alternation between the past and present put into focus how war can ravage a region and a family for decades and was very effective in gradually unspooling the plot threads. The performances were all very good, particularly those playing Nawal and her daughter.Now, let's talk about that twist: that Nihad, her first son, is the man who raped her while in prison and fathered the twins. Undoubtedly, it was completely unexpected. It's a pretty crazy coincidence that he was the person assigned to torture her prison and that he chooses to rape her. Putting that aside, the real problem is that it doesn't add depth or explain anything about the characters or in the plot. There are no genetic problems the kids have that are explained by the incest, and there was no reason for Nawal to expect that he was anything more than a random torturer - there was no inherent connection in their roles. This doesn't make the twist bad or illegitimate, but also doesn't make it particularly impactful, and given the intense build up to that discovery, it was a letdown. Love the cinematography, love the direction, but nothing more than a good, well-crafted movie with a forgettable ending.",Incendies
50,MikeyB1793,Intriguing,8,23 February 2011,"This is a very intriguing story. Most of it takes place in war-torn Lebanon.The plot concerns the will of a mother for her twin children – a boy and girl - both raised in Montreal. They must return to Lebanon to fulfill this will and in so doing, they unravel parts of their family past they were never aware of. The story weaves back and forth between the life of the mother growing up in her native country and the daughter during her first sojourn to Lebanon. It was somewhat difficult for me, at times, to distinguish between mother and daughter in these alternating scenes.This is a film that does require close attention. It starts off rather hesitantly in Montreal and slowly develops into a full-fledged story with many rewards. But there are excruciating scenes – not a film for young children. One very potent scene is when the daughter returns to the village of her mother. The village women, upon finding out her identity, refuse any further communication with her. This sets the stage for the many layers of the puzzle needing to be resolved. And there is resolution at the end.All and all a most worthwhile experience.",Incendies

52,JakeBrinkman,Defined by its *spoiler*,6,29 October 2019,"Massive spoilers in this review!Unfortunately this movie is only mildly interesting, carried by excellent acting from Azabal (Nawal). That is, until the final reveal. But once that hits, it's a sucker punch to the gut that makes sure to leave your stomach churning. There's a Korean film with a very similar major reveal; I'll call it KF avoid spoilers for those who haven't seen that one.Thanks to the one similarity, it's impossible to not draw comparisons between Incendies and KF. The reveals for both movies hit me the same way. However, when I first saw KF, I wished a better story had been crafted around the reveal. Not that it was a bad story, but it was incredibly unrealistic. Now that I've seen the more realistic version in Incendies, my wish has been satisfied, though I certainly can't say it was a pleasant experience.On the other hand, KF was more emotionally satisfying. In Incendies, every time a reveal (major or minor) happened, it cut away to a completely different scene. It actually made me think the two siblings must have had poor actors. It seemed as if the director was almost ashamed to show them acting emotional, even when it was more than appropriate to do so. KF actually allowed the characters to express their emotions on screen, and it made a much more powerful impression.As a minor point, the siblings don't look very much like either of their parents or each other. If the director was already making it so they didn't have to seriously act, he could have at least made them look the part.Between Incendies and KF, I think Incendies is the better film thanks to its grounded realism. Despite this, Incendies falls short of greatness by drastically pulling its punches in every emotional scene.",Incendies
53,bbewnylorac,Great film,9,10 March 2013,"One achievement of this excellent film is that it makes you think about war. It makes you think that many people who migrate to the West have complicated personal stories that influence their lives today. And that what we see on the TV news is a woefully inadequate representation of the actual human impact of war. The intelligent woman at the centre of the film had the bad luck to have been born into a brutal, inhuman time in history, even into a brutal family, and she tries her best to survive. You've got to empathise with her on some level. The film has many twists and turns in its plot, and even as I left the cinema I wasn't sure I'd understood which side she was on at a particular time and why she responded as she did. It made me want to know more about Lebanese history. It's a beautifully made film and well recommended.",Incendies
54,rgcustomer,"A slow, but good film of family secrets",8,4 November 2010,"Incendies (Babelfish tells me this means Fires) is good, but a bit formulaic. It aims very high, but I think it falls short of what it could have achieved. I think it spends too much effort on atmosphere and not enough on plot. Maybe tighter editing was needed. Still, I was impressed, and it's undoubtedly one of the better Canadian films, improving on Polytechnique.Early on, there is the reading of a will, and twins are left with the tasks of locating their unknown father and brother.This takes them to ... somewhere in Palestine, which I took to be within Israel. Other reviews have noted this is supposed to be Lebanon, but looks like Jordan. I have no idea. People familiar with the history of the area seem to think that certain facts of the film mean it could not have been in any particular country in the Mid-East, because the places and dates make it impossible. But because the film never claims to be a true story (or I never saw such a claim) I'll forgive it. Still, it would have been more satisfying if it could have been set in a real place and time.From there, the film follows an almost mathematical formula, which itself is an enjoyable mini-theme of the film. One part of the math was ruined by the English subtitles. Euler's (ridiculous) quote actually was ""... (a+b^n)/n=x, hence God exists ..."", which I think was presented on screen as ""... ©, hence God exists..."". I can't tell which version is closer to what was spoken by the character, but I doubt the word ""copyright"" was used. The original quote strikes me as typical of the obfuscation and confusion used to con people into accepting various beliefs. It's nice to see that referenced in this film, particularly given what happens. It's a rare, believable, and complex representation of all-too-common religious violence.I found the film painfully slow at times. While this did serve to accentuate certain scenes which were very effective as a result, halfway through the film I wasn't sure I wanted to watch the rest of it. If I had been at home, I may have turned it off, and I would have missed a good film.I was impressed by the acting, which is to say that I didn't notice it at all. I believed the characters completely. Also, I found the use of sound helped to draw the audience into the story. The silence is silent. Noise is noisy, but in a real way, not Hollywood.I will only half-spoil the ending. For those who don't guess it, they do tell you what's coming, just before it happens. I'll hint at it here, so consider yourself warned.There is a particular question raised by one character, regarding what ""1+1"" equals. This can legitimately be interpreted (in electronics) as an inclusive disjunction rather than addition, giving a correct answer that is not 2. Some might see this as a trick, but I think the film is emphasizing that we should be careful about our assumptions and interpretations.",Incendies
55,avik-basu1889,Brilliantly directed portrayal of life in times of chaos marred by a flashy climax !!!,7,24 October 2015,"'Incendies' is a film directed by Denis Villeneuve and it is adapted from Wajdi Mouawad's play of the same name with the screenplay co- written by Villeneuve and Valérie Beaugrand-Champagne. The film's plot has an epic-feel to it because the film takes place over a lengthy spell of time covering a large number of years. The film stars Lubna Azabal as Nawal Marwan and Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette as Nawal's twin children Jeanne and Simon respectively. After Nawal's death, Jeanne and Simon get informed that their mother had left two letters one for each of them respectively. They learn that their father is alive and they have a brother whose existence they were unaware of. Jeanne is supposed to deliver her letter to the father, while Simon is supposed to deliver his letter to their brother. This mission takes both of them individually to an unnamed Middle-Eastern country as they try to piece together clues to gather more and more information about their mother's past.This is a film that becomes very tough to watch at times. Villeneuve really goes for a gritty, stripped down depiction of what it is like to survive in a country divided by hate and experiencing civil war. The film is brilliantly directed and Villeneuve's brutal guerrilla style of shooting reminded me Alfonso Cuarón's style in 'Children of Men'. The themes of the film range from the absurdity of hatred borne out of religious diversity to elements of immigration. It shows the sorry state of the lives of children in countries and regions devastated by war. Their lives pretty much end before they even begin. The film also underlines the concept of showing people living is financially well off countries, the privilege that they sometimes forget to acknowledge. The acting is brilliant from the main players, but a special mention has to be given to Lubna Azabal. A fair portion of the narrative of the film rests on her shoulders. The screenplay is cleverly written. The film doesn't give you all the information all at once. The expositions happen gradually. The narrative shifts from mother to daughter constantly in a very Godfather II-esque manner.I would have probably given this film a 9, had it not been for the ending. The shocking revelation at the end is genuinely unexpected and has an impact while you're watching the film. But once you start to think about it, it becomes very difficult to buy it. To some extent it might be meaningful from a thematic standpoint, but in a film directed in such an aggressively realistic manner, even symbolism has to have some literal believability in the context of the plot.'Incendies' is a well directed, well acted film about war, hatred, intolerance and the hardships of living in ultra-conservative and unstable societies. The film will have an impact and make you ponder about life itself. But the ending of the film in my eyes hinders it from making the transition from good to great.",Incendies

It is difficult to agree with the mother's motivation setting. True love is silence and commitment, swallowing and digesting alone. It is my suffering that is settled and cut off by me today. I will never force a pair of children to embark on the journey of inheriting pain and cocoon. If the director tells his mother to hide the truth, and passes away with a secret, and the children actively pursue the answer, the ending will be even more shocking.",Incendies

58,Rockwell_Cronenberg,A solid premise with a dreadful structure.,5,24 December 2011,"Incendies was a mixed bag, but I felt like it's negative aspects really bore down on it's positive ones. On the solid side of things, Denis Villeneuve has a real knack for storytelling and an eye for imagery that is truly gorgeous. Some of the shots here dug deep into my brain, be them haunting or beautiful, they managed to elicit a strong reaction from me.The premise of the story is quite an intriguing one -- upon their mother's death, two twins discovery their father is alive and they have a brother they never knew and then set upon a quest to reveal the truth, and in casting the leads I don't think they could have found more skilled actresses than Lubna Azabal and Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin for the job. These women are a rarity in modern cinema; strong and fierce, fully stood in their beliefs and decisions. It's powerful to see such strong women and the actresses portray them with just that level of gusto and perseverance that is required.Where it falls apart though is it's structure. Incendies is another of the many dozen films this year that employ a split-time narrative structure and it's yet another example of how to do it improperly. The sections (detailing the twins journey for the truth against the mother's past and her own journey) never feel like they mesh well and it ends up feeling like two completely separate films. At first it wasn't so bad, but as the film progressed the space between these two grew further and further apart.The last act is where it really derails, as in the present day there are huge discoveries made that we already knew so they lack the sense of emotional catharsis that the characters receive and in the past we see events that the characters already know about so it just becomes a retelling of things we are already aware of. The final act is this bizarrely awkward display of throwing everything at the audience in quick succession, so out of place from a film that had been slowly building up until that point. It felt as though they didn't want it to end up being three hours long so they threw together half a film's worth of information into half an hour. It ends up feeling very awkward and disjointed and completely lost me by the time the credits rolled.",Incendies

60,jackasstrange,Involving Psychological Thriller,8,8 December 2013,"This film is widely considered one of the best films that came out in 2010, and rightfully deserves this acclaim. The story starts pretty simple: two brothers needs to enter in a quest on the birth-land of their deceased mother in order to follow her last wish: to find and give two letters for their 'lost' son. It sounds very simple and generic, but while the story is advancing the film really starts to involve you into Nawal's story, that is told in flashbacks. So i don't need to say that the development of the characters is very good.As i was saying, her life is told by flashbacks. The editing don't makes very clear in the beginning of the film what was happening at all, but soon we start to get a notion of which story is Nawal's story and then, as i also already said, gt involved by the story. And while we follow Nawal's story, we are also following a world of pure horror and cruelty, which may upset some viewers, but again, some of these cruelties depicted are essential to our understand of the story, and also to establish a compromise with the viewer.This film is not for everyone though, it has some blatantly critics to the Christianity's followers, so be aware of that fact before watching the film if you are one of these persons that become easily offended by that kind of stuff. Just a warning.The cinematography in this film is very beautiful at times, it is totally done using only digital cameras. I also liked the homage to the French New Wave's films, whose directors used lots of cuts of a same scene but in different angles in the only purpose of mock the 'Hollywood Blockbusters' kind of cinematography.And i also find the music score to be very interesting.Anyways, it's a must watch film. And the so-called ending wasn't so powerful to me, but that's just me. I have already watched a couple films with similar powerful ending, so this one wasn't that much of a 'shock' for me.. 8.4/10Although, is far from being perfect. It has a few events that are just forced upon the viewer, and that is not cool.",Incendies
61,zeekwunlau,"The story begins with ""evil"" in human nature",8,4 May 2020,"The film started in a country where people with different beliefs led to wars in different schools. Muslims and Christianity. The protagonist was not spared to be involved in this tragedy. The story began when he had an affair with a man from another denomination, which in the eyes of the whole village was a serious shame and his family killed In addition to her lover, his brother even wanted to kill his sister. The fanatical religious genre, the faith is firm and terrible. The genre and the genre began to fight each other, and the tragedy began when the heroine gave birth to her first son.The hostess was imprisoned for assassinating the right Christian leader. In prison, she suffered severe torture and regained her hope of life through her singing. In an abused experience, he was asked by a famous interrogator. I do n't remember the specific name. The hostess was raped. She became pregnant and gave birth to twins in prison, that is, twins who are now looking for father and brother.The daughter of the hostess learned about this in the process of searching for her father and brother. Due to the mental pressure, he found his younger brother and looked for it with her. In the process of searching for his brother, he learned that it was his brother who raped his mother, and the father of the twins was also the father who raped his mother.At the end of the film, the twins gave their mother's relics to their brother and their father. The mother also forgiven his elder son in the end.At the end of the film, the hostess 's eldest son looked down at his mother 's grave with his hands down, just like the subtitles originally shown in the film, his heart was already burning.This tragedy occurred because of different beliefs, and this is the fate of the people of the times. Humans who could have lived with peace of mind, because of endless disputes and endless conflicts, dragged alive people into the dark vortex.To make a digression, just like the recent epidemic, the relations between countries are complicated and complex, and countries are like people. There was a cold war or a hot war in the country, which was equivalent to the indifference and fight between people. From a higher perspective, this behavior of human beings is extremely naive, and people can be friendly and complete. But the ""evil"" in people's hearts has caused this kind of tragedy to repeat itself until mankind produces higher wisdom!",Incendies
62,Meven_Stoffat,"A lovely looking and acted film, in desperate need of a script",3,29 July 2011,"Forgive me for being the on person who stood out among the crowd here, but by God I really can't see how this has an 8.2 rating here on IMDb. Now I can see that this would be loved to death by those who only watch ""film"" and not movies, but come on, folks. I do like Denis Villanueve... Or at least I did. I saw his movie Polytechnique and I loved it. It was brutal, uncompromising yet very heartfelt and uplifting. I loved the black and white cinematography, as well as the feeling of being caught in the middle of the shooting. His filmmaking is just lovely in that film. So with hi expectations already in place, I was hoping this would do the good deed.Alright, from a filmmaking standpoint, as in cinematography and all that jazz, the movie is amazing. If I could give the movie a 10 for that alone, I so would. With all the gorgeous scenery and what not, this film really is pleasing to the eye. And the soundtrack is fantastic too, with ""You and whose Army"" by Radiohead over the opening scene- I LOVED that! And the acting is really brilliant, Maxim Gaudette and the female lead both did very great together.But how shallow was this film.The biggest problem is its characterization. Characters go a long way in a film for me, and believe me I wanted to feel for the mother and her children. I'll admit they did quite well with the mother, and the scenes with the flashbacks to her past were very intriguing. But them we went to present day with the kids, and the daughter in her mother's homeland, and suddenly the film goes all to naught because the children are SO DAMNED UNINTERESTING. In fact I don't remember a thing about the son because he was in the movie for like, literally, 5 minutes. Another problem is the script... If there even is one.. The movie feels like Villanueve dropped the script one day, then picked it up and instead of putting the pages in the right order, went ""Ah, never mind, shoot it like this!"" The dialogue is so wooden and hokey, that at times I fell on the ground laughing at the implausibility. In fact scene. After scene, I was scratching my head because the scenes have no meaning. And don't get me started on the twist with the third child, when that came, I asked myself ""was this some bad joke the cast and crew had going on throughout the shoot?""I wish I could jump on the bandwagon like a lot of us here have, but the movie is so dire, tired and dull. And furthermore it's 30 minutes too long too. This is a 90 minute or even a 100 minute movie stretched to 2 hours and 10 minutes. It did not need to be that long.OVERALL: 3/10Pros: A very beautifully shot movie, with great acting and soundtrack.Cons: The film is otherwise very shallow, with an almost zero level script, bad pacing, and dull and shallow characters.",Incendies
63,Rendanlovell,Beautifully haunting.,10,14 December 2015,"'Incendies' is the film that put director Denis Villeneuve on the map. Now, with 'Prisoners', 'Enemy', and 'Sicario' under his belt Villeneuve has become one the more eye catching directors working today. Just like his other films 'Incendies' strings together a cobweb like story. We watch as a pair of twins venture out to the middle east in search of their father and brother, as a final wish of their recently departed mother. Although the film is more about these twins finding out who their mother was. Naturally this not all that the film is about but, to avoid heavy spoilers and to keep this film as the experience it should be, I will leave it at that.And this film is an experience. Even though the film runs at a fairly long two hour and twenty minute run time, what 'Incendies' accomplishes in that time is remarkable. It is able to draw you in and hold your attention for its entire run time. Its story is unlike anything you will ever see. It's a slow burning thriller that hits every beat that you'd expect and every beat that you don't expect. And it does it in such a way that everything feels completely natural and progressive. The control that Villeneuve has over the film is insane. Every single person involved in front and behind of the camera does a superb job. Villeneuve knows what he wants out of the film and gets exactly that.It's a beautiful film that is able to manipulate its audience with utter ease. Its not just a beautifully constructed film but a beautiful film to look at too. It may not be Roger Deakins who shot 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' but 'Incendies' seems to take note of this gritty realistic look. And it employs this same style here. And just like his other films 'Incendies' has an ending that will knock you flat. This ending would not be near as effective if where in anyone else's hands. It cuts between flashbacks and reality in such a way that keeps the film from becoming predictable. So, when the film concludes it comes as a complete shock. I could go on and on about how miraculous this film is. But I think I should just leave it here. If you have any desire at all to see this film please go out and purchase it. If you do, I assure you that 'Incendies' is a film that you will never forget. It's a beautifully constructed film with enough style to keep just about any body interested.",Incendies
64,christian94,Buy the Blu-Ray; Thank Me Another Day,9,4 October 2011,"Having received rave reviews and been familiar with the quality of Denis Villeneuve's work, especially in Polytechnique, I did what I do rarely and bought this without having seen it previously. I was not disappointed in the least.War. Death. The story starts strong and will bring you to a voyage in space, time, thought and emotion along with the characters. The writing, directing, editing and cinematography are outstanding. The acting is rather natural and from the gut. Many scenes feel so real and personal. At times you may feel dirty as a urinal. This is not a feel good movie. This is a hard movie that deserves to be seen. It beautifully explores the ugliness of war. It shows that intolerance, hate and bigotry passed down by generations and cultural conditioning are hindering our quality of life and depriving as of true respect & dignity in our dim human condition. This is true everywhere, even in Canada where the quality of life, physical security and cultural openness are arguably among the very best in the world.The story's backdrop balances between realities of peace, education and prosperity and plunges us through the chaos of rejection, violence, fear and family feud in search of redemption and truth. We see a nondescript Arab country with a Christian minority's imprint on its people. We are reminded of recent or ongoing similar situations in the Middle East and Africa, but also in Europe and Asia in the not so distant past. Yugoslavia, Cambodia, etc. Discrimination, children army, murders, massacres,etc. The best humankind has to offer or so it seems...This story goes there, dark, deep, dangerously borderline depressing, yet with a unflinching conviction that telling the tale and finding the truth may not actually liberate, but may allow us to get it straight. Perhaps to finally get it right.There are many symbols and silent unsaid commentaries in the movie, but the narrative also speak volumes in many ways. The reflection is real and relevant. How can we live and leave a better future for our children? How can we brake the destructive and devastating cycle of war and hate?As if the movie was not enough, we are also privy to Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette's stunning making-of documentary :Se souvenir des cendres - Regards sur Incendies http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1756720/ which takes a life of its own with revealing interviews,crisp cinematography, eloquent editing, poetic vision and spellbinding storytelling.

Well, no. There is a 'twist' in the story that you could say is cleverly written, it does not make up for the other defects of the film. It's slow, with the character going though to motions of their 'discovery', but none of that makes for interesting scenes. I didn't care much for the characters and certainly failed to identify or sympathize with them (a basic requirement for liking a film). The story takes place in an unidentified Middle-Eastern country (apparently they didn't want to offend any middle eastern people or they think it's all the same over there -whatever) and religion is (surprise, surprise) basically the root cause of all the evil that happens to our protagonist. The sum of all these elements does not add up to a great film. I even turned it off after 35 mins. After a few days I gathered enough courage to plow through the remainder of this film, and it does get a bit better after the slow start. My advice is: there are films you'd think are perfect but there's always such a thing as personal taste.",Incendies

Never, ever leave us. You are a god.Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, okay, I think I'm sturdy now. Incendies is a rare film that manages to be an invigorating political thriller about violence, war, religion, and hostitily, while simultaneously, be a malevolent, nail-biting mystery-noir thriller. There are so many sequences in this bruting, cloak-and-dagger mischief-maker that will stick out to you like an imperishable parasite. It is crushing.The only reason why Incendies doesn't earn a 5/5 from me-for now-is because the pacing at first glance wasn't all too keen at times, there's admittedly a plateful of coincidences that materialize, and the character, Simon, was a bit of a nuisance virtually every time he emerged on screen. I'm sure though that after a rewatch in the near future, I'll end up fine-tuning notably more to this deviously harrowing exploit. Nonetheless, j'ai adoré. (Verdict: A-)",Incendies

The film brings home the horrors of war, the dynamics of family and gives insight into Arab culture...much of which is unknown to the west.

The little I do know suggests it is not accurately represented, and all the logical flaws I list below will clearly show this is a film unconcerned with accuracy. Films like this often attempt to disguise their political nature by winning you over with a heart wrenching story, and for a great deal of its duration it achieves that, but ultimately falls apart in a twist ending that if not entirely unbelievable, is so coincidental, that it amounts to the same reaction.Getting a glimpse into some of the horrors of war-torn middle eastern countries, in comparison to peaceful Canada, makes for some harrowing viewing, while the twins journey to discover their mothers mysteries is engaging. However those things cannot overcome the great disbelief that occurs along the way:Would a mother who makes a devastating venture to the south of the country for the sole purpose of finding her son really give up the chance of uniting with him by assassinating a political leader and landing herself in prison? Of course not.
Would a repeat rapist really not recognise his victim as she stood before him at the pool? Of course he would.
Would a mother really not tell her rapist in advance she was his son, knowing it could prevent the deed and incest? Of course she would.
Would a mother really send her children into a war torn country to learn the truth of their father, when she could simply tell them herself and save the danger? Of course not.
Would a Muslim sniper, trained for that role from childhood, really switch sides to become a Christian Arab? Of course not. It's this point that makes any believability the twist might have had fall apart. If he didn't do it, the twist can't occur.
Why would the baby twins not be thrown in the river, as the film suggests happened to other babies born in prison? No explanation is given for their special treatment.
What are the chances your son would father your children, and when he flees, end up in the same continent as you, same country, same state, same town, and same swimming pool, at the same time? Very low.The 1+1 scene was a cringeworthy attempt to unite the mathematical scenes from the start, which don't appear to have any relevance whatsoever.
The actors ages don't appear to match the circumstances, with the rapist both too old to be the son, and too young to be the father.

The scenery and the camera work was impeccable. The delivery by Lubna Azabal (Nawal Marwan) was tense and emotionally charged.The split timelines however was a mixed bag for me. Although the 'children's timeline' added narrative to the story, it 'stole' screen time from the 'mother's timeline' which was by far more compelling. In fact, nothing really occurred during the 'children's timeline'.As for the twist, I didn't find it shocking. Maybe because it was contrived, and maybe because - comparing to the prior occurrences - it was an anticlimax. It wasn't bad, but I didn't feel it was a strong resolution either.My biggest complaint was the evident bias, presented in this movie, with regard to the atrocities done by each fighting party. I tried to explain to myself that this is Nawal's point of view, but that just kept accumulating into being a one sided interpretation of the war. Personally, I find it irresponsible.",Incendies
84,martinpersson97,An amazing and quite shocking drama,9,11 March 2020,"Another masterpiece from one of the best modern directors; Denis Villenueve, who has made some instant classics such as Enemy, Prisoners, Sicario, and Bladerunner 2049.Much like Orson Welles classic Citizen Kane, it is about finding truth in the life of a secretive person - but this time, it gets even more personal, where the protagonists share a very close bond with the object of investigation; it being their mother.The movie is extremely well cut, flowing well with its present-day story, intercut occassionally with flashback-sequences - again, reminiscent of Citizen Kane or The Godfather: Part II.The acting is amazing from all of the characters, and without going into too much spoilers - even some despicable characters find themselves in somewhat sympathetic roles.It is extremely well-written, the above comparisons to other classics not being an overstatement, it has a strong script going for it and plot twists that could stand against some of the most profound.Safe to say, it rightfully maintaind its spot on IMDb's Top 250 list, and is the work of a true artist!",Incendies
85,postsenthil,A MUST WATCH !!,9,27 October 2019,"While religions all over the world overtly profess a language of love and offer a path to salvation, it is not uncommon to find their teachings hijacked by fanatics and zealots who spew hatred and incite teeming followers in the name of God to commit ungodly acts. Many a war have been waged and scores of precious lives lost, maimed and scarred in the name of religion which preach a blind hatred of others. This is a story of a society and in particular, a family, which had to bear the brunt of a civil war spawn from such mindless religious hatred.Jeanne and Simon, twin siblings in Canada, are taken by surprise when their reticent mother dies leaving a strange will which requires to deliver two letters from their mother. Jeanne is to deliver a letter to her father whom they thought had died long ago while Simon is to deliver another letter to a brother whom they were unaware of. Simon is clearly reluctant as he considers the demands in the will as an unreasonable, if not, a totally irrational request by their mother whom he believed was demented. Jeanne, however, sets out on a journey to discover her mother's past and to find out her father and brother.Jeanne's journey is interwoven with a parallel narrative arc which depicts the story of their mother, Nawal, in her youth in an unnamed Middle East nation (probably Lebanon) with simmering tension between the its Muslim and ruling Christian populace. Nawal, a Christian, falls in love with a Muslim from a refugee camp. When she discovers that she is pregnant, she tries to flee with her lover. However, Nawal's brothers confront them and kill her lover in the name of family's honour. Nawal's grandmother saves her from her brothers' wrath for bringing dishonour to their religion and clan. Nawal's grandmother helps her to keep her pregnancy secret and promises to assist Nawal in having the baby under the condition that Nawal would send it to an orphanage upon delivery and leave to a distant city for her studies. Nawal fulfills her condition and leaves her village to pursue higher studies in a university even as the newborn which is tattooed by her grandmother is handed over to an orphanage. At the university, Nawal is an activist during her studies and when the threat of civil war looms large, she forsakes her studies to look for her son to take him to safety before the onset of full blown war.
The rest of the movie oscillates between these two parallel narratives of past and the present, separated in time by a few decades - Nawal quest for her son and Jeanne's quest to unravel her mother's past. Nawal's search for her lost son takes her ever so deeper into the heart of an unfolding dark civil war, where her life is tossed around by the belligerent forces like a helpless vessel in a terrible storm. Jeanne's search, on the other hand, reveals her mother's troubled past and the traumas she had to undergo before she left her strife-torn native for Canada. These two intertwining strands culminate in an exceptional, SHOCKING and INTENSE revelation in the finale. Playing the reticent, yet resilient and psychologically complex character of Nawal, Lubna Hazabal as Nawal provides the stand out performance which is compelling even in her intense silences. The rest of the cast consisting Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin playing Jeanne, Maxim Gaudette playing the reluctant Simon as well as Rémy Girard playing the notary Maître Lebel, Nawal's former employer and the holder of the will who guides the twins in their quest provide competent performances.Canadian director Dennis Villeneuve helms this multi-layered movie (adapted from a popular play by Wajdi Mouawad known for its poetic flourishes) with the assurance of masterly auteur with potent visuals, sharp writing and a deliberate pace that keeps the viewer glued to every detail. Villeneuve's brilliance is manifest in the manner in which he has crafted an ambitious non-linear narrative that transcends multiple genres of drama, road movie, thriller and anti-war movie.Overall, this stirring movie is an exceptional ode to the triumph of kinship, togetherness and love which trump over the seemingly invincible forces of hatred. Nominated for Best Foreign Language Movie for the 83rd Academy Awards (2011) has also received acclaim in several international film festivals.",Incendies
86,drpakmanrains,Great Ending to a Slow Convoluted Slog,6,26 March 2012,"I know I am in the minority regarding this widely acclaimed film, but after reading a review of ""In A Better World"" saying how terrible it was compared to this and the other nominated foreign films of 2010, I was expecting this film to be much better than I felt it actually is. Let me say that I realize it is ambitious and well acted, but it is done in a manner that I find rather annoying, that is where a mystery requires the principals to find something in the past, and everyone they encounter at first is reluctant to help, and then seems to be able to supply an additional bit of information, which leads to the next encounter. They rarely encounter dead ends, and their mother escapes one treacherous moment after another, much like Indiana Jones, or the Bourne films, which I find unlikely and ultimately empty at the core. I know those films are very popular, so if you like those, you will probably like this slower paced one. However, the ending was indeed different, and quite interesting. Had the ending been predictable from the start I would have rated this a 2 or 3, as it also kept switching from the present to flashbacks without the viewer realizing which it was, making the first half of the film hard to follow. I admit I prefer movies that try to tell a straightforward story, and if they use flashbacks, it is fine if they signal it someway. For me, ""In a Better World"" was the masterpiece. This was just a well made overlong formulaic indie with a terrific ending which almost made the trip worthwhile, but not quite.",Incendies
87,jburtroald95,"Not perfect, but unmissable!",8,27 April 2011,"As two teenage siblings are making the funeral arrangements for their prematurely deceased mother, their faithful notary informs them of a very peculiar request that she has left to be completed before her burial. Her children are suddenly told that they have a brother and a father who are still living, and that they are to deliver a secret letter to each of them on her behalf. This situation is succinctly communicated in a very effective opening scene of exposition, and indeed the difficult search of these young adults to find their lost relatives remains the central focus throughout the entire film. A niggling weak point of many critically-acclaimed European films is a frustrating ambiguity in storytelling and a lack of a properly paced narrative, both of which seem to have a certain sadistic purpose about them, as if the intention is to make things as hard for the audience to follow as possible. However, the early firm grounding of plot present here assists greatly with the accessibility, and so is far less discriminative.The scenes making up the body of the piece proceed mostly with a masterful grace, coherence, intrigue and sophistication. The sister, Jeanne Marwan (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) is by far the more willing of the two to carry out their mother's dying wishes – her brother, Simon (Maxim Gaudette) merely responds with a moody male temper to the words in the will – and so, at least initially, we follow Jeanne, being shown extended flashbacks of the events from her mother's past that she discovers. In these scenes, we see Mrs Nawal Marwan fighting endlessly to survive in a world fraught with terror and violence, being the horrific religious and political conflicts in the Middle East of the 1970s. The challenges she faces make this one of those remarkably engrossing and poignant stories of hope bravery and love that are cinematic gold.The final discoveries and revelations are again satisfyingly comprehensible, but definitely not for the faint-hearted viewer. Still, even if one finds the overall conclusion distastefully grotesque, there is still something to admire in the most apt direction from Denis Villeneuve and a splendid performance from Lubna Azabal as the mother. With a cast that also includes Rémy Girard, Allen Altman, Mohamed Majd and Abdelghafour Elaaziz, Incendies (""Scorched"") may have the occasional patch of sluggishness and over-exaggeration, but you still owe it to yourself to see it.",Incendies

----------------------------
Story follows two directions, one past one present, of two twins tracking their mother's footsteps to uncover the mysteries of her past. The twins of a dying mother are given two tasks to fulfill before they bury her in a ""tradition grave"": to find their father and brother. They believe their father has died in the religious wars waging during their mother's time, but the notary suggest they to search deeper. The son holds resentment in his heart, but the daughter wants to complete her mother's wish and learn about her family history. This leads her on an adventure through the middle east as she tracks various stomping grounds of her mother (including childhood village, university, prison) hoping to find the whereabouts of her father and brother. The secrets to their identities are shocking disturbing.Meanwhile the story transitions into the past of their mother's life: her love for a muslim refugee, the politics of religious warfare in the area, the search and discovery of her adopted son, and all the various people who's heart she touched during her lifetime.

91,chaz-28,Searching a mother's past revives Lebanese tragedy,7,29 August 2011,"Lebanese-Canadian Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) has passed away. She was at the swimming pool, started staring off into space, and then slowly faded away in the hospital. She has left behind her twins, Jeanne and Simon, who are in their early '20s. To them, their mother was a secretary to a local notary, liked to swim, and that is all. Their mother does not have a past, at least not one which she ever brings up in conversation. There is no father in the picture and the twins assume he died back in Lebanon during the war.At the reading of Nawal's will, the twins receive startling news. Their mother has left instructions for them to deliver two letters, one to their father and one to their brother, relations which they know nothing about. The twins take the newfound discovery in completely different ways. Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) accepts what her mother wants her to do and takes off for Lebanon, a place that is familiar to her only from textbooks. Her brother, Simon (Maxim Gaudette), refuses to have any part of this nonsense and wants to stay out of the affair altogether. For Simon, his mom may have had some alternate, hidden past, but that was not who she was to him. She was a Canadian secretary, not some Lebanese village girl.I will reveal absolutely nothing about what comes next, that is for the audience to discover right along with Jeanne. As Jeanne slowly pieces together the facts of her mother's previous life in Lebanon, the film cuts to Nawal in the past and shows her experiences firsthand. The children start the plot of Incendies; however, Nawal gets most of the screen time. Furthermore, the film does not take time to explain what the war in early 1970s Lebanon was all about. It assumes the audience is familiar with the right-wing Christian militias and the Palestinian refugee camps in the south. If you are not, it may help you to read about the different sides beforehand so you will not waste time during the film trying to sort it out.This is very well written script and the acting is high-quality. What the film lacks is a score. There are two Radiohead songs played in the film which fit in nicely and help shape their introspective scenes. On the other hand, the rest of film is sparse, just dialogue and scenery. This is most likely what the director (Denis Villeneuve) intended, but a memorable score would have gone a long way in helping the events portrayed here land with a deeper impact. The choice of two mellow, thoughtful Radiohead songs though was a very good idea.",Incendies

93,corrosion-2,Unforgettable,10,15 October 2010,"A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.A Canadain-Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son & daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. As we follow their search, flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother.There are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in Incendies. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East, this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end.

This is indeed the spoiler - the brother for whom the twins are searching, and the father, turn out to be the same person - with the added flourish that their conception occurred as the result of torture/rape.What exactly was the point here? Was there one? In 'Chinatown', which has a similar twist, the revelation is treated with horror and disgust (plus it explains eccentricities in the Faye Dunaway character). Here it says absolutely nothing about anything - in fact, the revelation is accompanied by the ludicrous hope of the dead mother that it 'will end the cycle of anger'.Are you kidding? What it's going to do is lead to permanent estrangement and alienation of all three, plus do permanent damage to the twins' self-perception.And what does any of this say about the Middle East?

Jordan's landscape es pecially with the film's photography, are somewhat surrealistic, as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region's sub-conscious. Villeneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront.

106,ilpintl,A work of devastating power...,9,26 January 2011,"""Incendies (Scorched)"" opened in town this Friday, just days before it made the short list of nominees for Best Foreign Film for this year's Academy Awards. It played in the Vancouver International Film Festival 2010, but I missed it then.Fortunately, it received theatrical distribution; this devastating film on the horrors of conflict and its enormous human costs simply must be seen. Denis Villeneuve's searing work, his fourth feature, is based on the celebrated play of the same name by Montreal native and artistic director of the French Theatre at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa Wajdi Mouawad. While there is no doubting the immediacy and impact it must have had as a piece of theatre, ""Incendies"" benefits from the transition to the larger canvas of the big screen, appropriate for the epic themes and emotional conflagrations it tackles.When their mother dies and her will is read, twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan are stumped by its bizarre burial instructions. Nawal Marwan states that she must be interred naked and facing away from the sun in an unmarked grave, until the two letters she has left with the family notary are delivered on her behalf. One is addressed to the father the twins believed dead, the second to a son whose existence comes as a complete surprise to them. The will makes the twins realize that they did not know their mother at all. They have not had an easy relationship with her, and are understandably reluctant to comply with her terms.The daughter Jeanne moved away and found refuge in the abstract realms of pure mathematics. Her sibling Simon, who remained at home, had the more complicated relationship because he dealt daily with Nawal's strangeness. Jeanne agrees to deliver the letter that was left to her, and embarks on an odyssey of discovery, in search of the father she has never known. Later, she convinces Simon to join her.Although the Middle Eastern country is never named in the film, Wajdi Mouawad ascribes the inspiration for his play to Soha Becharra, a woman who was imprisoned for six years in Khiam, southern Lebanon. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, he explained ""For me, the success of this play and the film is a way to give back some life to a woman whose life was taken away from her."" The cinematic endeavor is hugely, powerfully successful: as Jeanne scours an alien land for clues of her mother's past, we see Nawal's tough life in flashback in the same locations that her daughter visits for the first time. Sectarian strife, tribal and religious warfare, family blood feuds, and honor killings have been the blight of the Middle East and areas as far as Afghanistan and what is now Pakistan, and parts of Africa. Bloodshed and violence have been a way of life; each side claims to be justified in killing to avenge earlier injustices. While humankind has not lost its baser urges—we just have to recall the recent incident of the young Afghani woman whose nose was hacked off, or the countless rapes in present day DR Congo—the film is a plea for reconciliation and forgiveness to bring about the much needed change.Nawal barely escapes an honor killing due to her unwed pregnancy, gives up her baby son for adoption, and spends the rest of her life looking for this lost child. Along the way, she takes sides in the violence and is imprisoned for fifteen years for shooting a political leader. Upon her release, she begins life anew in Canada with her infant twins, the outcome of brutal rape at the hands of a torturer. Regardless of the change in geography, she remains haunted by the past and her unending quest for her lost child. How does one look for reparation and justice, when the perpetrators frequently flee the country of their misdeeds and seek asylum elsewhere? As she has not kept her word to her son to return to him, she feels unworthy of a proper burial. A character in the film wisely observes that death always leaves its traces, and Jeanne and Simon finally get to know their mother from the relics of her life.The Belgian actress Lubna Azabal's heroic performance brings Nawal to awe-inspiring Brechtian life. Undefeated by each dehumanizing blow, she stoically navigates a war-crazed world devoid of any sense, her driving force is the need to reunite with her son. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette do excellent work as the siblings who gradually begin to understand their mother. Rémy Girard and Allen Altman, playing the Canadian and Middle Eastern notaries respectively, guide the siblings through their search, while Abdelghafour Elaaziz makes an impact in the small but important role of Abou Tarek the torture specialist. The rest of the characters are brought to life by a talented cast of unknown actors; in their hands, even the smallest roles acquire great significance. Denis Villeneuve's film honors the stories of these people by rigorously avoiding directorial excesses. Events and stories this powerful do not require embellishment, and Villeneuve's spare, dispassionate directorial style maximizes impact.Someone remarked that ""Incendies"" is the closest contemporary approximation of Greek tragedy, and I agree with this assessment: the crimes and consequences are universal and timeless, and if a film holds up a mirror to question our capacity for barbarism, it is reason to applaud. Regardless of the outcome at the Academy Awards, ""Incendies"" is a major achievement for Canadian cinema.",Incendies
107,suvopyne49,Emotionally Exhausting Experience,9,5 September 2014,"Incendies belongs to that rare breed of films that induce a tumultuous surge of emotions in its spectators while engaging them through the narrative. Jerry Seinfeld once said in his show Seinfeld, to add to the humor of that show undoubtedly, that Leo Tolstoy wanted to name his novel 'War: What Is It Good For' instead of ""War and Peace"". Maybe that rhetorical question of a book title would have been an apt tagline for what was portrayed in this film.What sets Dennis Villeneuve's 'Incendies' apart from other films with post-war trauma as their underlying theme, is the spectrum of human relationship he constructed on the screen. The film starts with twin brother and sister, Jeanne and Simon, receiving their recently deceased mother, Nawal's funeral wishes; wishes that need to be fulfilled, before the children can proceed with the burial. In two different letters, the twins were asked to locate their father and half-brother, who we would later find was called Nihad. With initial reluctance and refusal from her foreboding brother, Jeanne finally set upon the journey that would uncover the truth through several different realisations, taking the audience with it.In Incendies, Villeneuve never loses the grip that he gets to hold from the very first few minutes. The narrative had the mother and daughter tracing the same path in a Middle-Eastern country, only with different perspectives and scenarios. The civil war, that was shown here to have its inflictions on the protagonists, can be compared with the Lebanese Civil War. The places that had horrific memories for the mother are visited by the daughter. Thus, blending the two timelines in the narrative, a sense of déjà vu is channeled in the film. At one point, viewers along with Jeanne would be forced to ponder whether being oblivious to the truth was a blessing or not.If the screenplay is the heart of the film, then the oxygen was provided by the cast to keep it pumping. Lubina Azabal's Nawal Marwan is tremendous feat in acting. It was important for her performance to be in accordance with the story, with she being the protagonist in this tempestuous journey of a film. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin as Jeanne, was not far behind either. Apart from these stand-out performances, the film is bolstered with performances from the rest of the cast akin to that of a neo-realist film.Incendies is as intense and brutal as one can get. Nothing hits harder than the truth that comes out of nowhere and you do not want to hear. Incendies is quite an achievement at that. It becomes incessantly difficult to revisit the first scene where Nihad, a child, would leave you with self-judgment and introspection. Radiohead's ""You and Whose Army"" adds to the cause.",Incendies
108,socialmedia-437-956449,"Picturesque, memorable, surprising, tense and mysterious",9,23 August 2012,"The story begins with a will, which Nawal (Lubna Azzabal), a Canadian expat with Middle Eastern origins, leaves behind for twins Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudet). The will consists of two sealed envelopes with instructions for delivery listing Jeanne and Simon's supposedly late father, and their recently discovered older brother. From that point forward, the twins embark upon an adventure in a war-torn country, with the sole purpose of unlocking the mystery left behind by their mother; a mystery providing a gateway to their homeland and origins.The magnificent prologue of the film speaks volumes, with a beautiful, seemingly serene hilly landscape tricking the audience into a false sense of security. The camera then slowly sweeps across a room full of young boys either with clippers shaving their heads to a military standard, or receiving terrifying looking arms. The camera pauses on one boy with piercing eyes, looking at us in a moving combination of fear, anger and resentment as his hair falls on his shoulders, rendering him bald and ready. In the background, Radiohead's 'You and Whose Army' hypnotises us, imprinting the powerful image in our memory – one which will strongly be recalled later on in this film. This scene alone is worth sturdy artistic praise.Face down, naked and without a memorial is the burial instruction left behind by the apparently tortured Nawal, with a haunting quote noting that, ""childhood is a knife in the throat that you can't easily take off"". The children realise that a gravestone can only be added when the puzzles of their mother's past are unlocked with the delivery of the letters within the cryptic will.Based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad,'Scorched' which I am not familiar with, but one could feel tell that the screenplay adaptation turned Mouawad's work into a respected and admired, multi award winning picture. The film garnered international attention, with twenty wins in total at various festivals, including an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. 'Incendies' was also one of the most highly praised films screened during the second edition of the Doha Tribeca Film Festival (DTFF), encouraging further exploration into its appeal.Can war be poetic? With Villeneuve, this is possible. It is also romantic and ruthless, combining the most extreme of human emotions, leading to radical choices like the Christian Nawal's recruitment by Muslim militia. The poetic narrative exposes idyllic sceneries that the director focuses on often, revealing shortly after the truths of a raw, harsh and poignant reality. .From the moment Jeanne lands in the Middle East we are transported to stories from her mother's history. Although the country's name is fictional, the historical details fail to belie the nation in question is in fact Lebanon. Every location she visits is alternated with a parallel memory from her mother's past, featuring ferocious battles, both as just a woman and also as a political activist. As soon as Jeanne infiltrates her Nawal's hometown, she is exposed to the complex hatred that society continues to struggle with, even years after the war has ended. The villagers blatantly refuse Jeanne assistance upon discovering she is Nawal's daughter, without any mention of her mother treated like a taboo.While Simon is resisting his mother's enforced wishes, it is Jeanne who initially takes the solo initiative to seek closure. Throughout her adventures, we learn that this same, unfriendly village appears to be the basis of Nawal's struggles upon falling pregnant with a Palestinian man who was brutally murdered by her own brothers. Drowned in the shadow of disgrace by everybody in the village due to falling pregnant, Nawal delivers a boy who is taken away from her upon birth. With a tattoo marking his shin, Nawal had vowed to find her child at any cost, only to be driven out of the village for fear of persecution and even death. This is when she takes drastic decisions out of anger, resentment and fear, just like the boy at the opening of the film.The war is not just the context but explains – regardless of one's political stance – that there's more to what people choose to practice and preach than mere ideals. Nawal's decision to join the militia was primarily born out of despair and the injustices she suffered. In the style of a mythological Greek tragedy, the plot then cleverly reveals key information within every step the twins' detective efforts reaped. After years of absence, it becomes obvious to them that war had never really left all of their mother's past protagonists, but lived on and festered within them.Although the children had considered their mother as nothing more than a neurotic, unstable character, the journey they embark on honours what is in fact a valiant woman, also known as ""the woman who sings"". The past was too painful to be easily forgotten, and it seemed they had never really understood their mother.The film is picturesque, memorable in every scene, surprising, tense and mysterious in parts. Villeneuve portrays a vulnerable and curious vision from Nawal's viewpoint, one that is applicable to any person regardless of religion and political parties, but sharing the same circumstances. For someone who is unaware of the conflict of the Middle East, the narration carries no judgment as to innocence and guilt, or what may be considered right or wrong. As with war in general it is a personal perspective which highlights how one's worst enemy can also be a precious part of oneself. It is the story of struggling women, star-crossed lovers and suffering mothers and the personal journey of a life, and family legend, tainted by war and society.",Incendies

110,diomavro,Absolutely fantastic! One step away from being a true masterpiece!,9,3 September 2014,"Note: I don't know how true this story is, I am only judging it as a movie. I think this movie is one of the best pure drama movies I have ever seen.Acting: Top Notch all around, extra shout out for Mélissa Désormeaux- Poulin whom I thought was totally brilliant, so much so that I won't remember her real name in a few hours. Characters: Well this is a drama so there isn't much variation but there is something to be said for realism. On paper the twins seem to go through a deeply involving emotional journey even though they come to terms with it relatively quickly its still well done. The beginning was relatively slow and we don't really seem to understand Jeanne very well, there is some sort of brilliant but subtle hinting with math(Euler's identity seems to be metaphorical) but its insufficient to understand the characters, only in hindsight, though this is excusable with Jeanne as she seems to be introvert. A little more on the relationship of the twins would have also been nice, as far as I am concerned they didn't need to be two different characters. Plot: Since the movie was rather realistic its just a little bit disengaging if you take the discovery process of their mothers future to be so conveniently laid out in a progressive manner so at to leave the big shock for the end. This is the main reason I give this movie a 9 and not a 10, I believe some more thought on the timeline elements would have made this movie a true work of art. Directing: Great and crispy camera work with some very good shots. At times the character moves about too fast, such as the orphanage, the scene were she visits the ravaged orphanage is a bit too quick and a little more camera work to help the viewer understand the extent of the war/hate would have been better. random twist comparison: I keep drifting to Old Boy and trying to compare the use of the the same plot twist. I think its more excusable to reveal it in the end of Old boy because the plot causes the twist and the information about the twist is centrally controlled by the villain. Conclusion: Great movie, probably not for the soft of heart though I don't find it particularly graphic but conceptually it can affect some people. Probably a good movie for starting controversial conversation topics afterwards.",Incendies
111,alexart-1,Our Love Became a Funeral Pyre,9,26 March 2011,"When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.Incendies already had great source material. I've praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.",Incendies
112,krisrox,Nasty surprises,6,12 February 2012,"""Incendies"" is a movie I really wanted to like. It's refreshing on several levels, featuring pleasantly strange locales (Quebec and Lebanon). It has a good sense of pace, and covers hitherto unseen moments in modern history with a good eye for detail.Still, I was tempted to give this movie the lowest score possible. Primarily for butchering its own story towards the end, going for the type of plot that only amateur screenwriters fall for: exciting on paper but hopelessly shallow in practice. (Go see it for yourself - it's so contrived it completely undermines the realistic feel the director has fought so hard to establish.) Furthermore, I'm sick of movies that create ""drama"" by graphically depicting violence against children. We get that mid-80s Lebanon was a hell hole, Denis.

113,charbelelaro,This movie is amazing,9,2 April 2019,"Incendies Directed by Denis Villeneuve is a foreign film with one of the most intriguing stories I've ever come across. So the film begins with two twins mourning the death of their mother, trying to sort out aspects of her will. They become incredibly distraught after finding out their mother wishes not to be buried traditionally until a letter is sent to their brother and father. The twins were unaware that they had a brother and a living father, therefore leading to an investigation in order to complete the task. Everything in this film is phenomenal. Every single performance is outstanding. The realism depicted by these actors blew me away. Denis' direction, as usual is perfect. He captures moments of horror so well, utilising close ups and big wide shots when necessary. There are so many moments in the film which look incredible. Incendies has one of the most insane ending revelations I've ever experienced in film. Although it isn't pretentious or cheap due to the phenomenal writing. I was so compelled by this movie for the entire runtime. The story rarely has a dull moment, due to the uneasy and suspenseful plot. Incendies should be seen by all. Don't let the English subtitles discourage you. This movie is amazing, so therefore I give it a 9.",Incendies
114,YellowManReanimated,I expected more,7,8 March 2016,"Having seen Sicario, anything but whimsical, and some of the comments made about this film and the director in general, I expected something more than this convoluted, cack handed effort at emotional drama. Sure the cinematography was excellent, the acting exquisite, the Middle-Eastern landscape lovingly captured but the story was so preposterous that it undermined the real suffering which has occurred and continues to occur in the war-torn areas of the Middle East. Right from the hackneyed letters device at the beginning of the film I started to worry, ooh person speaks from the grave, what is this ""The Greatest Gift"" all over again? To the inexplicable throwing-up of the lives of the children, really you're just going to drop everything including your burgeoning career and whatever else is going on for a wild goose chase on the behest of your emotionally distant and possibly unhinged mother? These decisions seemed incongruent if we were to assume that the children were sane, balanced individuals and we were certainly meant to perceive the daughter as such, as she was, along with her mother, the emotional centre of the film and had clearly made something of her life, excelling in her field. As a result of this incongruence, you're left with this emotional centre losing its impact as the character starts to come off as a plot device, add the brother and lawyer to this category too, used to expose upon her mother's fantastically tragic past and to tie together an exaggeratedly distressing and chronologically mind-boggling familial history. I loved the music, the setting, the acting and the way the film was shot. The pacing was a little off at times, constant transitions between mother and daughter threatened to become jarring, but at the beginning of the film it worked well and even seemed to be channelling The Godfather Part II at times. It's true that Villeneuve has a real command of his craft and the films I've seen from him show that. The thing I really had a problem with, however, was the story. It was just unnecessarily absurd and over-the-top. If Villeneuve can stick to more realistically hard-hitting fare in future, again I mention Sicario, he'll serve his talents much better in my view.",Incendies
115,nizzambaharuddin,DARK & BLEAK,10,13 January 2020,"1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Watch the film and this equation will make sense.Incendies is one of those films where I'm not surprised if anybody who has seen the film they confessed that the film managed to change their whole life perspective. It's that damn good. This film has it all. Family conflicts, genocides, war between religions, politics. To say it is bleak is actually an understatement.I've watched a few of Denis Villeneuve's film before this. And I gotta say, you can clearly see his signature and style all over the film. The pacing, cinematography and overall style is definitely obvious for us to see. This film showcase his talents not just in terms of directing, but also his know-how to choose a story and expand on it.The narrative is actually quite simple. Nawal, a dying mother instructs her twins, brother and sister Simon and Jeanne to go on a trip to the Middle East in search for an answer to her life history. There, they learnt how life in those times in those places is like living in hell. How politics and religious extremists would only destroy lives.Villeneuve's film has this quality of needing little dialogue to convey things. Instead, he relies on his actors to use their full facial expressions and acting range to show raw emotions. Some of the scenes are so gripping and hard hitting you will likely feel the same as how the characters feel at the time. This film is so exhausting you'd probably feel drained of it all by the end of it. But it doesn't do it through fast pace, but rather through the use of you discovering the truth as it unfolds before you.Villeneuve also has the habit of leading you astray with his plots. He led you into thinking for something to happen, only for something else to happen. You'll probably feel vandalized or harassed or confused by the end of the film, or all three. Not to mention his cinematography and mise en scene is absolutely superb. Just enough to got you immerse in the story and curious as a whole.Incendies made Hollywood noticed Denis Villeneuve. And I can see why. This film is a masterpiece. Absolutely no doubt about it. There are absolutely zero fault I can find in this film. Well, it's slow but that's not the film's weakness. It's only is if you prefer action packed films or cookie cutter summer blockbusters. And this film isn't that. It's doesn't exist to appease you or the audience. It is only there to tell a story.

120,BlizzyFoxTF,Incendies is one of the best indie films I have ever seen.,10,10 August 2020,"An indisputable masterpiece in storytelling, cinematorgraphy, acting and direction, the film was captivating from beginning to end despite Villeneuve's signature slow burn approach. Before I saw this film, I never thought Villeneuve could ever top the slew of great films he made thoughout the 2010s. This statement seems irrelevant considering that his magnum opus came out long before all his English language ventures.The best aspect of Incendies is its direction. Villeneuve's direction is smart and meticulous. This is a patient, methodical film that knows exactly how to deliver its emotional punches and heighten drama, while maintaining a consistent tone and style throughout. Some of the shots are sweeping and establish a great sense of scale. On a technical level, the film is pretty flawless.There are many gems in this movie. These are only some of many memorable scenes that I find note-worthy.The careful build up in the desert bus ambush. The average director would not spend so much time showing a character entering a bus and all the people around her, but these directorial touches are what make Villeneuve such a unique talent. The sequence of the ambush is very tense, and a huge part of it is due to the element of unpredictablility that Villeneuve infuses into every shot. This scene foreshadows similar brilliant moments in his later works, notably the highway scene in Sicario.The still reaction shot of the sister's face as the school janitor reveals the truth about his mother. The camera is unflinching as the graphical details are described, and tears flows midway through the scene. It is a powerful moment that features expert executiona and incredible acting.The clever writing in the meeting to track down Chamseddine. The local claims to not know Nihal of May and immediately asks for the brother's identity. The brother smirks, finding the gangster's code rather banal in the way it is presented to him. Such a smart scene, where character motivation's are naturally and subtly delivered to the audience.Villeneuve hides critical information from his audience, and reveals them in all sorts of creative ways. He would let certain scenes play out organically, and in others he would use editing to his advantage and achieve beautiful symphony between image and dialogue. The camera is moved so confidently, with a singlular intent to show information carefully and methodically. So many moments packed with details and clever touches. Villeneuve films are always a blast, and its appeal is very evident here.The cinematography is gorgeous, using a consistent palette of cold colours to paint the vistas of the Middle East. The acting is top-tier. The actors who played the sister and mother are phenomenal in their roles. The narrative is interesting. The film jumps frequently between flashbacks to show the late mother's perspective of her experiences, as her children revisits those same places in the current timeline, collecting the puzzle pieces containing mother's backstory and the shocking truths along with it. Very intriguing.Speaking of which, the film tells a very interesting, moving story. It is a searing tale that begin with two siblings tracing the life of their recently passed mother as they searches for hints of lost family members. The film is mostly set in the middle east and depicts a turbulent, despondant world, where at the centre of it all lies an incredibly human tale of love, preserverance, morality, ultimately forgiveness. The character of the mother is tough, independent, and upright. Her quest for survival in a brutal world is inspirational. However, it is only by the end of the film is the full picture of the film's core themes and ideas laid bare for all to see.It took me a moment to figure out the twist, but I did it before the film straight up told me that (the only blemish I have with the film). The film would still be powerful enough without the twist. I would have accepted an ending where both of the targets of interests were actually dead, and whole expedition being a bust. Of course, such a nihilistic approach, redolent of a Colan brother film, would be too much to bear for a lot of people. Looking back on his entire filmography, Villeneuve is like a big fan of twists. There is no problem in that, considering how well executed every twist in his films is, including this. (DV twists that are considered great: Incendies, Enemy, Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner, wow that's almost all his films)Incendies is a veritable masterpiece that further accentuates how good of a year 2010 is for film. Usually, everything the same director works on goes down hill from here, considering how hard it is to top a film with such quality. In my opinion, while Incendies is the most perfect film he has made, his later films are far greater in scale and tackles genres that never saw the same treatment being applied before. In this sense, I'd say the brilliance of Incendies are overshadowed by his more ambitious, almost equally great works. Blade Runner 2049 is one of my favourite films of all time, and I am more familiar with Prisoners and Arrival. I don't think it is shame when a director's oeuvre is so varied and consistently high quality that some great works are shunned. Also, I would rather see him make another Blade Runner 2049 than another Incendies, because it is a mark of growth for a great director making his way up the ladder. I look forward to seeing Dune, but Incendies will always hold a place in my heart.",Incendies
121,forlornnesssickness,Incendies : She was a woman full of sorrow and acute pain,10,14 June 2014,"""Incendies"" has a familiar plot used in many mystery fictions. The odd instructions are delivered to the characters with no explanation. The journey begins eventually, and the mystery is peeled away step by step. While following their path, we begin to sense that there will be the unexpected answer at the end of journey. Shortly after the death of their mother Nawal(Lubna Azabal), twin brother and sister, Jeanne(Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon(Maxim Gaudettte), meet the notary Lebel(Rémy Girard), for whom Nawal has worked as his secretary for about 20 years. The request in her will surprises her children with her hidden past. Before dying in the hospital after suddenly fallen into some catatonic state, she left two letters. The one is for the twin's father; Jeanne is instructed to find him and deliver it to him. The other one is for the twin's hidden brother; Simon is instructed to do the same thing like her sister. Until their missions are accomplished, Nawal's body will remain buried without coffin or tombstone.Jeanne and Simon are confounded by this revelation. While living a new life with them in Canada for a long time, Nawal seldom mentioned about her past to them(the twins thought their father was dead during the war in their mother's homeland). Angry and confused for this, Simon refuses the request. In contrast, although she has been distant from her mother for a while, Jeanne decides to go to her mother's homeland to find their father after advised by her adviser professor in her graduate school not to ignore this matter.The movie goes back and forth between Jeanne's journey and Nawal's long, hurtful journey. When she was young, Nawal fell in love with a Muslim guy, and she got pregnant by him. Her Christian family certainly did not approve of that; after their failed attempt to run away, her lover was shot by her brothers for the family's honor, and she had to leave behind her baby right after she bore him. Before separated from him, she promised to him she would find him again.However, several years later, when she studied in the university, the sectarian conflict between Christians and Muslims got more intensified, and her hometown became a war zone. None the less, Nawal was determined to find her son for keeping her promise. Though well aware of the dangers, she went back to her hometown, and that was the start of a long ordeal she had to struggle through – it was impossible for her to stay in the middle in this conflict.There are several striking moments to depict the horrors of war in the film. The director Denis Villeneuve, whose screenplay based on the acclaimed play by Wajdi Mouawad, handles the brutality in his movie with restraint and conciseness, as shown in the gut-wrenching scene where Nawal is forced to save herself in a shameful way from sudden brutal mass killing by a militia group. In the opening sequence crucial in the story, Radiohead's ""You and Whose Army?"" is effectively used in the soundtrack against what is shown on the screen, and this memorable moment is chillingly connected to the scene where the boys are attacked by a sniper not so older than them.Villeneuve deftly moves the story between the past and present. Compared to the violent past, Nawal's homeland at present is relatively peaceful, but there is still the conflict, and there are still the shadows of the past which people do not like to talk about. Nawal's family members do not forget what she did even after so many years have passed. When Jeanne meets the former prison guard who knew her mother as prisoner, he is very reluctant to tell her what happened to her mother, while emphasizing that he has been a school janitor.Later in the story, Simon finally joins her sister with Lebel. Their search is continued, and, in the end, there is the shocking truth waiting for them. Of course, I will not tell you what it is, but I have to say this; I already guessed what would be revealed based on some storytelling logics, but it was really devastating to see how the movie silently reveals that horrible secret to the characters with the emotionally shattering effect.By the way, while watching the last scene, I wondered about the plausibility of the story because I was a little bothered by some small calculation based on the one tiny detail shown in that scene(Maybe I was wrong about that, but I cannot go into the details due to spoiler problems). In addition, the story relies on the coincidences a little too much. For instance, Jeanne and Simon's journey could be aborted with the dead end by any chance. Come to think of it, it is very lucky that there are enough surviving people and documents to lead them to the arriving point. I know it would have been really hard for Nawal to tell the truth, but could she just leave one letter to her children for explaining everything?Nevertheless, the story works well on the emotional level with the haunting performance by Lubna Azabal, who is convincing both as Young Nawal and Old Nawal. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudettte are also good as the other half of the story, and Remy Girard gives an interesting performance as a kind, courteous man with the strong professional ethics he firmly sticks to.Nawal can be described as a woman full of this complex feeling. Her heart was burned by so many pains and sorrows in her past - and her fate was as cruel to her as the Greek tragedy.",Incendies

Watch Fatih Akin's "" Edge of Heaven"" instead.",4,5 April 2020,"Dennis Villeneuve is a director who's gained acceptance but like Christopher Nolan, there's something about his films , I can't exactly place it , but I know that something is off. They both have made good decent films , but not great ones. ( I consider Tim Burton's first Batman the best Batman movie )
This film has been on my -to watch- list basically since it came out , and I just got to see it today. I've got news for you. Prepare to be bored stiff. I thought , what, is this a joke ? I paused , checked Imdb rating again , checked the random user's review again ( gladly , anything please to distract me from this tedious film). I went back at it , after 40 minutes in with no engagement at all, meaning I didnt care much with what I was watching , debating whether to fast forward or not , I started casually fast forwarding. This should give you a hint.A bit more specific though..Bad Editing , many scenes just cut meaninglessly to other scenes depicting same from other angle ( No I'm not an editor , just was so bored that tried to get myself thinking over some aspect of what I'm watching)Bad screenplay - maybe the story isnt that bad , if you chose another set of scenes and sequences and whole emphasis , basically another whole movie.Indifferent acting - The kids were just indifferent , the mother's mute way of being , mixed with some mute crying isnt praiseworthy. I may even say the cast was bad , the whole ensemble cast, the brother and sister , no chemistry whatsoever.Bad Direction - Yes the guy who did Bladerunner 2049 , which wasn't bad , in this film I just don't like the direction as well, clearly.It's a film very similar in subject matter and topic to Fatih Akin's "" Edge of Heaven"" , but that film is alive , energetic whereas this film is totally dead , compiled of dead scenes.

It echoes the tradition of the Greek tragedy where the end is sown in the beginning and all that is required to reach that end is for people to follow the logic built into their parts in the play that life really is.At times I couldn't watch. At other times I couldn't look away. Its beautifully scripted, acted and directed. It is not gory, but at times is hard to watch. Its almost Hitchcockian in terms of its treatment of cruelty.

I don't want to discuss about the Christian and Muslim issues. If this a real story then it is very unfortunate and war between countries contributed to it.Hats off to the director the way he handled the movie was excellent. Each character's actions are practical, any human will react the same way. Perfect!
Only a mother can understand a child. The actress who acted as Nawal Marwan properly justified the character.All the actors have done a best job. Thought the director is smart, the way he narrated the story is the best way for this kind of story,

Probably the most powerful one, because I can't remember the last time a movie made me speechless...that 1+1 scene...OMGBest French Canadian movie in my opinion, even thou I only have watched 2 so far :P, I have no doubt Incendies will be the best French Canadian movie for me for years to come. It is a masterpiece.The story is about the twins that go to middle east to search their brother they never knew at their mother request. It is very fascinating how the truth is unfold one by one and I didn't expect that coming...the ending is very shocking one. Yes it is powerful masterpiece with amazing writing, but it is not flawless, I think there is a logical flaw or technical flaw (damn u make up artist >,<), but it is also something that make the audience from figuring the truth. Even with the flaw Incendies is still 10/10 movie for me.",Incendies
127,j_smith_7,Long but enormously worth it,9,14 March 2014,"I'd best begin with an admission. Usually, I only come to post a review on IMDb for what turned out to be the lousy films I paid hard-earned cash to see. I do this in the vain hope that others who also work for their money do not waste it on trashy flicks of which, as we cinema heads know, there are far too many. This time, though, I am here to praise a movie. This, believe me, is a first for me on IMDb. The plot and characters of 'Incendies' have been discussed elsewhere by those who have reviewed this movie long before I saw it. So, I won't bore you with repeating all that. My intention is different. You see, I am a European expat who has lived and worked in the part of the word this movie is set in for many, many years. I remember very well the horror of seeing bombed out buildings, the dead everywhere, militia on street corners, gangs running amok on shooting sprees. The fear in the eyes of those in blind panic as they faced the dilemma of trying to get to the shop to buy food for their hungry children without being shot by a sniper's bullet. Now, not for one moment am I suggesting that I ever experienced anything approaching the losses and utter misery of local people. I did not. Rather, what I am saying is that this film is so wholly accurate in depicting the arbitrary nature with which torture, immeasurable pain, and death descend that it left me quite emotional (and, believe me, I'm a tough old so-and so who has seen some real messes from war around the world.) This film is so exquisitely made and so well acted that it has the power to grip from the very first moment as it leads us, oh-so-carefully but painfully, toward the only conclusion available in a world so desperate and lost. It is, quite simply, stunning from beginning to end.I can give it no higher praise than to say it is required viewing for every adult. Please take the time to watch it.",Incendies

It took me about 10 minutes after watching it to be able to do anything (eventually I had a smoke). Everything that composes a film, editing, camera work, acting, all the choices for narrative, converge most perfectly, emerging as the most complete whole I have seen on the screen in a long time, at once hauntingly beautiful and quietly earth-shattering. And, as it always seems to go with Villeneuve, there's not a single superfluous grain. There's no lingering, no exploiting of cruelty (each aspect and scene of the sort is thus also presented in the most tactful way), the soundtrack as well is reduced to what is necessary, to much greater effect. The camera is closely kept on the protagonists (without exception every performance is excellent), wider shots are reserved to set the stage. War is seen through the eye of the intimate in a fact-finding odyssey into the past. Virtuous also the division of these time-lines without ever confusing, and never l'art pour l'art, but an essential story-tool. The story itself is in the end the main character.

I am totally speechless after the film ended, left me in a shock. The choir at the end, and the shocking ending of the movie, I just wonder, is this story real? I strongly applaud for the director.I am a Pakistani born, having spent half of my life in Iran. I watched this film because it had some places shown in the film which resembled the place where I had spent my childhood. More over the IMDb rating for this movie was quite enough for me to make me watching this film. When i saw the film, I wasn't expecting such shocking end. There are very few films that got me in so seriously, the movies which captured my mind so brutally. Yes I admit that the movie ended but it didn't end yet, in my mind. It left me with so much unanswered.Indeed the film has been perfect through every scene. The actors, the co-actors and the leading character Nawal. I simply have no words to tell you how I found this movie, but I assure you it's worth watching. There was a scene where Simon Marwan returns after meeting the war lord, and he is hysteric and tells in an exclamation to her sister, can one plus one equal to one and she shrieks briskly, I got scared and I stopped the film for a while, thinking what does this mean ""can one plus one equal to one"". Some notions struck me, but I shuddered myself that no, how it can be, what! Can it be? Ohh my holy God, please don't and exactly the same I found, when the film ended, I was sitting numb.For me, this is the victory of an author, writer, screen play and the director and to everyone involved in film making, that you involve the viewer and make him shocked.For me this is a 9 out of 10 film. I just gave one film 10 out of 10, and that was ""stoning of Soraya M."" I also recommend you all to watch it too. Its Persian but totally superb, outclass and epic.",Incendies

The script is terrific, the actors are perfect, the direction and cinematography are all you could hope for. I recommend it without hesitation.Anyone who has seen any of Villeneuve's previous work--or Andre Turpin's Zigrail--knows that these filmmakers have bodies of work that are almost without peer in contemporary cinema world-wide and are unparallelled in the history of Canadian cinema (until seeing Incendies, Maelstrom was my favourite Canadian film). Incendies does not betray that ""legacy"". You should absolutely see it.In a film as stunning as this one it's odd to single out one aspect, but I must say that Lubna Azabal's performance is among the best I've ever seen. Though I've watched a few films that she's been in in the past, she never really stood out for me. She is devastatingly good in this picture.I do hope that this film gets submitted to the AMPAS for Oscar selection as it is definitely the best film I've seen this year and a shoe-in for the foreign picture Oscar.My only complaint about the film was the use of music by Radiohead, which took me out of the film each time it played.

The truth revealed is cruel and shocking? The mother has died after finding out the truth, now she wants her children to go on a mission to find the truth rather than reveal to them the truth through the letter. One could argue that the mother wanted to reveal the truth and reveal the horror and the pointlessness of the Middle East conflict.

That is how I thought before watching this one... I just gave it a chance... And wasn't intending to finish it... Just wondered why this movie has been rated 8.2... It's a quite long movie actually but you don't feel and don't complain while you watch till the end... slow pace is easily adapted and even makes you ask for more...The movie contains many flashbacks which at first looks like a historical review of situation of those days... But then you realize the real mastery in telling the story in front of that strong historical background... The flashbacks and the real time connected by the end of the movie in such way that feels like there's no other way to understand and really ''feel'' the movie...The story itself is not comparable to any other one... at least I haven't watched a movie with such a strong and different scenario... very very powerful movie...This movie deserves applause and all kinds of rewards...I strongly advise this movie to everyone over 16 yrs old... as it is not a ''feel good'' or a ''have fun time with family'' movie... just a very very good piece of art... a master's work...I'm very very happy that I watched it!!!,Incendies

Wow turns out it's not quite what you expected.For a more authentic and heartwrenching Canadian performance depicting horror and grue, go see instead ""One Lunatic One Icepick"" (warning: parental advisory).

140,hanagomolakova,A Hall of Fame material,10,17 July 2011,"The film opens at present day in Montreal with twins in their twenties, Jeanne and Simon Marwan, hearing the will of their mother Nawal Marwan, who has just passed away, from a notary Jean Lebel she'd worked for many years. Her last wish is for them to find their father and brother, to their bewilderment, because they thought their father dead and they never heard about having a brother.At first, only Jeanne is willing to undertake the journey to an unnamed country in the Middle East (however, this clearly refers to Lebanon, where the author of the play himself was born at and escaped from) while Simon, questioning their mother's sanity, refuses to embark on such a crazy quest.Simultaneously, their mother's story entwines with their research. An incredible story of a woman who is caught between the conflict of religious conflict between Muslims and Christians, especially the war in the country in the 1970s' and 80s'.What gives the story an extraordinary strength is exactly this comparison between the perceptions Jeanne and Simon who grew up in a free country versus the life, habits and ways of a nation in the middle of a raging conflict in a country so distant from their lives, especially – and this is apparent during the entire film – because Nawal has shared nothing of her past with their children.This is portrayed during the twins encounter with the local tradition, especially at one moment, when Jeanne meets the villagers who could have known her father and is told by an elderly woman that ""she is looking for her father, but is her mother she knows nothing about"". This exactly depicts the relation of the audience in the western world, who, unless they've lived in similar conditions, cannot relate to some of Nawal's later radical actions and the endurance with which she accepts the imprisonment that follows.This endurance of Nawal through the atrocities she is faced with during her life before the final escape to Canada is mind-blowing. Death, abuse, inhumane conditions and life-lasting rage are emotions Villeneuve has captured with a divine skill.All pieces to the puzzle are gradually served to the audience (depends of how quickly you pick up on the clues) and the moment you realize what actually happened just stops your heartbeat for a second.Like many of the critics, I would have thought this film would win the Oscar for the best foreign film. It has everything a film should have to be more than welcomed to the Hall of Fame and a message that clearly, is immortal.",Incendies

The bads: Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong, way to long, especially the beginning of the film. I didn't care about the characters and i've found myself fighting against boredom for the most part. Nothing really happens until the 48th minute, THE 48TH MINUTE!! I didn't bought the plot in the first place; a twin's odyssey in the middle-east to meet an unknown brother and understand the mystery behind the mental illness of their dead mother; and that's too bad because i wanted to like this movie very hard, but i didn't. The ending is twisted at a point it became ridicule and laughable, i didn't bought that either... Yeah, i know, truth is stranger than fiction, but sometimes fiction pushed too hard is overkill.In my opinion the music didn't fit for a middle-east movie, for the most part at least. I mean, why not include some Twisted Sisters, Bon Jovi and Justin Beiber in the soundtrack once you are there? A bit of ""phrygian dominant"" would have helped.I didn't liked the structure either, i think they tried to make it too ""artistical"" or something, and it didn't helped the story.If you want your vacation to last longer, that 2 hours and 10 minutes felt like 5 hours, just saying...Not a bad movie, but not that great either.

What I will say is that this it is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The direction is superb, there are some breathtaking shots of the rundown, war torn Middle Eastern landscapes. The score containing various works from Radiohead is fantastic and really sets the bleak tone of the movie perfectly. I'll be honest and admit that I did not recognise any of the actors or actresses but they are all exceptional, particularly Lubna Azabal who gave one of the best performances I have seen in a long time.

Although everything about the film is quite well done - acting, cinematography, music - it's the cleverly crafted plot and the way it's delivered that takes the cake.

There is a lot of good here with an excellent performance from Poulin and some stunningly shot landscapes. The film goes back and forth in time but not enough to confuse though may be a little too subtle for some viewers. The plot is disturbing and ultimately shocking but again manages to portray this in a subtle way which is no mean feet given the subject.A real surprise and thrill to watch that never failed to mesmerize and shock at the same time.

149,miamijunge,Best Movie Ever,10,31 July 2012,"I have probably by now watched this movie over ten times, in counting all the times that I have shown it to friends. And every one of them loved it This movie I should not have liked, because it started a little bit slow. I didn't know what I was dealing with, and what significance the initial scenes would have throughout the movie. First the scene of the child whose hair is being shaved, then an ugly file room with a man standing there and then a will being read to two other protagonists. hmmm Definitely a boring movie. NOT SO... Approximately five minutes into the movie I was hooked.I have to admit though that I did watch the trailer and that I was attracted to this movie by the part where it was mentioned that ""your mother was not crazy."" This was enough to entice me to watch it. Throughout the movie, the facial expressions and display of emotions of the actors, especially the ones of Lubna Azabal were stunning. It made me an immediate fan of hers. The acting was just superb this movie all around.This is not your typical movie and not your typical feel-good storyline. It is something new and refreshing, something that I had not seen before. Very few movies made in Hollywood have good plots now-a-days. The few recent Hollywood movies that were memorable in my opinion were Doubt and Precious, because the plots were unique. With that said, I am usually underwhelmed by the lack of a good plot/story-line/twists, or just shocked at how they overstep the imagination in order to somehow come up with a "" TWIST,"" Watching Incendies was a great experience. This movie made me go on the search for non-Hollywood movies left and right.I read some reviews criticizing such things as Lubna's accent and how the scenery didn't match every aspect of Lebanon (the presumed country where this was taking place). I disagree with that finding, as after all, this is all fiction, and as such, it does not have to be 100 percent perfect. Being that I know that this is fiction, I understand and tolerate the fact that the plot development and culmination are unrealistic, but that's what art is all about. After all, this movie came from a play, correct? You might as well criticize the play, instead of the movie.Compared to the crap that Hollywood feeds us most of the time, I say that this movie is probably one of the best ever made. I could give this movie an 11 out of 10, because it really deserves it.",Incendies
150,walterradunsky,Another Muslim Propaganda Film,2,16 March 2014,"I can understand some of the attraction to 'Incendies,' as there are some well crafted elements of the film, including beautiful cinematography, superb acting, and a story that immediately draws the viewer into the world of its troubled characters. But what I find inexplicable, as well as frightening, is how so many people who have seen 'Incendies' appear incapable of seeing it for what it is, i.e., a Muslim propaganda film. While the protagonist of the story is an Arab Christian, her character clearly serves no other purpose than as a medium for illustrating completely unprovoked evils of her own people against the Muslims, who are all portrayed in this film as the most perfectly innocent victims one could possibly imagine. It is worth noting that the lead actress in Incendies also played a major role in 'Paradise Now,' a Palestinian film in which it is the Jews who are portrayed as the unprovoked tormentors of the Muslim people. While there have in fact been incidents of violence against Muslims by non-Muslims, there is a long and indisputable history of Muslims committing acts of violence upon not only non-Muslims but each other. And while I've seen much passion, beauty and poetry in films written by Muslims, I have unfortunately never seen a single one that even attempts to show any sympathy whatsoever with non-Muslims or that places any responsibility whatsoever upon the Muslim people for any kind of problem facing them. But equally disheartening is how many people--including some of those who are the objects of the lopsided demonization portrayed in so many Muslim-made films--subscribe to such blatant hatred and lies.",Incendies

In terms of a film, it scores 10/10 on every scale that a film can be rated on. Plot, interest, link to reality, beautiful cinematography without being artsy. If you do not like this film, then I imagine you simply just do not like films. People criticising it on IMDb were probably looking for a history documentary or TV drama. It is captivating from the start. And it really holds your interest right up till the credits show at the end.I read the summary of the film and I wasn't expecting much. A history quest in Middle East isn't a film I would go for, but that is totally the wrong description of this film. This film is about who you are and your history which starts from your parents and what we think we know and what is actual. In its essence, it is about a mother striving.Someone wrote that it's not a feel-good movie, but I disagree. It is a movie that jolts you back to reality and makes you count your blessings. But it doesn't shy away from the gruesome callousness of the world. It is a needed film because there is so much war in the world, especially in the Middle East, but the film doesn't try to patronise or teach us about war. The film is about a mother and her love.It is not a film to watch with your family and maybe not for the faint-hearted either.

152,maddox-richard,"Beautifully made tragedy but schematic, contrived.",6,30 July 2012,"Just watched it, hence the ramble... Such a beautifully-made film with terrific performances. I can see how many people find it an extremely powerful tragedy but I wonder if it tackles too much for its length and medium. There's only so much you can do and say in a 2 hour conventional-ish movie without overtly manipulating the audience.Personally I have a problem with many fictional films of this type though I understand my reaction is not the common one. To me, these films take extremely shocking or despicable events which 'could be real' or 'could have happened' and 'do sometimes happen'. They film these events realistically but they ask the audience to dive in and get into the story as you would a piece of riveting fictional drama, The Godfather etc. At the same time they insist the film has elements of reality or quasi-documentary - to have 'this is almost truthful' or 'this is currently happening' qualities. Yet the screenplay, the unfolding drama, is only as real as a Greek tragedy, say - it is carefully scripted and story-boarded to shock and amuse and provoke. It's a play. A drama. A movie. It's still only another The Godfather or The Matrix. It's not a documentary or a record of an event or events which happened. It's like having your cake and eating it - taking an irony-filled, message-laden 'impactful' stage play and putting it in the package of a realistic contemporary action-drama thriller mystery tragedy. I think if another director had played more on the fictional 'Greek tragedy', 'heightened ironic drama written for the stage' aspects I would have loved it. (Eg if the audience understood they were being manipulated for the sake of great drama.) Conversely I think if this director had made a similar movie based on a true story without the central shocking irony I would have loved it. He's a great director.Not meaning to 'compare' different films and different intentions, and perhaps conflicting some of what I have said so far: I liked the way Roman Polanski's 'Death and the Maiden' keeps the stage play aspects of the original. I didn't enjoy 'The Kite Runner's mixing of fact and fiction, and then its action rescue ending. I'm a fan of some films which take real events and work them into drama and then finish by revealing the actual protagonist in real life - Europa Europa is an example. I'm a fan of City Of God only because it is so obviously a complete fiction, a 'Hollywood' style shoot-em-up, rather than a 'state of address'. I'm a huge fan of Sergei Bodrov's 'Prisoner Of the Mountains' as a film depicting some themes of war and religious conflict in a fairly realistic way but somehow with a nice balance between 'this is just a filmed play' and 'this is something happening right now which carries some universal truths'.I don't comment that often on IMDb but I do think that for films of an extreme nature (such as Incendies' central twist) it is probably worth recording people's different reactions.Finally, I do think the director is one of the best of recent times and congratulate him on the film despite it not being to my taste.",Incendies
153,Barahir13,The most depressing film ever,4,26 March 2021,"This film made me lose hope to humanity. Although stories similar to this one are certainly true, art should give hope to people not take it away. Also the way the age of the protagonists was handled is a bit dumb. The father should be at least 50 at the end of the movie? But he doesn't look more than 35 imo. So it confused the hell out of me. Also it just happened that Marwan just ran into him in Canada, a huge ass country. Come on that was so lame. If he hadn't run into him she would have never written the letters in the first place so the whole story would have never developed. It feels so dumb. For just these points I can't give more than 4/10. Good cinematography but not an enjoyable movie for me after all.",Incendies

155,m_ats,Many flaws..,2,6 February 2011,"This is overall a ""nice"" movie with a deep message about wars and a few clever analogies, but it is somewhat too far fetched and unbelievable. Several movies like this one have been made, where a person is torn between two religions or ethnic groups since their birth and confronted to their origins when going on a quest (Greek vs. Turks, Armenian vs. Turks, etc.), but they don't need Radiohead to be entertaining. This movie shouldn't either. I also don't like movies that rely on spectacular coincidences. With everything else, it completely threw me off.Last but not least, the whole mathematical parallel was clumsy and appeared as a sign of ""trying too hard"" to be ""deep"" on too many levels. Anyone having studied maths at university will find the professors' characters (both Lebanese and French/Canadian) unreal. Maybe this worked better when it was a play. One can easily see the classic tragic themes and elements. But I didn't see it then.",Incendies
156,whistlerspa,Interesting but frustrating at times,6,20 August 2011,"This film got off to a difficult start for me. Having spent time in the Middle East the initial sequences were frustrating as I was trying to work out where the film was set. Also the fictional war between Christians and Muslims was not realistic, which added to my confusion. I couldn't 'normalise' this film then.Once I got over that, accepting it is a work of fiction or alternative history it them became easier to take on faceout of kilter value. The story was poignant and depicted human trials in a very realistic and gritty manner.The story is set around Nawal - a Lebanese(?) woman who has her first child taken from her at birth and years later in Canada has a nervous breakdown leading to her death. In her will she charges her twins to search for their father, and brother (whom they did not know about) to give them each a letter in a sealed envelope.Jeanne (the daughter) is prepared to do this but her brother Simon is reluctant and she sets off alone to the Middle East to begin the search.I'll say no more regarding the plot except that the search uncovers surprising events in their mother's past and a traumatic conclusion.Given the volatility of the region in which the story is set the events depicted could well have happened, but that she would send her children off on such a mission is not so believable.Overall cinematography is beautiful and I thought the script and acting was excellent. A good film but not, in my opinion, the great one that some are saying it is.",Incendies
157,rtneu,An intriguing movie that moves you completely and,8,10 April 2011,This movie moves you completely.It is a very intriguing movie that got me glued till the end. Every scene in the movie is important and has linkages to what happened earlier / what will happen later in the course of the movie. The movie depicts background of Palestine at the time the war broke and how it linked many characters in the movie through one woman.It is a first movie of Denis Villeneuve i have seen but it made sure that I would research and see more of his work.Lubna Azabal is totally into the character that she plays. She doesn't have verbose dailogues. Yet her fantastic facial expressions and her emotions speak volume about what she goes through in different phase of her life. Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette also do justice to their roles in the sense how their perspective on their mother changes and how the respect towards her only grows more and more as they come closer and closer to the what happened to their mother. All in all a great movie to watch. However this movie is not for a mass audience. If you like and intellectual movie with a strong serious storyline then you can definitely go for it. I give it 8/10.,Incendies
158,Ufo476,So outrageous it becomes blatantly funny!,5,29 July 2014,"I never thought it possible that a film with such heavy subject would have me laughing at the end! But thats exactly what happened. After depicting all the clichés that there are about the wars at the middle East (for most of the time, so efficiently and subtly that the movie went quiet well up to a point), and after having us convinced we are actually seeing a really good movie, it drops a twist so ""over the top "" that instead of delving us in shock, it just leave us there standing like in WTF happened now?MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD......So, the mother had an illegitimate child that was taken away from her (after the killing of her boyfriend by her family) ,who was then captured and trained from an opposite group, who was then later captured and imprisoned from the original group, and then in the blink of an eye changes his loyalties, becomes a tormentor, ends up raping his own mother, and the later, after encountering her son/rapist completely accidentally in the other edge of the world, collapses and dies but arranges to sent her offsprings to find their brother/dad for closure! (which she still loves of course!) Sorry, this is so extreme that it no longer seems horrible or serve us to transmit the dismals of war, it just becomes plainly laughable. If you ever saw a movie that tries so hard to make a point that it TOTALLY misses it, then that movie was it!In the background of course, there are masterfully presented descriptions of the horrors of war, especially civil war, which every nation who has been through this process knows how worst is from ""normal"" wars, but again everything is given with such extremity, crazy coincidences and the like that you can only accept it if you take them for their symbolic meaning. Unfortunately, the end is so extremely absurd that simply ruins the strength of the movie. Everyone knows what happens in wars. Sorry, such crazy development doesn't happen even in them.The saddest part is how many people embraced that movie, showing beyond a doubt how accurate the story about the naked king (H.C. Andersen) still stands today, both among the critics and the common people. But then again, there is no surprise there!In conclusion if you want to see a ""punch in the gut"" about such subjects, see ""Whistleblower"" (or Hotel Rwanda and the like), who truly deliver. This one is betrayed by the fact that it simply tries too much, and hence looses the realism that would give the movie its strength. Oh well, next time...",Incendies

165,trekhyon5,Family tragedy intertwines with geopolitical conflict in masterful ways,10,18 December 2017,"Before his arthouse-Hollywood fame Denis Villeneuve adapted Wadji Mouawad's play into ""Incendies,"" a powerful film combining family epoch, mystery, political commentary and psychological drama.It all begins in French Canada with what is kind of a goofy scene: in the reading of their mother's will twins Jeanne and Simon are tasked with a journey into the Middle East to find out about the secret life their mother Nawal led there before moving to Canada. That's where the goofiness ends. ""Incendies"" does have the infinitely complex plot structure of the most exciting and challenging thriller, but within that compelling structure lies an intricate web of meaning.The story alternates between different time levels, illuminating the twins' search as well as the hidden life of their mother. Villeneuve forces overwhelmingly devastating scenes on the viewer, taking his audience to the core of war in general and the conflict in Middle East in particular. This is definitely not a feel good flick; a lot of what I saw made me shake physically the first time around. Still, in the middle of all that hopelessness, all that human suffering and senselessness there are glimmers of hope. Few and far between as they might be they are still bright enough to prevail.At 130 minute ""Incendies"" doesn't contain one single unnecessary second. It's tight, emotionally resonant, intellectually challenging and urgently relevant on countless levels. It's not much of an exaggeration to state that this film is about everything in the sense that it covers the levels of individual experience, cultural processes, political workings and humanity in general. And it does it all exceptionally well. Having recently rewatched it after 7 years, I'm again completely dumbfounded.",Incendies

The ending of the movie itself - the resolution of the story where they finally find the father and the brother was amazingly shocking and it will haunt me forever.

I congratulate the whole crew who made this movie perfect and the best of luck for yet another mind blowing story which I will be waiting for. I suggest the movie to all those who have a brave heart and like to be disappointed from time to time even by things that we think or know that are the only truth, righteous, and very personal.I gave it 10 points although I did not want to categorize it in making it a movie to be ranked because it is way too different...

167,paparidgeback,Denis Villeneuve's mystery unfolds within the horror of civil war,8,10 August 2016,"""Incendies"" (meaning ""Scorched"" in English) is a Canadian mystery-drama and is as intense as any film I've seen. The story begins as brother and sister twins are read their mother's last will, a disjointed, delirious and despairing appeal that they travel to the Middle East to uncover the dark secret of their family history as a condition of fulfilling her last wishes. We're never told exactly WHERE the mystery story which unravels as Nawal's life takes place; at least no specific countries are named: all military raiment, weapons and vehicles are either generic or anonymous (best as I remember, even the university is simply ""The University""). On the other hand, the bus massacre is conducted by AK-47 wielding ""Christian rightists"" (the Phalange, if we assume a Lebanese parallel), the off-camera destruction of the orphanage at Kfar Khout was committed by ""nationalists"" (movie code for Lebanese Arab Nationalists) while Nawal's son was ""mercifully rescued"" by the Muslim warlord Chamseddine.OK, we get it. Even without naming a specific country or political cause, there's little doubt who's the off-camera bad guy whose regional presence provokes the conflict that is the movie's backdrop. But this is a movie review, not an exegesis on geopolitical policy or regional prejudices. Just be aware that a socio-political narrative exists, and accept that the film assumes secondary evils emerge from a primary source ... without directly saying so. The adult twins' quest quickly becomes a passionate and exhausting peregrination into the cycle of violence too often dismissed as endemic in the Middle East. Our persistence for staying with Incendies through to the climax is rewarded with the revelation that the incestuous consequence of personalizing anonymous violence to become internalized and incarnated into retributive action is the birth of an even greater and more loathsome lusus naturae: when we incubate malevolence and evil we risk becoming the wellspring of the evil confounding us.Although described as a masterpiece by some critics I have no desire to see Incendies again nor can I think of a good reason to recommend Incendies to casual viewers ... not because of excessive gore, gratuitous violence or sensationalized sexual content (Incendies is probably modest in this regard, given the film's setting) or because Incendies is a bad film, but because Incendies so effectively immerses its audience into the emotional horror and wretchedness of despair without extending a commensurate glimpse of either redemption or restoration.",Incendies

To fulfill these wishes, they must journey to her birth land in an unnamed Middle-Eastern country (based on Lebanon during the Lebanese civil war[3][4][5]). The movie contains a series of flashbacks to the mother's life (Nawal Marwan). Nawal, a Middle-Eastern Christian gets pregnant from a refugee (likely a Palestine refugee in Lebanon). Nawal's infuriated brothers kill her lover as they try to escape. She reveals to her grandmother that she is pregnant. They keep the pregnancy secret in order to save face. Upon the baby's birth, the grandmother tattoos the infant's heel, and they give the baby boy away. Nawal follows her promise to her grandmother to study in Daresh (a fictional city) during which a Civil War breaks out. Under threat of war, Nawal returns to find her lost son. War has preceded her arrival as she discovers her son's orphanage has been destroyed. She then pretends to be a Muslim to board a bus with other Muslims fleeing to get to the camp where her son has been moved to. On the way to the camp her bus is attacked by armed Christians. She and a Muslim woman and her daughter survive, only to have the bus covered in gas to be burnt. Nawal escapes by showing her cross. They would not spare the woman, so Nawal claims the other woman's daughter as her own. However, the daughter runs back to the bus and is shot. Disillusioned, Nawal joins a radical organization. She is planted as a French tutor for a prominent Christian leader and assassinates him. She is sent to prison, where she becomes known as the woman who sings. Before her release after 13 years in prison, she is raped by the torturer Abu Tareq. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to twins in the jail. A nurse secretly saves the babies and returns them to Nawal after her release. They emigrate to Canada. After her death many years later, Nawal leaves a will requesting that her children, Simon and Jeanne, find their father and lost brother. Simon refuses, but Jeanne continues on her own, following in her mother's footsteps. She finds her extended family, who refuse to speak to her because of the shame her mother brought on the family. She then finds the prison and learns from a former employee that her mother was raped and gave birth in prison. He gives her the name of the nurse who birthed the babies. Distraught, she calls Simon to join her. He arrives with their mother's former employer from Canada. They find the nurse and ask for the baby born in prison. Only when the nurse reports that their mother gave birth to twins, do Jeanne and Simon become aware that they have been searching for themselves the whole time. A local solicitor identifies the name of their lost half-brother as Nihad. He further manages to trace the warlord who seized the new orphanage where Nihad had lived following the destruction of the first, and arranges for a meeting. Simon learns that Nihad had been taken in by the warlord, turned into a soldier, and eventually became a torturer at the prison where their mother was held. He was then known as Abu Tareq. Having discovered that their father is their half-brother, they find out that he too had moved to Canada. They find him, and deliver the letters from the mother. We learn that after many years, while swimming in a pool, Nawal spots a man with a tattooed heel. Meeting her rapist and lost son again after so much time, she suffers from a stroke and dies shortly after. At the end, her son visits her grave after he learns what he had done to his own mother.From the names (Christian) and the fact that Nawal's lover is ""from the camps"", the Marwan family are likely Christian Lebanese (further, Maronite, since Nawal's uncle's name is ""Charbel""), while her lover is Palestinian. However, Nawal's accent, as well as her family's and most of the actors, is not Lebanese.",Incendies

After the first shock about the revelation, that the brother is the father and the torturer, I was asking to myself, how is it possible? the 1st baby was born when Nawal was.. maybe 20? OK, then she went to an uncle, an university and to a guerilla group. Overall it seems like maybe 5-10 years passed. In the jail she was raped by someone who looks like 25-30... We re thinking again from another perspective: Abou Tarek became a good sniper, it means, he should be about 20-25 and then he get caught and was trained to become a torturer and went to the prison. So at least he should be 25. Then he raped a woman who should be about 45-50, isn't it? And she became pregnant, while her body was being tortured?

174,Wasp-12-21-11,The Best Film of the Year,10,10 March 2012,"Although nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards, Incendies did not win, with the award instead going to In A Better World, a Danish film directed by Susanne Bier. While Bier's family conflict drama was a fine film in its own right, it lacked enough power, intrigue and narrative to sustain its two-hour length. Incendies may occasionally overstay its time, but there is no denying its raw emotional impact.When Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabel in deeply affecting form) suffers a stroke at a Quebec swimming pool, she spends the remaining weeks of her life silent. At the reading of her will before her two children, Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette), notary Jean Lebel (Rémy Girard) reveals not only that Jeanne and Simon's father – whom they believed was dead – is still alive, but that they also have a brother. Given an envelope each to deliver to their father and brother, respectively, their long and disturbing journey begins.Incendies is not an overly complicated film, but it does require a certain amount of attention, along with an even larger portion of believability as, towards its stunning conclusion, the viewer will have to rely on its stretched credibility. The final revelations of the film are sure to divide viewers. Some may see it as a nonsensical attempt to impress audiences with a shock twist, while others will view it as a harrowing but powerful reminder of the harshness of war, racism and violence.It cannot be said that Incendies is a perfect film – the film's length does occasionally stretch itself further than it should and it depends very much on coincidence. But for its flaws, Incendies makes up for them – Azabel's pitch-perfect performance as Nawal will shake the cores of even the coldest viewers, while André Turpin's stunning cinematography makes it almost impossible to believe that the story was once confined to a stage. It may not promise easy viewing, but Denis Villeneuve's fourth feature film is an outstanding achievement and will resonate with viewers across the globe for long after the conclusion.VERDICT: A superbly acted, astonishingly filmed and remarkably told masterpiece, with an emotionally staggering climax. 2011's finest film.",Incendies

176,latinmelkor,A touching film that depends on coincidences all the way up to ridiculous,6,25 November 2020,"I have written this review as a response to all those who find in this film a perfect jewel and label it as underrated (although in many sites it is highly rated and has more than 100,000 views). It is true that it is a very entertaining and interesting film, and I think that, for many viewers, the obvious weaknesses of the film are not so obvious.
Something that I liked and called attention to is the narrative structure. Some twins (female and male) find out from their mother's will that they have a brother and that their father is alive. The mother commands them to find them both. During the first part of the film, only the daughter decides to carry out her mother's wishes, and to do so she travels to a Middle Eastern country (which is never specified) where, as she travels through places that played an important role in her mother's life, we are presented with her biography through flashbacks. It is easy to feel confused at first with the factions (Christian and Muslim), because they do not correspond to a historical reality, but rather were made in the service of fiction. However, little by little, the viewer is able to put the puzzle back together and discover the hard life that the woman led in the midst of violence and intolerance.
The film has a lot of plot-twists that manage to arouse the interest of their audience and, to a certain extent, are presented in such a way that it is possible to glimpse them when they approach. Unfortunately, the film depends too much on coincidences of sudden and unexplained developments. About this, in many occasions I found elements that, although they should seem natural, were not very well explained and, of course, for the final outcome to happen the scriptwriters took the coincidences to the last consequences.
Although Nawal Marwan seems to live in a rural environment, she is able to move to a relative who works at a university. Despite the fact that at first she cannot read or write (at around 21 years of age), she soon manages to work at a newspaper writing articles. The screenwriters made Marwan a prodigious mind: even though she began receiving education as an adult, within a few years she is able to infiltrate as a tutor to the son of an extremist Christian leader she was tasked to kill, teaching him French and English. After killing this leader, she is finally captured and taken to a prison where she is tortured for no less than 15 years. After being raped by one of her captors and becoming pregnant, she is released (instead of executed) and, with the help of the warlord who benefited from the Christian leader's death, she's exiled to Canada.
The same pattern is repeated in the son's story. He is left in an orphanage where, ultimately, is recruited by an extremist Muslim group. There he is trained as a militia officer, a sniper. He is not just any sniper, of course, he is the most skilled and recognized of all. Eventually, the enemy faction, the Christians, manage to capture him, but, because of his ability, they decide not to execute him but to recruit him themselves (wasn't it supposed to be a holy war?) and, moreover, they do not train him as a sniper (there is no justification for it), but as a torturer. In his new job he ends up working in the prison where, by chance, his mother is. He unknowingly rapes her, she gets her pregnant and thus he becomes the twins' father and brother at the same time.
This is shocking and, I admit, makes one reflect on the way in which war separates people who, in peace, would live together happily. It is a sad and painful story, incisive and critical of the senselessness of war, but it is weakened by its dependence on so many unjustified elements. And, without a doubt, what put me most against the film was how the mother came to know that the one who raped her was her own son. In a swimming pool, the woman sees a man who, on his foot, has the tattoo with which she marked her son to identify him. Then, upon discovering his face, she is horrified that her son is the father of the twins, the rapist. The pain of the scene is diluted by the coincidences: her son emigrated from the country where he was originally and precisely that country is Canada and, besides, she finds him in a pool, where she can see his foot and recognize the mark. Finally, the son is unable to recognize her as his victim, so the man does not run away, fearing that he will be denounced for his past crimes. By leaving her will, the mother entrusts her children with the torturous task of discovering that they are their own brother's children, a task that would be impossible were it not for the fact that they are ""lucky"" enough to correlate the records and find the people who could lead them to the truth.
Although I have vilified the film, in reality it is a very beautiful film visually, with an impeccable performance and a catchy plot, but it depends on coincidences that become ridiculous and take it away from a perfect rating.",Incendies

181,glbawk,Not convincing,5,17 November 2010,"This film has some strong scenes but it is not close to what it could've been.As someone from Lebanon I couldn't take this film seriously(sometimes the drama bordered comedy for a native of Lebanon).The only fight between Christians and Muslims in the middle east was in Lebanon. But the characters speak different Arabic dialects, the scenery is from Jordan, some scenes hint to real historical facts but are totally off the mark. the parallel's with the war in Lebanon are so obvious yet so wrong.to sum it up. Imagine a film shot in Bresil about a war between confederate states and united states where the dialect is Australian and there's a scene which hint at the Abraham Lincoln assassination... Would you take such a film seriously?",Incendies
182,fatin-husien,Interesting but flawed,6,1 October 2018,"Incendies.I had a hard time with the name, I don't know if it sounds to tell much about the theme or does it really mean anything, I would have preferred 
"" the woman who sings"" 
I think it would have made it much more interesting.
But thats okay, now let's talk another the story, two siblings who are searching for their mothers past, only to discover that their father is alive and actually around them in the same foreign country they live in and , he is in fact their brother.
Alright, fine I can swallow that huge plot twist but the problem with this script it two vital elements that didn't add up, 
1) why would a mother who suffered so much want her two kids to know this ??? This is major plot hole that was never talked about, why on Gods earth would she want to send her beloved young daughter and son to that horror ??? And what point could it possibly be, we only learn that the guy tried to convince her otherwise but she ""insisted"" the knew who their father was (but why woman why ?) this comes right to the core of the pointlessness of the movie, because there is absolutely no reason, we therby find the kids utterly uninterested in the matter, the son does not even care if his father is alive, the daughter feels like a student doing a very hard homework and can't wait until she comes home and sleep, the girl although good actress, she failed to deliver her emotional part of the role, and at the end, they deliver the two messages to their father as if they are the mailman !!! I mean, I expected the guy to beat up his father or at least show up crying!! But NO they were near to emotional-less and again, utterly uninterested. 
Why couldn't it be that the daughter have somehow found out that her mother was raped in the war and wanted to go back for answers, thus finding out everything, why did it have to feel like a heavy assignment? And what was the point of knowing this if neither them nor their father/brother can do anything about it or even TALK about it !!!!? The second plot hole is the son/father ; we never really understand much of his character, like why was he a sniper in the first place, why did he switch loyalties, why God why did he happen to be at the same pool where his mom and kids are swimming, I mean Come on, Canada is a huge place!! How could this coincidence even feel believable? (At the same angle where the mother could see the black dots, she recognizes him righ away, she dies but not before telling her boss everything and asking him the nonsense letters thingy that benifets in absolutely nothing but complete horror and shame to all three of them) I am having a hard time understanding the purpose of this movie, I can take some extreme coincidences that adds up to the meaning before it, but here I find that the ending was only meant to be a plot twist for the sole purpose of shocking the audience, not to deliver a strong cause. 
If only it was the girl who wanted so badly to know who her mother was and not flash that picture to every human being in Lebanon, it would have made much stronger motive and therby sense of the movie.",Incendies
183,mimidjukic,I just want to point out two things to help you enjoy this brilliant movie.,9,30 January 2013,"There are two things I want to say here. The first is that while most of you know that the movie is based on a play, many seem to ignore that the play was also written in french, and therefore named Incendies, not Scorched. The Writer is one of my favourite persons in the world and his name is WAJDI MOUAWAD, so if you could stop calling him Mouhad it would make me very happy.But the second and most important thing I want to say regards the reviews that that criticized the ending of the movie for being too far-fetched and killing itself by going over the top. I probably would have agreed a little if I had no prior knowledge of Mouawad's work. So I feel the need to point out that it is a Greek TRAGEDY. It is part of a trilogy where no piece is linked to the other in any other aspects than themes, from what I gather (the two other pieces are called Littoral (coast) and Forêts (Forests)). I had the chance to read a bit of his work, including Incendies, before I saw the movie and once you are aware that this is a Greek tragedy despite the settings, you see it under a different light. Maybe it seems strange, but it works - and besides, Genius always does, right?Now that I've got that out of my system, I can skip to recommending you this movie with all my heart. I swear I am not saying that just because It's from Quebec (like me - if the spelling and grammar mistakes in this haven't tipped you off). The emotion won't need subtitles to pierce the screen. The choice of scenery and colours, the imagery, but mostly, above everything, the plot really makes it worth seeing. I love the fact that this is the movie that represents Quebec's cinema on the international scene. I love that it is a play that drives you deep into the middle-eastern world without exploiting the terrorism issues in a mediocre way. I love the fact that it isn't set anywhere particularly. I learn from the reviews that Mouawad was inspired by the Lebannon conflict, but it doesn't change the fact that it's not about the country or the nation but about humans.",Incendies
184,drumgod101,Better than Greek Tragedy!,10,4 July 2013,"Because it's so good, after watching Canadien/French Film Incendies for the second time, I thought that it must be based on a novel of play. I needed to find out. I now know that it is based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad. Mouawad is a Canadien writer, and to my delight, Incendies is part of a series of four plays. This means I have three more Incendies-like plays still to read. I won't go through a run-down of the plot, talk in abstractions about arch, characters symbiosis or lack-there-of. there are tons of proper film reviews out there already dealing with these topics. I thought I'd just talk about two things, the two things that I thought make this an outstanding film: Photography, and the remarkable unfolding of a dramatic story; better film critics than me, which is to say any real film critic, have said that this film pulls off tragedy better than the Greeks. The photography, the photography, the photography was just as good the second time as it was the first time I saw it. The film opens in a village that could be mistaken for Greece of Israel. At thought maybe this was set and shot in Palestine, but I think most of the film as actually shot in Jordan. Theses shots are actually set to portray a fictional Lebanon, both past and modern day. The history intertwined with the movie seems to be loosely fictional; I can't find any information on any of the places that appear in film. My Lebanese civil war history is a little rusty. Anyone else?There are two shots in particular that stand out. Both are shot at a distance to reveal the vastness of the landscape, unmistakably Mediterranean. Rocky, and the trees, not that I'm a tree expert, but they must be olive or fig trees, they are almost overused as prototypical symbols of the Med, but they work great. The first shot I like is actually two shots, meaning one type of shot that is used twice, almost identically. It's of a bus traveling on a skinny, mountainside road. At first, the camera is in close then pans way out to show the whole panoramic view, massive landscape, and tiny bus, a common technique in World films that are shot in exotic landscapes. The other shot is similar. It is later in the film. One of the characters is driving to a modern day Deressa Refugee camp and there is a shot taken from the sky of the winding roads leading up the side of a mountain. This shot is amazing, and whatever effects of filters the photographer added to make it fit the film's tone so well, I can't think of a better word to use to describe them, and the shot as 'cinematic.' I know that's a terrible term to use when describing Cinema, I really do, but a shot like this is so expressive and well-placed in the film, there is nothing going in the film here excepts visuals, the shot on it's own stands out as an artistic, filmmaking achievement.The storyline, the storyline, the storylineunfolds with the precision of a textbook tragedy. It sets up the conflict right off the top--- find missing brother and father. As the drama unfolds the story becomes more and more complex, adding twists and turns to the plot that we never even thought possible. In the end we are left with remains that challenge Oedipus the King in magnitude. (but without the fall from grace) The film still manage to exit the scene with a sparkle of hope. Forgiveness lets the audience breath a little easier as the film closes, a catharsis, but even then the story, the film, will haunt your subconscious for a good while after.

As I am learning French I thought it was a good chance to hear French being spoken. I was totally wrong about this movie. While I was watching it I could not move my eyes from the screen. The plot at first seems simple. Two twins are searching for their unknown brother. But nothing in this movie is at it seems. Nice acting , suitable soundtrack. And the direction is superb in my opinion. In the end of the movie when everything come to light I was almost with my mouth open. Movies usually do not surprise me, but this one actually did.

192,gherk-man99,One of Villeneuve's best,10,18 April 2019,"This film begins with a simple and captivating concept- a Mother dies, leaving some strange requests in her will about finding a lost brother and Father, which her twin son and daughter were not aware existed.
From the very first scene you can't help but be pulled in by the mystery behind the past of this woman. Through a series of flashbacks involving the Mother, we learn about her dark past as the twins try to unravel this last request their Mother left them.
This film is defiantly one of Denis' more dark and serious films. A lot like the film 'Prisoners' Denis would go on to make in 2013, Incendies is about the love that a parent has for her children, and the lengths she will go to protect them. Visually, this film is very saturated in shots of war zones, turmoil and Iranian landscapes. Each tense scene that takes place within Iran is as shocking and new for the audience as it is for the children. Obviously, with this being one of Denis' first films, he has a passion for making sound a big part of his films, as he displays in later films like Arrival, Blade Runner and Sicario. Every threatening sound comes across as quite jarring and real, only adding to the incredible sense of hostility he builds between the main characters and the antagonists. The biggest thing I can appreciate about this film is the way Denis does not underestimate or patronise his audience. He very carefully feeds you segments of the narrative so you can fully build it up in your head, but does not make it stupidly obvious. This is also his most political film, and although you don't need to know much about the conflicts in Iran in the 70s, it really adds to the depth and tone of the story, complimenting it very nicely. There were plenty of moments throughout this film that left me shocked and in awe at how visceral and surprising they were. So far, I haven't seen a Denis Villeneuve film that I haven't appreciated in one form or another, and he will definitely go down as one of the great directors in modern cinema history.",Incendies

202,Marlene_,Quite the disappointment,4,4 September 2019,"First of all, in my opinion, Denis Villeneuve is one of the greatest film directors of our time. Blade Runner 2049 and Enemy are some of the greatest films in recent memory, but this does not mean that all of his work has to achieve the same threshold of brilliance or even the the slightest bit of ingenuity. One such miss, I believe, is the 2010 movie Incendies.The plot follows Jeanne, a young up-and-coming mathematician, and her twin brother trying to uncover the mysterious life of Nawal, their deceased mother, and fulfill her last wish of giving a letter to their lost father and brother respectively. What we end up with is a melodramatic retelling of Sophocles's immortal tragedy Oedipus Rex with a somewhat meaningful commentary on religious extremism and the destructive power nationalism on the side.I believe that most problems of the film reside with the stupidity and the lack of foresight of Jeanne and her brother, impossible coincidences and the dubious motivations of of their mother. First, we know that Jeanne roughly knows how much and at what time did Nawal spend in the unnamed Middle Eastern country. We find out for ourselves the moment she visits the old university from Jeanne herself. Later on she finds out for how long Nawal spent time in prison from the school janitor and that she was raped and impregnated there. It is at that time that she found out that she got pregnant there as well. The twins age align perfectly with the time table given by the film. One would think that a mathematical prodigy like Jeanne would at least suspect a correlation, but no. What we get instead is an hour more of beating around d the bush culminating in the overrated and predictable reveal worthy of any Turkish/Spanish soap opera, i.e. that their brother is also their father, which brings me to my second point: the coincidences. Nawal just happens to unknowingly find her son in a prison who just happens to rape and impregnate her and there is obviously the moment when she conveniently stumbles upon him at the swimming pool where she could identify him by the tattoo on his heel in a completely different country almost twenty years later. This is some Star Wars level coincidence nonsense here. Thirdly, I simply reconcile Nawals need to tell the truth to her son. The film goes out of it's way to establish that Nihads personality is almost completely a product of the environment that he was raised in. This is something that Nawal certainly had the capacity to understand. We even see that Nihad made and active effort to become a functioning part of the society after leaving The Middle East. But thanks to the terrible realization of what he had done, his efforts will most certainly fall apart as he descends into a never ending cycle of guilt. I simply cannot find a way to justify Nawals choice of action. Sometimes, ignorance truly is bliss.Although I believe that ultimately there is more good than bad about the film, there are some interesting aspects of it. The acting of Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin is great and at moments superb. Social commentary had quite a bit of potential, but even this, I believe, was not explored to its fullest extent.All in all, I find this movie to be a complete mess and an overall disappointment.",Incendies
203,ixltoo,Disappointing Considering All Those Genies,4,18 March 2011,"I was expecting a lot more especially after all the awards the film has received. I was curiously zoning out in the middle act - the movie wandered about in the desert (literally)and I did not feel engaged by the characters at all.There seems to be some sort of ying-yang morality tale going on judging by the ending, but it lacked real emotional punch. I felt manipulated by the story. This was an extreme situation and maybe it was just too hard to suspend my disbelief. Given the source material, I'm not sure they could have done much.Having re-watched the Hurt Locker the night before I saw this film, I found that the cinematography lacks the clarity and point of view that Kathryn Bigelow's film does.

She was in university and then joined this band of terrorists, committed murder for them and then went to jail. So add another 10 years at max. How could her child be old enough to now be the executor in the same prison? It just don't seem to add up. Unless someone can believe this timeline.

208,milija17,Strong anti-war and anti-religion message,9,14 January 2016,"This movie isn't intellectual, let alone ""falsely intellectual"", as some claim it to be. This movie is just a powerful message against war, and I'd say against religion, as well. The author cleverly did not place the story into a particular country, cause the story is universal - war over religion makes no sense anywhere. Because religion doesn't make sense either, to start with. Sure, movie has a flaw or two, I'd say the greatest of them is the terrible cast for the role of brother, who couldn't probably act even in his high school, but miraculously ended here.I can't decide if the movie should have more ""pathetic"" and ""emotional"" in it, which could be done just by adding classical music. From the artistic point of view, it's probably needless. However, maybe it would reach more people, ""pathos"" would probably create greater emotional response, and the message would get farther.",Incendies

But Nawal doesn't know that. She never knew that until she died. She just identified the son in the swimming pool. that was all.

The surrealistic screenplay and photography wholly contributed to the mysterious nature of the story. It is a film the audience won't soon forget after viewing and leaves a lasting impression on the mind. No doubt it will be represented at the Oscars.However, this is not a movie for everyone. I admit my tastes fall into the political/action/thriller genre, but I do enjoy a bit of drama or mystery every now and then. That said, I was honestly a bit bored for the first forty minutes. If you are the least bit squeamish, or can't cope with the idea of years and years of torture and rape, or children being graphically shot and families massacred...then simply prepare yourself by reading the Parental Advisory or just avoid this movie altogether. I personally have a rough time with torturing women and lengthy imprisonment (can you imagine being locked in a room for decades, raped and tortured on a daily basis?).

This movie did this to me. Apparently, this director is a real up and comer after the success of other movies. After really enjoying Prisoners. and reading many good reviews on this movie, I decided to give it a go.This movie is in French and Arabic. If you don't understand those languages (which I don't), you will have to use subtitles. It is okay, though, because the story is so gripping that you will forget that you are reading subtitles shortly after the beginning credits.I'd list this movie as a drama/thriller. There are some very dramatic parts where it is almost hard to believe what is happening on screen.If you think you have a firm grip of what is going on in the movie, how it will all end, you are in for a big surprise. Please, watch this movie because it is truly one of the better films out there.

The strength of her character is shown throughout and she has done absolute justice to a person who would have to deal with such situations in life.Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin also plays her role to the script and her emotions are so natural and pulls u into the story. Maxim Gaudette does enough to warrant a good performance certificate.All other characters have been played well. Lot of research seems to have gone into the development of the script based on a play by Wajdi Mouawad who is the co-writer with the director Denis.

221,lord_91106,Exquisitely and beautifully brutal via a very contrived plot.,9,5 December 2011,"This movie is beautiful to view, but emotionally brutal in the end via its heavily contrived plot. There is a cinematic treasure here, to be invited innocently, first-hand, to view the ravages of a civil and religious war on an otherwise normal society - all played out within its stunning rugged countryside. We are walked through scene after scene with our central character guide to view the realities of war - how people suffer and learn to hate. This does not exclude the central character; even she responds to terrorism with a focused retaliative vengeance. But this is only the upper level of the story - the second level down is far, far darker: it is the Oedipus Legend on steroids. The analogy could be made that the central character, by turning to violent revenge as a way to compensate her loss, is instead herself revisited horrifically by her own decided actions. As a shadow horror, her offspring parallels and even exceeds this downward spiral track of malice. That what happens in this movie _could ever happen_ is truly a dramatic stretch, exceeding even the Greek myth makers. Therein, I had to balk.Furthermore - the loving - even transcendental deathbed reconciliation enounced by the main character, ""To be together is everything..."" seems, no matter how many times I try it out in my normally wildly idealistic mind, too idiotically simple to cover what travesties have befallen in this tale. Can we swallow a forgiveness more Christlike than Christ?",Incendies

Adorable french Canadian accent (I'm french, I love what our cousins have done with our common language ). A Quebec thriller, yeah !Rapidly, first eyebrow raisers... What Arab place are they talking about like everyone should know about it ? Never heard of it...Then you realize the Arab country they are going to is just an archetypal Arab country, non existent. A caricature of many seen-on-TV Arab countries... OK, why not, I suppose Americans (as people living on the American continent) have a lesser history burn with Arab countries than Frenchs, for example, do, and have no problem building a make-believe Arab country just for the sake of... what? At this point, I supposed the filmmakers wanted to make some point about Arab or religious wars... or terrorism... ? Since they are Canadians, not Unitedstatesians, I was hoping maybe for a not so obvious / good vs bad kind of story... But I was really wondering what was the purpose of all that.The story goes on, civil war, religious war, slaughter, all fake, all archetypal, OK, but to what end? What's the point?And then, you finally get the answer, at the end of the movie, with one unforeseen big plot twist.And then you realize the Arab story is absolutely irrelevant. The same plot could have been set in any archetypal place with a credible history of violence and torture... South America? Former Yugoslavia? Caucase? Heck, actually, since the prison/torture part is altogether sufficient to hold the whole movie, the very same movie could have been set just about Guatanamo (and viewers would then believe for one hour they were watching a anti-US movie, only to realize at the end the total irrelevance of all that)At the end of the movie, you get that astonishing plot twist, which makes you realize the vast vacuity and uselessness of all the side stories you have been watching for the past hour. But, OK, what next ? What to do with that extraordinary situation ?Well, nothing. Movie ends here. Tadaaaa.And loopholes appear : there's obviously a wrong choice of actors : one of them should really look like twenty years older that what he looks like. The lawyer, since he wrote all three letters, should have understood much earlier the whole thing: it never shows that he knows more than the others participants to the quest. Weird.Good acting. I loved the actresses. The boy is deliberately annoying, and he does annoy me, so I guess he is a success too.On the whole, a waste of time, the feeling of having been cheated, using a deceitful setup for a story that could hold in three lines.I do suggest, instead of watching this movie, reading the Robert Heinlein 1953 short story ""All you zombies"".

He has been designated to read the will of their mother, who had been his secretary, Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal). Her last wishes are quite bizarre. She wants them to deliver two sealed letters: one to the father they thought was dead and the other to a brother they didn't know they had. In addition, Nawal wants to be buried ""naked, no prayers, face down, away from the world.""Jeanne realizes that many mysteries have gathered behind these last requests, which could explain her mother's silence in the final weeks before her death. Although she immediately decides to go the Middle East order to untangle the family secrets, her brother, who found his mother's craziness to be an embarrassment, decides not to accompany her.Through flashbacks, we learn that Nawal grew up in a Christian family but fell in love with a Muslim. Her enraged brothers kill him and scorn their sister for bringing shame upon the family. Her grandmother protects her from her avenging siblings and delivers Nawal's baby. He is put in an orphanage, and she flees the country.Through another flashback, we see Nawal trying to locate her son years later. In the most terrifying scene of the film, members of a Christian militia slaughter a bus load of Muslims; Nawal escapes after identifying herself as a Christian. Her rage is so great that she switches allegiance to the Muslim faction and assassinates the Christian leader. Nawal is sentenced to 15 years in prison and endures torture and rape. Her survival strategy involves singing.Jeanne visits her mother's village and discovers that the women there have no knowledge of her father but have nothing but contempt for her mother who betrayed the community. In support of Jeanne, both Simon and Jean join her in some crucial meetings with a midwife and the Muslim who engineered Nawal's actions as an assassin.Incendies is directed by Denis Villeneuve who claims that the title refers to an inferno that leaves ""something totally destroyed, totally transformed . . . Destruction that you cannot change afterwards."" This combination family drama, political thriller, and survival saga is based on a play by Lebanon-born writer Wajdi Mouawad. Incendies does convey the dehumanization of civil war, the horror of genocide, and the scourge of unbridled violence that takes the lives of innocents. The film was Canada's submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2010 Academy Awards.Lubna Azabal gives an incredibly intense performance as Nawal, a resilient woman whose life is smeared with so much blood that she turns to anger as a way out. Melissa Desormeauz-Poulin puts in a stellar performance as her daughter Jeanne who wants to connect with her mother by learning all there is to know about her.",Incendies

I've been a member of IMDb for 12 years and most of the time the ratings on here kind of show me whether a movie is good or bad. Not so with 'Incendies'. It is rated 8,3 and is in the top 250, I can not see why that would be so. There is absolutely no depth to any character, no motivation, no background. The problems in some unknown unspecified middle east country are black and white. The only reason why you would make it so is that you do not want to do any research to make the situation believable. But the nail in the coffin was the unbelievable (literally) story. How did the writer get away with such a plot? At least when you read Sophocles you know there is much more to it than just the plot. This was embarrassing, all the more because it is in the top 250.Maybe people don't know what a good movie is anymore, there aren't many made nowadays that make it to most movie theaters.

245,eloveharris-1,Emotionally engaging mystery and drama,9,1 June 2011,"My husband and I were both very impressed and emotionally engaged throughout the whole film even though we had seen the play Scorched which we both considered the best play with deep meaning we had seen in years. Let me recommend the play, too, whether or not you've seen the movie. Someone said the play is 4 hours long. It may have been but I don't remember a boring moment, though I remember parts that aren't in the movie. The movie, nonetheless, is whole and complete.The characters of the mother and her twin daughter and son are all extremely sensitively portrayed by the actors. Without flashbacks to the emotionally distant and confusing parenting they received from their mother, you are able to imagine the wounds they received, compounded by a complete lack of knowledge of the reasons. The daughter, Jeanne, seems to have dealt with this by becoming a student of pure mathematics. The professor to whom she is a TA welcomes the students to the world of abstraction and solitude. Her brother Simon simmers in rage.After their mother's death, they embark on a journey of discovery their mother stipulates in the cryptic and startling instructions in her will. The journey leads first Jeanne and eventually Simon to Lebanon. They discover the origins of their mother's wounds, little by little, as they learn of her difficult (an understatement)life as a young adult in a country with unforgiving moral standards for young love relationships and at war with itself. As the viewer, you see this difficult life of the mother through flashbacks of her coming of age in horrendous circumstances, as her children in the present day learn of her tortured life and of her determined strength.The movie, as does the play, provides the audience an opportunity to see what may lie hidden behind the face of distance, withdrawal, or rage in others. It encourages compassion for ourselves and others whose demeanor is simply a survival mechanism to deal with wounds which you may not know or understand. It also lets one experience vicariously (thankfully)the horrors of war, especially, war based on revenge for personal and ""tribal"" atrocities. All of this makes us more whole, more compassionate, and less quick to judgement of good or bad in a very complicated world.",Incendies

One envelope reads ""For your father"" and the other reads ""For your brother"". The kids are in a shock after they come to know that they have another brother. The boy, having hatred in his heart for their mother, denies doing anything with those envelopes and thinks of moving on with their lives. However the sister is sensitive and thinks of following the trail back to their mother's past and dig the links as their mother's last wish. The story starts from here.The plot is set in an imaginary place named ""Daresh"". After being impregnated by her lover and after her family comes to know about this, her brothers kill her lover and almost killed Nawal too. The grandmother somehow pities on her and asks her to deliver the child. The grandmother then asks her to leave the village and move to town, without the kid as she gives away the kid, the village not being safe for Nawal anymore. Nawal moves into city, starts working with University's radio station, learns French but the desire to find the whereabouts of her child is still burning within her. With the same desire she starts tracking back her child and comes to know that the kid was given to an orphanage in South (a place dreaded to be full with extremists).She then gets caught for killing a Nationalist politician and spends 15 years in jail. The movie talks about her sufferings while being a single mother, being away from her child, being in jail and being in a society so full with hatred and revenge. Her ordeal in keeping a secret, facing the torture and yet forgive the torturer, and above all be rational about everything is captured very beautifully in the movie. Also the movie shows us what kind of world surrounds us and we have no idea of. See this movie to watch what a woman have to go through in a life in extreme situations and what being a mother means.

Such a pretty film with a good cast, you are just watching to find out if the production costs are worth the story. It is. To think of it like that, in retrospect, is at the very least showing how little it takes to please us. The moving watching public. Could this film have been made in the US? It is so true to the story and unforgiving in every way. In the states, the movies we see are a result of test screenings, dumbed down plots and studios that are looking for maximum profits (""all hail the American corporation machine""). This film is not an easy movie to watch. First of all the whole thing is in subtitles and some of it not even, and doesn't pull any punches. It's was like they said ""not everyone will get it, not everyone will give it a chance, and most people won't even be exposed to it, but we will say, what we want to say. As an American it was the most connected I've been to an Arabic movie. It is a new generation of film for the world. There are no ""terrorists"" with ""WMD's"" just honest characters and epic performances. We always heard that there were atrocities in this region, but any portrayal I've seen, seems to stop at the stereo typical Arab that is on CNN/Fox. This movie goes beyond that, it's set production is great, costumes, angles of photography are brilliant. So many little extras that make up a great movie. On top of a story that any person, any where could understand. It is appalling and beautiful all at the same time. I hope this hasn't created feeling like you are about to watch, (insert any comic book movie here,) this is real. And emotional. And a tough movie to comprehend. It is just amazing....",Incendies

250,freddyatali,Exquisite,10,21 September 2010,"Denis Villeneuve has created nothing less than a masterpiece. This film is revealing a great Director, especially when given an original story with such powerful dimensions.Despite being skeptical as first of the film being shot in Jordan, when dealing with the very specific, multidimensional Lebanese drama, the geographic distance with the land of Lebanon is detaching the film from the strict reality of the place and taking it to whole other level of significance. Jordan's landscape especially with the film's photography, are somewhat surrealistic, as if the story was taking place in a deep level of the region's sub-conscious.Villeneuve has managed to delicately craft a story with dimensions that a human mind in its normal condition is not prepared to understand and confront. And yet these things did happen, many times during the war and retelling them is a very not an easy task. Actually a quasi impossible one and yet Villeneuve did it.This has to be the film representing Canada at the Oscars. And it will win.",Incendies

The film also has something to say on the nature of hate and violence. Unfortunately this wonderful film will neither be seen nor appreciated by a wide audience.

For almost the whole movie i thought this was going to be a story about religion hate violence and in the end that it was going to leave me devastated with sadness but still with a hope that those who believe in love how painful the journey yet may be, it would leave you with the possibility to heal and knowledge about something very important.I would like to write more because im feeling so sadly disappointed, but i will not i just want to warn you going to see this story that it ends with a sick twisted story about a son raping his mother without knowing it and who give birth to twins trying to find out about their history after their mother has died. How could you destroy this movie in times like this when people are trying to understand the violence of terror, with all those people trying to find a lasting understanding about the meaning of life, their are so many people that are suffering from situations in their life and i think that you let them down. This is not a movie this is just a big disappointment.",Incendies

I was so impressed after watch it, that for next few days i was lost in thought. Very powerful drama, one of the best ever. Just watch it !! I watch it months ago and I'm still under impression. The story is about love, hate, war, forgiveness . Brother and sister are looking for their roots - father they didn't know and surprising cognition: another brother. Their mother left them with a big bag full of shocking secrets. Very shocking secrets. 1+1 is not always 2. I could not imagine someone living with such a weight on shoulder. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.",Incendies
255,buzz75,unbelievably superficial,3,18 September 2013,"I have not watched something so utterly superficial and falsely intellectual in ages, and I am not really one of those demanding types at all. It goes along well with other moronic attempts such as Jolie's film about the war in Bosnia. This ""masterpiece"" is set in an inexistent land (?), with the political situation and other circumstances resembling to those of Lebanon. The resemblance with the real life stops there. What follows is a chain of unrealistic and senseless occurrences, which aim to shock the viewer, but it is actually going from bad to worse each minute. All in all, this is pathetic attempt to elucidate the sense of human suffering and get an insight in destructive forces within through the portray of society in a spiral of violence. Bad, stupid, boring, and more Hollywood than anything I have seen lately.",Incendies

257,sidneywhitaker-294-45147,"A grim, baffling tale",4,16 February 2012,"INCENDIES-- If you can watch the film right through, you will be properly horrified by the inhumanity of man to man, and the fierce grimness of life, for simple people in a barbarous middle-eastern wasteland of destruction. But first you will be baffled and frustrated by the breaks in continuity, in location, and in action... A swimming pool,empty--then suddenly with one glamorous female swimming under water, (used no doubt for ""artistic symbolism""); then oddly populous; then a hospital scene. Incoherence, and grimness, are the keynotes.The ""twins"" introduced near the outset, are given a heart-rending puzzle to solve when their mother's strange will is read out. Jump cuts offer no help to the viewer trying to follow this trail. But the prevailing mood of tragedy, danger, hostility pervades.Against the film-world hype and ""glamour"" of the award (director's interview among the Extras), I find it to be artistically self-indulgent, the director drawing on the pathos of tragedy in order to display his originality and talent.",Incendies

Child murder, mass slaughter, sons raping mothers - who wants to tolerate that sort of barbaric behaviour??? Not only is the storyline so extremely fetched,physically and emotionally violent and so sick and twisted that you can't actually believe what you're watching, but there is a really dangerous religious message to the story too. There are a lot of annoying things about the film too, like where are they? Why do they fight? which time are we in? It keeps going back and forth in time. Why does the son look about 40 when he was meant to be abput 19 and then doesn't recognise the woman he raped systematically? Why are the ""twins"" supremely intelligent being a product of their brother and mother- surely they would have some birth defects being so closely related? Why do none of them age in appearance throughout the film, making it impossible to gauge what's going on? And what on earth is the 1+1=1 about???I pity the person who's troubled mind could even make up such a story...",Incendies

I guess this movie was given extra credit because: it is a ""author"" movie, and it is about a harsh Arab tragedy.The story and actors are not bad. The cut of the movie is.The director needs to cut its movie so the story can really flow. In Incendies many scenes are long with unnecessary still picture, or traveling.The ""Author"" would say you need time to convey a story with feelings. BS.

Stuff happens and you'll be like NO WAY and then the film goes even further and you'll be like WHOA OKAY WHAT and then even further and you'll be like OH MY GOD and then even further still and you'll be like HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING OH MY GOD PLEASE and then it'll just keep going even further and further and further and by the end of the film you'll just be a steamy, shattered mess like I was.Characters and events throughout are depicted with the subtlety and prowess of a master filmmaker. I don't want to spoil anything, but there were numerous moments in the screening that I attended when the audience was vocally reacting to moments on screen that were extremely visceral and affecting.

And at the end the person will suffer most would be definitely you. I always hate war thought I know the cruelty of war.

I will leave the plot line out for the benefit of the audience. The film is in French/Arabic, so English viewers will have to go by the sub-titles.The film shares it's secrets in layers - when you've watched one layer and think you've seen it all, you're presented with another that is far more complex and visceral than the previous one and so on and so forth until the film explodes in a shattering climax that will leave you reeling. I remember being stunned as the credits rolled and have never recovered. I decided to own the DVD because I haven't watched such a great thriller in years.The direction and cinematography is a work of art. The acting is excellent and Lubna Azabal is phenomenal.

Do your own research to find out that this film is merely a tool in creating one of the most untrue stories ever told during one of the most difficult times in human history. The author of this story is Muslim and apparently in his story his characters live in an alternate universe were there are no Muslim terrorists instead, a very small minority, namely Christian Maronites are terrorists who cease another's life for out of wedlock pregnancies and are busy running rampant throughout the Middle East committing mass murders.Please check out the Damour Massacre where 582 Maronite Christian civilians were annihilated by Arab/Palestenian refugees residing in Lebanon. These perpetrators, an army of thousands (Muslims including PLO refugees) attacked and killed these Maronite Christians reportedly stating during their attack that they were offering a hollocaust to Muhammad. Nice!I am all for freedom of speech but producing a film based on the writings of such screwed thinking is a jagged pill to swallow. If this is possible perhaps there will be a film in the near future exonerating Hitler and depicting him as some sort of persecuted victim.

Either way, it certainly is a film worth talking about. An extraordinary film. I agree with the review concerning the violence ; it was handled very sensitively by Villeneuve.
