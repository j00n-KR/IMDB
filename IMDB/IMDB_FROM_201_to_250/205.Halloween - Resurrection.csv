0,TheLittleSongbird,Proof that the 'Halloween' series should not have been resurrected,1,16 January 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween H20' is the one exception and the fourth film is also watchable. 'Halloween: Resurrection' is the worst offender. One of the worst sequels ever, of the genre and any genre, and one of the most pointless. 'Halloween H20' was a perfect place to stop the series, to have it resurrected so badly and in a way that disgraces the 'Halloween' name to intelligence insulting degrees is enough to make the blood boil. The only halfway good thing is Jamie Lee Curtis and she and her iconic character are written out in such a slap in the face way in a scene that is anything but creepy or suspenseful. Sadly that is the one scene that actually feels like it belongs in a 'Halloween' film.Curtis aside, the acting is absolutely dreadful. By far the worst acted of the sequels, yes worse than the 'Revenge...' and 'Curse...', with the embarrassment that is Busta Rhymes being the biggest offender. The entire cast of characters are far more annoying than Tina in 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers' which is quite a feat.Laughably awful dialogue, in a script that shouldn't have been approved beyond first draft if even that, can also be found. The film is even more ineptly directed than Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers' and the non-horror scenes in 'Season of the Witch'. Visually, it is far too gimmicky that it severely gets in the way of the atmosphere.The music, after improving drastically in 'H20', is even bigger a drawback than in the fifth and sixth films, no it is no longer one of the best assets like it was in the first four films. Here it sounds cheap, goofy and just doesn't fit in placement or in tone. There is nothing remotely creepy, tense, suspenseful or even entertaining here, the deaths cause unintentional laughs, nothing creative or shocking.The atmosphere is just ruined by that, gimmicky filming, a paper thin, confusing and ridiculous story that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, terrible dialogue and acting, intelligence insulting stupidity (Rhymes versus Michael, the nadir of the entire series bar none) and erratic pacing (mostly dull).In summary, should never have been made, an unforgivably poor quality and pointless excuse of a sequel and a film. 1/10 (a rare rating for me these days but this deserves it).

1,Leofwine_draca,Waste of time finish for an increasingly irrelevant series,3,25 July 2016,"It comes as little surprise that HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION was the last film in the long-running HALLOWEEN series (except for the new Rob Zombie 're-imaginings'). It's a real stinker of a movie, totally devoid of any kind of originality and playing out its storyline with an inane mix of seriousness and goofiness, never really working as a straight film or a spoof. It's heavily indebted to two films: SCREAM, what with the self referencing and the self-aware nature of the hidden cameras, internet webcams etc., and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, with lots of mock-grainy video camera footage used in an attempt at atmospheric scares.HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION begins in a totally unacceptable way: by killing Jamie Lee Curtis' character, Laurie Strode. Apparently, Curtis only agreed to appear if she would be killed off, so the scriptwriter decided to have her do something extremely stupid (and anybody who knows her character, especially from the first film, would know that she would never do something this crazy). Once that unpleasantness is out of the way, we're back into the predictable teen slasher mould, with a bunch of teenagers hooked up in the Myers house, having sex and smoking drugs until Myers himself turns up to bump them off. This film tries to update the plot into the internet age, so characters use palm-top computers and communicate online rather in real life, although oddly nobody seems to use a mobile phone much. It's all rather pointless.The stalk 'n' slash sequences are amusing rather than frightening, and the cheesy gore effects are just that: all effect, all put on, without any impact. There's also one of the dumbest-looking severed head gags I've seen in a movie. The teen cast is pretty awful, with the ladies particularly ill-represented. Bianca Kajlich is an uninteresting heroine, and the rest of the girls are either bimbos or, in the worst case, Tyra Banks. Not that the guys fare much better: the two familiar cast members are American PIE's Thomas Ian Nicholas (he's offed quickly in a gag ripped from HOUSE) and black rapper Busta Rhymes, whose kung fu schtick come the climax is frankly embarrassing. This time around, Myers isn't in the least bit frightening, and he's played by a stuntman who should have stuck to doing stunts rather than trying to act menacing. The only decent thing about this film is the classic HALLOWEEN music, and even that was better in the original.",Halloween - Resurrection
2,SnoopyStyle,Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the pay in fifteen minute opening,4,16 April 2016,"Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is catatonic locked in an asylum after the last encounter with Michael Myers. She is faking it and he is still after her. He stabs her in the back and sends her off the roof. Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), Rudy Grimes (Sean Patrick Thomas) and Jen Danzig (Katee Sackhoff) are friends studying in Haddonfield University. Jen signs them up for a reality show at the Myers house. They are joined by Bill Woodlake (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Donna Chang, and Jim Morgan in the show run by Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) and Nora Winston (Tyra Banks). Myles Barton is in a chatroom relationship with Sara. Unknown to them, the six reality TV guests are locked in the house with Michael Myers.Despite any possible retcon, the first fifteen minutes are still the best part of this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is Halloween every bit as much as Michael Myers. The rest is something else. Whatever it is, it's not Halloween. The reality TV idea is annoying and it gets worst with the intermittent reality TV camera work. I like a few of the actors, but Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes really lower the likability factor. It's so bad that I am more interested in everybody getting killed. I don't care if any of them survive.",Halloween - Resurrection
3,claudio_carvalho,Not So Bad,7,23 May 2004,"Three young men and three young women are invited to spend the night  in the house of Michael Myers, in a type of `Big Brother show'. Michael Myers is in the house and the slaughtering of the participants of the show is broadcast transmitted. I really expected a movie worst than that. But in the end, it is not so bad. The problem is again the use of cameras like in `Blair Witch Project'. It shows a total lack of originality of the director, in a formula that is getting the viewers tired. Anyway, the movie is a good entertainment for fans of this series. The participation of Jamie Lee Curtis is minimum. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): `Halloween Ressurreição' (`Halloween Resurrection')",Halloween - Resurrection
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"You can't fault them for trying, but it's not good.",4,25 September 2018,"The people behind this film tried to give audiences what they wanted, slasher movies had been big news, and the Halloween franchise seemed to fit well for that genre. The opening scenes I really liked, indeed they're the best part of the movie, slick, menacing, and that music is just incredible. Reality TV was still very popular, and you can see why they came up with this plot.Sadly that's the end of the good news, from there on it's downhill, I personally disliked the story, they had no qualms about cheapening the legacy of the great Halloween. It's tacky, the production, plot, characters lack any sense of quality, only the music stands out well. The behaviours of all characters are nonsensical, you keep saying to yourself 'would they really do that?'They tried, but failed. 4/10",Halloween - Resurrection
5,gavin6942,Failed Mix of Halloween and Reality Television,4,24 November 2010,"Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now in an asylum, where she awaits the inevitable return of Michael Myers. Myers, after visiting her, returns to his childhood home and makes a nightmare for a group of kids who have decided to film a reality show inside the house.First of all, this film pretends that Halloween 4 through 6 never happened, creating the possibility that the Myers house has been abandoned for decades, rather than lived in by other families. This reboot is a result of the writing on H20, but it was still a bad idea no matter who started it.Second, one would think that bringing in Rick Rosenthal would be a good idea. He made ""Halloween 2"", which was probably the last solid part of the franchise. But Rosenthal is clearly not the horror directing master we might have thought, as he approaches this film with a weak vision and sense of style, more emulating MTV than his own work. A quick glance at his credits will explain this: he has spent the last twenty years making teenager-based television rather than horror films.Next, add Busta Rhymes. Like its previous installment with LL Cool J, this is the point in the series where a rapper is added to the mix. Much like how many horror franchises ultimately ended up in space, many started adding rappers to the cast. Why? I do not know. But it does nothing to help the credibility of the picture. Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks do not have the appeal for horror fans that other actors would have.The POV camera thing is a mess. It looks bad and is more or less a bad idea. Yes, it has worked in such films as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and more recent excursions. It does not work here. Had they cut that aspect out entirely, this film would have been a bit better instantly.No horror franchise took as big of a nosedive as ""Halloween"", with this being the final crash landing. Reviews of this film were so poor, and viewer appreciation so weak, it's very unlikely they will ever make another one in the series. Yes, they made the two Rob Zombie films after this, but I just like to pretend that never happened.",Halloween - Resurrection
6,jboothmillard,Halloween: Resurrection,1,28 July 2009,"From director Rick Rosenthal (Halloween II), I had heard a few things about this sequel, I guess I just wanted to see what I thought and whether I agreed with the critics. The film starts three years after the events of H20, with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in psychiatric care after chopping the head off Michael Myers. In a small series of flashbacks you find out that it wasn't actually Michael (Brad Loree), it was another man in his costume (which makes no sense whatsoever). He manages to get back to Laurie, and in attempt to kill him she and he end up falling off a roof, with Laurie getting his knife in her chest. You'd assume Michael would stop killing once his sister is dead, but no, TV producer Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) is setting up the reality TV show DangerTainment inside the house that young Michael grew up in. A bunch of thrill-seeking volunteers have agreed to live and be filmed by various cameras inside this house, with no way out. The volunteers are Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Donna (Daisy McCrackin), Jen (White Noise 2: The Light's Katee Sackhoff), Bill (American Pie's Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Scott (Billy Kay). Obviously not long after they have entered Michael shows up to murder all the volunteers, and Freddie was planning to scare them dressed as Michael, and it takes a while for the viewers of the show to realise what is happening is real. In the end, it looks like Michael Myers is killed in a fire started, but when he is taken to the morgue his eyes open, so he could be alive (of course!). Also starring Luke Kirby as Jim, Ryan Merriman as Myles Barton, Tyra Banks as Nora and Rick Rosenthal as Professor. The violence is limited, Curtis has a pathetic final appearance, the performances are all dull, the camera work looks like a crap attempt at The Blair Witch Project in places, it is just a boring attempt at a revamp for an already dying series. Poor!",Halloween - Resurrection
7,BA_Harrison,Myers Little Eye.,4,12 November 2011,"In order to wring one last drop of blood from this extremely tired series, the makers of Resurrection come up with a really moronic reason for Michael Myers to be still alive, after which they ill-advisedly proceed to kill off Laurie Strode (sacrilege!) and then set-up the lamest possible excuse for yet another teen slaughter—the filming of an internet reality show in the old Myers house (still standing after all of these years).Now I thought H20 was bad, but this chapter in the Halloween franchise hits an all time low: a dreadful cast (featuring Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks, ferchristsakes!) pointlessly struggle to make the most of their awful dialogue; the ridiculous plot introduces some truly inane developments (do many suburban houses have a secret network of tunnels running beneath them?); and director Rick Rosenthal chucks in just about every cliché going plus a few dumb ideas of his own for good measure.Busta Rhymes doing kung fu on Michael is pretty idiotic, but for me, the worst thing about this whole film is the fact that the producers of a reality show go to all the trouble of organising auditions, setting up a website, and installing all manner of electrical equipment, but use cameras that give a picture quality worse than a 10th generation VHS tape that's been left next to a powerful loudspeaker for a week. However, I'm sure you'll find your own favourite reason to dislike this mess: there's plenty to choose from.3.5 out of 10, rounded up to 4 for the gratuitous bewbz and some brief chainsaw action.",Halloween - Resurrection
8,moonspinner55,"""Inside all of us there lurks a dark, malevolent figure...a kind of boogeyman, if you will.""",1,2 November 2017,"Three years after decapitating the wrong person instead of unstoppable maniac Michael Myers, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, in a cameo) has been committed to an asylum, apparently catatonic but actually lying in wait for Myers to track her down--he does. That's just the prologue, however; the rest of the film is made up of Haddonfield University students taking part in an internet reality show that will deliver them back to Myers' childhood home on Halloween to ""look for answers."" Directed by the inept Rick Rosenthal (who fumbled ""Halloween II"" in 1981), this generic installment catches viewers up on the previous effort, 1998's ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"", utilizing flashbacks--only then to have an intern at the asylum fill us in on Myers' entire criminal history, a checklist of murders. I'm surprised Dimension Films didn't try to save money and plug the whole movie with flashbacks. A stabbing here, a gutting there. Curtis gets off easy; not so the rest of the cast, nor any audience who stays to the end. * from ****",Halloween - Resurrection
9,Coventry,Big Brother is Slicing You!,4,12 November 2006,"Surprise, surprise! It wasn't Michael Myers' head that got chopped off by Laurie Strode at the end of Halloween H²0... It was all just a terrible mix-up and some poor random bloke got decapitated by accident! After re-watching that film recently, I was wondering what explanation they would come up with to attach Michael's head back onto the rest of his body. The first ever successful medical head transplant would have been a little too grotesque, even for a desperately long-running slasher series, so I guess this ""twist"" is the most acceptable excuse imaginable for yet another sequel  number eight already  in the franchise revolving on the unstoppable Haddonfield killing machine. Nobody asked to 'resurrect' the premise yet once more, and apparently it's the least popular entry in the series, but still a very watchable slasher with very few depth, but quite a lot of gory murders. The film opens inside the walls of a mental institution where Laurie awaits the inevitable return of her murderous brother. During a too obviously forced confrontation on the institute's roof, Jamie Lee literally kisses the franchise that turned her into horror's most legendary scream-queen goodbye once and for all. Michael returns to his childhood home in Haddonfield where he's lucky enough to receive a new shipment of victims without even having to leave the house. Hyperactive TV-director Freddie Haris (Busta Rhymes) recruited six teenagers to spend Halloween's eve in the legendary house where 6-year-old Michael killed his sister and broadcast everything they do and say live on the internet... Even if that includes getting stabbed repeatedly, impaled, head-crushed and decapitated. Personally, I hate the whole concept of Big Brother and similar reality-TV shows with a passion, so I secretly hope that one day they'll all follow the rules of ""Halloween: Resurrection"". Just put all the sad attention-seekers together in one ramshackle house and unleash a homicidal maniac upon them! Let's see how many losers will then still volunteer to have their pathetic lives displayed on camera. The film itself is pretty lousy, with absolutely no efforts to build up tension or to properly introduce the players. The dialogues are horrendous and endlessly stretched to connect one violent slashing with another. Very much unlike it was the case in ""Halloween H²0"", since that film featured almost no graphic gore in the first hour. The girls are extremely pretty (even super model Tyra Banks makes an appearance) and they can scream really loud, the boys are a bunch of hopeless nerds and the script contains all the obligatory internet/chatting room clichés. Worth checking out if it comes on TV.",Halloween - Resurrection
10,preppy-3,Why?,2,20 July 2002,"The film starts off good with a nice, atmospheric, suspenseful sequence involving Jamie Lee Curtis.  Then it falls apart.A bunch of kids from Haddonfield University decide to stay in Michael Myers childhood home (for scholarship money) overnight and find out why he was the way he was.  Michael somehow finds this out and decides to put a stop to it. Also all the kids have little video camera on their shoulders so the film annoyingly keeps going back and forth between video and film. 
Basically, it all turns into just another slasher film.  The script is horrible--lousy lines along with cardboard characters.  All the acting sucks and I hated every single ""character"".  Still, the deaths are loud, violent and bloody and some of the stalking scenes do deliver.  Also the sound in this film is great and there's a nicely updated version of the score.So, it has it moments, but not enough.  A 2.",Halloween - Resurrection
11,poolandrews,One of the better Halloween sequels.,6,29 October 2006,"Halloween: Resurrection starts with the not so shocking revelation that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) didn't decapitate her homicidal brother Michael (Brad Loree) at the end of Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998) but an unfortunate paramedic who Michael put his mask on so he could make his escape, it's been three years since then... It's modern day America & the craze for reality TV is at it's height & Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) has an idea, he intends to audition for teenagers to spend Halloween night in the now empty run-down house where notorious killer Michael Myers lived in Haddonfield & broadcast they're every move through the internet using small cameras attached to the contestants. Sounds like a winner, right? Anyway, friends Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), Jen Danzig (Katee Sackhoff) & Rudy Grimes (Sean Patrick Thomas) are all picked along with Donna Chang (Daisy McCrackin), Jim Morgan (Luke Kirby) & Bill Woodlake (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who think they can become famous if they play along. Unfortunately for them the Myers residence is far from empty, I mean even homicidal undead killers have to live somewhere, right? It just so happens that Michael doesn't like house-guests either...Directed by Rick Rosenthal who also appears in the film as the college professor Halloween: Resurrection was originally titled Halloween: The Homecoming & is the eighth film in the series which stopped individually numbering them in the title after part 5, I have to admit that I thought it was one of the better sequels but that isn't saying much is it? The script by Larry Brand & Sean Hood takes the topical notion of the reality TV show that is proving so popular even now with the likes of Big Brother, Survivor & I'm a Celebrity get me Out of Here in the UK & uses the basic concept as it's main story. It sort of feels OK actually & I quite liked the idea even though not much is made of it other than some The Blair Witch Project (1999) style shaky hand-held camcorder type shots. Having said that at heart it's a straight forward predictable slasher that in reality isn't any different from dozens of other's which litter video shop shelves & congest obscure cable TV station schedules. For it's type it's OK but nothing spectacular, it's one of those films I found watchable but almost totally forgettable as soon as the end credits started to roll.Director Rosenthal was responsible for probably the best Halloween sequel Halloween II (1981) so he has the dubious honour of being the only person to direct two Halloween films, I'm sure he's very proud although to be fair to him they are two of the better entries. Here he does an OK job, everything looks decent enough, there's the odd stylish moment & the kills are pretty good. On the negative side there are just too many pointless, dull & frankly boring shots of teens wandering around in the dark, Rick mate it becomes tedious very quickly so if you make a third one bear that in mind OK? After the totally anaemic previous entry pleasingly Halloween: Resurrection has some decent kills & some OK gore, someone gets a spike through their throat mounted on a camera tripod in a scene that rips-off/pays homage to Peeping Tom (1960), someone is impaled on a spike railing, someone has a kitchen knife stuck in their head, there's a cool decapitation, a slit throat, a severed head in a washing machine & someone's head is crushed.With a supposed budget of about $15,000,000 Halloween: Resurrection is generally well made with decent production values. The original Halloween theme is still cool as well. The acting isn't up to much & Rhymes gives a terrible performance. According to the IMDb's 'Trivia' section apparently leading lady Bianca Kajlich cannot scream (?why!) & she had to be dubbed in post production, to be honest considering the role & film I'd have thought being able to scream would have been an iron clad requirement.Halloween: Resurrection is an OK slasher in a cinematic world already full of them, it passes the time & is watchable but nothing special or to get too excited about. There are better slashers out there but there are worse ones as well, the choice is yours. The series started with Halloween (1978) & was followed by Halloween II then came the totally unconnected Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988) brought Michael back, then came Halloween 5 (1989) & Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) which is when they stopped numbering them, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later was next before Halloween: Resurrection. It doesn't stop there though, a remake of the original Halloween (2007) is set to be directed by Rob Zombie sometime soon.",Halloween - Resurrection
12,Bunuel1976,"HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION (Rick Rosenthal, 2002) *1/2",2,10 November 2006,"The Michael Myers saga was always more respectable than that of Jason Voorhees - not that the immediate sequels to the classic original were any better than its myriad clones or the typical slasher! Anyway, I only managed to catch up with 3 of the sequels a couple of years back - but did get the opportunity to watch the above-average 1998 outing, HALLOWEEN: H20, during its original run; I'm not able to get a hold of nos. 5 and 6, so I had to make do with ""Halloween 8"" - directed by the man who brought us the atrocious first sequel! After a pre-credits sequence depicting the final confrontation between Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her homicidal sibling, the film takes up a premise that showed promise (sort of bringing the saga up-to-date with a ""Blair Witch Project"" perspective) - a Reality TV show set inside the ill-fated Myers house. While the heroine is adequate (though still made to share an icky relationship over the Internet with a whiz-kid teenager), the rest of the participants are the usual mixture of the bland and the obnoxious (particularly her publicity-seeking best friend); the cast also includes the two black producers of the show - with foul-mouthed (and top-billed) Busta Rhymes eventually engaging in an idiotic karate fight with ""The Shape""!! Besides, the unattractive color (simulating the look of Digital Video) doesn't help...though John Carpenter's simple, effortlessly eerie ""Halloween"" theme still manages to generate the required response whenever it comes on! The DVD includes a few worthless deleted scenes and even 3 alternate endings (a sure sign, if any was needed, of the film's general dissatisfaction).",Halloween - Resurrection
13,utgard14,Shouldn't have been made,3,4 November 2013,"The plot is irrelevant. It's still the same old song and dance. Michael dispatching annoying people right and left. The movie makes no attempt at novelty. It's completely content at being what it is: a bland entry into a franchise that, with the exception of one film, had descended into parody a long time before. The one thing this movie does try to do different with the franchise is that it uses more F bombs than all the other Halloween films put together (before Zombie, of course). This should be no surprise given Busta Rhymes is one of the stars. So yeah...that's something to be proud of.The cast is mostly terrible. Jamie Lee Curtis, clearly fed up with Halloween, reprises her iconic role for the sole purpose of seeing her killed off once and for all. You can't really blame her for wanting to be rid of this mess. The rest of the cast is made up of the super annoying Busta Rhymes, the beautiful Tyra Banks, and a host of (at that time) aspiring stars. Of the bunch I would say Bianca Kajlich and Katee Sackhoff comport themselves best. Obviously this movie did nothing to help the careers of anybody involved with it.Rick Rosenthal, who I felt did a decent job way back when with part 2, directs ineptly here. There isn't a memorable scene in the entire movie. It's just a loud, obnoxious mess of a slasher film. I struggle to decide whether this is the worst of the series or part 5 is. Both are excrement. There's also something truly sad about a Halloween movie being so unoriginal that it borrows from or rips off various other movies (Blair Witch Project, Scream, Terminator 2, Peeping Tom). The first Halloween movie was an innovator, not an imitator. It's just sad to see how far the franchise fell by 2002. I also think it was very indicative of the state of horror films at the time.",Halloween - Resurrection
14,zardoz-13,"Only unquestioning ""Halloween"" aficionados will appreciate this gimmick-laden installment in the long-running series.",3,11 July 2007,"The latest Michael Myers' slasher saga ""Halloween: Resurrection"" relies more on slick gimmicks rather than sickening gore to generate fear and anxiety. No, ""Resurrection"" doesn't surpass director John Carpenter's peerless slice'n dice classic ""Halloween"" (1978), which launched unknown actress Jamie Lee Curtis into the Hollywood firmament as scream queen Laurie Strode. Yes, ""Resurrection"" tops 1983's ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch."" Nevertheless, this derivative but efficient follow-up to the much superior ""Halloween H2O"" (1998), the second-best ""Halloween"" epic since Carpenter's original, piles up a reasonable body count, stirs up serviceable suspense, and features one of the more memorable moments (or the mother of all false alarms) of the franchise.""Halloween: Resurrection"" fades in three years after ""H2O"" faded out. Evidently, Laurie believed she had beheaded her murderous younger brother, the ""unstoppable killing machine"" Michael Myers. Sadly, she learns to her shock that Michael swapped places with a paramedic. Macabre Michael crushed the guy's larynx, so he couldn't identify himself when Laurie hacked off his head. Consequently, the authorities have locked up poor Laurie in the loony bin . Meanwhile, when she isn't stashing her pills in a rag doll, guilt-ridden Laurie awaits her inevitable showdown with her big, bad bogeyman brother. Fifteen minutes later, Laurie confronts Michael (career stunt man Brad Loree), and you can guess who triumphs in their rooftop encounter. Hopefully, the proposed ninth chapter in the ""Halloween"" movies may rewrite Laurie's untimely demise the same way ""Resurrection"" shrewdly revived Michael. Director Rick Rosenthal, who helmed ""Halloween 2"" (1981), shifts the action from the insane asylum to the dilapidated Strode family domicile in Haddonfield, Illinois, where all the bloodletting began. Enter dot.com entrepreneur Freddie Harris (rapper Busta Rhymes of ""Shaft"") with a sure-fire scheme to cash in on Michael mania. Harris recruits six unsuspecting college students to appear on his Internet cybercast 'Dangertainment.' He promises them $5,000 apiece if they can survive a night in Michael's house. Each wears live web cams as they prowl the premises. Harris has wired the house with hidden cameras, too. Little does Sara (Bianca Kajlich of ""Bring It On"") and her five ill-fated friends know that menacing Michael has been living alone under the house. While Michael isn't knocking off these nitwits with his customary sadism, Sara's cyber-pen pal Myles Barton (Ryan Merriman) is typing out and sending messages frantically to Sara on her Palm-Pilot, warning our heroine about Myers' whereabouts. ""Halloween: Resurrection"" combines ""The House on Haunted Hill"" with ""The Blair Witch Project."" The formulaic screenplay by Larry Brand and Sean Hood ignores the slasher movie rules about sex and drugs that Wes Craven's ""Scream"" trilogy outlined years ago. Gore- hounds looking for buckets of blood in the R-rated ""Resurrection"" may feel cheated by the overall lack of slash and gash. The best parts of ""Resurrection"" have little to do with horror and more to do with keeping this mass murder melodrama up-to-date with the latest advances in technological hardware. Altogether, only unquestioning ""Halloween"" aficionados will appreciate this gimmick-laden installment in the long-running series.",Halloween - Resurrection
15,Boba_Fett1138,Such a bad concept for an Halloween movie.,4,14 October 2009,"What were they thinking. Reality shows of course were a big and still new thing at the time of this movie but that doesn't mean you should drag the Halloween-series down to this level. The movie picks a story in which a group of young people participate in a reality show in which they must enter the birth-home of Michael Myers. They entire world can watch it online but nobody seems to be worried when people start to die pretty quickly on already. Also not the crew of the show, which seems to consist out of 3 people only for some weird reason.It's of course not also really a very original concept to begin with. I mean it has been done many times before, in one way or another- and also a lot better in previous horror movies. Besides it doesn't really provide the movie with any exciting horror moments, mostly because it's being predictable all.""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" was not a perfect movie but it still was a decent enough reboot for the series, which introduced the Halloween movies to the more modern present style of horror film-making. With this movie they totally seem to abandoning this approach again and they pick a totally different approach again, which needless to say, doesn't work out very well.It was an horrible choice to kill of Laurie Strode in this one. Jamie Lee Curtis returned to the Halloween series in 1998 with ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" and she reprises her role again in this movie but she is only in it for the first 5 minutes or so, in which she gets killed off by the Michael Myers character.This movie doesn't introduce some very hopeful new characters. I hope they were not thinking that Sara Moyer could be a good new main character for the series. It seems like a poor choice that the movie mostly decided on casting in youngsters, no doubt in an attempt to attract a new crowd of young people to the Halloween-series. The last movie had LL Cool J as a comical relief, this time this questionable honor goes to Busta Rhymes. He's just being Busta Rhymes though, pretending to be an actor. It must be said though that his characters works out better and more useful for the movie than LL Cool J's did in the previous movie.Funny though that the movie is being directed by Rick Rosenthal, the movie who 21 before this movie also directed ""Halloween II"". Other than that he really hasn't directed a lot more movies throughout his career.""Halloween: Resurrection"" is a very simplistic and lazy written movie, that focuses more on attracting a new young audience than it thinks off the older and faithful fans of the series.

The series reaches its lowest, and Resurrection ironically enough killed it until Rob Zombie remade them(I haven't watched either of his attempts yet, but I have literally no reason to believe that he handles them well). This was made purely to crap out another sequel, and with how sub-standard it turned out, that does not come close to justifying its existence. The plot is meaningless and full of holes. There is not a single character in this that you can relate to(all are stereotypical and one-note), like, and there's a mere handful of them that you can even stand. They go out of their way to be obnoxious, and you do not feel any sympathy when they die. The acting is utterly unimpressive, for both the names and the unknowns in the cast. Worst are probably the model and the rapper. The music is OK, and the original theme does turn up here and there. This doesn't build up atmosphere, suspense or tension all that well. There are cheap scares, the set-up is forced, and, well, here's a clue for the film-makers who clearly had none: When those in the movie are bored, the viewers are, too. Editing and cinematography are decent at best. The show doesn't make sense; are they only going to do it once a year, on Halloween? There's only the one house, are they picking up a new sensationalist background for each iteration? Is it a one-time thing? Why on Earth do they think they'll be rich, it's not like they have something easy to franchise? This isn't likely to satisfy the least picky of its intended audience. There is plenty of bloody(and at points, gory) violence, relatively frequent strong language, a little sexuality/suggestive material and brief gratuitous nudity. I recommend this solely to those who must watch every single slasher made, regardless of their quality. 1/10",Halloween - Resurrection
18,view_and_review,Dedication,3,11 February 2021,"Would it be right to say that ""Halloween: Resurrection"" met my expectations when my expectations were hopelessly low? ""Halloween: Resurrection"" was a crapfest and I expected nothing more. But I watched, and you want to know why? Dedication. I've put in hours watching the horrid Halloweens from part three on up, so what's one more bad sequel?H.R. picks up three years after H20 (which had another New York rapper in L.L. Cool J). Laurie Strode (JLC) is in a ward of some kind for mental patients. We find out through some lousy soap opera-style writing that Laurie Strode never killed Michael Myers in H20, but rather an EMT whom Michael put his mask on so he could escape. Ridiculous I know. It doesn't even suit M.M.'s persona to take his mask off and put it on someone else so that he can escape. That would imply fear or awareness of danger which Myers has none of.At any rate, he caught up with Laurie at her place of institutionalization and finally succeeded in killing her*, then politely handed over his beloved butcher knife to a patient as if to say, ""I'm retired.""*I wonder how they solve that problem for Laurie Strode to be in ""Halloween"" (2018)?H.R. then jumps to Haddonfield, Illinois, the birthplace of it all. Freddie (Busta Rhymes) and his assistant Nora (Tyra Banks) of Dangertainment have selected six participants to spend Halloween night in the Myers house. The whole event is to be streamed POV on the internet. Maybe that could work in 2021, but in 2002 that idea would be dead in the water. Internet speeds on average were what... 5Mbps? I think I had the top tier of AT&T U-Verse back then and I had a whopping 18Mbps. That was barely ideal for internet surfing, so streaming was totally out of the question. And what was more technologically mysterious were the text messages the main character, Sarah (Bianca Kajlich), was receiving. They were coming in one letter at a time! As a secret admirer of hers was watching the stream, he was trying to help her by alerting her of Myers' whereabouts in the house (as if there wouldn't have been massive lag in the stream). As he was texting her, the text messages were appearing on her phone screen one letter at a time which has NEVER been the way texting worked. So, in a technological leap forward we get a live streamed show in 2002, while at the same time we get some incredibly backwards and non-existent form of text messaging. Unreal.Anyway, hack hack, kill kill, Michael Myers slices and dices through ten bodies by the time it's all said and done. Predictably, one girl lives while other more able-bodied people die. She was the one cautious, simple, morally upright, non-ostentatious character so she deserved to live. Same formula that was used back in 1978 when the first ""Halloween"" was made. You'd think after 24 years they'd try something new.",Halloween - Resurrection

An explanation is given as to his decapitated survival from the dreaded Halloween: H-20 so that filmmakers can continue to present viewers with celebrations of mindless violence and murder. Jamie Lee Curtis makes one last appearance as Laurie Strode who is now in a mental hospital, and to further underline the idiocy of the film, she is murdered in the opening. A bunch of teenage airheads are picked to enter the abandoned Myers house showcased by some stupid program called Danger-Tainment. That just might be the height of creativity in the entire film. Bugged with cameras they roam about unaware of Myers inside who murders them via decapitation, impalements, etc. Rick Rosenthal is back after directing Halloween 2, and this isn't even on par with that lousy film. Instead it becomes perhaps the worst film in franchise. One can say that perhaps producers grew tired of trying to get John Carpenter back with the franchise. He attempts to pull a Blair Witch Project with its pitiful look. Horrid acting by Busta Rhymes, Sean Patrick Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Tyra Banks.

20,kannibalcorpsegrinder,The most underrated entry in the series,9,28 October 2015,"Participating in a new reality show, a group of college students exploring the childhood home of Michael Myers broadcast the killers' return and eventually killing them one-by-one forcing those watching the event to help them get out alive.This here is a sorely underrated and highly enjoyable effort with a lot to really like here. One of the film's greatest strength here is the use of its central gimmick here of using the reality show addition to the series in an incredibly fun way. Not only is this one highly probably to occur here given the guidelines of what's known in the series thus far, and the set-up here is much more genuine and authentic here due to that. The early set-ups here showing their preparations of the house which gets fun with the hidden kills having to a lot to do with that, though the real fun here come from the integration this does in the final half using it as the primary factor in helping them escape. By utilizing the footage from the shows and the different headsets on the group as that frame-point and then tuning to the technology they share is s a means of guiding them out is a supremely imaginable scenario filled with suspense as the fellow partiers watching the broadcast continually shout out information to help him along brings this nicely full-circle with the stalking in the house providing plenty of insanely suspenseful scenes throughout the house and down through the garage which makes for some great times here. Outside of the finale, there's some great stalking throughout here as the early walk-through of the house up into the second floor or down into the basement which is a lot of fun as the big encounter here with the falling wall of fake bodies before the fine chase through the area settling on a fine kill. The upstairs scenes are almost as fun, with the great jump through the dresser to launch an attack, the absolutely crazy scene where they come face-to-face with the doppelganger and are unsure of who's the real one or if the game is still on-going, the great battle in the kitchen that has plenty of fine action as well as the outstanding ending brawl in the garage that gives this one some fun. Along with a stellar opening chase and some really fine, creepy work with Michael here, this has enough here to hold off the long flaw here. The only thing here is the fate of the show's organizer, who's one of the most annoying characters here who survives the whole affair based solely on who's playing him rather than anything to do with what happens to him in the film proper and even manages to survive in one of the most hokey methods imaginable to provide the final killing blow instead of the final girl which really should've happened here, doing so with some absolutely lame methods as well.

Of course, Michael doesn't take kindly to this, and sets out to kill these intruders.The plot twist used to bring Michael back from his apparent ""final"" end of Part VII is clever; utterly pointless, crass, and contrived, but clever.

24,The_Void,Halloween; a series that didn't need resurrecting!,4,30 October 2006,"What do you do if you're planning on making a sequel to a franchise that was tired six sequels ago and can't think of a plot line? Just stick the internet in, of course! What we have here is another completely redundant instalment of the boring Halloween series, which once again sees dreary killer Michael Myers slashing his way through a bunch of stupid teenagers. The only difference between this and all the other Halloween films is that this one focuses on the ridiculous idea of having the dumb teens skulking around Myers' childhood home in aid of some show being broadcast via webcam. The film ties in to previous Halloween films by way of Jamie Lee Curtis' character - an actress who obviously appears in the film for a big paycheck, and the fact that she won't have to be in any more Halloween tedium. The main reason I've never been a fan of any of the Halloween movies is because the murder scenes are never up to much; and indeed, all we have here is Myers slashing his way through kids with a knife, which doesn't take long to get old. Normally when a film stars a rapper, that rapper is the worst thing about it; but not here, as because the rest of the film is so dull, Busta Rhymes actually increases the overall entertainment value. Nothing about this film particularly stands out at any point, but Rhymes does have an absolutely hilarious line of dialogue towards the end. Overall, this, like the rest of the Halloween series, isn't worth watching and you'd do well to miss it!",Halloween - Resurrection
25,trashgang,what goes wrong when you popularize a franchise,5,21 November 2011,"Let me answer on my summary, everything can go wrong. First, it picks up were H20 ended so again forget part 3,4,5 and 6. Secondly, money makes the world go around, Jamie Lee Curtis is just in it for a teaser. And last, Michael died in H2O but here they gave a stupid twist to H2O's ending and never explained anything. The only good thing was that they brought back Rick Rosenthal, the director of part 2.So Laurie Strode is just in it in the first minutes, the part that makes H2O a bit laughable, but once that's over we see the main storyline. And here we have the popularization of Michael Myers. This has nothing to do with Halloween, I remember pinhead (Hellraiser: Hellworld) being involved in an internet craziness, well, this is nothing else. Just watch Michael's first killing, that's surely based on, and an inside joke, to Peeping Tom's killings with a tripod. Look, if you go back to the Myers' house than it's just not possible that Michael is still living in that house, abandoned for 20 years. And with the kids running into trouble, nobody goes out to rescue them, even as you can follow their mayhem on the Net! And the way it was filmed is just picking in, again, on mockumentaries and docu style horrors like Blair Witch or FearDotCom. I have seen the 4 endings that were shot and one, the CSI ending was surely made to go further on with the franchise. Katee Sackhoff was in this flick as Jen just to move one year later to the Batllestar Galactica series as Starbuck. Daisy McCrackin, reveals some flesh and there's more red stuff and stabbing then in H2O, so on that part it really looks more Halloween then H2O but still, bad storyline. Up to this writing Michael didn't reappear if we don't count Rob Zombie's remake with it. Brad Loree did fine as Michael Myers, and the acting was okay, sadly as John Carpenter once said, a good flick needs a good story, and how many franchises died with the popularisation of the main character (remember Freddy!)Gore 2/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",Halloween - Resurrection

What works is they updated the story with a dot com theme.  Some of the film is stale, and tired.  We know who is going to survive, the only difference is instead of the jock being the hero, we got a rapper, street type guy, which is a predictable staple in today's modern horror film.  I wish they would have a film where no one is killed or everyone lives. This would be an original or the sleazy woman or the annoying prankster lives.  The film is scary, and does not pull any punches; except which character in what order dies.  The film hides what will happen next.  This film creates tension, and causes the viewer to jump unxepectedly.  This is what a horror film should do, and the second Michael Myers is perfect script writing.  Concluding, I like how they bridge the last film, with the present one.  Laurie Strodes kills the wrong person. Watch, in Halloween 12 or whatever, they will have the Myers house again after they burned it down in this film, I hate it when they insult the viewer with such inconsistencies.",Halloween - Resurrection
27,Smells_Like_Cheese,Shame on you Rick Rosenthal!!!,1,28 November 2003,"What the heck was this? Seriously, Halloween H20 was a perfect ending to the Halloween franchise and so help me God if this was their ""final sequel"" this was the worst way to end it. I remember seeing this in the theater and afterwards just everyone saying how much they hated this movie. First off they have Jamie Lee Curtis all crazed looking and drugged up and then they kill her off! Oh, my, God! How could they?! Shame on these stupid people, this is a pathetic attempt of the MTV generation trying to add technology to the Halloween series. What did the very first Halloween present to us? A killer who stalks babysitters and wanted to kill his family off, nothing else, that's it. Very simple, why do they try to crap up the story? How could you make a Halloween movie bad? Apparently this stupid director must have been drinking or doing some illegal substance because this was just a shamed attempt at giving us a few scares.Beginning three years after the events of Halloween H20, Laurie Strode, has been confined to a psychiatric care facility. The Summer Glen paramedic located the body of Michael Myers in the dining hall of Laurie's school, Hillcrest Academy High School. When attempting to seemingly do away with the terror from her brother once and for all, she had killed an innocent man. Unable to deal with the crime and the fear of her brother, Lauire was later confined to a sanitarium. Myers had earlier attacked the paramedic and forcefully switched clothing and his mask. The paramedic was rendered a mute from a crushed larynx. On the night of October 31, 1998, Myers cleverly escaped once again. When Michael finally appears, Laurie lures him into a trap, but before she can kill him for good, he turns the tables on her. In a confrontation on the sanitarium's rooftop, she reaches over to pull off his mask to make certain it is actually her brother. He suddenly grabs her and pulls her over the edge with him, stabbing her deep in the back. She gives him a kiss on the lips of his mask, lastly telling him, ""I'll see you in Hell."" Michael releases the knife from his sister and she falls many stories below to her death. Myers finally accomplished killing his sister, a pursuit twenty-three years in the making. He then makes his way back home to Haddonfield, Illinois. One year later on Wednesday October 30th, six college students win a competition to appear on an Internet reality show in which they are to spend Halloween night in the childhood home of Michael Myers. Their mission is to find out what led him to kill. On the actual date of October 31, the investigation is done in a style reminiscent of the MTV reality show, Fear. On this night, through the entrepreneurial broadcast business Dangertainment, it is shot live on the internet. Of course who is going to be there to ruin it? You guessed it, Big Bird, Happy Halloween.This is just a stupid sequel, Halloween: Resurrection makes the other sequels look like masterpieces. Halloween 2 started off terrific, we slumped just a little, nothing major, things picked up majorly with Halloween H20, so how in the heck did this movie get messed up? Because the director and writer were looking to relate to today's audience, which are a bunch of ignorant teens and this was just a waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours' as well, I promise you, you're not missing out on anything, don't watch this movie. Let's just forget about it and think that H20 was the way the Halloween franchise ended, oh, Michael, please don't ever do this again, either that or kill the director, or I will!

Jamie! How proud I was to see you return to greatness in 'H20' only to (literally) fall into this mess. I hope you earned enough blood money. And after you read your only scene, how on earth did you agree to this storyline? Absolutely the worst, uh, resurrection of any franchise killer since 'Jaws: The Revenge' which told us the original's long-dead shark actually lived and followed by ocean the Sheriff's widowed wife down from New England to the Keys?? In this, they attempt to make us believe Michael switched bodies in the end of 'H20' and she killed the wrong man. If that were the case, wouldn't the victim simply take off his mask or do the universal ""no"" movements with his hand since he couldn't speak? And then Laurie doesn't ask this Michael to take off his mask since he's playing the same prank. But, I digress, that's just the first 17 minutes. You have the rest of the movie to hate as well. Reasons: Busta Rhymes (enuff said, but) and his busta moves, a victim that's on the verge of death texts someone vs. dialing 9-1-1, an overbearing soundtrack and a normal human scream that breaks glass. Obviously they were trying to cash-in on the reality series/webcam boom of the time and bring Michael on camera for people at home (or in this case, just a party) to watch him stalk easy prey in a house that's insides seem like a 37-room mansion with enough hiding places for 6 killers.

Did we really need another ridiculous installment in the series? Of course the answer to all of these questions is money. Apparently and inexplicably there is still cash to be mined from the Halloween franchise. Too bad. Halloween H2O provided what I thought was the perfect end to Michael Myers.There are so many negative things I could say about Halloween: Resurrection that I really don't know where to begin. I suppose I'll start with what I found to be the biggest problem  Busta Rhymes. Has there ever been a more annoying person to appear in a horror film? What a horrible performance! And then there's the whole idea that Michael has been living in a tunnel system under his old house that the police never thought to search. Yeah, right. The whole notion is an insult to the intelligence of any thinking person.Don't you think that an event like investigating the Myers' house on Halloween night would draw a crowd of onlookers (or at least nut-jobs) from near and far? There's no way Michael should have been able to enter and exit the house unseen. The crowds of the curious, security, or police would have surely noticed something going on. Again, this whole notion is an insult to the intelligence of any thinking person.Honestly, I could write paragraph after paragraph of what I found wrong with Halloween: Resurrection, but what's the point.

The previous movie had Michael being beheaded by Laurie. This movie retcons this by saying that it was actually someone else wearing his mask. His throat was crushed which is why he didn't tell Laurie who he was. Then why didn't he just take off his mask then? More importantly, how was he able to survive being hit by a car when he was just an ordinary person? The rest of the movie is basically a reality show with Michael in it. It's about as dumb as it sounds. It features a bunch of people living in Michael Myers' house as part as some publicity stunt but they get killed off like any other characters do. All of these characters are annoying and pointless and it seems like they belong in another movie. We get more lame scenes with fakeouts of other people wearing Michael's mask.

Sadly though, they never attempt anything other than stabbings.John Carpenter's original low-budget horror flick, about a babysitter stalked by the bogey man, was a big hit that brought him much acclaim. A sequel was inevitable. Carpenter even worked on it. But after that, he bowed out and his producer Moustapha Akkad took over. He's not a filmmaker, he's a businessman. And for 24 years, he has served us the same sandwich, over and over.Rick Rosenthal, who directed Halloween II, is back behind the camera. One would assume that his familiarity with the franchise is a good thing. Too bad he's obsessed with cheesy lighting, obnoxiously loud sound effects and confusing editing.This film was supposed to be released in the autumn of 2001, but apparently there were major differences of opinion when the director of H20, Steve Miner, started fiddling with the finished print. The original title, Halloween: The Homecoming, was dropped because Dimension Films wanted a title that made it clear that Michael Myers was still alive. So they nicked half the title off an Alien movie and stuck it on.There is only one way to tell a story of teenagers being murdered by a psycho in a William Shatner mask/hockey mask/pillow case. And you've seen it a zillion times. The only minuscule difference this one offers is that the whole thing in broadcast on the Internet, which provides room for some gimmicky, if annoying, set pieces and a few clever tricks. But don't expect jaw-dropping twists, or intensity.An ambitious reality show producer (Busta Rhymes) sets up the Myers house with booby-traps and red herrings to juice his sleepover Internet show. A handful of teens, with stereotypical personalities, fall for it and deliver the goods. Until Mikey comes back, that is.What's that you say? Surely, Mikey can't be alive after Jamie Lee lopped his head off in H20? Well, the movie says that Michael stuck his mask onto someone else before being chucked into the back of the corpse-mobile. Umm...so where's the actual ""resurrection""? What follows is a shlocky assortment of teenage slayings - Freddy, Mikey and Jason must surely have laid waste to most of teen America by now - and massacres. What motivates Mikey? Never revealed, man.Carpenter used this to good effect first time round. Parts 4, 5 and 6 - they dropped the roman numerals after III - added truckloads of story to the Michael Myers myth, which, although nothing but hokum, was at least interesting.H20 completely disregarded those movies and went back to killing for no reason. And now once again, it's just pointless bloodshed. Mikey isn't scary. Jason would flatten him in a second. You know that he's always going to get up after being hung, shot, stabbed, poisoned, fired out of a cannon or run over with a steam roller. There is zero suspense.Watching a rubber dog-doo machine make rubber dog-doo is not interesting. And watching a killing machine kill got boring well over a decade ago. It's time to try something new.Halloween: Resurrection tries a little harder, perhaps. And for this reason, it's one of the better sequels.

I liked the combination of the classic ""Halloween"" story with elements of teenage romantic movies, reality TV, the ""Blair Witch"" style and sporadic comic reliefs. The acting is not nearly as bad as you might think after reading internet reviews, and the atmosphere is more tense than in the prequels. ""H2O"" retains the position of the best film in the franchise, but this one is the most exciting and entertaining.7/10",Halloween - Resurrection
37,jacobjohntaylor1,This is not awful it is a lot better then part 3,5,11 November 2015,This is not a great movie. But it an underrated movie. It not awful. But Halloween H20 is a lot better. So is Halloween 9. Halloween the cures of Micheal Myers is better. Halloween 5 the revenge of Micheal Myers is better. Halloween 4 the return of Micheal Myers is better. Halloween II (1981) is better. The original Halloween from 1978 is better. The Halloween remake from 2007 is also bettter. And so is Halloween II (2009). Good movie pertty scary. A lot better then Halloween III seaon of the witch. It is have a good story line. It also had great acting.,Halloween - Resurrection
38,paulclaassen,"Rock bottom!!! End this, please!!",1,16 October 2018,"Rick Rosenthal, director of that terrible 'Halloween 2,' is back for another take on the Halloween franchise. The first thing I noticed was the bad acting, then the bad cliches, then all the characters added simply for the kill, then the bad dialogue, and silly plot. Just like 'Halloween: H20' this film ignores all previous sequels and follows on 'H20', which followed on 'Halloween 2'. There's just so much wrong here, I'm not even gonna bother highlighting some of them. This was terribly bad. The idea of them doing a reality show in the Myers house might be intriguing, but the execution thereof was nothing to write home about. This is the worst bunch of people ""being selected"" for the TV show. On what credentials? They're all idiots and say and do the stupidest things. Nothing here is credible. If this is a big TV show, why are the contestant's cameras so bad? Why did no-one see Bill getting killed? And the way EVERYONE just misses what happens on the screens for convenience purpose only is just stupid - especially the Tyra Banks scene. Wow, bad, bad, bad!Busta Rhymes' character is anything but professional, considering the show was his idea. He doesn't act or talk the least bit what his character stands for, or supposed to, at least. And as a TV show they don't have any security measures in place??? Even when there's a fire!?? Oh, c'mon, you can't stuff this crap down my throat and expect me to swallow! This was like watching a very, very bad non-humorist comedy. They've managed to make a complete spectacle of the franchise. This one hits rock bottom in the worst possible way!",Halloween - Resurrection

40,Dr_Coulardeau,You are the voyeur that is watching you,10,31 July 2007,"John Carpenter is always just as good as good can be because he knows his trade and he knows how to pull the strings that are going to frighten us, terrorize us or just gross us out, and there are many strings that must not get entangled. And they don't. The main point with Carpenter is that he manages to produce and set up some crucial moments when we don't know who is who and where we are, in reality or in virtuality, in a real murder or in a fake hoax. And that is when we get over the limit and manage to believe the unbelievable. Carpenter is also extremely good at keeping the film in dark shadowy half lights that are necessary for him to play on the depth of the picture and to hide what is going to come out of the dark without any due process of announcing itself. You must not look for any deeper or wider meaning, because there is none, except that we accept to be the eye of the camera, or we accept the camera to be our eye, hence we accept to be voyeurs inside a film that is itself a voyeuristic adventure since we capture the action through cameras and TV screen relayed onto the internet and a portable telephone. We are confronted to at least two if not three levels of voyeurism with the organizers of the first level becoming the direct victims of the adventure, and then the guinea pigs of these becoming the victims of the voyeuristic and exhibitionistic game they had accepted to get into. And even further the audience of these two levels on the Internet becoming themselves victims of the game because they believe it is a game even when it turns more than sour. It is the use of a portable telephone via an instant messenger that will enable this voyeuristic audience to become compassionate. And we, the voyeurs of Carpenter's film, are like innocent angels victimized by Carpenter and his tricks and what's more we enjoy it and would like to see some more, so that we even know, accept, desire and enjoy the very last punch line that closes this film without closing Michael Myers' eyes: he is eternal because after all this is reality TV and not any virtual fable told by some perverse deranged greedy film director.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Halloween - Resurrection
41,damianphelps,Its Pretty Much What You Would Expect,5,9 March 2021,Any movie that features Myers is pretty watchable for me (a low standard I Know!) so this does just enough.The movie is hardly a classic and at least it comes up with an ok story (just).I'm glad the franchise was not left here it would have been tragic.,Halloween - Resurrection
42,digitalbeachbum,Poop,1,30 October 2021,"I remember when this was released. Everyone in school was talking about it and how frightened they were to watch it. However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts.

43,insomniac_rod,Worst manner to end a franchise.,4,17 July 2006,"Where to begin? This is a bad sequel for the wrong reasons. It had a lot of potential but the director and producers took the franchise to the wrong direction (s).First, I know that the reality shows took by storm t.v. but it wasn't necessary to focus a HALLOWEEN movie on one of them. That was truly a bad decision. Michael Myers does not belongs in the new century, he's a slasher icon that should've stayed in the past. Or you could've used another character instead of Myers. I mean, the premise is really good but it didn't work with Myers. I watched the movie's premiere back in 2002 and I was very excited mostly because it was ""the new Halloween movie"" but soon after the great opening sequence, the movie goes terribly down hill.The second mistake was to include rappers and socialites in this movie. What do they have to do with Halloween? I mean, LL Cool J did a decent job in ""H20"" but it wasn't necessary to use new rappers. Rappers, Halloween, what does that have to do with Horror?! damn it.The third and biggest mistake was to kill Laurie Strode. She was the best thing about the movie but I'm sure that Jamie Lee Curtis didn't like the new dimension that the franchise who once she made popular was taking.Without JLC and Donald Pleasence, the series are ruined. And now that (sadlY) Mr. Akkaad is dead, I think that ""Ressurrection"" is a terrible way to end the series. If you are a newcomer to the genre, you might enjoy watching the movie because it has a lot of boobs, cheap gore, and false scares.

A dated, lazy and disrespectful piece of hot, ugly garbage, Resurrection has many of the ""so-bad-it's-good"" traits I love in rotten cinema (ridiculous logic, ill-advised comedy, terrible acting) but none of the noble conviction. However, any time Busta Rhymes speaks is pure gold.",Halloween - Resurrection
45,Anonymous_Maxine,"Hey, at least the series isn't sinking as precipitously as the Hellraiser series. Just kidding. This movie rocked. Seriously. You're hearing this from a dedicated Halloween fan. Resurrection deserves to be w",8,26 June 2003,"I read another reviewer's comments about Halloween: Resurrection, and one of the things that he said in his review is that hardcore Halloween fans will be disappointed. On the contrary, I think that hardcore Halloween fans, a brilliant group of movie buffs with whom I proudly associate myself, are among the few that will really be satisfied. The Halloween that John Carpenter released in 1978 is among the most well known horror films ever created, which is why people who are not so familiar with the series (and the fact that the original will never be topped or even matched) are the ones that will expect a horror movie experience of some incredible mangnitude, and when they realize that no sequel can never accomplish that, they'll walk away shaking their head in disillusionment.
I, on the other hand, with the benefit of a very in-depth understanding of the Halloween series as a whole, realize that any sequel to a film as good as the original Halloween is made for entertainment purposes only, and for the most part, this kind of entertainment doesn't include many real scares. If nothing else, I enjoyed this movie just because of the film score, which remains one of the best and most powerful horror film scores ever recorded.Granted, the movie trips over itself almost immediately. It contains a scene very early in the film which is so ludicrous that it threatens to set the stage for an hour and a half of no-brain horror, but luckily the movie is able to turn itself around. There is a stereotypical scene in horror movie lore, and I don't know if it really has a name yet, but this is how it goes. There is some goofy and contrived conversation that leads to one person being in a high-risk room (this is a horror movie term) alone, while the other person (who SHOULD have been there at the time) lags behind doing something stupid (in this case, eating a candy bar from the vending machine).The moron finally catches up (I'll give a spoiler warning here, even though I'm only about to spoil a scene within the first ten minutes of the film), and notices that a running dryer is making a suspicious amount of noise. He walks up and finds a severed head inside the dryer. The problem here is that we know there's a head in the dryer as soon as the guard slows down and looks at it, but the dryer is drying a load of WHITES and there's not a DROP of blood on a single garment. I hope I'm not the only one picking up on the discrepancy here.I've gotten a quarter of an inch cut on the top of my head (from a water-skiing incident that I won't get into) that bled so much that it covered my face and chest and completely soaked my swimming shorts (the lesson I learned that day is that head wounds bleed a LOT), so I ASSUME that a SEVERED HEAD would bleed at LEAST as much. Okay, let's overlook the bleeding head thing (this is the kind of thing that comes up when you're analyzing a horror movie, so hear me out here), you still have to deal with the fact that, while the guard nervously creeps up to the drying machine that contains not a single solitary drop of blood, he evidently didn't notice the headless body of the other guard, which was so close to him when he was peering into the dryer that he tripped over it when he stumbled backwards in shock. Was this guy so curious about what was in the dryer that he stepped right over his friend's headless body?Before you answer that, let me just tell you that the rest of the movie doesn't operate at QUITE that level of sheer stupidity, so feel free to check it out. I was a little dismayed at first when I realized that Busta Rhymes was in the film, if only because he so viciously mutilated an Ozzy Osbourne song a few years ago, but he proves me to be an idiot by delivering an excellent performance as one of the heroes of the film. I'm a die-hard Ozzy fan, but even after Busta ruined one of Ozzy's songs, I am willing to forgive him after seeing his performance in this film.
One of the things that I liked about this movie, that I should have seen coming given the sheer magnitude of horror films that I've watched (REAL spoiler warning) is that Michael Myers was not brought back to life by some goofy Evil-Can't-Be-Killed crap, but by the simple fact that he disguised someone else as himself in the previous film, and so Laurie Strode decapitated someone who she thought was Michael Myers, but was really some poor guy with a crushed larynx and three kids. At this point, by the way, I'd like to point out that if you're revolted by the fact that a guy withthree kids getting killed is a RELIEF, you may not enjoy the Halloween films.I'm still a little confused by the fact that Laurie gets stabbed and apparently killed (I'd like to reiterate my spoiler warning here). I assume that her `death' (see my X2 review if you think I'm referring to an actual death here) is just another sign that yet ANOTHER Halloween film is inevitable, but I was expecting her to jump out at some crucial moment when some helpless teenager was about to get killed.Oddly enough, I think the internet portion of the film was remarkably effective, since I've seen total trash like Dee Snider's Strangeland, and realize how easily this kind of thing can be totally screwed up. The movie contains the obligatory element of romance, and like almost not a single other film that I've ever seen, the two characters involved in romance never meet each other. For that alone the movie deserves some commendation. There is a little bit of a Can't Hardly Wait element as two geeky freshman go to a party supposedly designated for people older and cooler than them, and they wind up heroes without forcing us to suffer through any cheesy romance scenes beyond the heroine thanking her hero on television. When was the last time the hero and heroine made contact only through television? Am I wrong to think that the movie deserves to be rewarded for at least trying something new?I am not a fan of endless horror movie sequels. I have yet to see Jason X, but having seen all 47 or so sequels of Friday the 13th, I know that unless they come up with something as fresh and entertaining as Halloween: Resurrection, the series has long since passed away. I am also, I might mention, not at ALL a fan of rap musicians covering classic rock songs, but even though Busta Rhymes did that and screwed it up just as badly as they all do, I really enjoyed Resurrection, as well as his individual performance in it. It is Halloween 8, a sequel number that holds no distinction other than the fact that it is the only one in years worth watching that goes beyond being worth watching just because you're a fan and are obligated to see them all. This sequel undoubtedly stands above the rest, I can only hope that it sets a trend.",Halloween - Resurrection
46,gwnightscream,Disappointing & Unnecessary Sequel!,4,31 March 2012,"Bianca Kajlich, Busta Rhymes, Tyra Banks and Jamie Lee Curtis star in this 2002 horror sequel. This starts off with Laurie Strode (Curtis) in a mental institution for killing someone who she thought was her evil brother, Michael Myers. She's soon confronted by the real Michael (Brad Loree) and is killed. A year later, Michael returns to his home and stalks a group of college students who get to spend the night in his home for a reality show, ""Dangertainment"" created by Freddie (Rhymes) and Nora (Banks). Sara (Kajlich) is the main teen who's fearful of going into the Myers house and becomes targeted by Michael. Rick Rosenthal also returns as director after he directed the second film. This is a disappointing and unnecessary sequel and I think I speak for many that the beginning with Curtis is probably the only good part. Rhymes and Banks didn't help it either, but I like the camera stuff and probably still recommend it if you're a fan of the series.",Halloween - Resurrection
47,FiendishDramaturgy,"Conflicted and uneven, but still fun",8,28 January 2005,"This attempt begins with a beautiful sequence between Laurie Strode (reprised by Jamie Lee Curtis) and Michael Myers.

She did not survive all that just to die from a 12-foot fall and a single stab wound.

Everyone else will die. Everyone but Busta Rhymes, that is. He was the main reason I didn't want to like this movie. I mean...Busta Rhymes? And he is a little over the top here, as I expected, but unlike my expectations, he was otherwise quite good. Other than the clichés (and there are thousands, it seems), the fact that it could not decide between a PG-13 rating (the level of violence and the kill saturation) and an R (waaay too much gratuitous sexual shots and scenes), and the obvious ripped-off characters, it was fun. It was not unique, creative, intellectual, or fresh, but it was fun.

48,Captain_Couth,Interesting concept. Bad movie.,6,16 June 2004,"Halloween: Resurrection (2002) was directed by Rick Rosenthal (Bad Boys) who also helmed the second film in the series.  Yet, he suffered the same fate as Part Two.  He was a victim of re-shoots and re-editing.  The producers were not satisfied with the final product so they ordered him to heavily re-shoot most of the film.  Several times he was almost taken off the project.  But he soldiered on an after a series of delays, Halloween: Resurrection was released.The movie follows a geriatric Michael Myers. Time has not worn out old Michael.  He's up to his old tricks, killing dumb teens and others who get into his way.  The movie has a bunch of fools with mini cams go into the old Myers homestead live on an internet broadcast to ""solve"" the mystery of Michael Myers.  Well. the usual results occur as the ""shape"" slices and dices his way through a new crop of youngsters.

49,bsmith5552,Imaginative Sequel!,7,26 January 2003,"""Halloween: Resurrection"" is another in the long list of ""Halloween"" (1978) sequels to be sure, but this one is better than most and uses interesting new cinematic techniques to enhance the horror. The story opens with a prologue in which we find out how Michael Myers (Brad Loree) escaped death in the previous installment ""Halloween H2O"" (1998) and what has become of his beleaguered sister Laura (Jamie Lee Curtis). After a couple of grizzly murders we move on to the main story. The main body of the film which involves six young people being chosen by promoters Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks to spend a night in the 25 year old deserted Michael Myers house, with the whole event being captured on video for a web cast over the internet. But of course you know who is also lurking about in the house. The six, and I hope I've got this right are Bianca Kajlich as Sara, the main character, Sean Patrick Thomas, Daisy McCrackin (looking like a younger Julianne Moore), Katee Sachoff, Luke Kirby and Thomas Ian Nicholas. Naturally there are the usual bloody murders as one would expect in a Halloween flick. Helping Sara escape the horror is high school student Ryan Merriman, who had established an on-line relationship with her and is watching the proceedings on the web. He is able to warn her through e-mails over their respective cell phones of impending danger. What sets this film apart though, is Director Rick Rosenthal's innovative use of digital video cameras strapped to the head of each of the six actors in the house. As well, there are stationary surveillance cameras scattered throughout the house for added effect. These are actual working cameras that capture the events of the story from six different points of view. The video footage is integrated with the film footage to give the film a more terrifying feel. We see what the characters see including a couple of their own murders.  Rosenthal reveals on the DVD that a Special Edition DVD will be forth coming where the viewer can follow any one of the six characters through the ordeal utilizing only the footage shot from their respective video cameras. In other words you can follow the story from six different points of view. Should be interesting.",Halloween - Resurrection
50,Polaris_DiB,Ruinous and malicious ending to the Halloween franchise,1,7 May 2007,"Rick Rosenthal returns from Halloween II to direct Halloween: Resurrection, the eighth in the franchise involving the serial killer Michael who is still out to get his family, and who still lives despite the cathartic ending of Halloween: H20. But what happened? Whereas Halloween II specifically worked to recreate the mood, tone, and construction of the previous movie, Halloween: Resurrection is a directly malicious attack on the franchise.It's three years after H20, and it turns out that the figure Jamie Lee Curtis decapitated in the previous film was a voiceless security guard, not Michael. Let us forget a moment that this makes no sense as the figure did attack Laurie Strode while she worked to defeat him, and instead focus on the fact that this movie pretty much makes short work of killing Laurie for no good reason except that it seriously seems like the filmmakers wanted to punish her, and the makers of the previous movie, for making an end to a franchise. Then the movie continues with a character named Sarah, possibly the daughter of Jamie Strode (from Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers), who joins two friends in a televised expedition to Michael Myers' childhood house for a night of reality television. Okay, so they're gonna get killed and people are going to watch them in real life. In some way, this movie really tries hard to present a ""voyeuristic aspect of television viewer-ship"" theme, marked by its pop critical and psychobabble dialog, an ill-conceived death-by-tripod, and Busta Rhymes saying some really stupid lines about the lack of humanism in television by the end of the film.If Halloween 5 was bad in construction, this one is bad in conception. The entire film is completely contradictory. It takes (bad) influence from reality television and The Blair Witch Project to make a movie about the dangers and emptiness of our popular televised lives, but the movie itself is filled with screen stars, monotonous television-style editing techniques, and a malicious contempt for everything the entire franchise stood for. The characters are more than stupid, this time they're even hateful, and what's worse, their confusion and clumsiness in the Dangertainment event shows an absurd lack of understanding from all levels of the production, from script to editing, on what the whole purpose of every level of the film is: the in-film dynamics of reality television, the out-film tension of viewer-ship, the point of the movie itself based on the themes it fails to actualize, and the relationship between those things.The actual film-making itself was flimsy and retarded. Rosenthal peppers the flick with worse scare-tactic cuts than even the most mundane of thrillers that come out practically every week, and then he tries to give significant dramatic effect with--seriously people--random slow motion takes of nothing happening! The acting and production design were equally as bad, making this movie literally seem like a random mish-mash of a bunch of stupid idiots running around an old, decrepit stage, pretending to be actors. Then the movie adds in new, in style, modern technology to show without a doubt that ""these kids are cool, they're completely relatable to a new generation!"" If this movie doesn't sound vomit-inducing yet, you have no soul.But all that aside, NOTHING forgives this film for Busta Rhymes. His entire presence is one of those hateful, headache-inducing things that makes people like me wonder if the filmmakers were just trying to get everyone to leave (not a bad guess, considering Rosenthal's aforementioned history with the franchise). A more obnoxious and uncomfortable character was never created for a horror movie, and then this film actually allows him to go all kung-fu on Michael and, the greatest sin of all, actually defeat him! By the time it ends, this movie has the ability to make you terminally ill--not because of the gorror approaches or the thriller tropes, but because it's so rotten and degenerate that the mise-en-scene itself smells like dead cat.The Halloween franchise has various levels of qualities and is in general an entertaining entity, but avoid this one at all costs. This movie should never had made it past the terrible script, much less the rest of production.--PolarisDiB",Halloween - Resurrection

Murder ensues, as it seems to in these movies. Jamie Lee Curtis briefly returns for a prologue set in a mental institution, probably the only nostalgic bone in the film's body.

The cast is great for what it is— Bianca Kajlich leads the film, and Sean Patrick Thomas and Katee Sackhoff are solid support here. The characters are all archetypical cutouts— sex-hungry college boys, a sassy psychological student, and a blonde ditz who's planning on jump starting her career as a star— but the truth is that in a film like this it really doesn't matter.There are stalk-and-slash scenes a'plenty, and voyeuristic explorations of the Myers house that reveal interesting if not contrived backstory on the legendary screen killer. The last half of the film is ridiculous fun, and it really goes out with a bang. Does it compare to the original string of films? Of course not. How could it?

I first saw this movie when it first came out at the cinema way back in 2002 & it was good fun,but i found it abit stupid because of completely ruining the excellent climax at the end of the excellent H20(1998)!!! so that annoyed me back then but i still got it on video,oh & busta rhymes,he was a terrible choice for this type of film but back then nearly every film put a rap star in it so it was film fashion then!!!Resurrection was ahead of it's time so now i love it for that,by that i mean the whole reality t.v aspect has now completely taken over t.v & this film saw it coming!!!
I loved the exciting feel of exploring the old Myers house at night & the whole film has a fun & exciting feel to it.
An excellent music score too.
I can now enjoy this relic & find it so much fun now & it's alot better than some of the other films in this franchise & even busta rhymes is just silly & fun rather than annoying!!!

DVD has an commentary track by the director and the editor of the film. DVD also has Web Cam Special with optional commentary by the director. Which ""Web Cam Special"" offers some alternative scenes and deleted footage wasn't used in the theatrical cut. DVD also deleted scenes, featurettes and more. Perphas the dumbest thing in this film is the Character of Rhymes. Which he's an OK character until he fights Michael with his Kung Fu Skills!. Which it seems out of place with the rest of the film and sadly Rhymes has an few unintentional laughs as well. Probably what makes this film fairly entertaining is directed by Rosenthal. Which he directed the violent, respectable and underrated ""Halloween 2"". Executive Produced by the late Mousapha Akkad (Who's been involved with every ""Halloween"" movie until the recent remake/prequel of ""Halloween""). Super 35.

57,JoeKarlosi,Halloween: Resurrection (2002) *1/2,4,28 January 2013,"SPOILERS TO FOLLOW! BUT WHO CARES??Those lousy, money grubbing bastards... they just couldn't leave a good thing alone! The previous film, HALLOWEEN H20: TWENTY YEARS LATER, was such an ideal way to end this series, but no --money talked, and so they stretched the rubberband so far here that it snapped. HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION is surely one of the dumbest, unnecessary, most hackneyed attempts to continue a franchise past its expiration date, EVER. The most offensive things occur right at the beginning. At the end of H20 we finally saw Michael Myers killed once and for all when Jamie Lee Curtis chopped off his head with an axe, right? Wrong. Because now an absurd plot device was created where we learn via flashback that prior to the decapitation, Michael supposedly got hold of a paramedic, crushed his larynx so he couldn't speak, and dressed him up in his own clothes and mask; thus, it was actually the paramedic and not Myers who lost his head (!). There is a certain creativity to such an idea, but it's also a cheap way with which to completely obliterate the last movie and try to keep the cash cow milked.The next part really puzzles me. The real Michael Myers arrives at a sanitarium where sister Jamie Lee now resides and he kills her within the first fifteen minutes. That's right - KILLS HER. So all Laurie Strode's efforts from those other Halloween films come to an abrupt and uncaring end in one flash. Aside from the plot point, the main thing that really bothers me about this to this day is why did Jamie Lee Curtis agree to do it? She had gone on record four years prior saying that it was her idea to return for the last chapter (H20) and have the Laurie character get her revenge. I have read that Curtis might have been contractually obligated to return for this cameo, but still it boggles my mind that she would have allowed her self-respected character to get offed, after she had been the one who wanted to bring some dignity back to Laurie Strode. If I ever meet her I'm definitely going to question her about this. Could the money have been THAT good??From here, Michael Myers has no family members left to kill. So a scenario is set up where an internet website is hosting a ""Reality Show"" for Halloween Night, staged in the very same old ""abandoned"" house that Myers grew up in as a child. They've got web cams and a live feed installed so that millions of viewers at home may get a thrill as rapper Busta Rhymes impersonates Michael to make it look good. At first it's just a gag, except when the real Myers heads back home again. You haven't lived until you've seen Busta kung-fu the masked Michael.I can't even write about this. It deserves zero stars for having the audacity to continue in such a stupid manner, but it does have some okay horror moments that earn it a star and a half. As far as I am concerned, HALLOWEEN: H20 was the true final film and this thing doesn't even exist. *1/2 out of ****",Halloween - Resurrection
58,Agent10,When will the pain stop!,2,22 July 2002,"It's time for this series to end and die. The day Busta Rhymes thinks he is an actor is the day Hollywood should start tearing down building. He should stick to his crummy day job. A sad and sick excuse for film, one tends to forget they have a brain due to the mind numbing story and the anesthetized acting, one should enter this film with caution. You may forget your brain due to the hypnotic and hallucinogenic factor of this film. For crying out loud, how many times will Michael Myers die and resurrect. Are they trying to beat Jason and make more crappy sequels. Not really scary, with plenty of bad sound editing, this should be up for the Golden Turkey, no problemo.",Halloween - Resurrection
59,aidanratesmovies,Accidentally Hilarious,5,6 July 2021,"Hardly as horrible as some claim it to be, but certainly not a good film, Halloween Resurrection is easily the most I have laughed at a horror film in a long time- even if it's certainly when they are not trying. I enjoyed this film, even though I also kinda dislike it. It takes some stupid twists and turns here and there that prove to be frustrating, Busta Rhymes is in this movie for some reason, and the look of the mask is again just horrible (did they not learn anything from last time). Not to mention that in addition to that, we have some incredibly bad acting- which can honestly be quite hilarious at times. I mean this is a movie where we have *spoiler alert* Busta Rhymes doing kung fu to fight Michael Myers- how can you not enjoy watching that with a smile on your face. Its relentlessly campy, and although I took almost none of it seriously, I do feel like they could have had a great concept out of this film. The plot with the reality tv show and the cameras inside Myers house is rather interesting- although a bit forced the way they do it. The major problem is, it just doesn't feel like a Halloween film- and rather seems like the start of potential for a completely unrelated horror flick that just roped in Myers for the thrill of it. In the end, I enjoyed Halloween Ressurection for what it is- a stupid, stupid movie- whose some of its parts, as bad as they are, make for an enjoyable but disfunctional ride.My Rating: 4.8/10.",Halloween - Resurrection
60,Movie-ManDan,"Ignore the First 15 Minutes, Think Of It As A Prequel To H20, Then It Will Become A Guilty Pleasure.",7,29 October 2014,"They really should have left the series at H20. It wrapped everything up and ended on a high note. It was also a legitimately good movie. Then they make this. A spoiler: Laurie kills the wrong man at the end of H20, not Michael, so she ends up in a mental institution where he returns and kills her. That sucked!!!! Later on, a group of college students are gathered to partake in a reality show where they have to survive in Michael's house. They have no idea he will show up. Aside from the bad beginning, the whole movie really wasn't bad. I guess you could say it is like when somebody likes Hanson's song MMMBop. The acting is mostly bad and the people are dumb. However, the death scenes and suspense are good. Combine good deaths with bad acting and you will laugh. You wait and hope Michael will kill everybody and are happy when he does. He is really cool in this. Also, I found the house and general filming to be pretty good. I was very impressed to see how spooky the house looked and how good the filming techniques worked. But I could not deny any flaw this movie has, which is a lot. But people should see why this is a guilty pleasure.3/4",Halloween - Resurrection
61,Sandcooler,Or maybe it was all a dream,3,1 March 2009,"""Halloween H20"" was a pretty worthy sequel, a bit slow but still pretty good. Then they just had to level the whole series again. I suppose there is some sadistic fun is seeing how these writers hopelessly try to bend the story their way, but mostly it's just insulting to the audience. I mean, the explanation they give to how Myers can still be alive is terrible. I have seen that Jason movie in which he is brought back from the dead by lightning and I went like yeah, could happen. This could not happen. It makes no sense. I don't expect a good plot from a slasher, but it would have actually been better if they had given absolutely no explanation. About the rest, this thing tries to make up for its story and I appreciate that. There aren't really any creative kills, but the way they're directed makes them look pretty brutal. It's a bother how Michael keeps getting stronger and weaker whenever the script demands it, but really that's a criticism I could give to any of them except for the first one. I like how this one doesn't even try to kid us, leaves the door wide open for a sequel. I just hope it won't have Busta Rhymes.",Halloween - Resurrection
62,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"This entire series should just be retitled: ""RetroActively Changing The Previous Film's Ending""",1,11 July 2014,"Every wretched movie in this yawn-inducing series retroactively changes the ending of the previous film, so, it comes as absolutely no surprise that, yet again, this latest, and last, sequel to Carpenter's wildly overrated original begins by retroactively changing the ending of H2O. It is most difficult to care what happens when we know that, no matter what happens, the ending will be changed in the next sequel, which is contractually obligated. Now get this: it was not The Shape who lost his head at the end of H2O, it was some random ambulance driver, who The Shape dressed in his own clothes and put his mask on before making his escape. Somehow, this random ambulance driver gained superhuman strength, survived being run over by Laurie, assumed a confrontational stance and stared down the van she tried to run him over with for a second time, survived the fall down the hillside, and didn't bother to even try to take his mask off. It was not until *after* she beheaded him that the mask was removed, and we learn of the switch. There are at least SIX completely implausible points in that set up. We've been told repeatedly that Myers is trying to kill any living relative. If that is true, then after he kills JLC at the end of her contractually obligated cameo appearance, why doesn't he bother going after her teenage son (from H2O)? Apparently that would make too much sense. He decides to go back to his childhood home, which, by all accounts, should have been demolished decades ago, and hacks up a group of college-aged losers who are there filming a reality programme for internet viewers. Internet viewers who think it is only a Halloween horror film, and shout commentary at their screens, a la Mystery Science Theatre. The producers even tried to add a little bit of ""buddy movie"" here, as one of the viewers helps the lead girl, over the web. The overly self-aware casting is overflowing with celeb-retards , with ... I shudder to even type his name, ""Busta Rhymes"" as the token rapper, Tyra (America's Next Top Model) Banks, JLC only along for the ride to add her name value to this enervation, along with various other no-names who will never be heard from again, even if their character survives this one. The climax has Myers boringly being set on fire again, and electrocuted, in an ending which made me say ""We already know that won't kill him"", as it rips off Halloween II, co-directed by this film's director, Rick Rosenthal. And of course, the obligatory, contractually obligated set-up for yet another sequel, which, if it ever materialises, will doubtlessly begin by retroactively changing this film's ending. When do we get a sequel which shows Myers going after the Akkads, to finally end this crap?",Halloween - Resurrection
63,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A colossal misfiring that fundamentally betrays the franchise, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is a shallowly-trendy, sub-par by-the-books slasher flick.",1,1 January 2015,"You know a slasher-franchise has reached it's lowest point when an integral scene revolves around an iconic villain such as Michael Myers becoming involved in a cartoonish kung-fu fight (complete with over- the-top Bruce Lee-like screams) against a rapper who was already sort of fading from the public scene even at the time of this film's release. (Btw, that's not spoiling anything.)But hey... at least it wasn't set in space, which is where other horror movie franchises seem to want to go to die when they realize they've run out of ideas. (*Cough, cough*... Friday the 13th, Leprechaun, Critters, etc., *cough*) I guess that's sort-of a plus.""Halloween: Resurrection"" is a tedious, shallowly-trendy, under- written (and under-directed) and shockingly cartoonish nail in the coffin to what started out as an excellent horror film series. The original was a classic by any measure, and a surprising number of the sequels were actually quite good as well. (In particular the second film, and the 20th Anniversary release ""Halloween H20"", both of which are definitely some of the best slasher-sequels ever made.)Even at their worst, earlier entries showed quite a bit of class and effort (even when it failed spectacularly, as in films like ""Curse of Michael Myers""). Whereas this entry is instead keen to deliver the most boringly by-the-books scares and cardboard-flat characters, all while shoehorning in an incredibly dated plot revolving around the internet and reality TV- things that were just starting to take off big at the time. This reveals that the film is little more than a cash-in on the internet/reality-TV crazes, while also trying to capitalize by being part of a recognizable franchise. It's the absolute embodiment of ""hack filmmaking.""And the true tragedy of this- this film was directed by Rick Rosenthal, who directed the generally very well-received ""Halloween II"", which is arguably one of the strongest entries in the entire franchise. In a shocking 180 degree turn, his return to the franchise results not in another solid sequel, but instead this abomination- the absolute worst in the entire franchise.After a prologue sequence too insulting to long-time franchise fans to even bother summarizing here, we are introduced to our new ""characters"" (a term I use loosely), who are to be featured on an upcoming internet-based reality-TV series. The hook of the show: They are to spend a night exploring the old Michael Myers house in Haddonfield, Illinois. Of course you know that that means: Michael comes home, and decides it's time to pick-off these intruders one-by- one, forcing them to try and fight for their survival.Nothing about this film works.Performances are stale, and alternate between irritatingly boring and infuriatingly over-the-top. The worst contender being the aforementioned rapper, Busta Rhymes, who seems to be trying way too hard to convince the world he's a charming, funny, likable actor when he clearly is out of his element. He comes across as a weirdly contrived cartoon-character that has been shoehorned into the film.The script (courtesy Larry Band and Sean Hood) is a disheartening and frankly condescending mish-mash of lazy re-hashes from prior films and the forced inclusion of the ""modern"" (aka, dated within six months) elements like the internet/reality-TV angle. ""Modern"" elements which were clearly only included because one of the writers happened to open up the entertainment section of his newspaper one day and see the words ""internet"" and ""reality-TV"" in the headlines, and came under the impression that putting these contrivances in would make the film feel ""timely.""Add to that the obvious indifference on the part of director Rosenthal, and you can tell this film is just a complete mess. The film feels like he couldn't care less about crafting a good thriller. Scenes are shot with the most obnoxiously boring compositions, set design is cliché (Oooo... creepy, grimy hallways... I haven't seen that before in every other horror film ever), poor costume design, etc. Rosenthal just didn't seem to put his heart into any decision made, and it's clear the whole film suffers for it.Heck. Even the mask used in the film doesn't measure up to previous entries. It's weird, cheap and looks like a bad fan-made piece of costuming, as opposed to a major Hollywood release.This is the film that destroyed the franchise. After the stellar prior entry, I had high hopes, and this film seemed like it was purposely going out of it's way to fail to meet any expectation... Even the lowest of expectation.This gets a well-deserved 1 out of 10. And I personally find it such a bizarrely poor film, that in no way fits in with the rest of the franchise tonally or stylistically... I don't even count it as canonical.",Halloween - Resurrection
64,m-47826,Franchise back to bad sequel mode...,2,23 August 2020,"H20 was the perfect ending to the series. And even if you can overlook that questionable twist, at the start of the film. The opening sequence is so ridiculous, you end up hating the rest, just thinking about it. I was in my teens when I first saw this in theaters, and of course, I thought it was fun. But did it have a good script? Certainly not. And now, almost twenty years after its release, more complaints ensues. The major one being, how old and tired the technology and pop culture references are. Never follow trends to the letter. The casting is mostly filled with nobodies, which is kind of depressing. Jamie Lee Curtis is back, but it felt more like a requirement, than a true commitment to her role. The editing, to create the feeling of an omen, and Michael Myers lingering presence, is extremely cheesy. And if there's something this sequel didn't need. It was more cheesiness. One thing I give it though, the jokes and one liners, are funny. Even when it's silly. And some of the death and chase scenes, are pretty intense. But the fact that they keep using the same scream effects over again, is distracting... Bianca Kajlich was a good finale girl for the film. But couldn't these actresses, including her, scream properly?...",Halloween - Resurrection
65,rivertam26,Entertaining but embarrassing,6,1 March 2020,This is not a good movie. In fact it is a bad one and it also ruins the effect of the previous showstopper before it. That being said it is quite a bit of fun and although it's nowhere near as good as the previous film it feels more like a Halloween sequel than that one did. The film centers on a doomed reality show that happens in the Myers house on Halloween night. Of course Myers is there and systematically stalks and brutalizes the wannabe stars. Some of the entertainment is of the so bad it's good kind from Sarah shattering a glass with her powerful scream to Busta Rhymes entire performance. The kills are fun and Rick Rosenthal of 1981s Halloween II sets a decent atmosphere. Although this sequel is completely unnecessary and doesn't move the franchise forward in any way it's marginally entertaining even though it's embarrassing.,Halloween - Resurrection
66,Pumpkin_Man,Halloween In 'Da Hood!!!,10,20 September 2008,"As a hard-core HALLOWEEN fan, I feel like I'm the only one who truly loves this awesome sequel! My title is called HALLOWEEN In 'Da Hood because it has Busta Rhymes, Tyra Banks, and Sean Patrick Thomas. I love the plot, the setting, and the mood in the film! Michael finally finishes off his sister, Laurie Strode, which kinda sucked. One year has passed and Freddie Harris starts a new website called DangerTainment and six lucky people win a chance to be in it, and the location is Michael Myers' childhood home. I love that the house looks just like the original house. Sara, Rudy, Jen, Bill, Donna, and Jim are the winners, and they meet Freddie and Nora for their interviews. Meanwhile, across town, Myles 'Deckard' Barton is watching Sara do her interview, because he is interested in her and has been helping her with internet stuff. on HALLOWEEN, they all go to the Myers house, and broadcast live on the Internet for millions of people to watch. No one can leave until the show is over, so they are all locked in. Little do they know, Michael is back and doesn't like uninvited guests. At a college HALLOWEEN party, Myles 'Deckard' is watching the show, and when Michael shows up, Myles believes that the people are actually being killed, but no one else at the party does until Sara is the last one alive and calls Myles for help to tell her where Michael is at. Freddie finds Sara and realizes what is happening. Most people hate that Busta Rhymes karate-chops Michael, but I have no problem at all with it! Later, in the garage, Sara has been knocked on the ground with some heavy equipment on her, and Michael is coming to kill her, then Freddie knocks the door down, and says ""Trick or treat, motherfu#*er!"" to Michael because he thought he killed Freddie.

67,DunnDeeDaGreat,Standard sequel with some gulity pleasure moments to a dead horror series,4,13 July 2002,In 1978 John Carpenter released one of the greatest horror movies in the form of Halloween. It's first sequel was okay but after that the series went downhill. It seems that every sequel would have a new backstory on Mr.Meyers and this is one is no execpation. I think the producers make a mistake by killing of Jamie Lee Curtis. Mrs.Curtis is what Halloween is about and only she can stop Meyers. I think the producers should have went with Josh Hartnett (but he's too big for movies like this) or Danielle Harris (but who has seen her in years) together since techinally they are siblings if you tie all the loose ends together. Halloween: Resurrection isn't scary but it's funny which isn't a good thing. Busta Rhymes makes the movie as Freddie Harris with his one-liners and the chicks in the movie are very hot. The film will disapoint hard core fans of the movie and those in the mood for a scare. The film might be better in my book if Bianca Kajlich had shown her knockers but all in all the film is just a gulity pleasure. The death scenes are okay and the chicks are hot. I give it 5/10.,Halloween - Resurrection
68,mattymatt4ever,"After all these horrendous slasher flicks, a good one actually comes along",7,1 August 2002,"After watching these crappy so-called slasher flicks like ""Urban Legends 2"" and ""Valentine,"" I'd be satisfied with a halfway decent slasher flick. Well, this is more than halfway decent--it's good.  Sure, it's nothing extraordinary, and there are those moments where you do wanna scream out, ""How stupid can these people be??"" but overall it's near par.  There are a few good scares, and Michael Myers never ceases to be creepy.  There's even some cool gross-out f/x, including a head rolling down the stairs.  But mainly, what makes it work is that it never gets too cheesy, yet it never takes itself too seriously.  And there's even a lil' bit of female nudity. What's a horror movie without some bare boobs?  Fans of the series will definitely be satisfied.*********SPOILER AHEAD**********If there's one harsh criticism I have, it's Busta Rhymes's speech at the end.  I found Busta perfectly convincing as the money-hungry founder of Dangertainment, in which he scares the hell out of his innocent young recruits to keep his Internet audience glued to the screen.  But at the end, he makes this heavy-handed, ludicrous speech about how the murders of these young people shouldn't be means of entertainment.  OK, maybe if it came out of a better actor's mouth, it would've sounded somewhat convincing--I mean Busta is a fairly good actor, but he's not ready for serious drama.So for all of you who are in doubt of this eighth installment to the series, don't be.  Trust me, bring the popcorn, you'll have one hell of a time!My score:  7 (out of 10)",Halloween - Resurrection

70,ODDBear,Michael still lives,6,21 July 2005,"I recently watched this 8th installment in the series and on the whole I wasn't disappointed. I'm actually one of the few true Halloween fans who liked Halloween H20. I particularly liked the ending. It sort'a wrapped things up neatly I thought. But since they HAD to bring old Michael back (and by the way, I'm not complaining) they at least did it in a semi-plausible way.Halloween Resurrection takes place three years after H20 and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is in a mental hospital, following the traumatic experience of decapitating the wrong guy. Michael pays her a visit and thereafter the Michael vs. Laurie plot is laid to rest.BRING ON SOME NEW MEAT! An internet company titled DANGERTAINMENT (cool title) decides to offer a few young people the opportunity to spend a full night in Michael Myers's old house and the whole show will be broadcast live over the net. Of course, when they get there, Michael is waiting for them with a big sharp knife.Resurrection doesn't offer any novelty to the series. This is a plain slasher fest with no subplot whatsoever. That's basically OK, I mean, it's fast paced, Michael gets down and dirty from the get go and it's over in an hour and twenty minutes. The movie has some definite highlights and it generates a decent amount of suspense and has some very cool kills. Director Rick Rosenthal returns to the series, he made a very decent Halloween 2 and obviously has some respect for the genre.But the film isn't overall successful. It's got a paper thin storyline and you basically don't care about any of the characters, none. There's an annoying storyline concerning a geeky teenage boy at a party who watches the live show and of course he's the only one who knows that the show is for real while everyone else are totally oblivious to that fact. Busta Rhymes isn't very good as a central character. He simply doesn't fit all that well in this movie. His fancy (but utterly stupid) lines over the course of the whole film are really annoying. Just think how much better the movie would have been with a better written character and actor. LL Cool J, also a rapper, fared much better in H20. The internet angle, a new twist, is interesting but not used to it's full potential. I didn't think it added anything, I mean, it's just the routine slash fest that delivers here. And the tunnel, well, I thought it was just too much.But these Halloween films aren't perfect. Fans like them like this, with all their imperfections. They could make 5 more movies like this and I'd go see them and have a good time.Halloween Resurrection is a perfectly acceptable sequel. The first ten minutes alone are a knockout.",Halloween - Resurrection
71,fernandoschiavi,Halloween: Resurrection is tedious from beginnng to the end and ends this second timeline with a sour taste in your mouth. Laurie didn't deserve her fate,3,4 September 2021,"Released in 2002, Ressurection continues the story of H20 (1998) in which we all thought it was the end of the franchise. And to be honest, if I had stopped at it, it would have been the perfect end! However, Miramax Films' greed led to an eighth film in the franchise (Seventh by Michael Myers) to be made. As a matter of fact, they wanted to make a side film (as a third, you know?). With a new story, new killer, etc. But the producer Moustapha Akkad didn't want to, because he was afraid of another failure, just as Halloween III had failed, precisely because it was a film that had nothing to do with the story of Myers. The movie's original title would be Halloween: The Homecoming (something like Return Home) and they even considered returning Danielle Harris, Jamie Lloyd of H4 and H5, for a role in the film. However, the producers wanted to ignore the story of these two, just as H20 did, and they also wanted a title that indicated that Michael was alive, to draw attention. That's how the movie turned into Resurrection.The story of Halloween: Resurrection begins with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) committed to a sanatorium. She is the sister of psychopath Michael Myers (Brad Loree) and was tormented after a series of confrontations with the killer and feeling guilty for a fatal mistake. Once thinking that she had finally managed to kill her murderous brother (as suggested by the previous film in the franchise), she found that she was wrong and another innocent person ended up falling victim to her vengeful rage. Laurie is now just waiting for a new and inevitable confrontation with the serial killer, an event that is confirmed in a definitive deadly encounter between them in an interesting sequence set on the roof of the psychiatric hospital.At the same time, in the psychopath's quiet, small hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, a group of six young people is selected to participate in a program broadcast live over the internet with the suggestive name of Dangertainment (translated as The House of Panic). Its creator is an opportunistic businessman, Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes), who, aided by assistant Nora Winston (Tyra Banks), expects high profitability with a reality show that consists of a group of young people spending a night at the house where the famous murderer Michael Myers he lived his childhood, coinciding with the arrival of the traditional Halloween (the famous Halloween). The archetypal group is formed by a discreet psychologist named Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich), by ambitious Jenna Danzig (Katee Sackhoff), who exclusively wants fame, by culinary student Rudy Grimes (Sean Patrick Thomas), author of several silly jokes, by disinterested law student Bill Woodlake (Thomas Ian Nicholas), rebellious musician Jim Morgan (Luke Kirby), and beautiful Donna Chang (Daisy McCrackin), who struggles to say clever phrases. With cameras on for an internet broadcast, the group gets to know in detail the former home of the dangerous assassin, and as evil inevitably never dies and finds its way home, Michael Myers is back and ready to clean it up, reemerging from limbo to continue its legacy of blood and horror, increasing the region's death toll, and most importantly to keep the extensive franchise in business.Although the track record is not very positive, it is clear that there is a kind of convention where any new film in the Friday the 13th or Halloween series, or other similar productions, has always received a barrage of unfavorable reviews that is already turning into a cliché repetitive. There are a multitude of types of horror movies, with different proposals and different themes, and all of them always have their good and bad elements. Halloween: Resurrection also has its highs and lows. The film begins by trying to correctly explain the chronology of events for those who do not know more about the fictional universe of the franchise, or for those who do not remember clearly the previous events. And it was clarified that only the original 1978 classic with its immediate 1981 sequel, plus Part 7 (Halloween H20 - Twenty Years Later, 1998), were considered in the story, excluding the other films in the series.For starters, it is important to be clear that this new film is the true antithesis of its predecessor: there is nothing innovative, the deaths are not very inventive and every actor who appears on stage seems to be there only to die in the following minutes, without the slightest creativity. There is no effort in search of any kind of verisimilitude. The task of identifying - and rooting for - any character is virtually impossible, as there is no way to believe anything you see. So, how to be scared by what happens on the screen? And a horror film that doesn't provoke fear is certain death - in the worst sense of the expression.Jamie Lee, who makes a small appearance at the beginning, must have at least been well paid - but not enough to make her come back in an eventual sequel, as the script tries to eliminate her for good. The rest of the familiar faces, like rapper Busta Rhymes and top model Tyra Banks, do exactly what you'd expect of them - that is, they play themselves - and take it all as a joke. The girl, Sara (Bianca Kajlich, who has never done anything worthy of note again after this work), knows only how to scream (with the help of the sound effects technician) and run, without showing any other minimally promising quality.The film is short, not wasting time with unnecessary situations and quickly the viewer is invited to witness the real horror of a group of young people who are spending a night in Michael Myers' old house, being attacked by the same, who lived in the basement during the recent years and resurfaces to drive the invaders out of their refuge. For those who appreciate violence and blood, there are good scenes of deaths with young people feeling the killer's extraordinary strength and the power of his sharp blade tearing through their bodies. And there is the interesting setting of an abandoned house of damned fame, with its various rooms corroded by the devastating action of time.In the story, participants in a television program are taken to spend the night in the house where a famous serial killer lived. What they don't know is that he's back and willing not to let anyone leave the place alive. You've already felt the cliché in the synopsis, haven't you? But that's not the only problem. Besides the absurd decision to make Jamie die at the beginning of the film. The leading role is given to a bunch of insufferable characters, played by the worst possible actors. The reality show model that, in theory, should bring apprehension considering the vision of deaths in real time does not work. On the contrary, it makes you laugh. The decision to shoot handheld was also laughable. The poor quality of the image only frustrates the viewer and never causes tension as those involved must have thought. Of course, if in a horror/suspension movie there is an inability to cause tension, apprehension and fear in the viewer, it won't work.Furthermore, Troy Hansen's production design creates some obscure and cavernous spaces for characters to circulate, ideal cubicles for Michael Myers to throw the party. These scenographic choices demonstrate spatial control of those involved, but the obviousness of the dialogues and the randomness of the murders make the narrative very predictable and tiresome. Jumpscares are also used and abused, irritating in the too much sound organization of composer Danny Lux's film. Even in moments when nothing happens (much of the film) the soundtrack remains loud, trying to cause a kind of ""suspense"" or pass some level of threat.It is also noticed that there are undesirable easy scares, idiotic jokes, huge holes in the script, unlikely situations (the police take action only after the massacre, for example), and the unnecessary scenes of sex and drugs, which, although discreet, it is noted that they were inserted as if it were a must in every teen horror film. As well as the obvious, predictable, and mostly unsatisfactory outcome. The character played by rapper Busta Rhymes is ridiculous and almost unbearable, being a greedy creator of the macabre reality show and responsible for a series of banal phrases of attempts at humor, forcing us to root for Michael Myers to verify the quality of the sharpening of his knife in the flesh of the unfortunate.Directed by David Geddes, Halloween: Resurrection is deliberately dark in some passages and flirts a lot with the metalinguistic processes of the reality show. There are jokes about fame, nudity, some dialogue that tries to expand the film's reflexive possibilities, but the uneven direction and the script without dramatic rigidity demonstrate that the project for Michael Myers in the cyberculture era was doomed to failure. Halloween: Resurrection is tedious from beginnng to the end and ends this second timeline with a sour taste in your mouth. Laurie didn't deserve her fate, even though Curtis didn't want to be in the spotlight this time.",Halloween - Resurrection

This last movie of the Halloween series is funnyvery funny indeed! It brings the ""old"" Michael Myers to the XXI century, to the internet era!... The plot is about a group of teenagers that are chosen to participate in a kind of reality-show broadcasted by the internet, ""The Dangertainment"", which consists in being locked at Michael Myers house, exploring everything that belonged to him They thought it would be an amusing entertainment, scaring to the public, but funny to them However they are not home alone, and the fun will begin, but for Myers!The reality-show's fashion has reached the horror films! It's a movie that reflects nowadays society, always waiting for some reality show in the screen! But, on the other hand I think this movie is also a critic to that By a comical point of view it can even be seen as a spoof to the horror flicks, because just to a spoof movie one would mind to create such pathetic idea! This movie would be a nice target to the next ""Scary Movie"" Producers of spoof movies please take a look on it!Beside this ""brilliant"" ""pseudo-scary-reality-show"" the movie is a traditional slasher, just one more to the Halloween series But could/should we expect something else beyond this ""knife cuts flesh"" from a Halloween series movie? Of course not! So it's an average movie anyway!",Halloween - Resurrection

But, like Michael Myers, this series doesn't know when to die.Just like American Psycho 2, this is the sequel we all wish didn't exist.This movie came off during the era of the early internet, cell phones, and rappers in movies. All of that shows in this movie. Make no mistake about it, this is another pulp fiction 2000s teenage slasher film that tries too hard.The only question that I have is how they had such a good internet connection in the 2000s. Even my webcams now sometimes get blurry in the era of 5G wifi..5/5. There's a reason why they asked Rob Zombie to reboot the whole series.",Halloween - Resurrection
75,acidburn-10,Halloween Reality TV style,5,13 September 2007,"After the events of Halloween H20 Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is confined to a mental insitution after killing the wrong man thinking he was Michael Myers, waiting for yet another showdown nut this time she loses Michael Myers finally kills her and after that he heads home, only to find that his home has been used for an Internet reality TV show where a group of teenagers and TV crew are using it and thats when the bloodbath starts up again.Halloween Resurrection is fun and entertaining and one of my faves out of the entire Halloween franchise. despite the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis dies within' the first ten minutes which is a end of an era, I was so sad to see her go after ruling the entire franchise with an iron fist, the oarts she was in Halloween 1 and 2, H20 and this one are definitely the best ones. Another thing about this one is that there are more deaths which should keep hardcore fans happy and plenty of totty to look at. Keeping with that pattern, ""Halloween 8"" also mostly discards (except for Laurie's involvement) all of the previous Mike Myers carnivals. But the worst sin which H8 commits is discarding H20's main raison d'etre (Michael back to stalk his nephew) to give our beloved mass murderer the task as just another psycho killing for no reason. A dumb thing about this movie is that there is no mention of Laurie's son John (played by Josh Hartnett in H20)! Where are the new answers promised? The links to the previous entries? Probably in Akkad's bank account.Screenplay-wise, this has to be the thinnest of all the Halloween films. The lead characters are so beyond underdeveloped it's a screen writing crime. And what about our heroine Sara (Kajlich)? You know the LEAD girl? She's also abandoned for a long period of time and I can't say that I found out anything about who she was throughout the film. And then we have the lousy dialogue, I laughed my ass off more than once. *MINOR SPOILERS* Wait till you see that chick hit Mike with a chainsaw that was funny as hell.Structure-wise, the flick is very simple...maybe too simple. We only get one subplot that has to do with Sara and some Don Juan kid (Merriman) flirting with her via email (God, I missed Sam Loomis there), but even that angle isn't explored to its fullest. Sure it wound up being a kool plot device during some of the tenser stalk sequences but in the end, it didn't amount to anything on a character level The murders here are way slick (loved the crushed head bitvery nice) and mostly came through. Thank you for that. I also enjoyed the ""Blair Witch"" type vibe the film put out with the web cams. Rosenthal splits the screen 4 ways at times and the constant POV shots from the main players gave this sequel a more involving aura that often made up for the non-existent screenplay. Last but not least, I loved the small nods to ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween 2"" and really got into the Myers vs Rudy (Thomas) knife battle in the kitchen. Fun stuff.The acting Bianca Kajlich screams very well but she's no Jamie Lee Curtis didn't find her interesting enough, Busta Rhymes was awesome he was the best one in the whole film with his wacky dialogue and awesome kung fu moves he ruled this movie, Sean Patrick Thomas annoyed the hell of out me I'm glad he got killed off, and well not exactly going up in the acting world after making his name in Save The Last Dance, he just ends up in a slasher movie as a pointless annoying victim wrong career move, where is he now, Tyra Banks (Nora) shakes that ass and grabs that cash. Ryan Merriman (Myles) does what he has to do well. Billy Kay's character Scott really rubbed me the wrong way. Daisy McCrackin is stunning but doesn't do much, Luke Kirby was funny and annoying at the same time but had fun with his role, Katee Sackhoff the Brittany Murphy lookalike played the blonde bimbo well was she pretending to be annoying and stupid or is she a bad actress who knows but she has a great death scene, Thomas Ian Nicolas had a seemingly pointless role much like he did in the last American Pie movie, and lastly Jamie Lee Curtis although she wasn't in it much she was still the best thing about this movie and Brad Loree played Michael Myers well definitely one of the better ones throughout the series.All in all Halloween 8 does cut it as a sequel better than parts 3,5 and 6, despite the fact that Laurie is gone and there's no story left to tell. this is just a fast paced slasher movie with pleasing results and some wicked death scenes, although this one may not be as good as Halloween H20 it still rocks.",Halloween - Resurrection

I do like the idea of a ""Survivor""-esque reality show on the internet within the Myers house idea but the idea seem to got wasted by the bad acting, some miscasting, some lame killing sequences and a stupid fight sequence with Busta Rhymes kicking Myers's butt as he quotes ""Trick or Treat Motherf*****"".

79,LoneWolfAndCub,A real low for the Halloween series.....,2,26 June 2006,"I thought 3 and 6 were terrible, well, this takes the cake as worst Halloween movie and one of the worst movies in general. It is overall an appalling movie with disgraceful performances, a shoddy script, bad characters and a generic, boring score.The movie had a great start. We see Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now confined to a mental asylum. But it's not to long until good ole Michael Myers (Brad Loree) drops by and knocks her off. This is when the movie slowly descends into the crapper. A group of teens audition to spend a night in the Myers' house courtesy of Dangertainment. Alas, it all goes terribly wrong as Mikey pays them a visit.I'll start by saying, if the movie had been edited to only include the first 10 minutes, it would have been better than this 90 min pile of crap. Busta Rhymes gives possibly the worst performance in history and the rest of the cast are only a cut above him. The script is poorly written and the characters were not interesting. The score was generic and not the least bit scary. Brad Loree does play a good Michael though, and surprisingly he was the best actor (bar Curtis).Usually I'm OK for some mindless slasher entertainment but when its this bad, I just can't hack it.1/5.

So there is NO Myers for this film.I find it unlikely that he would be able to locate her in the Mental Institution (why was she even there anyway?).And once he'd killed Laurie there was no reason for him to do anything any more. He would never have known about the TV show being done at the Myers old house.Why had this house not been demolished? It's been empty a long time and no-one would ever buy it considering it's history.And no-one knew about the tunnels under the house? Did anyone else notice the mistake where the girl read the newspaper article about Laurie Strode ""Myers Sister""? That's wrong, she was a babysitter, nothing more.I doubt the police would have allowed anyone to film on a house on such a day. Oh, and being hung from the camera flex would have killed him.The whole film became a joke once the last girl got the chainsaw. At least the electrocution would have killed him beyond any shadow of a doubt.This is the 1st Halloween film to end showing us Myers is still alive.

Granted though, it does have some entertaining parts. The best sequence is really the opening with the cameo by beloved Jamie Lee, who does a nicely humorous turn in her brief appearance.Resurrection isn't a completely dead film, it really just suffers from some unnecessary silliness.

Freddie Harris and Nora Winston are reality programmers at DangerTainment, and are planning to send a group of 6 thrill-seeking teenagers into the childhood home of Myers. Cameras are placed all over the house and no one can get out of the house... and then Michael arrives home!When i first heard about this, i thought the concept was brilliant. Each character given a video game and sent into Michael Myers. Unfortunately, the idea didn't turn out too well. The film started off fantastic with the Halloween theme leading into the death of Laurie Strode, and then after that, the film just died. I actually found the acting in this film quite bad. The stars just could not fit in with the story and it's concept. Busta Rhymes character for me was the worst individual in this film. His acting came across very poor and seemed to best fit in a cheap, rip-off, straight to DVD movie. Once they entered the house, they should have really kept the film to the hand held cameras. The film would have been a lot more scary and more interesting if it didn't switch to an actual camera for the death scenes.

Things go awry.Halloween 4, 5 and.6 were awful. No question about it. They presented a storyline that nobody cared about and, despite their best efforts, failed to deliver anything more than a generic slasher formula.When the team decided to retcon themselves with H2O, they were on to something. They were able to bring Jamie Lee Curtis back on as Laurie Strode and, for that brief moment in time, all was well (well, as much so as things can possibly be when a mother/son duo are being stalked by the masked killer). H2O ended at the perfect time; the series was as good as it had been in a number of years....And then, this happened.This film is to the Halloween franchise what Hellworld was to the Hellraiser franchise, although this particular film is even more insulting because you have H2O directly before it which was a nice reset and brought things back to an enjoyable place, whereas Hellraiser didn't.This movie is so generic. These characters are copied and pasted from the book of horror movie cliches and they interact with one another in such a way that every single moment is nothing more than exposition. There's no humanity in the interactions. Every single word of dialogue is just rushing you to the killer so these kids can die off and we can go home, which is a real shame.Unfortunately, this is far from the first time that financially motivated decisions beat out intelligent creative ones. Halloween is a franchise that never seems to fail in the box office department, and the studios know this. By the time we hit Halloween: Resurrection, the series has been milked for more than it's worth, and this is really the final nail in the coffin. This would be like if Wes Craven's New Nightmare had a sequel after somewhat re-setting the franchise and Wes, Robert, Heather and the team had nothing to do with it.The best actress in this entire franchise, Jamie Lee Curtis, is brought back once again... and they wasted the opportunity. They gave her a throwaway role in order to be able to slap her on the cover without needing to worry about a false advertising lawsuit, give her a pay check and send her out the door. Sure, the decisions with the character may have been her idea, but that doesn't mean the viewer is required to be on board with them. This entire movie was just a rushed effort to bring in as much money as possible and, while it may have succeeded in that area, it failed where it really mattered. Not, of course, that the studio really cares about any of that.Oh, how the mighty have fallen!",Halloween - Resurrection

The gimmick is there, the initial idea is good but was not developed; most of the characters are unidemensiomal with zero development; very weak dialogue; a lot of cheap scares that don't work at all; even if I think Halloween franchise takes itself way too serious sometimes, here is the total opposite working almost as a parody.Still not the worst.

Boy was I wrong. The first 15 minutes were awesome, edge of your seat thrills, and scary. The rest was just as scary. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. My favorite Halloween movies are now Halloween the original, Halloween H2O, and now Halloween Resurrection. The rest of them aren't that great. The music was creepy like usual. The acting was good. I although had a little trouble with Sean Patrick, and the guy off of American Pie. I would watch them and think of Save the Last dance, and American Pie. But other than that this was such a great movie. I understand why people would be upset about what happen to Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie, but honestly if her brother can live through all the sequels why can't she. And plus the ending of Resurrection has an opening for another Halloween film. It would be so cool if Michael and Laurie Strode were in another Halloween Film and this time they duke it out one last time. You never know. it could happen. But moving on.

The writers somehow threw together an explanation to the H20 ending that saved Michael from his apparent death. I'm not a fan at all of the beginning scenes with Laurie Strode and its quite said that it ended this way with a hack installment. The movie went in the direction of a hood MTV real-world type feel which I guess was aimed to attract young audiences instead of true horror fans. The film takes place in Michael's old house which oddly changes a lot in each movie. The majority of the cast stunk, especially Busta Rhymes, it was only Bianca Kajlich who was likable.

Because spending a considerable amount of time and patience is not worth it at all when it comes to soulless drivel like Halloween: Resurrection. This has got to be the most stupidest horror film I have ever seen(on TV one Saturday afternoon to be precise). With a bunch of flat, uninteresting characters whom I didn't give a rats ass if they lived or died, I didn't care for the whole film either. It's not enough that the actors suck but putting celebrities in a horror movie?!?!?!?! How freaking stupid is that? Are they expecting us to believe that they can deliver a good acting performance? Well, they failed miserably at that and I'm glad GLAD for that. The funniest part of the whole film is Busta Rhymes going all Bruce Lee on Michael Myers in one of the most laughably stupid and illogical pieces of ""comedy"" in film history.

A group of eager college kids join a reality web cast to spend the night in the house of Michael Myers. Unbeknownst to them, Michael is living under the house, and he doesn't want them there. This sequel sucks because it doesn't even fit in with the rest of the movies. Every movie was about Michael Myers' quest to kill all of his family members and those who get in his way. Nothing happens in this movie that's important, except he finally kills Laurie, which was a BIG mistake. The rest of this movie is filler. Michael Myers killing people just to make the audience cheer. And the audience doesn't cheer, trust me.The acting in this movie sucks. It features the corniest acting I've ever seen on film this side of Friday the 13th Part VII. Busta Rhymes lacks any acting talent whatsoever. Every time he opens his mouth a stupid line comes out, and it's actually annoying. I also hated how his character knew karate just from watching kung fu movies, and he beats the crap out of Michael Myers. I have to say though, the reason this movie gets a 3 instead of a 1 is because it had one memorable scene where Michael is facing Busta Rhymes dressed as Michael, and Busta Rhymes mistakes Michael Myers for someone in his staff, and he reams Michael out. It gives you a bit of a laugh. The female lead in this movie lacked everything needed for a female lead in this type of role. She wasn't a good actress.

Like H20 this isn't really a Halloween movie.

It did well at the box office and it has Jamie Lee Curtis kicking some Myers butt. The faltering franchise was dead until H20 revived it. H20 wasn't great but at thst point it was definitely the best film since Halloween 2.In 2002 we got Halloween: Resurrection. The web was starting to be more part of our lives so this film was put together with that in mind. Michael Myers for the internet age. The film opens pretty well actually with Jamie Lee Curtis returning as Laurie. She is in a mental institution. Apparently she had a breakdown after finding out that the man she killed in H20 was not Michael Myers. She apparently is catatonic from all of the medicine she is given. She fakes taking it she gets up and sees Michael. He goes after her and the confront each other. It is the only half way decent scene in the film. It's all downhill from there!!!We meet Freddie and Nora played by Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. They produce an internet reality show. They want to spend tge night and broadcast their show from Michael's childhood house. They get a band of really bland and stupid college students to spend the night to see if they could find out what made Michael a killer. And you know what happens next. Michael picks them off one by one in the house while the show is online so people are watching in real time. All of this is filmed with different types of cameras because there are supposedly cameras all over the house. No story, nothing, Michael in the house killing kids making a reality show. It us done without an ounce if tension. This movie came out 2 years after the very successful Scream so they went for thst kind of cool 90's vibe with this film. It fails miserably to create any tension at all. Rich Rosenthal directed this film. He was a veteran of the series having directed Halloween 2. Even though that film was not on the level of the original Halloween, it was a good sequel. The film looks good at times, the multiple looks of the cameras is kind of cool but that's it. There was just no tension, let alone scares to care much. Some of the casting in this film is just downright awful. I hope Jamie Lee Curtis got well paid for her little 5 minute cameo because it's the only thing worth seeing in this film.Jus horrible.Worst film in the series by far!!!Grade: F.",Halloween - Resurrection
99,Rendanlovell,No,1,21 August 2020,"Note to self: Never title or subtitle a movie with the word Resurrection. Doing so dooms the production to failure. Alien: Resurrection is definitely the worst Alien movie and Halloween: Resurrection is by far the worst Halloween movie. Straight from the jump this is nothing short of embarrassing.Not only is Michael Myers back after being decapitated but Jamie Lee Curtis is back as well. Both are introduced in the first scene and Jamie is dispatched shortly after, in possibly the most anticlimactic kill in the series. What's worse is the way they explain away Michael Myers decapitation. Apparently he had the quick wit to chsnge clothes with a paramedic that was inexplicably around, and then left for no reason.Really an awful opening scene meant solely to tie up a few lose ends. Then the rest of the film starts, and it's equally terrible if not worse. For one the film looks like garbage. It's shot horribly, it's lit horribly, and any visual effects suck.Not to mention the atrocious acting. Or the incredibly stupid reality tv story. Which is kicked off by the main character screaming. That's what gets her a tv job. A light gets knocked over and she screams. What an awful story catalyst.It's also inexcusably lame. Early 2000s were loathsome at best. Disgusting fashion, obnoxious music, terrible speed ramping, and ugly ugly production design. Simply, this movie should not have been made. Why even think about writing a screen were michael uses a camera to a guy? Why cast Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks in a Halloween movie ever? Don't see this.",Halloween - Resurrection
100,monstermayhem32,What was once a great franchise starts to show it's age,6,6 August 2007,"Halloween Resurrection is by far one of the worst boring and uncreative Halloween sequel ever created. The series should have ended with Halloween H20 since the series would have had closure with Laurie Strode finally facing her fear of her brother Michael Myers and finally killing him for good. Instead the filmmakers attempt to cash out the franchise for all it's worth and doesn't even attempt to at least create an interesting story and characters that the fans care about like Halloween 4 did with Jamie Lloyd and Rachel Carruthers who were excellently played by Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell. The Story follows three years after H20 in which Laurie is now in Smithsgrove sanitarium for killing a paramedic in which she though was Michael. Michael returns and eventually kills off his sister, one year later a company called Dangertainment plans to have a internet live show in the Myers house which Michael returns to Haddonfield to kill off the unwanted guests. the acting in this film is horrible, and the character are a bunch of dumb pot heads, who are completely clueless of who Michael Myers is. Despite a well famous cast like Tyra Banks, Sean Patrick Thomas, Busta Rhymes, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Thomas Ian Nicholas the films suffers from many plot holes. The only good things about the film is Michael Myers's mask, the house, and Jamie's performance of Laurie Strode who is clearly tired of fighting Michael and is very beaten down and worn out.",Halloween - Resurrection

Outside of Curtis, I knew no one, and frankly believe they'll never amount to anything anyway. Though I understand the first 10 minutes were there to establish a link between this piece of trash and H20 -- I disliked it tremendously. The set up -- a bunch of mindless students share Micheal Myer's house on Halloween with cameras in every room, and no one on the outside sees anything weird until well into the third reel. It is sad that such a great franchise has finally -- and again -- scrapped the creative bottom of the peanut butter jar. I rented this for a buck, along with some good movies.

109,happyendingrocks,Next up: P. Diddy battles Michael Myers in a steel cage?,6,23 October 2009,"After the pointless mess that was Halloween H20, I was obviously not all that excited to witness the Resurrection. However, once I've invested my time in 7 films in a franchise, it's pretty much a given that I'm going to see the 8th, if only to hold on to the vain hope that maybe someday I will get a Halloween sequel that comes anywhere close to matching the original.Resurrection isn't necessarily a good movie, but by utilizing a fresh concept and doing some interesting things with it, the film at least manages to be entertaining. At this point in the franchise, offering a Michael Myers tale that doesn't make you want to turn off the movie midway through is a genuine accomplishment.Perhaps the most rewarding thing about this 8th Halloween installment is how much it catches the viewer off guard. After all, with both Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks in the cast, we're almost assured that this will be the penultimate awful Halloween sequel. But, when the end result is a modestly entertaining 90 minutes, we have to concede that Resurrection manages something that some of the other entries in the franchise haven't done.Don't get me wrong; there's still stupidity galore here.The opening scene with the return of Laurie Strode has nothing to do with the film that follows, and we get the sense that Jamie Lee Curtis only agreed to appear in Resurrection so that she could be killed off, thus sparing herself the indignity of ever having to appear in a Halloween movie again. While we should probably feel some sort of dramatic impact after seeing her finally fall prey to the bogeyman who has pursued her through three films before this one, the entire sequence is so devoid of suspense or purpose that any sense of climax is negated, and it's hard to feel much sympathy for our former protagonist when she essentially walks into the knife herself.Busta Rhymes is one of the main characters here, which is asinine enough in itself, but this idiocy is compounded by the series of lame one-liners he has throughout the film. In a franchise that has set new standards of dumb, there's no debating that the single worst line to ever grace a Halloween film is delivered from Busta's lips here: ""trick or treat, motherf****r"". Did I mention he also does karate in this movie? Unfortunately, I'm totally serious.Battlestar Galactica fans may be excited at the prospect of an early appearance by Katee Sackhoff. But don't be; she's the single most irritating and unlikable character in a cast full of them, and the dialogue our beloved Starbuck is forced to deliver is a frakking embarrassment.Then there's the slight problem of Michael Myers being decapitated at the conclusion of Halloween H2O, which could be viewed as a considerable hindrance to his being able to slash his way through his roster of victims here. Though the explanation used to solve this problem is iffy at best, it's worth noting that if you watch the finale of H2O, there isn't a single element that betrays the unlikely scenario described here. At least they thought it through a bit, we have to give them that.Elsewhere in the film, there is other evidence of a brain being involved somewhere in the creative process. The concept itself is strong and timely, and the execution is well realized. The alternation between different cameras to give us first-person views from our doomed characters that augment the standard film format sets up some nice images, particularly since we're dealing with dark and grainy video that heightens the tension on its own. Michael Myers hasn't looked scarier in years than he does lurking in the shadows of his dilapidated house, as seen through the POV cameras of his future victims.We alternate between the happenings inside the house and the view of the voyeuristic internet users watching the events from the safety of the outside world, and the reactions of the viewers are particularly smart. As Michael slices his way though the cast, the online audience is engrossed in the story, but unwilling to believe that what they are seeing is real. This is a fine commentary on how our media culture has learned to distrust how genuine the elements of reality TV are, and how we've adapted to accepting the most loathsome activities of the stars of these shows as part of the entertainment. Whether or not the film-makers realized they were making this observation, it remains a keen piece of media criticism.Though the door is clearly left open for yet another Halloween sequel, the franchise has splintered now, and Rob Zombie's reboot pushed the series in another direction. It's sort of too bad, since there is enough promise in Halloween: Resurrection to suggest that capable hands could have gotten the saga of Michael Myers back on track. Whatever film-maker ultimately decides to pick up the thread of this story where it left off, they would be wise to note the things that Resurrection does right, since it assuredly outshines the two film that preceded it. Not a difficult thing to do, granted, but a distinction nonetheless.",Halloween - Resurrection
110,Toronto85,Halloween: Resurrection,5,1 July 2013,"'Halloween: Resurrection' is the eighth instalment in the original Halloween series, and in my opinion tied for worst of them all. It takes place three years after Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) supposedly chopped off Michael's head in 'Halloween H20'. Well we find out in this one that she got the wrong guy, and has since been locked away in a psychiatric facility. Michael kills her early on (WHICH I HATE!..) and we make our way to Haddonfield to meet our main cast of characters. Our main group of six is a bunch of young people participating in a reality show run by Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks...yeah. Anyways, the show consists of the group having to spend Halloween night in the scariest house in the USA - The infamous Myers house! Michael of course does not like this, and dispatches most of them in gruesome ways leading to a fiery conclusion.This one definitely the weakest of the original series, right next to 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers'. At least part 5 had some real connection the Myers story! After Laurie is killed, we get a bunch of newbie characters that we never really even care about. The acting is OKAY, but the characters' are written as the most irritating people in existence. I never really cared for most of their safety, except maybe Sean Patrick Thomas' character Rudy. The main girl Sara is nice enough, but she is written and acted as a complete bore. The twist of having the reality show was good though, and I give them marks for thinking outside the box. Their time in the Myers house is also broadcast on the web thanks to Cameras set up all over the place, which adds an interesting twist when a person watching the show has to help guide the reality stars to safety. The scares just aren't there though, and that's what I watch a 'Halloween' film to get. I want to be startled. Michael isn't intimidating or creepy or even scary in this one. Completests of the series and of horror films (like myself) will have to see this at least once, but it's the weakest of them all for sure. The gore is fine, and the Myers house is done up well, but it's a disappointment.5/10",Halloween - Resurrection

114,Mr_Censored,"Should have been titled ""Halloween: Crucifixion""",2,31 October 2008,"Picking up where ""Halloween H20"" left off, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" re-writes the previous installment's ending so that Michael has actually survived, via the ol' switcheroo. After a little detour to the local mental hospital to face off with his sister once again, Michael Myers heads home and is anything but pleased to find a group of college kids filming an internet documentary/web-cast on his turf. Quicker than you can say ""Silver Shamrock,"" Michael dispatches violently of the brain-dead, overly horny cardboard cut-outs in an attempt to clean house.To say this film is a new low for the series is an understatement. Fact of the matter, to this day, I cannot say why they even bothered making this film, assuming that it's sole purpose was to make a little money. Perfectly mirroring that theory is the complete lack of a soul in this film. Sure, in the '78 original, Michael was meant to be a blank slate without conscience or reason. But does that mean that any of his films should share those characteristics? The eighth installment in the franchise was surely the final nail in the coffin of what was a very troubled series. Despite it's various off-shoots and dropped story lines, the ""Halloween"" series always carried itself as a more intelligent, reasonable franchise. Not as outlandish and far-fetched as the Freddys and Jasons of the eighties, Michael and his films were more often than not, believable. As fans, we have weathered cults, curses, men in black, sisters, uncles, nieces, Marco Beltrami, characters and stories that constantly met dead ends and everything but the kitchen sink -- heck, even a film that had nothing to do with Michael -- so to say we were used the abuse by 2002 would be an understatement. But by insulting our intelligence with it's downright stupid explanation as to how Michael survived his last fling and then following it up with the lamest, weakest story of the franchise, it seems as though they genuinely didn't care about making a decent product this time.Basically, with this film, the intention was to create a fast-food version of Michael Myers. He walks, he stalks, and he slashes rappers, models and mid-20's actors trying to be teenagers. There is zero story to be told, as Michael basically takes a detour from the usual ""Halloween"" mythos to slice and dice some random meat. Despite the fact that Rick Rosenthal -- who also directed ""Halloween II"" -- can deliver a good looking film, there is nothing else of substance. No suspense, no scares. The characters -- even the intended survivors -- are paper-thin and uninteresting. Heck, they even got Michael Myers wrong. Aside from a completely disinterested Brad Loree, what was up with those eyebrows? Heck, they even butchered the Myers set...err, I mean...house. I could break it down for you some more, make it seem even more unsavory, but it would be pointless. Just know that any sequel bearing the name ""Resurrection"" is a waste of time. Sure, if you turn off your brain and forget Sam Loomis, Laurie Strode and everything else you came to know and love about ""Halloween"" and see this as a modern ""Friday the 13th"" with Michael doing the dirty-work, it can be enjoyed on a very simple level. Afterall, with so many bad characters to choose from -- most notably, a karate-kicking Busta Rhymes -- a little bit of pleasure can be derived from seeing their ultimate demise, a reassurance that they won't taint the ""Halloween"" name ever again. Other than that, though, there's nothing else to write about.",Halloween - Resurrection
115,dormesher-21565,The guilty pleasure movie,7,7 October 2018,"Halloween Ressurection the guilty pleasure Halloween movie not a great at all and has a lot problems but I still have a lot of fun with this movie and I still think it's more enjoyable than 5 it's definitely a guilty pleasure.The negatives In this movie. Killing of Laurie Strode the way they did was stupid and very disrespectful to the character.
I think the movie would been better they set in the hospital and Michael was hunting Laurie all the way through movie and kills her at the end that would been awesome.
Because untill he kills her that opening scene is really effective and really well done he's dark and definitely feels more like Halloween.
Also the Michael looks in this movie is garbage he and in my opinion the worst he has looked in the franchise in my opinion.
Buster Rhymes sucks he just sucks he made of Michael Myers and that's just something you do not do the martial arts scene is just laughable and so cheesy.Apart from that I do have fun with this movie it's definitely a guilty pleasure and I do respect it for doing something different in the franchise getting Michael away from killing his family members and him being getting back to killing random victims was a bold move that I respect and enjoy its alot of fun.
There some cool kills and the scenes in the house are really interesting bringing in the found footage was different for the franchise at the time and I respect them for trying it.Now I do like the way bring Michael back the fact that it wasn't him in the mask which if you watch H20 it does sort of hint at when he touched his face looks like he's scared so it makes sense that he swapped masks with someone and got away I like that.My favourite scene in the film is In the opening when Michael gives that mental paitent his knife and he explains who Michael and says now he's come back and the music plays it's always been a bad ass scene Michael looks bad ass when he's walking away.Verdict 7.1/10 has a lot of problems but definitely a fun movie and a guilty pleasure in the Halloween Franchise.

116,erwan_ticheler,Another lame Halloween sequel,3,29 October 2006,"It is so sad to see that the Halloween has bogged down into a never ending story of bad film making.After the highly praised and indeed brilliant first installment by John Carpenter the film have gone from reasonably okay (part 2), to bad and even worse (the next sequels although I must say that I've never seen part 6).No it has never been good news since 1978 when Michael Myers is concerned and that's a pity.The first film that had all the great stuff a good slasher should have (except maybe for the supernatural ending) was never equaled,not even close.Even part 3 that tried to give a new non-Michael tail to the story was pretty disappointing if you ask me.Not to mention the stories with Michael's niece.H20 brought back Laurie but with no good effect although we all thought that Michael was dead by now (hey,his head got chopped off).In Halloween:Resurrection (lame title) the first thing we hear is that Laurie killed the wrong person cause Michael put his mask on a father of 3,poor Laurie now she is a killer.In the opening she is again stalked by Michael who tries to kill her and seems to succeed when he stabs poor Laurie several times after we see Laurie fall down (but is she really dead,that's something for everybody to discuss about,I'm not really sure).Anyway,in the rest of the movie she won't be bothered again.The rest of the film is an unmotivated and uninspired follow up of badly shot death and mayhem in Michael's old house in Haddonfield.The attempt by Rick Rosenthal (who actually made the first sequel) to recreate some of the tension and atmosphere of the original fails entirely because of the bad story,bad cinematography and bad acting.The story is full of flaws (why does he go on killing after Laurie's death what he sincerely believes and why can he simply kill people without anyone noticing it on the web cams,it's too accidental),the cinematography is not any better (the small cameras make for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience and the slow motions are very annoying not to mention the full view shots of Michael as he comes storming towards someone,which is totally against the great first person view of the original) and the acting is inert especially by Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes although the rest of the cast isn't much better.The characters are too standard to give any depth.No,this Halloween installment again fails to compete with the original or with any good or even decent horror movie for that matter.Myers becomes more and more some kind of immortal godlike (or Satan) creature who refuses to die as we also see in the ending of this movie sadly enough.Another sequel seems to come although thanks goodness none has arrived yet,maybe Hollywood has come to senses and Michael laid to rest.Poor Michael (or poor Laurie) does not deserve another hellish Halloween sequel.",Halloween - Resurrection

119,LanceBrave,Like some chicken-fried muthaf...,3,5 November 2013,"""Halloween: H20"" was as natural a conclusion as the series could ask for. It, also, made lots of money. Naturally, another sequel had to made, even if it meant undoing a satisfying ending. The public demanded more Michael Myers, they got more Michael Myers.""Halloween: Resurrection"" spends its opening minutes undoing that satisfying ending. Which isn't easy. Michael was super-dead at the end of ""H20."" In order to get around that, the screenwriters cooked up an absurd solution. Michael Myers has always been a thoughtless force of nature. The opening retcons the previous ending by having Myers suddenly develop a sense of cunning. He switches places with a paramedic, making sure to crush the guy's larynx so he can't scream, and walks off, leaving Laurie to murder an innocent man. This contradicts 24 years of history. The manslaughter causes Laurie to crack, placing her in the loony bin. This is conveniently explained by two nurses. After three years of twiddling his thumbs I guess, Mikey tracks his sis down. The final-final confrontation between brother and sister is underwhelming. Laurie ensnares the Shape with a remote-control pulley she set-up at some point. Once again defying characterization, Michael tricks Laurie into (stupidly) stepping into his kill radius, ending their sibling rivalry forever. Because the movie hadn't trampled over his personality enough all ready, Myers makes friends with a fellow inmate before walking off. Jaime Lee Curtis only returned so she could die, insuring no involvement with future sequels. This is very obvious. She sleepwalks through her five minutes of screen time.Despite conceiving an ending even more final then the previous final ending, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" continues onward. Two internet reality television moguls dream up an event, a group of photogenic college students left in the abandoned Myers house with camera's strapped to their heads. Their experiences are streamed over the internet, despite this being 2002, when high-speed internet wasn't widely used. Michael shows up, of course, slashing his way through the generic slasher bait. He spends most of the movie standing in the shadows, waiting for his queue. The life of a slasher must be so ho-hum When I say generic, I mean it. The characters of ""Halloween: Resurrection"" are by-far its worse attribute. Bianca Kajilch's Sara is the virginal final girl, shy, reserved, and an attentive student. Best friend Jen, played by pre-fame Katee Sackoff, is her bubble-headed best friend. If this had been made in the eighties, we definitely would have seen her boobs. Speaking of boobs, redhead Donna pretends to be smart but is your typical slasher movie slut. She bangs a guy she's known a few hours and thinks a dusty basement is an ideal romantic spot. Jim, who has no further development beyond ""the horny guy,"" goes for it. Bill fills the obnoxious prankster role and, thankfully, dies early. Token black guy Rudy seems reasonable but even he lights up a bong for no reason. You'd think a post-""Scream"" film wouldn't partake in clichés. Such blatant throwbacks might have been charming if it had been intentional. No, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is just badly written.Those characters are thin and terrible. They're not the worse. Busta Rhymes plays Freddie Harris, the man behind ""Dangertainment."" Rhyme is obviously not a trained actor. He mugs furiously and it gets worse the longer on camera he is. He shouts all his dialogue in a macho brogue. Early on, he watches a kung-fu movie in his hotel room. This is meant to set up a later scene where he ninja-kicks Michael Myers through a window. As big as an indignity as that would be for a once-feared horror villain, ""Resurrection"" goes lower. Freddie returns to save the day and puts the monster down. How? He shocks him in the balls with a live-wire. Rhymes destroys every scene he's in. I hope he ad-libbed lines likes ""Trick or treat, muthaf**ka!"" or ""Like some chicken-fried motherf**ker!"" No screenwriter deserves the indignity of writing dialogue like that. Terrible human being Tyra Banks plays another terrible human being, one who ignores someone being murdered on camera twice. At least the movie has the good sense to kill her.The movie can't even get Myers right. Yeah, he looks okay. The mask is a better sequel example, though the hair is still off. However, the killer's behavior is completely wrong. He puts a knife down in the heat of the moment to kill a dude with his hands. After stabbing someone, he gets more knives just to decorate the corpse. Most egregiously, he lets Busta boss him around in a scene that recalls ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy."" At this point, I can only assume that Michael truly did die at the end of ""H20"" and this character is an impostor. That makes more sense.The high-tech angle rarely comes into play but still ends up being one of the movie's better attributes. A group of partiers watching the live feed recreate slasher movie audience. They yell at the people on-screen and cheer at the death scenes. Sara's internet boyfriend texts her helpful hints. These might have been comments on slasher movie formula. If they were, any further commentary is lost amidst the sea of clichés.Part 2's Rick Rosenthal returns to the director's chair. Any talent Rosenthal might have is over edited, as ""Resurrection"" features grainy flashbacks and flashing white lights. Danny Lux's score is generic though makes good use of Carpenter's original theme. John earned his musical royalty check on this one. The movie is packed full of lame jump scares and unintentional hilarity. For these reasons and more, it is the worse ""Halloween"" film, outpacing even part six. Six was a mess but its badness was ambitious and audacious. ""Resurrection"" is boring, lazy, stupid, and pointless.",Halloween - Resurrection

Yahoo chat rooms? PDAs? The internet? Busta Rhymes?

121,llihilloh,The worst one yet.,2,23 December 2002,"*~*~*~ Spoilers Ahead *~*~*~Oh, this film is bad.  I'm a big fan of the 'Halloween' films, but there is absolutely no excuse for how terrible 'Halloween: Resurrection' is.I had been wanting to see this film for a while.  The previous movie, 'Halloween H20' was really good, so I figured that the scares would keep coming.  Well, I guess when it comes to an eighth installment (this is the eighth film!), the 'Halloween' franchise has officially gone down hill.
'Resurrection' started off slowly and pretty much continued at the same pace for the entire duration of this nightmare.  Jamie Lee Curtis is killed within the first ten minutes, and that right there was enough to persuade me to turn the garbage off.  Seriously, Curtis is a favorite of mine, and was it really appropriate to kill her as soon as the credits stopped rolling? So, Jamie's dead, I'm mad, and 'Halloween', a once simple and scary film, is now buried in cameras that are hooked up to the Internet.  'Halloween' has now ventured into the dark side.  The change between professional filming and the personal filming gave me a headache for the whole 94 minutes (or so).  'Resurrection' drags on and on.  It wasn't scary, the death scenes were over in the blink of an eye, and every scene was predictable including the end.  Now of course, Michael Myers is still alive, which more than likely means that another 'Halloween' film is in the making.  What a terrible idea that is.The direction that this film was under was unbelievably idiotic.  Rick Rosenthal, who directed the wonderful 'Halloween 2', is apparently now under the influence of drugs.  His directing is half done and simply terrible.The acting is probably among the worst I have seen in a while.  I liked Bianca Kajlich on 'Boston Public', but she is not fit to appear on the big screen.  Katee Sackhoff, Daisy McCrackin, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Sean Patrick Thomas, and Luke Kirby are also bad.  It's a shame that the film didn't even allow the audience to actually see them before most of them were killed. Maybe I would have liked them better in that case.  Busta Rhymes is ridiculous.  He obviously can't act, but he did manage to make me laugh a couple of times.  Tyra Banks' incredibly small role here is no big deal. Ryan Merriman is probably the best of them all, and I'm just saying that because I've liked him in previous movies.  Overall, the cast is awful.Everything about 'Halloween: Resurrection' is asinine.  The acting is horrible, the death scenes are silly, the writing is simple, and the film is just not scary in the slightest bit.  Most of the 'Halloween' movies ARE scary, but this one isn't at all.  I would say that it's a shame that 'Resurrection' is so short, but in this case, it's a relief.  Nobody should have to sit through this trash.",Halloween - Resurrection

This time around, Michael Myers returns to face Laurie Strode one more time... Meanwhile, an Internet entrepreneur (Rhymes) has offered several college students scholarships if they can stay in the Myers house for one evening, on Halloween night. The expected carnage follows, but is done in a fast-paced style. The cinematography (especially with the multiple camera angles) is done very well and the acting is for the most part superb, with the greatest performances by Curtis and Rhymes.

It reminded me a lot of the Scary Movies that the Wayans brothers put out, except with the genuine Halloween theme music playing. It's a complete parody of itself, made all the more hilarious by the fact that the film makers didn't seem to realize it. Whenever that rapper appears on screen, I was just in stitches. Is it possible that they didn't realize this guy can't even spell the word ""act""? This goes WAY over the top of anything the Wayans put in their movies. The only problem was that these folks couldn't write characters that were half as likable or interesting as those in the Scary Movies, yet those characters were intentionally paper thin clichés.

I know people hate that part and would rather see him die, but I loved that part. I just teared up laughing and cheering for that part. He is a good rapper and an actor and I don't think he's bad as every one says, but as much as I love this movie, there is only one complaint.They had to kill Laurie Strode in the first 10 minutes of the film and I admit, it is sad, but Jamie Lee Curtis wanted the studio to do that because she didn't want any part of the new Halloween sequels.Overall, I love HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION, sure it is stupid, but there is a reason why I like this movie at all costs.8/10.",Halloween - Resurrection

For his truly fantastic and everlasting Halloween theme.Keep out.",Halloween - Resurrection
128,TheMovieDoctorful,The Worst Halloween Film To Date,1,17 October 2018,"Going into Halloween: Resurrection, I had hopes that it might surprise me. After all, I regard Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (The worst critically received of any of the Halloween films) as the best sequel in the franchise and my favorite overall series entry. I had no reason to go with the crowd and slam this movie...Well, except for one reason; it's genuinely terrible. It's not even merely as bad as everyone says it is, I consider it even worse; for while most people criticize Halloween: Resurrection for being a general waste of time, I take issue with it being a general waste of time that also wastes its own potential.I am absolutely behind the idea of a found footage Halloween film. Done right, it could be genuinely terrifying and memorable. Myers was always scariest when blending in with the background, only illuminated with brief flashes of light. If done right, it could have been one of the best entries in the franchise. Unfortunately, much like Rob Zombie in his Halloween remake 5 years later, the film wants to have things both ways; it wants the fourth wall breaking immersion and realism of found footage, but doesn't want to alienate its audience who want more big stars and less shaky cam. So, instead, the film is part found footage and mostly traditionally shot. Does this contribute to the themes? Does the benefit the story in any way? Is this important to the characters? Do I even have to answer these questions?When Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks are among the acting highlights of your movie, something is seriously wrong. I suppose Sean Patrick Thomas does a servicable job, but everyone else embarrasses themselves. Bianca Kajlich is one of the worst leading actresses I've ever seen in a Horror film, especially in the few scenes where she genuinely does try to act. Her ""badass"" moments near the end when confronting Michael Myers legitimately feel like something out of a sketch comedy show. I found myself leaning back in my chair every time she began to open her mouth. Thomas Ian Nicholas too, trying to prove that he can have a career beyond the American Pie movies and that you don't need to actually act-and-react if you have a nice smile. He fails at both of these, but at least he gets killed off quickly (In perhaps the only scene in the film that comes even close to genuine terror.)One thing that never seems to get brought up is how ugly this film is. I'm not talking about ""Rob Zombie ugly"", where it's an intentional stylistic choice. I'm talking bland and dirty and dark to the point where you can't see anything. I understand that a dark and shadowy atmosphere makes sense for a Halloween film, but the lighting in this film occasionally Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem levels of incompetent.If H20 wasn't proof enough that the Scream formula doesn't work for Halloween, Halloween: Resurrection ends the argument immediately. Comedy can work in a Nightmare on Elm Street film or a Friday the 13th film or even a Hellraiser film if done right. It does not work in a Halloween film. Halloween's thematic darkness and serious, adult stories are what set it apart from other slasher movies as a long running franchise. They had themes, they had commentary, they had characters that were made to be invested in. Halloween: Resurrection has none of that. It almost seems ashamed of being a Halloween film. It does, after all, kill off Laurie Strode in the most unmemorable and disrespectful way possible. A stab in the chest, a throw off a building and that's the end of Laurie Strode. One of the most iconic and enduring scream queens of all time going out like a fart in the wind. Without even the hint of an attempt from the screenwriters to find a genuine worthy replacement.I go back and forth on whether this or Halloween III: Season of the Witch marks the worst film in the Halloween franchise. For now, this one takes the urinal cake. While Halloween III was just a convoluted and deeply misguided mess from the very first draft, Halloween: Resurrection had potential. But that potential only makes the weight of its overall failure all the greater. That's the biggest sin of all.",Halloween - Resurrection
129,FeverDog,Enough already! *SPOILERS*,3,21 March 2003,"Why do I keep watching slasher movies?  For nearly twenty years now I've been seeing basically the same movie.  Sure, the wardrobes change, but they're almost always filled with the same characters making the same stupid mistakes that are accompanied by the same scare tactics we've all seen a million times.  I'm beginning to curse that day in my twelfth year I bought a ticket to FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VI - that was my first slasher, and I've been hooked ever since.  Sure, I may not see these in the theatre any more, but I still rent them all the time.  Hopefully, HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION will perhaps break this genre's hold on me; I'm getting tired of constantly questioning what I'm supposed to just accept in these movies.H20, the previous chapter in this series, was a wee bit better than average, with a satisfying ending; in my IMDb comments about it I wrote, ""I couldn't ask for a better conclusion; very chilling and appropriate (and it means they'll be no more sequels, I hope).""  Well, I didn't get what I wanted, but I guess I deserve what I got.Let me understand how H:R picks up after H20.  That was a medic whom Jamie Lee decapitated at the end of H20?  His larynx was crushed, so he couldn't save himself?  Riiight.  Do EMTs usually zip victims up in body bags before checking for a heartbeat?  Why didn't the medic just remove the mask before Jamie Lee separated him from himself?Besides the opportunity to shoehorn Jamie Lee into H:R, I cannot see the reason for the prologue with her character in the hospital.  No mention is made of her son, or where this hospital is.  Is it in California (where H20 was set) or Illinois (where H:R takes place)?  Or is Haddonfield now like the Simpsons' Springfield, existing wherever the plot needs it to?  Cut out the pre-title sequence, and the movie improves.And I don't get Jamie Lee's final line - one that's got so many whiskers on it that I thought it'd been retired.  She says to Michael, ""See you in hell!""  Why would her character, Laurie Strode, believe she's going to hell? This exit line is the lamest I've ever heard for such a long-running icon, and the writers should be ashamed of offing her in such a routine, blasé and unceremonious way.  It was very disrespectful to both Jamie Lee and fans of the HALLOWEEN series.Moving on.  The plot of a horror sequel is of no consequence, so I'll ignore it for the most part in these comments; I'll just make note of other questions I pondered throughout this movie.  For example, I noticed that the email address of the heroine was ""Sara@HaddonU.org.""  Just ""Sara""?  Should we assume she's the only student at her school with that name?  Lucky her.
Is the Myers house public property?  Who okayed this ""dangertainment"" to be webcasted from this house?  And wouldn't the police raise objections?Yeah, what about the police force in Haddonfield?  With all that's happened in this town over the years, one would think that the PD would be on extreme high alert every October 31, but they don't arrive at the Myers house until long after a 911 call; it took a deadly inferno that burned a building to the ground for them to respond.  If I lived in this town, I'd demand to know how my tax dollars were being spent.I'm also wondering why there was no reaction from the peanut gallery at the costume party to Henry Rowengartner's death.  It was clearly on camera; did the partiers take a mass bathroom break at that moment?I know, I know:  I shouldn't ask questions like this during these types of movies.  I was occasionally able to put my complaints aside and enjoy some of H:R.  Some of the suspense was actually pretty creative; I dug the idea of placing p.o.v. cameras on the actors, which produced some interesting shots.  The premise of the movie, unlikely as it may be, worked for the most part, as long as I didn't think too much about the logistics of it.As for the acting, the cast, with one exception, was adequate.  The one exception is, of course, Busta Rhymes. Why did the Razzies snub him?  Not since that bitch with the pearls in F13 PART VII have a wanted a horror movie character to die.  But did I get my wish?  Of course not.  Why, like LL Cool J in H20, does the has-been rapper survive?  When did B-level hip hop artists become our slasher saviors?  Weren't they usually the cute guys the heroines wanted to make out with?Maybe this was done intentionally, since H:R sometimes seems to mean HALLOWEEN: REVUE.  Although Parts 3-6 are ignored again, parts of this movie are lifted from the other sequels.  Besides the rapper/hero surviving Michael's wrath to reappear at a crucial point in the final showdown, we've got Michael burning up like he did in Part II.  Is this homage, self-plagiarism, coincidence or laziness?I hope that if they must make another sequel, they go back to PART 5 and explain what happened after that man in black broke Michael out of jail. Bring back Danielle Harris' character, and pick up the series from there. Or, hell, make a HALLOWEEN III PART II, detailing the aftermath of all those kids' bug-infested noggins.  H:R, while not the worst of the series (that dubious distinction goes to Part 6, THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS), has led it down a dead end.  It's time to again reimagine the franchise. And time for me to quit renting these movies.3/10",Halloween - Resurrection
130,nick121235,Just trying to be fun,6,23 November 2016,"I fully understand all of the negative reviews but in my opinion Halloween: Resurrection is, in fact, one of the better editions to the series. Halloween took a quick dive after the first sequel, the third film in the series being nearly unrelated to the rest (not that I hated it- in fact I quite enjoyed it), and then the fourth, fifth and sixth being particularly bad films on their own right, even disregarding the understandable shadow of their origin material. Halloween has always had a troubled and rocky journey as one of the big grossing horror franchises to come out of the time period along with A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. In my humble opinion, this, the eighth film in the series, does what none of the others did- bring a lighthearted campiness to the series. Halloween H20, the preceding sequel, was inordinately well done and quite unexpected, but I think that by the time you reach the 8th film in the series you're expecting little other than some laughs, corniness and maybe a few new and exciting kills. This is what worked so well for Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, but what Halloween had refused to do. All throughout the series, Halloween obstinately stuck to an atmosphere of seriousness, always giving us a straightforward story, never being jovial or satirical until now. This movie may not be the best- the characters can be quite forgettable, the story line is mediocre at best, and the found footage cuts are of low quality and therefore unenjoyable to see on screen. Despite all of this I think that Halloween: Resurrection far surpasses much of the other trash to come from this franchise. And it has Busta Rhymes in it.

After having Laurie escape death after numerous encounters over a twenty some odd year span it was quite heartbreaking to see her character meet her end, and such an unceremonious one at that.Once its established Laurie is dead and she's not coming back, there's really no reason to continue watching the film. The rest of the movie focuses on a group of teenagers who after winning a contest must spend the night in Michael Myers' childhood home while being broadcast on the Internet for the entire world to see.Among the weakest entries in the series, the only films worse than this are Rob Zombie's new remake and ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"".

133,piratecannon,They Just *Had* to Make Another One,1,27 December 2012,"Well, this is it: the final review in a journey that's seen me make my way through a total of eight (including this one) horror movies all born of the same franchise. All told, we've had some classic moments, plenty of absurdity, and a third entry which doesn't feature the iconic Michael Myers in any way, Shape (Ha! See what I did there?), or form. The next to last entry, H20, promised to end the franchise on a slam-bang note, with Mr. Myers decapitated and Laurie Strode well on her way to finally overcoming the emotional toll that years of paranoia and attempts on her life by her psychopathic brother have wrought.But they—the Tinsel Town powers that be—couldn't leave well enough alone.Quite frankly, if the series had actually ended with H20 it would have been nothing short of a miracle. A studio opting for dignity as opposed to additional dollars is unheard of, so it should really come as no surprise that Michael would return to the big screen.""How is that possible?"" you ask. ""Laurie cut his freakin' head off with an axe right? That's the end. Kaput. Nothing else could possibly happen.""Guess what: that wasn't Michael at the end of H20. It was actually one of the paramedics who'd attempted to recover Michael's body. We're told that the not-at-all dead sociopath sprang to life, crushed the larynx of said paramedic, and swapped their outfits, mask included. Admittedly, the explanation is pretty ingenious (though it starts to lose some credibility when one asks the question, ""Why didn't the poor sap just take off the mask and signal for help?"").Fast forward a couple of years. Laurie has been placed in a psychiatric institution due to the guilt she's endured after beheading a completely innocent man. She's spent her time preparing for Michael's inevitable return, having devised an elaborate setup that she implements in the opening moments of Resurrection. Laurie lures him onto the roof of the facility, uses a wench to string him up by his feet and then attempts to dispatch him. Predictably, Michael gets the better of her. He pretends to suddenly feel remorse at his actions, asking for her affection. When she acquiesces, he stabs her in the back (literally) and hurls her off of the building.That's it. That's how she dies.Laurie Strode, one of the definitive female action/horror protagonists of the past thirty years, is killed within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. It's one of those things that you have to see to believe; the first time I saw the movie I was appalled at the laziness of it all, and knew that what would follow could only induce queasiness.And that's exactly what happens. In essence, the story is reduced to a reality TV cash grab. Michael inexplicably returns home—he's killed his whole family at this point, not counting the infant featured in Curse (a plot point that's strangely ignored here), so I'm not sure what he hopes to gain by doing this—and survives by trapping and eating rats. When a crew of horny teenagers is recruited by Freddie Harris (played by Busta Rhymes, whose penchant for overacting is both hysterical and mind- numbing) to spend Halloween night in the former Myers home while the entire experience is broadcast live on the Internet, we can predict exactly what's going to happen. Michael starts killing people, and everyone watching thinks it's part of the act. Busta Rhymes uses some kung fu that he learned from watching Bruce Lee movies to kick Michael out of a window and eventually electrocute him. It's hackneyed as hell and infuriating.Michael, of course, isn't really dead, and when he dramatically regains consciousness in the Haddonfield Coroner's office we know that the same B.S. will continue, ad infinitum, until Michael faces both Freddy and Jason on Venus.The good news? Based on sheer mathematical probabilities, another good Halloween movie will be made eventually. It might just be another two or three hundred years before it happens.",Halloween - Resurrection
134,SeminolePhenom,Michael Myers may have been resurrected but the movie flops with all of the other sequels.,2,27 October 2005,"A group of college students are invited to be on an internet reality show called Dangetainment created by Freddie Harris(Busta Rhymes). The idea of the show is to spend one night in the old house of Michael Myers(Brad Loree). The problem is that Michael Myers is still on the loose and joins them in his old house for another massacre. Viewers watch from a party as each student dies on camera.This is an original idea for a horror movie but is done no better than any other low-budget horror film. Just the very thought of Busta Rhymes fighting Michael Myers is extremely amusing to me, but the fight takes place. The movie may have been funny but it was funny without trying to be which destroys the whole point. The murders were actually done decently well but the acting and writing made up for the missing flaws. Overall, the movie was incredibly dull and stupid and leaves the viewers asking ""What the hell?"" I do not recommend this movie to anyone including die-hard Halloween fans.",Halloween - Resurrection
135,dirtychild,Fun - better than expected,7,1 December 2002,"SPOILER ALERT!! I had a look at viewer's comments on IBDM.com and I did not have very high expectations.  Also - the film has only been released late Nov 02 (a few months after the US release) - which doesn't sound good.  Also - I knew Jamie Lee Curtis died in the first 10 minutes (which was a fairly interesting idea). After Jamie's character died - I thought the movie was going down hill - it felt rather corny with all of the teenage ""victims"" and Busta and Tyra were introduced.  I was thinking - this movie is going to be S$#^!But once it got into the swing of things in Michael Myers'childhood house - it gets fairly lively.  Busta Rhymes is well cast as a internet show host/entrepreneur - he's fairly livid and has a few great lines and moments (ie: trying his kung fu out on Michael - kewl!).  It was obvious who was going to die and who was to survive - this movie tends to follow all the horror rules (as described in ""SCREAM"").Go see this movie - don't have any expectations that this is high art or anything.  See it at the cinema (it was great as there were a lot of teenage girls at my session - who provided a bit of a ""scream"" soundtrack at the right moments - great fun!).Although a bit of a warning - the violence in this movie is a tad on the extreme end of things - a lot of gory butcher knife action which made me flinch a bit.  ;-)I give it 3 and a half victims out of 5",Halloween - Resurrection

137,lostintwinpeaks,HALLOWEEN: WHATEVER,2,27 October 2002,"""Enough of this Michael Myers Bull****!""Yes, as uttered by a character in one of the later sequels (I think it was either 5 or 6, probably 6: The Curse of Michael Myers).BEFORE YOU READ ON, BE WARNED: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS AND WILL REVEAL THINGS YOU MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN H8.Ripping of The Blair Witch Project, Big Brother, and the recent and genuinely unsettling My Little Eye, this belated sequel finds a group of teens entering the Myers house (which strangely has not been torn down) on a live webcast.And - you guessed it - MM shows up and starts some slaughter!As a direct sequel to H20, it too ignores the events of 3, 4, 5, & 6 (no bad thing ...), following only the stories of 1, 2, & 7, a.k.a H20. In fact the opening scene even shows flashbacks to H20 and explains the story of how Jamie Lee Curtis chopped MM's head off at the end and hem managed to survive. The explanation is frankly ridiculous and completely gratuitous. Who cares how he survived? Throughout several (8 now!) Halloween movies, MM has been ripped/slashed/stabbed/thrown off buildings/lit on fire/ploughed into by vehicles/etc. etc. Wouldn't it have been more honest just to have his head sewn back on??!!Anyhow, we see Jamie Lee Curtis in the opening scene, which is slightly disturbing - but marred by being overtly melodramatic. She kisses him on the lips and whispers ""See you in hell"" before falling off a roof...And again, no explanation on why now - why this Halloween? Why MM waits until Hollywood decides to ""RESURRECT"" him for a particular Halloween... 1998, 2002, etc.It does attempt to explain that he's been hiding under his house all this time, but then it never follows through with this story, just one of many loose-ends in the movie.It also attempts to blame his psychotic tendancies on a childhood of abuse... although it is hinted that this may just have been set up my the webcast producers. Again, this isn't clarified. Was he abused as a child? Or were the producers of the webcast (entitled Dangertainment ... reminding me of a cartoon) attempting to add some spice to the story? Who knows, who even cares.The whole webcast thing has been done before, as I mentioned above, and even though all the different camera views and angles are directed expertly by Rosenthal, it's very much Been There Done That.The bodycount is much higher than H20, but the characters are so underdeveloped, that the death scenes create little impact.There are some good and even suspenseful (very few and far between... like a few amusing laughs/smiles in a really bad sitcom) moments, most notably towards the end when the main female character (the virginal one who survives) is running through the house, while gripping a hand-held messenger buddy; her online friend keeps buzzing her - rather than running to the house to save her? what's happened to the white knight and damsel in distress? now the white knight just watches the poor damsel online and emails her! - with instant messages telling her where MM is.At the end, MM is burned and electrocuted again (like this has happened before??... most notably at the end of H2 where MM burns slowly while ""Mr Sandman"" plays...), and the whole thing has a decidedly 80's feel to it. And when the final girl wields the chainsaw at MM and screams ""This is for ... (so and so he's killed in the movie)"", it's one of the best bad moments of over-the-top melodramatic and extremely awful acting ever displayed on celluoid.Even the very sequel-tempting (Halloween 9 anyone?) end is very lacklustre, lacking any real punch.This movie went through numerous title changes from HALLOWEEN 8 to HALLOWEEN THE HOMECOMING to HALLOWEEN H2K to HALLOWEEN EVIL NEVER DIES, and so on and so forth. These undecisive plodding changes are also clear in the script and direction.The eight Halloween movies probably cost less than 40 million in total to make and have taken God-knows how much (at least 10 times that figure) at the box office.And in fact, I'm a slasher fan and was quite looking forward to this movie. I was left virtually unimpressed... maybe it should be retitled (again!) to HALLOWEEN WHATEVER.",Halloween - Resurrection
138,CowherPowerForever,What Makes You So Sure It Is Over?,7,25 October 2014,"The Following review will contain spoilers.Halloween: Resurrection is a widely hated movie amongst the Halloween faithful. Some, like myself, do consider it to be an above average film, and not one of the worst of the series. While the film has it's faults, the storyline in this film is frankly better than those used in Halloween 5 and Halloween 6. The problem with this film mainly was that it was ahead of it's time. If Halloween: Resurrection was released within the past five years(of writing this review) it would have been better received, I have little doubt about that. The following is my review of Halloween: Resurrection.The film was written by Sean Hood and Larry Brand. The story on this film is pretty straight forward. It takes place about 3 years after the events of Halloween: H20. Laurie is now in a mental hospital as she went crazy after she found out that Michael didn't really die at the end of H20. Michael actually killed one of the paramedics on scene and crushed his larynx so he couldn't say anything. Laurie then killed this paramedic by accident. She is haunted by this and is now in a mental hospital waiting for her real brother to come and kill her. We are then shown the night Michael Returns, but Laurie is ready this time. She has a trap for him on the roof of the building, but it backfires when she needs to remove his mask to make sure it is him. Michael then is able to turn the tables and finally kill his sister. Michael then goes back to his home in Haddonfield. He comes home to realize that an internet reality show is filming in his childhood home, and of course he will murder everyone in his house. As I mentioned above this story was ahead of it's time in regard to the reality programing. So many of us are use to seeing many horror type shows in famous houses that is first person based trying to find hauntings. Which is why I believe if this film were released in say 2012 instead of 2002, the film would have been a bigger hit and been more well received. I personally believe the story is not that bad. It is certainly not the worst of the franchise, and it moves nicely. Hood and Brand get a thumbs up in my opinion.The film was directed by Halloween 2 director Rick Rosenthal. If you have read my Halloween 2 review you already know I hold the opinion that that is the best sequel in this franchise. Rosenthal brought a more scare based approach to this film, which is what the franchise needed. Sure, there are still some over the top kills in this film that I could do without, but it wasn't as bad the previous film in this series(Halloween:H20). The acting is another big talking point about this film. Busta Rhymes is basically the star if you will. Many believe this was an awful casting decision, and I do agree. However, three years prior to this film another rapper(LL Cool J) starred in a Halloween film. The outrage against him is basically slim to none. The decision to cast Rhymes is a bigger role was not wise, but it certainly wasn't the worst thing in the world. However, I will admit that this is probably one of the worst acted films of the series. Jamie Lee Curtis phones in this very short part and acting legend Donald Pleasence had already passed about seven years before this film was released. Rosenthal delivers some nice scares that are a throwback to the original film more so than some of the slasher type sequels this franchise has turned out. I enjoy that and I think Rosenthal deserves credit for this outing.Danny Lux was the composer of this film, and he is mostly doing television shows these days. The score for this film has a John Carpenter feel to it, whereas some of the other sequels tried to change too much. That means the originality is at a low, but the film goes by nicely hearing that fantastic score we are so use to hearing in this series. Lux doesn't knock it out of the ballpark or create anything original, but he brings us that great classic Carpenter score that we all love.This film also marked the final effort from longtime series Producer, Moustapha Akkad. He was sadly murdered about three years after the release of this film in a terrorist bombing. Those hardcore fans of the series know him, and know his thoughts and opinions on the entire franchise very well. He didn't want Michael to die in any of the films, and just like Donald Pleasence, he wanted the series to continue as long as possible. He didn't want it to end. I love Moustapha for holding that for many decades as I myself never want to see the series end.Overall, it is not the best nor the worst film in the Halloween franchise. Sure it probably receives the most hate, but I can think of one or two films in this series that are worse. While it may not be the perfect way to have continued on the franchise, that really didn't matter as the series was rebooted entirely in 2007. The original franchise ended with this film, and while even I admit it wasn't the best way to end the amazing run, it was still an enjoyable way to end it's original run.7/10",Halloween - Resurrection
139,Ky-D,A decent next chapter.,4,15 March 2005,"The Halloween series seems to follow a pattern. One excellent entry, one OK entry, one bad entry, repeat.1, good, 2, OK, 3, bad. 4, good, 5, OK, 6, bad. 7, good, 8, OK. See what I mean.Over all a step down from H20, but right on par for the series over all. Resurrection is an apt title as it brings back series vet director Rick (Halloween 2) Rosenthal. He knows the tricks and is ready to employ them. Sadly, this old dog is lacking in new treats.An internet video site wants to set up a Halloween night web-cast from the abandoned Myers house. They enlist the services of several fresh young faces to explore the house and uncover it's ""secrets"". This would happen to be the unfortunate evening that Michael returns home. Needless to say, a body-count ensues.Interms of how the film is shot, Rosenthal employs some nifty camera switches; cutting back and forth from the omnipresent audience view and the cameras set up for the fictional web-cast. It's a nice touch to the overall look of the film. Were he falters is in the scare set-ups. He uses every trick you've ever seen before in a slasher; some of the set-ups are lifted strait off of the original Halloween and H20. As such, the film is never as scary as it ought to be.On a more positive note, the cast is more likable than the usual cannon-fodder. The females especially come off very well and the men manage to be less obnoxious than slasher fans have come to expect.The whole package is worth a view. It's better than about 90% of the slashers on the market these days, but it never hits the horrific heights that this series is known for.7/10",Halloween - Resurrection

141,gila_film,Only for the true Halloween or slasher fans,7,23 December 2002,"After the heart pounding finale in H20, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee-Curtis) thought that she has ended it, but she's wrong. Michael Myers is too smart to die easily.  Now she's spending her life on a sanitarium, waiting for Michael to get her again. Finally, Michael accomplishes his goal to kill Laurie (isn't he?). And then the story goes to a bunch of teenagers that plan to spend a night to the old Michael Myers house in Haddonfield, to fulfill the challenge of Freddy Harris (Busta Rhymes), the owner of Dangertainment, an internet real time show. Everything goes terribly wrong then, when Michael Myers is back for his bloody rampage.
Okay, we thought it has end on the H20, but the producer had a second thought. The result is one of the bad sequel ever made. Actually, the first 20 minute is great, and does a decent contribution to the Halloween saga. We easily presumed that the series was over. Think again! Michael is still alive and still blood thirsty. It's like that Resurrection is divided into a two movie. One is the Laurie Strode saga and the other is a plain slasher flick. Rick Rosenthal (Halloween II) did succeed to entertain us but with the cliché mandatory and a lot of rip off from another movie like Scream and Blair Witch Project made the second part as the bad one. The plot is pointless and does nothing except just for a fun watch to the audiences. What a pity that Halloween series fall into those typical slasher flick.
Well, at least for a true Halloween fans or slasher fans, you won't miss this. But if you want to watch more serious movie, avoid it.7/10",Halloween - Resurrection
142,moviesfan11,'Halloween:Resurrection' fun but flighty,7,24 March 2005,"Halloween: Resurrection Open: Mental Hospital, our struggling heroine Laurie Strode(Curtis) is in a mental hospital after we find out that, at the end of 'H20', she beheaded the wrong guy. Now, as she sits helplessly haunted by the memories of her brother, Michael, he decides to crash at the hospital. And this time, Michael finally succeeds...Meanwhile, producers of the reality series ""DangerTainment"" Nora(Banks) and Freddie(Rhymes) give a group of teens the opportunity to spend a night in Michael Myers childhood home. The teens include the hesitant yet compassionate Sara(Kajlich), her tawdry yet supportive best friend, Jen(Sackoff), the timid yet surreal Rudy(Thomas) and the fun-loving and easy Donna(McCrackin). Sara is hesitant about the situate, but Freddie and Jen convince her.Now, trapped in Myer's childhood home for the world to see, this new group of teens will struggle to survive when Michael decides to crash the party and come home! 'Resurrection' has a good concept and is fun, but it's flighty and the look of the film wrong. This time around, Michael seems to find increasingly blander ways to kill people, a few scenes aside. The suspense level is very low for a slasher-film, and by the plot it could generate tons of chase/suspense scenes. These things aren't completely delivered.The things above aside, 'Resurrection' may be flighty, suspense-less and bad looking, it nevertheless is a fun way to spend your night and is definitely one of the better installment in the series(IMO its the 4th best after the original, the 2nd and H20) Halloween: Resurrection- *** R for strong horror/terror violence, language and some sexual content.",Halloween - Resurrection
143,PeterJackson,"Gives a new dimension to the word ""tiresome""",1,11 October 2002,"ANOTHER slasher pick? Yes, it's the new Halloween, the 7th or 8th in the series, lost count. No 7th or 8th film in a series is any good, the 4th, 5th and 6th usually aren't neither, but that's ok. Actually, I had some hopes for this film, walking in the theater. The original Halloween was one of the best in the genre, with never-dying Michael Myers entering the big-screen in spectacular fashion. But the second in the series was already far beyond par, and the rest was pure formula (haven't seen any of em though). Then came H20: 20 YEARS LATER, which benefited again from Jamie Lee Curtis' presence. Not a good film, far from being a stand-out in the genre, but at least it had SCREAM-writer Kevin Williamson on the credits, and was actually pretty enjoyable too. So I thought: well, maybe this new Halloween will have some suspense too, maybe some surprises (I'm a sucker for surprises). But what I saw...well, I'm still speechless. This film was even worse than most stupid entries in this genre.First of all, we get a stupid explanation for the fact that Michael is STILL alive (unbelievable if you saw the previous one). Then we get Jamie Lee Curtis in the mental hospital. What happens next, might show her attitude towards the series by now. The beginning has actually nothing to do with the rest of the film, it isn't even a good opening to this film, unlike the SCREAM-intros. Then we get to see the actual film, which is pretty much, like one of the characters puts it, Halloween meets the Osbournes, or Big Brother, or the German movie DAS EXPERIMENT, or whatever. You put the usual bunch of irritating high-school friends in one house, put some cameras on top and let Mike (umm...Michael) Myers do his thing. Is it thrilling? Nope, it just seems Myers is doing a routine slashing in here. There's no suspense at all, just people getting killed like you knew they would. Not hard to guess that the ""smartest"" will survive. Is it funny? Yeah, if you can laugh at lame dialogue and the aforementioned irritating characters. If that's your thing, fine, shows why all these dumb-headed high-school comedies nowadays are such a success. Oh, and it's so dumb-minded that you can't even stop shouting at the screen: ""Oh, come on! As if...""But what could you expect from a movie that was directed by the same man that directed Halloween II? It's so formula that you cannot only predict everything from the first til the last minute, but it's so bad that the last-minute surprise is even more irritating than usual. It's so obvious by now that, indeed, ""Evil never dies"" , that it's even boring to see these people trying to put M.M. to rest, without being ultimately successful. How long will they go on with this and what's the point of making another movie like this if nothing works out in the end. I'm sure Michael must be pretty tired by now. But maybe we get a Halloween: 60 years later, in x years time, where Michael is a geriatric patient, killing off his fellow patients. Maybe that would be a thriller! As far as this one is concerned: it's more of a thrill finding ways to stay awake while Michael is doing his thing than watching this bore. 1/10",Halloween - Resurrection
144,scott-sw,Terrible.,5,11 January 2008,"Halloween Resurrection is one of those movies that is hard to recommend. It has a few hits, but far too many misses, foul balls, and walks. As a real sequel, it follows H20 several years later when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now in a mental institution. She has gone permanently crazy. Michael Myers, as to no surprise, shows up to finally do her in. At this point, it seems Halloween Resurrection could have stopped. Not so fast. A crazy reality television producer wants a new reality show. He has several people spend the night in the home of Michael Myers in Haddonfield, Illinois. This is to the chagrin of the town, as well as the resident. After all, this is Michael's home. In any case, the bleached William Shatner mask makes its return to take-out the unwanted guests. There are a few tense moments that give us a little scare, and a little suspense. Still, this is not true to the Halloween myth. Even looking at Halloween 4, 5, and 6, as well as the official trilogy of 1, 2, and 7, Michael Myers has a vendetta against relatives. Once they are eliminated, the rage should be gone. As for this one, there is no ""reaching"" out to the person trapped inside the pathological, methodological madness. That is what really brings this movie down to the real ""slasher"" level. There is no depth of character the Shape offers in previous roles. Worse, there is no protagonist with the relationship. We had Laurie for one set, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie in the other. In other words, there is no real ""hero."" Finally, just as in H20 (and the remake), there is no guts in release date. This movie is called Halloween. So why is it released in the summer? Apparently, producers had no confidence in the king of Halloween. In any case, we have finally crossed into the Friday the 13th universe where mediocrity is abound. Of course, I think mediocre is generous.",Halloween - Resurrection

You have all the worst trends of the era: shoddy editing, bad music placement, found footage, poor understanding of technology...The Bad: The first act of this movie is really just a short film to retcon why Michael Myers is still alive (which is dumb, because he's obviously immortal) and to have Jamie Lee Curtis in the promotional materials, whilst allowing her character to die, as per her wishes. She has no role in this movie. From this first act, I knew this was gonna be bad, because the opening act contradicts the rest of the movie. Why would a livestream take place in the house of an ESCAPED MURDERER who returns to his hometown EVERY YEAR?!The rest of the film is one of the worst slasher films I have ever seen. It doesn't feel like a Halloween movie at all; more like an episode of a horror anthology that just so happens to star Michael Myers. The characters are unfathomably stupid and annoying; the final girl literally screams - for no reason - at the sight of anything vaguely ""horrifying"" (like a child in a dog costume) and demonstrates zero instinct for self-preservation. Busta Rhymes is here and...it's pretty obvious he had some demands as to how his character would need to be portrayed to star in this s**tpile. You have everyone: the horny hippie, the blonde bimbo, the creepy weirdo, the good black guy, the bad black guy...13 year old me could have written these characters.But, who cares about the victims right? It's all about the big guy. Unfortunately, Michael Myers is laughable in this movie. His mask looks bad, he has 0 screen presence and he seems to have regressed into a dumb animal. He just sorta walks around and swings his knife around, without rhyme or reason.Not only that, but the filmmakers decided that cutting between a normal film and grainy, almost unwatchable footage was a good idea. That it was also a good idea to cut a million times anytime Michael goes to kill someone, so there's literally no memorable kills here at all.The Ugly: Ironically, the film that was supposed to ""resurrect"" the Halloween franchise basically killed it.

146,FrightMeter,Above average sequel with a cool premise...,3,13 July 2002,"Let's just start by acknowledging the obvious; there was really no need for this sequel, or any sequel after Part 2 of the Halloween series.  But, they were made, so we might as well enjoy what we were given. Halloween:Resurrection (it's not really a resurrection because Michael Myers never died) starts with everyone's favorite scream queen confronting Michael for one sad, final time. We are then introduced to a group of teens who are selected to spent he night in the childhood house of Michael Myers and have it broadcasted live over the internet on Halloween night.  Needless to say, after offing Laurie Strode (his lifetime ambition) Michael returns home and is not a bit happy to find these pesty kids intruding his home.  That is where the murder and mayhem begins.  Each of the characters are stalked and slashed on the live webcam broadcast via ""The Blair Witch"" style.  I found this movie to be incredibly gory, which surprised me with how strict the rating system has become.  The sound is excellent and there are some genuinely creepy moments.  Let's face it, nothing will ever live up to the original, but this is a well directed, honest effort.  Really, the only complaint I have is the performance of the lead heroine, Bianca Kiljach towards the end of the film.  Her fear is not believable for me and the ways she delivers her lines during the chainsaw fight is almost laughable.  Other than that, a solid effort that will past about 90 minutes.

Instead, they bring in a vapid bunch of teenagers and a cliche-ridden script (which appears to have been rewritten daily and had no set ending according to the DVD) and tarnish the series beyond repair.

152,Phantasm01,Maybe 8 is enough...,7,30 June 2006,"As with any movie franchise that is nearing the double-digit mark, it proves tougher and tougher to try to bring something new to the table. Filmmakers, writers, producers, etc., seemingly are always deemed to add another notch to all ready squealed-to-death series'. Such is the case with the classic 'Halloween' franchise.However, instead of attempting to put Michael Myers (aka: The Shape) into such silly realms as outer space (a la 'Friday the 13th's' Jason Voorhees-in what turned out to be nothing short of pure embarrassment for both the producing studio and fans alike!) 'Halloween 2' veteran director Rick Rosenthal decided to take a more modern-day, practical approach. Using what every American all ready knows all-to-well about: reality television.For some, this may have been the final straw that broke the camel's back; using what most moviegoers would consider to be unprofessional, low-end methods in an attempt to revitalize an ailing series. Such, were my thoughts! It seemed an odd attempt, this guerilla style film-making, in what is usually such a technically sterile environment that is Hollywood.Guerilla style film-making or not, Rosenthal manages to pull off the impossible; not only using the consumer digital video format but learning to integrate it with the professional look of 35mm film! Some are quick to state that this has all ready been done via 'The Blair Witch Project' but that would be a false assumption. 'Blair Witch' used 16mm film and DV, both which were later blown up to a 35mm format so it could be viewed in theaters. Therefore, 'Halloween 8' is unique in it's mixing both formats simultaneously.Rosenthal and company were looking to create a more 'documentary' type feel to the latest installment in the series and they managed to create just that. This proves to be vital to the film since, at this point in time, there is little left to reveal to the audience, at least as far as it's main characters are concerned. Probably, more people know more about Laura Strode and Michael Myers than they do some of their own family members! Having said that, what else can one do to try to still maintain the audience's interests in these all ready exhausted characters? Gore will only carry you so far and big names will only cost your production a heck of a lot of money. Neither is a guarantee for success. So, what do you do? Why, you must reinvent! 'Halloween 8' is like a phoenix rising. And, while it is not perfect, it does manage to spark interest again. There are some 'name' actors (or, at least, some familiar faces running around) that kill the suspense of the film. Those being Busta Rhymes, Thomas Ian Nichols ('American Pie' veteran), and Sean Patrick Thomas. And, while I find all three of these actors superb in their own right, I feel that their presence here is disingenuous and distracting. Whenever I see Mr. Nichols running frantically about, I keep waiting for Stifler to show up! These celebrity faces just produce the results a good horror film should not.Pretty faces aside, the rest of the film generate some heart-pumping thrills. Rosenthal and director of photography, David Geddes, keep light levels low. And, as mentioned in the commentary, almost to the point of being dangerously low that should a mere candle have been blown out the picture would have gone entirely black! Video footage shot by the actors themselves is integrated with the look of professional film. Giving the overall production an 'edgy' feel with its digital glitches sprinkled throughout partnered with the imperfectly framed DV shots. Surprisingly, it works! Musically speaking, Carpenter's original main score is still recognizable but little remains of it. Composer Danny Lux does a descent job combining the past with the present. The 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is also very active and effective enough so that you'll be snapping a few quick glances over your shoulder to be sure the Shape himself isn't standing behind you! Unusual as it may seem, Dimension Home Video has packed this disc full of fun, informative bonus features. First, a must listen to commentary track by director Rosenthal and Editor Robert A. Ferretti. Like Carpenter, Rosenthal is quick to point out his 'areas of improvement' and even goes as far as to point out a crew member lying on the floor holding a flag in the film! Mostly, his self-critical analysis is typical of any director and it just goes to show how much of a professional Mr. Rosenthal is and how he has evolved over the past 20 years since his having helmed the 2nd entry in this series.Topping off the disc are such gems as a deleted scenes section (with commentary!) as well as a 40-minute webcam special (also with commentary) which gets to be so slightly nauseating after awhile. There are numerous featurettes dealing with set design as well as Jamie Lee Curtis's thoughts on finally killing off her much admired and loved character Laura Strode. Also included is a very healthy Stills Gallery.With a clear conscious, I can state that 'Halloween: Resurrection' is a welcomed new entry. Having said that though, I'm not sure where the ol' Myers kid is to go from here. For the next director that should dare to helm yet another entry, I can only state that the Shape needs to stay put at home. Avoid the wackiness of space and ignore any high-flown ideas that would make our beloved Michael into something he's not; such as an angry spirit or evil alter ego via Martha Stewart. Keep him grounded safely in his roots. Just another deranged serial killer, who as Rosenthal jokes, is getting ever so closer to collecting his social security! And, at this point in the franchise, that may not be such a cursed statement. After all, if I see Myers terrorizing a retirement home, I'm definitely throwing in my 'Halloween' towel!",Halloween - Resurrection
153,BenTramerLives78,Not a Good Halloween Movie But....,5,30 March 2021,"Halloween Resurrection is without a doubt one of the worst movies in the Halloween series. I do find it to be an entertaining film despite its flaws. Yes, Busta Rhymes is terrible, but he's also kind of awesome. It's more or less a ""so bad it's good"" kind of film. I think Halloween 5 is the worst of the series and if this wasn't a Halloween film, it would be considered an enjoyable film. It's outdated now of course, but I've come around to it.",Halloween - Resurrection
154,jofitz27,"Actually, it wasn't that bad...",4,23 January 2005,"For a long time now, I've been hearing people badmouthing this film, saying how un-scary and horrible it is. Well, lets get one thing straight: it's not anything compared to the original. It's not very scary and has more than its fair share of horribly corny one liners and ""chills"". But, if you want a decent night in with a couple of friends, this isn't necessarily a bad pick... Starting off with a slightly ludicrous beginning, we see Mike Myers break into a hospital and gruesomely kill some innocents (police officers, etc.) Then, the scene turns to the obvious: a group of high-school kids, invited to stay in a supposedly haunted house by entrepreneur Fred Harris (yikes!...Busta Rhymes). Mike is not at all delighted about this, his house been filled with the terribly clichéd annoying high school kids, and sets about killing them once on for all. To shorten this down, Halloween probably should have finished after ""H20"" but it is slightly nice to know someone cares enough to do another (hopefully last!) one. So, to answer the question: no, this is not a good film. It's not particularly scary, clichéd and and dumb. But for a night in with some friends and a bag of popcorn, this might be the ticket...Overall: **/ out of ***** (2 and a half out of 5)",Halloween - Resurrection

I much rather prefer Jason to Michael anyway but it was mildly entertaining and when that original Halloween music comes on, WOW suddenly my rating goes up a couple of notches (I would really love to find the Drum & Bass mix of that but can't find it anywhere). I did like Busta for some reason but the rest of the potential teen victims did pretty much suck. Just fodder for Michael. No real inventive killings and twice in this movie Michael cuts the head off a person so the movie really is stuck for idea's. Not as bad as most people say so Halloween Resurrection gets 7/10 from me.",Halloween - Resurrection

Halloween was a classic, this is just like any other Big Brother style horror that was going around in the early 2000s. Had none of the atmosphere of the prequels, Myers himself didn't even seem that scary! The only thing I was glad about in this movie was that Myers wasn't finally killed off by this band of idiots. They tried to kid us at the end though he died in a fire. We've already seen that and it DOESN'T work, so why try to fool the viewer? If you like the early Halloween movies, I do not recommend this as you will be really disappointed. It might scare the tweens of today, but going by other reviews you can tell it is hated by Halloween fans.",Halloween - Resurrection
157,benjaminwest-242,A terrible conclusion to this timeline,3,30 October 2021,"Halloween: Resurrection fails on every front. The acting is subpar, except for Curtis, whose small role diminishes the purpose of the entire movie. The dialogue is terrible as well, with cringey moments throughout. The plot is not written well after the first few sequences, with ridiculous choices made by the characters and an overall not so convincing way that the characters are brought into their respective fortunes. The emotional depth is decent at best, and the character development has nearly no meaning. Again, there is a failure to truly address if Myers is supernatural. The conclusion is the most irritating, with a complete lack of awareness by the writers of what the audience wants. Fundamentally, this is a film that should not have been made, with the previous Halloween movie providing a more fitting ending than this.",Halloween - Resurrection
158,culmo80,Just Bad,2,16 March 2013,"Why am I giving this movie a 2 and not a 1? The first fifteen minutes or so are actually good. We get to see Laurie Strode battle it out with Michael Myers one last time.The story of Michael Myers should have ended with H20, which while not great, at least added something to the story. So what do we get with Resurrection? Well, as with Halloween 5, Michael's ""death"" is retold to show that he didn't really die; that he in fact traded places with a medic, going so far as putting his mask on the guy after crushing his larynx...because, obviously Michael knew that Laurie would steal the ambulance and decapitate the body.So Resurrection gives us the last battle between Laurie and Michael and ends with Laurie's death. Apparently, Jamie Lee Curtis would only reprise her role as Laurie if they killed her off...a rather smart move on her part because she could see where the franchise was headed. After this 15 minutes, the movie has no point. Busta Rhymes and Tara Banks (I really don't care enough to look up their character names) are looking for a pay day and decide to host a live ""ghost hunter"" show at the Myers house on Halloween night. They get a bunch of college kids to enter the house and explore it all night. Predictably, they all split up and are murdered by Myers. Here's the thing: the Myers house isn't that big...it's not like you could just spend hours exploring a relatively empty house. How do several people wander around getting ""lost"" in a house this small?Oh and Busta Rhymes is in this movie...he's the next biggest ""star"" after Jamie Lee Curtis. There is no Dr. Loomis equivalent here; no real talent. I failed to mention that Busta Rhymes is - in this film - a karate fan, and he fights Michael Myers using his Bruce Lee moves...yeah, that's actually in this movie.Probably the most cringe-worthy part was the ending, after the two survivors have burned down the garage with Myers inside. Busta Rhymes and the girl that survived are interviewed by the media and it was just so terrible. Then there is the part with Rhymes mocking the burnt ""corpse"" of Myers.I don't know what else there is to say about this film. It shouldn't have been made. It didn't need to be made. Even if there was a poll of fans who wanted Myers to return, you don't necessarily have to do what ""fans"" want. Certainly, fans didn't like this movie, and no one else did either.",Halloween - Resurrection

Anyways, if he wasn't ever killed, why this movie is called ""resurrection"" ? Is it like resurrection of the series? What's up with the crap in the beginning about doors to heaven/hell then? The main plot about teens investigating the Myers house however has nothing to do with this and, despite horrible acting, works pretty well, if you'll ignore the fact that this movie is ripping off too many horror flicks to count, that is. Watch it if you have nothing better to do, it's not really horrible, just stupid at most part, I wouldn't recommend it though.",Halloween - Resurrection

Why? We don't know.Parallel plot number two - some highscoohler that text messages main character from plot number one, they don't share any screentime except few texts and emails.Nothing works in this movie, and you can even see it with you eyes right away. Probably the worst decision is that they thought it would be cool and edgy to use actual crap handy cams to shot main characters POV portions of the movie.

The acting was good and so were the shocks and the laughs. Jesus! THOSE SHOCKS SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME!!!! I could not believe that Freddie was crazy enough to let those kids go into that house and he was crazy to dress up as Michael Myers because, the kids would soon discover that there is a real Michael Myers lurking in the shadows! And only two people in total survived which was Freddie and Sarah.And it's pretty cool to see a Junior High boy saving Sarah's life by communicating from a computer at a house party to Sarah's cellphone.Hey, do you want to keep yourself entertained with this movie?????

166,realityinmind,IMDb classifies this as a comedy,4,5 July 2018,"This is definitely the worst movie in the series (yes, worst that Zombie's sequel). The plot is ridiculous -- it takes place in the Myers' condemned house with no electricity (hello city regulations?), the actors are obsessed with sex like they are in a campy movie -- the girl gets naked in the dirty a$$ basement before dead bodies fall all over her (Halloween is NOT Friday the 13th), and the worst aspect of it all is the editing. All throughout this movie the film is randomly slowed down. Why? Michael is walking too fast..... press the slow motion button. Jamie Lee Curtis is falling too fast.... press the slow motion button. Randomly things just slow down for a few seconds here and there all throughout the movie yet the film format can't handle these slow-motion effects, so every time it is slowed down the film becomes blurry. It is horribly distracting, all because the director couldn't direct the guy who played Michael to simply walk slower. Jamie Lee Curtis didn't want to be in this movie as she keeps trying to kill herself off in all the horrible remakes but Moustapha Akkad just won't let her! (Though it is relieving to know that Danny McBride is helping with the new movie, and clearly that is enough to get Jamie Lee Curtis back on board one last time).I did like Busta Rhymes though... he is a good versatile rapper slash actor.And I am glad they finally got rid of that whole Thorn thing. It was a horrible mistake that was forced into the franchise for no reason (look up the history of how that happened).",Halloween - Resurrection

I went into the cinema with high expectations and came out thinking only one thing ""I want to buy another ticket"". Halloween: Resurrection should easily win horror of the year (or even decade) especially when compared to Jason X. Jason X which was a bad horror movie because it tried to go comical, but Halloween has lasted out and remained serious. I LOVED THIS FILM and i'm definately getting the DVD. Out of 10 I'd say 10.

168,TelevisionJunkie,"Often stupid, sometimes clever, and completely unnecessary (SPOILERS ahead)",2,13 July 2002,"I fought the annoying crowd on opening night solely for Jamie Lee Curtis. The few trailers I'd seen led me to believe she was returning yet again as the heroine.  Wrong.  Instead, she has fifteen minutes (if that) of amazing screen time before being offed....  It seems the only reason she showed up was to set up why Michael was still alive (and their reasoning was less than satisfactory - it was asinine).  It would have been interesting if, as I was led to believe, her neurotic character was like Linda Hamilton in T2, escaping from the asylum to hunt down her brother...but no.  Instead, we're fed a Blair-Witch-Project-meets-Halloween setup, complete with dizzying, often annoying camerawork, a lot of bad jokes, tit-shots, and an assortment of one-dimensional characters who you never really care about as they're being sliced and diced by the maniac in the (now more detailed) William Shatner mask.  H20 should have been the end.  The previous entry was made with loving care by people who obviously had respect for the original film - and more than a typical bloody sequel, they were looking for a clever way to end the series. There was a plot, strong characters, and a purpose.  The new incarnation follows the typical bloody sequel trend, pitting the bad-guy against a bunch of unsuspecting kids.  Yet again, tons of bloodshed ensues.  And then we're left with that typical ending, standard from 80s films (particularly Friday the 13th) where  they leave it wide open for another sequel with the corpse's eyes opening.  Yawn.  I'm a huge horror (and Halloween) fan, but I've already seen this movie a billion times under a billion different titles with a billion different casts.
I will admit that it's not all bad, though the cons far outweigh the pros. There is some clever dialogue (""You have nice legs, when do they open?"") as well as an amusing on-camera bong scene.  The effects are generally good. And the guy playing Michael this time did a good job mimicking Nick Castle's mannerisms.  If this were made prior to H20, I might have liked it more. But enough's enough already!  Finally, what's up with the constantly evolving mask?  Not since part 2 has it even remotely looked like it did in the original.  And by the way, after wasting $8, I'D like to personally stab Curtis for being involved in this one....",Halloween - Resurrection
169,DJ_Shilo,The End of a Legacy,1,24 October 2019,"""Halloween H20"" was the 20th anniversary of the original masterpiece, ""Halloween."" Time had gone by, but Jamie Lee Curtis returned to the role that made her famous, scream queen Laure Strode. It followed along with post ""Scream"" thrillers that came out a few years ago, most of them hopeless garbage such as the film ""Urban Legend."" When you thought it could not get worse, almost twenty-five years later, ""Halloween Resurrection"" reduces the series to a biter false alarm and Curtis can't seem to make up her mind and leave the series behind.It's about Freddy Harris (Busta Rhymes), who is a Reality TV programmer at DangerTainment, and he and his crew of internet streamers descend into the childhood home of Serial Killer Michael Myers on Halloween night. Michael has survived his last attempt on his sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), who has since gotten locked away in a mental hospital. Freddy and his crew set up cameras in the Myers house and attempt to broadcast a live feed from his home, but what they don't know is that Michael has come home to Haddonfield to crash the party.""H20"" was another attempt to revive the ""Halloween"" series that gave us Michael Myers. Jamie Lee Curtis was the one who got that movie of the ground, no doubt, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original. It was not a terrible film by any means, but it followed the teen slasher revival a few years ago and therefore was nothing special. Instead of being scary, we knew what was going to happen, but it was a fun movie, and at least we got to see Curtis again. Well, she has returned, yet again, in this unnecessary sequel that is devoid of any human feeling, story, characters or inspiration.Twenty-four years later, Laurie Strode is middle-aged and still running crazy down hallways and corridors when Michael shows up to break the door down. It seems she can never get away from him, and he always knows where to find her. At least in ""Halloween H20"", we saw how he tracked her down. This time, he shows up at the hospital Laurie is in because writing how he found her would be too much of a task. She is a long-suffering basket case until Michael shows up, and she leads him to the roof when she has a trap set to capture him. Of course, it doesn't go as planned, and she dies within the first twenty mins of the film. How despicable!Michael somehow makes it back to Haddonfield after a lazy excuse lets him live at the beginning of the movie. There is no real effort here to make a decent film, tell a story or even a make a believably lousy movie, this sequel is the bottom of the barrel for a cash grab and an insult to the series. It's just as bad if not worse than the ""Friday the 13th"" sequel, ""Jason X"" that came out back in April. That film was an unnecessary nail in the coffin, and so is this embarrassing junk. Speaking of embarrassing, I haven't even got to the Busta Rhymes character. He takes over the role of LL Cool J as the token rapper because putting another one in this sequel was necessary for some reason?Three years have gone by since ""H20"" and college student, Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich) wins a competition to appear on the DangerTainment show. Freddy runs it with his fake fruit loop assistant, Nora (Tyra Banks; she can't act either). Sara is the main character of the movie and the heroine with somewhat of a head on her shoulders. The kids that get chosen are all dumb slasher bait, and none can act. One of the worse offenders is Jen (Katee Sackhoff), and she is the typical dumb blonde. Imagine this; she attempts to pull a prank on the teenagers, thinking she is funny, and Michael ends up cutting her head off at the top of the stairs. Her head rolls down the staircase, and three of the kids look up in horror as Michael slowly descends the stars before they stop starring stupid and realize they are in trouble.Michael picks of all the dummies in slasher form, and it's all getting watched by a kid, Deckard (Ryan Merriman), who is watching via the internet from some party he is attending. By the end of the film, half of the party is watching the carnage unfold. Sara realizes Michael is in the house, and she tries to escape, and the kid watching attempts to tell her where Michael is via email messaging so she can stay alive. The camera work attempts to stand out like the ""Blair Witch Project"" did with the found footage aspect, but the camera is so shaky, you can't see anything, and when the cameras are down in the basement, it's even worse.Busta Rhymes was no doubt cast so people would see his face on the promotional art, but this guy is a horrible actor, and his character is remarkably stupid. Imagine this, Busta Rhymes breaks through a wall in the garage and starts karate kicking Michael like a complete buffoon. Did the producers think this was funny? Even worse, he begins Kentucky Fried Chicken jokes at Michael's expense when the movie is over, and we can finally go home.I put ""Jason X"" down something awful for all the right reasons, but ""Halloween Resurrection"" makes Jason's garbage sequel more watchable. There is nothing in this film that is memorable, Busta Rhymes is a pathetic joke and the fact that it is what it is and that the producers were seemingly okay with the finished product says a lot about ripping audiences off with no shame and no care. Jamie Lee Curtis is insulted as Laurie in the film, and she looks like she does not want to be there for all the right reasons. If this is the end of the ""Halloween"" films, It's a sad and painful journey we spent from sequel to bad sequel up to this incompetent trash being the seemly end of Michael's legacy.

170,Old Crow-2,Evil should find its way to the grave - may I be the one to show the way?,3,17 May 2003,"Those people who find these stupid slasher movies scary should see a shrink and start watching quality movies like The Ring. All these Halloween and Jason movies are for brainless people who like watching pure garbage and teens getting killed. Yes, I did rent Halloween Part I-can´t-even-remember, but I could watch only the first 15 minutes or so. Now someone thinks I was scared... Hmmm, in a way I was scared: scared of what this kind of crap could to my mental health. Halloween Part One was good, Part Two was okay and H20 was surprisingly good. I have no interest what-so-ever to see Parts 3-6. Once I actually saw some parts of Halloween 6 on the German RTL and I must say it was pretty awful. So, as Halloween Resurrection begins we are told that it wasn´t Michael Myers who lost his head in the end of H20. Oh really? What an original plot twist. Now Michael´s back for Laurie who (finally?) gets butchered. I feel sorry for Jamie Lee Curtis whom I´ve always found a decent actress, to say the least. But to see her in a crappy film like this shows that she´s really in need of (good) movie roles. Why did you do this, Jamie?Michael Myers isn´t scary. Jason Voorhees isn´t scary. Freddy isn´t scary. Those people who saw this movie in a theater, now those guys are scary! And guess what, Michael´s still alive! I can imagine the screenwriters trying to come up with a surprising ending: ""Hey guys, I have an idea... What if Michael didn´t die in the end? Now wouldn´t that be cool and spooky?"" And one one saw it coming, honest! I just came up with an idea... We could put all the people responsible for stupid brainless scary movies in a house, lock the doors and put all the lights out. Then we could give knives to folks who like quality stuff and let them butcher every single horror freak in the house. That would be so much fun and we would be praised by the following generations who were saved from having to watch horrible movies. I´m willing to pay for all the knives. I really hope that all those who were involved in Halloween Resurrection never get to work again, unless they manage to do something well.

A horrible experiment gone absolutely wrong(As if the mere idea of it should evoke any kind of hope. Yeah, right!), and as we all know, in ultra commercial Follywood they simply love to hold on for dear life to anything that is slick, superficial, vomit-inducing, and ergo anything that makes sure the cardboard figures working there gets their hard earned millions. Anyway, back to this sad, sad, show I was talking about. Of course the best thing would have been not to spend one single iota of energy on it, but I figured that I might get some good, unintentional comedy, so why not? And sure as hell, what unfolded itself before my very eyes was a lesson in learning how to phrase a sentence like all good illiterates do; think long and hard before uttering the most simple thought, speak like a lazy drunkard, get your words(or letters for that matter) mixed up, and wait for it....here it comes...Wait...act like this is the way to go, act like you're real tough, when you actually have the vocabulary of a mentally challenged 3-year old!! And that finally brings me to the matter at hand, this turd that is actually smeared inside a DVD-case, lying there, silently waiting, and hoping that some poor fellow will actually get confused, and will alas pass the feces off for a actual film. And if a turd is actually going to look like a proper one, everyone behind, and in front of camera must contribute, and of course here is the catch, without anyone having any knowledge what so ever about it. Now they stand there, thinking they have made a brilliant horror-film, immensely proud, and none the wiser. And of course my reason for bringing up the ""documentary"", is for the sole reason that it featured ""Busta Rhymes""(Hrmmm...really great name, he,he..) in connection with the crap I'm currently reviewing.

Maybe the FBI should have considered having a rapper on their payroll the next time they want to catch a serial killer, everyone knows now that a few pathetic karate-kicks, and lots and lots of verbal profanity is the way to go when faced with evil.

He must've had some kind of influence in the writing because he got to yell put downs at Michael Myers in one scene without getting his throat cut, and in the last pathetic scenes he gets to karate-kick Myers and shock him to death while getting some verbal thrashings in. This alone should make most people want to throw up. The camera work throughout the house was incredibly lame. If you dislike stupid camera effects as much as I do, stay away from this. It was giving me a headache. Jamie Lee was killed off at the beginning, the most likely reason is she wanted this to happen so she wouldn't have to be in any more sequels. Her final kiss goodbye accompanied by the line ""see you in hell"" was terrible. This movie ranks way down there with Charlies Angels: Full Throttle as my all time worst. If I could give it a ZERO I would, but I had to settle for a 1 out of 10. The reviewers who actually liked this movie show how pathetic and simple minded movie goers have become.

I must say the way they thought of bringing Michael back was genius,but this film alone was alright.They should of just left it alone after H20.The gore in this one was way to clean for me.Even the first HALLOWEEN,which I love,was gorier than this.The acting was fair,but to me Busta made the show.When he did karate on Michael,I laughed my a** off.This entry was good,but not all that.Still the worst is HALLOWEEN 5.",Halloween - Resurrection
176,Alise_shenle,this movie sucks,1,28 October 2008,"i have not watched any Halloween movie, but based on IMDb, i presume it to be quite good, it was listed as a horror classic. so when i watched this crap, i was thinking ""is this even about the same thing??"" the antagonist (the phantom of the opera copycat) is silent, superhuman, and he likes to stab people. what for??? i only find out the reason when i look up wikipedia. a good sequel doesn't need the audience to refer to sources. the heroes are really lame, and i couldn't give a damn when they die. there's the slutty blonde retard, who's always looking in the mirror, and just scream when mike stabs her. come on, at least try to run in your stilettos! the other red head is really stupid too, she had sex, and then she touches a ""dead"" rat, and screams around, shouting to mike ""I'm here! come kill me!"" don't they ever learn never go anywhere alone in horror movies? the brunette fares barely, too weak to even lift the table off her at the end. her only redemption is she never flirt or try to have sex in the show. and she kicking mike's head. the stupid hip hop wannabe producer is retarded too, like when he pretend he's mike, and shout at the real mike. he can't say a sentence without motherfucka in it. the pussycat doll reject is really idiotic. she always dances at the crucial moment. i'm glad she became a pool of blood. the other characters are too shallow for me to recall. as for the non existent plot, at first i thought i was watching reality TV, like fear factor. then i figured out it was the cult classic everyone was talking about. go figure, everyone.",Halloween - Resurrection

Does humor compliment the stalking shape of Evil?",Halloween - Resurrection
178,Finntroll,Please let Myers die.,1,2 November 2004,"The first Halloween movie was a classic, it's one of those movies I'll always remember. The series, however, is a bad one. It looks like those who own the rights to it are trying to outnumber the ""Friday the 13th"" series in most movies and that just can't be a good idea. Resurrection starts off like any other sequel of this sort, with a dead killer returning from the grave.All the clichés aside, this movie still reeks. Bad actors, bad FX, un-scary... This is all you don't want from a horror movie. And by the way, Busta Rhymes shows us all that he's the worst rapper gone actor ever, Snoop Dogg looks like de Niro in comparison.Avoid, avoid, avoid!1/10",Halloween - Resurrection
179,Zod-2,Not since Greedo shot first...,2,16 August 2002,"...have I seen such utter disregard for the intelligence of the fans of a movie series.  SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN The explanation of how Michael Myers survives H20 is ridiculous.  Not only is the paramedic that Michael Myers uses as a stand in for himself the exact size and weight as him but he apparently also possesses Michael Myers' ability to survive being thrown out a car windshield, hit by a car and crushed by a car.  Granted the film makers of Resurrection took the time to explain why the paramedic doesn't yell out to Laurie Strode and tell her that he isn't Michael Myers (his throat has been crushed - again this would kill most people) but they don't explain why, after fighting his way out of a body bag he doesn't take off the mask he's wearing!!!!Okay, horror movies rely on suspension of disbelief for the movie to be enjoyed but consistency is still needed within the frame work of the film. I'm sure even die-hard Halloween fans would be upset if Michael Myers started to fly from place to place to do his killing.  Michael has the ability to survive extreme trama, but he usually goes into a coma or disappears for a long time to recover from his injuries, everybody else, like the paramedic, cannot have this same ability.That's my distain for the first 15 minutes of the movie the rest of the movie is just your run of the mill bad slasher flick.  There are a couple of interesting moments, one or two minor scares and a little bit of suspense but nothing really worth mentioning.  There aren't any characters to root for everyone is just fodder for Michael to slash through.  Actually Michael is the one to root for as he cleanses the vermin from his house, I really wish he had been more successful.  The movie would have ended better with no survivors and Michael walking off into the sunset then it actually did, perhaps he could be on his way to do away with his nephew John!  As it is, I was REAL shocked to see Michael wake up in the morgue, not!I love the Halloween films that feature Michael Myers.  I, II and H20 make a great trilogy.  H20 would have been a fantastic way to end the series (despite what some of the other reviewers say).  But the film makers got greedy and made this pile of crap suckering in the people who loved H20 and thought they were going to get another H20 but only got a Friday the 13th Part 8.Halloween: Resurrection gets a 2 out of 10 the full 2 marks go to Michael Myers the coolest of the big 4 slasher killers (Leatherface, Jason and Freddy)",Halloween - Resurrection
180,HORROR_FAN_1,Why are they still making these??!!,1,8 May 2003,"It was just simply because it was titled 'Halloween' that I decided to show respect for John Carpenter's excellent opening 2 films. Boy, was I dissapointed. For a start I wondered how the hell they were gonna make serial killer Michael Myers come back for another killing spree when he was decapitated in H20.I thought that they actually would have had him walking around with a bit of glue stuck on his neck to signify him sticking his own head back on!. That probably would have been more plausible than the explanation of his come back. He dressed up in a paramedic's outfit, then just so happened to crush the innocent man's larynx?!. Gimme a break!. Bit of a coincidence then that the innocent paramedic dressed up in myers' clothes and mask would answer to the name 'Michael' when Laurie Strode speaks to him near the end of H20.What mainly lets the film down are the terrible actors. They are just so typical of a horror flick nowadays. In the Myers house we get the usual:1. Doing drugs - means they are gonna die2. Sex scene - means they are gonna die3. A typical hero (Busta Rhymes) who just happens to be a Bruce Leeand down right stupidity for going back there.Busta Rhymes is an absolute joke in the movie, every other word that he says is a swear word, what is the need?. As for him doing a Jackie Chan and kickin' Myers' ass, well as I watched it with my brother, we both erupted in laughter. It's hilarious.I've already voted for this film and yes, you've guessed it, gave it a 1 rating. I am a die hard fan of the 'Halloween' series but could simply could not rate this film at all. Why Jamie Lee Curtis wasted her time doing this is beyond me, she must be buying a new house in real life or something and needs a bit of extra cash.Hopefully this is the last we see of Busta Rhymes (except if it's in a comedy, which, after all, is the way I look at this film, as a joke)Rating 1/10.

181,jpkwolf,Worst movie.. EVER,1,23 March 2005,"H20 had good direction, decent acting from most actors and Jamie Lee Curtis did a very good job. It was all a good package with a good story line to end the series. Then what is this? Another Halloween movie. Well go ahead if it's a good sequel but of course it's not. It's a crap movie that cripples the whole series. Everything you could think of is just wrong in this movie. The direction sucks, everyones acting sucks (Even the acting of Jamie Lee Curtis) and it uses stupid and terrible hand camera shots. In H20 the characters behaved in a sensible way but in this lame excuse for a movie nobody does. First they kill off Laurie Strode (Jamie Lees character) which takes away 50% of the interest in this movie. The beginning setting of the movie doesn't make sense at all. Also in the beginning sequence when Laurie could kill Michael she does something that doesn't make sense at all which results in her death in the hands of Michael. Then there is the character of Busta Rhymes. First of all he can't act and his character is lame. Then he goes to kick Michaels ass twice and win which is apparently something that Laurie couldn't do. There are other lame things in this movie like all the kills that Michael does. This is clearly just an attempt to make money with the Halloween series name. Jamie Lee wanted to get out of the series by getting her character killed. I wish they would have at least done it with style or rather NEVER made this trash. H20 was a great and proper ending to the series.I'm just going to pretend this movie doesn't exist. Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen.",Halloween - Resurrection
182,c_p_c,Whats next?...Halloween:The Resurrection H20,2,24 February 2003,"There are just some times when a good movie franchise is abused and milked for all it's worth.  The first of the series is great and sets the mark ,the 2 occasionally 3 sequels that follow are mediocre and anything after that is just trying to make money of an audience that has no other place to spend their money.  I, unfortuantely was a member of that audience, as I paid money to watch HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION, the 8th installment of the once classic HALLOWEEN franchise.I don't even no where to start; bad cast, bad acting, boring death scenes (not to sound wierd, but why else do you go see a movie like this), need I go on.If you noticed that this movie is mostly made up of celebrities, it is no mistake.  This is all the movie has going for it, and yet it fails in that department.  The biggest mistake a horror movie can make is when it spends most of its time setting up the big death scenes and then knocks off its characters one right after another.  That is exactly what happens in RESSURECTION.  Every character w/the exception of 2 die in a consecutive chain that takes up about 20 minutes of the movie and the other hour is spent trying to gather of what little plot exists.The horror doesn't stop there.  This HALLOWEEN installment doesn't have the style that made the first two so good.  With the exception of a somewhat unexpected opening, the movie is poorly put together.Clearly an attempt to make some fast cash off a dying series, HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION  hopefully is the last time Micheal Myers takes the screen. Yet, I am sure there will find some way to bring back the masked killer. There always is a chance that the executives in charge of this franchise will make a good decision and hang up the white mask and throw away the knife.  HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION rates as just a 2/10.",Halloween - Resurrection

In the short time since Scream was released, have we really already reverted back to this crap that plagued the 1980's and forever made horror movies about as well respected as amateur porn. It's too bad that a ""good slasher"" is an oxy-moron.Big surprise that the man that directed this also helmed one of my other least favorite horror movies of all time (Halloween II). Just like that film, the pacing is dreadfully slow and the characters cardboard flat. All conventions of the genre are well fed here. There's the virginal hero, the slutty best friend, the sex obsessed frat boy, the bad boy loner, on and on and f*cking on.Illogical, contrived, and totally unrealistic.

Part 5 has weak points, but is still a powerful movie.As for this one, I see it as a... ""Let's celebrate how far the series went with just one more set of fireworks to end it all!"". If they make ONE MORE sequel, I swear... It's a great movie, if you're desperate to see Michael Myers in action one final time, but if you're looking for yet another rebirth of the series, give it up- there's not much more they can do, and this certainly doesn't do it. The only part in it that fans will find satisfying is the beginning scene, before the real story of the movie is introduced. (The situation surrounding the opening credits with Laurie, basically.) So it's a good finale to the series, (though H20 would've been far better), but there'd better not be any more. Michael Myers' reign of evil ends here.

My God if the next movie hadn't been a remake we might have ended up seeing Mr. T and Hulk Hogan Boxing a Wrestling Michael Myers.

Then it turned to solid concept when the contestants(the ones on the knives) goes into Michael's old home to find out why he was evil. They all gave cameras on their ears and they're live. There were people at a party who was watching. And here's the thing, Michael still lives there! And he starts killing off people. The people who was watching thought it was all a joke and part of an act, but soon they realize everything was real, people were actually dying, and Michael is still alive.

187,jpasols,Oh man Oh Man! Halloween Resurrection!,6,11 May 2019,"Oh boy! Yikes! Halloween Resurrection we got some serious reviewing to do.
Halloween Resurrection is the eighth entry in the Halloween franchise following up three years after the events of Halloween H2O. At the end of H2O we see Laurie chop Michael's head off, well in the beginning of this movie they explain that Laurie accidentally killed the wrong person. Before Michael's body was loaded up into the van at the end of H2O, Michael chokes a paramedic and crushes his vocals, Michael does the old fashioned switch a roo stunt where Michael dresses up in the paramedic uniform and puts the now mute paramedic in the macanic uniform and mask. So apparently According to Halloween Resurrection, Michael escaped and never died and Laurie is placed in a mental institution for killing an innocent man. So that's how Halloween Resurrection was set up!. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, Michael finally kills Laurie Strode!. Sad day. From that point forward the movie is then carried out by a whole group of worthless idiots who all deserve to die!. On Halloween night, Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks host a reality TV show called ""Dangertainment"" where they put a group of contestants into the old Myers house where they must wander around with head wearing cameras and flashlights for the whole night. Well Michael decides to come back home and finds all these kids wandering through his house with cameras and flashlights and Van's all outside his house. So of course Michael picks them all off one by one.
This movie is probably the weakest of the franchise, not putting a whole lot of effort into making this a good Halloween sequel like H2O. This movie had ZERO scare factors and the acting was horrific. I'm highly surprised this movie was actually released in theaters!. This movie is so corny and low budget material that it should have been a straight to video release. There is a few scenes where Busta Ryhmes tries to do karate moves against Michael Myers and I legitimately couldn't tell if this was a REAL Halloween sequel or a SPOOF. Really Busta? Karate moves on Michael Myers!? Lol that's absolutely atrocious. This movie was so poorly done that it's a laugh out loud comedy. I'm a HUGE fan of Michael Myers and the Halloween franchise but this one ranks very low on my Halloween ranking scale. Even the mask in this movie was poorly made, I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a Michael Myers mask or a white chimpanzee face. Halloween Resurrection without a doubt has the WORST Michael Myers mask I've seen in any of the films. Even the Halloween 5 mask was better than this one. You dont care about any of the characters in this movie and you pretty much just want Michael to kill them all so the movie can end already!. Jamie Lee Curtis only lasted 15 minutes of this film and theres no Dr. Loomis or Marion Chambers. All of the original cast members have been killed off by this point of the franchise. So it's another reason the original Halloween series should have ended at H2O. This film has no true meaning to the franchise and is a very UNimportant sequel that doesnt need watching. But if you're a HUGE Halloween/Michael Myers buff like me then maybe check this one out at least once. I do own this movie on DVD and in my Halloween 10 disc set bluray collection but its STILL apart of the franchise so if you own all the other movies then you better pick this one up too. It is a fun cheesy guilty pleasure type slasher movie but nothing too impressive like Halloween 1 and 2 and 4 and H2O. Other than hardcore Halloween/Michael Myers/Horror fans I wouldn't recommend this to regular movie goers.My final rating for Halloween Resurrection: 6 out of 10",Halloween - Resurrection
188,bronty,A million other films in one - all of them redone badly. VERY badly.,1,1 November 2006,"I like horror films. Always have. But, sadly, the genre seems to have taken a powder over the past 10 years or so, particularly the last 5, I'd say, and this ""film"" is a perfect example: by now, one expects lackluster direction, lousy acting, and derivative storytelling but this one hits an all-time low, for it's a million other movies you've already seen, thrown into a blender, and left to stew in the sun to spoil even further. Worse still, for those fans of the ""Halloween"" installments, except for the opening sequence featuring Jamie Lee Curtis, this film bears little real relation to any other film in the series. The recycled ideas provided here as ""entertainment"" are nearly endless: teens being stalked by a killer? Too many other movies to count but let's start with ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", to name a couple. Teens staying in a haunted house over night? Saw that in ""House On Haunted Hill"", ""The Haunting"", ""Night of the Demons"", you name it. Stupid people doing stupid things that cause their own deaths, or aid in it? Or horny teens getting whacked for doing what comes naturally? How 'bout ""Friday the 13th""? Helpless, screaming, white heroine who can't do anything without a man around to save her? In this girl-power age, we don't see that much anymore but just about every older flick has it. A group investigating weird happenings while capturing it all on video? ""Blair Witch Project"" all over again. And, just like ""Blair Witch"", this is an unmitigated disaster all around. There isn't a single scare or moment of tension throughout, ""helped"" neither by a director who'd be hard-pressed to successfully direct a grammar-school play, let alone a big-budget film, nor a cast of unknowns who greatly deserve to stay that way. They're awful. Not one of them has any screen presence, or creates a character worth caring about (though of course there aren't any characters written, just stock figures from any other horror film). The only ""names"" of note - besides Curtis, who has little more than a Drew-Barrymore-in-""Scream"" cameo - are model/""actress""/talk show hostess Tyra Banks and rap ""artist""/""actor"" Busta Rhymes, and when Banks and Rhymes are your biggest names, boy, are you in trouble! Imagine the producers talking this one over: ""Okay...the last installment had Michaael Myers killed in a very satisfying wrap-up of the series. How can we bring him back AND upset everyone who loved the films? Maybe we can kill off Jamie Lee Curtis! Yeah! But who to replace her with...? Hmmm... I know! Busta Rhymes! When I think of horror-movie legends, I think of Jamie Lee Curtis and Busta Rhymes. And maybe we can get one of those Victoria Secrets models? Any one of 'em will do. Let's get one who THINKS she can act but really CAN'T so we can kill HER off, too!"" Banks IS a bad actress (not Cindy-Crawford-in-""Fair Game"" bad but close) and disappears, thankfully, about halfway through. Unfortunately, that means we're stuck with Mr Rhymes, whose idea of acting is screwing up his mouth and face in attempt to come off as 'street', with some out-of-nowhere Jackie Chan moves thrown in for the ""big"" finale. (Yes, you read right: Busta - taking himself seriously - breaks into pseudo-ninja action, complete with the vocal sounds you'd expect. He's so impressed with himself, and it's all so ridiculous, that you've just gotta laugh out loud.) Oh, and did I mention that for a physically huge and powerful, unstoppable killing machine, Michael Myers has the lithe grace and body control of a dancer because AT NO POINT IN TIME does his hulking presence on the steps or floorboards of a decades-old house create ANY noise whatsoever? I wasn't sure if I should be scared for the characters or impressed with the carpentry. Goodness knows the carpentry would be the ONLY THING to be impressed with. Everything else in this flop is pure cash-cow desperation.",Halloween - Resurrection

191,jwtrox08706,"No wonder the series was rebooted, this was the crash in the system",3,8 December 2006,"A lot of people may think that Halloween 5 is the least effective film in the whole series, but Halloween: Resurrection is a close second to that. Putting Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks in this film...fail. Busta Rhymes brings two aspects to this film that do not belong in a Halloween film...hip hop arrogance and kung-fu. I like hip hop music, and I sure as hell love to see kung-fu. However, I do NOT want to see kung-fu in a Halloween film. I don't want to see Busta Rhymes making his stupid @$$ comments in a Halloween film. Tyra Banks: a role model to many. Personally, I just think she's annoying, now. She certainly has no place in a Halloween film. What else about this film shoots itself in the foot? Sean Patrick Thomas is a good actor. He was great in movies like The Barber Shop and a lot of teen movies during the '90s. Where he does not fit in is a Halloween film. Just, no. I can't explain it. Thomas Ian Nicholas is a similar situation. I thought he was hilarious in the American Pie films (and I love the original three American Pies), and he was good in Rookie of the Year. Does he belong in a Halloween film? No. He just didn't fit into the whole equation. I think one shining performance, which isn't saying a whole lot, because the acting in this film is not convincing, comes from Bianca Kajlich. She's good at being absolutely petrified and running from Michael. However, who the hell decided that it was a good idea to hire an actress for a leading female role in a Halloween film when she can't scream? That's right. She can't scream. So they had to ADR screams into the film for her in post production. In retrospect this film should never have been made. Halloween H20 was where it should have ended. Laurie beheaded Michael, and that was that. However, they just had to go back and use the holes in the time line between Michael falling through the table after being stabbed repeatedly by Laurie and the time that he gets tagged, bagged and put into the meat wagon as a means to come up with a very shaky situation to explain how Michael had survived that night. It's all bull$hit. Apparently an EMT went into the school, got his larynx crushed by Michael, and Michael switched clothes with him. So in all the confusion, Michael walks away, free to kill again, and a helpless EMT gets beheaded by Laurie. She gets institutionalized, and ultimately gets killed by Michael after a botched attempt to kill him when he finally decides to come after her. Horrible, just horrible. You know when the PC freezes because Windows f-cking sucks, and then finally it just crashes? Well, that's what this movie is, pretty much. However, there is one cool thing about this film. The use of webcams adds an interesting aspect to this film. Rick Rosenthal directed this, and he also directed the original Halloween II. So, he recycles some gags and features that he utilized in Halloween II. The webcams are very reminiscent of the security cameras and monitors in the hospital in Halloween II. Bianca Kajlich (Sarah) slips and falls on a huge puddle of blood, much like Lance Guest did in Halloween II. There are others in the film, but I thought I'd just mention the two most prominent ones. Overall, this film is very ineffective and weak when compared to many of the other Halloween films. I give it a 3 out of 10.",Halloween - Resurrection

Well after this fiasco it will be my last.Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage. The beginning with Jamie Leigh Curtis got the movie off to a promising start but it turned more and more stupid as it went along. It took alot of effort to keep from walking out.Having a rapper in this film was the biggest sellout. Hey, let's get a rapper in the movie so we can appeal to the teeny boppers. If you like lines like ""Trick Or Treat Mother Fu....."" Or ""You're just a man in baggy ass bibs"" or ""You're fried like chicken"" or referring to the killer as ""Mikey"". Get my point. This movie is freakin' ridiculous.Then you have the Blair Witch camera work ripoff that is horrendous. At least in Blair Witch you can still tell what is going on. Alot of Halloween is just horrible video that shows you nothing.Busta Rhymes ruined this movie. He starts making kung-fu sounds when he is fighting Michael Meyers. If I was John Carpenter I wouldn't even have let them use his music in this pile of crap.This movie sucks, plain and simple. It is an embarrassment to the Halloween franchise and quite frankly I don't want to see another sequel. Don't even rent this dung heap unless you are drunk off your a$$.",Halloween - Resurrection
193,rwduke,"Total Garbage, Total Sell-Out",1,15 July 2002,"I thought 3, 5, and 6 were awful but this is BY FAR the WORST of the series. This one taints the Halloween series beyond repair. I would never watch another sequel after this one. SPOILERSFirst of all, the original Halloween knows that it is a horror movie not an idiotic rapper vehicle like H8. I don't mind a little humor mixed in with a horror movie but we go to get scared. Every line that Busta Rhymes spoke made we want to projectile vomit onto the screen. He was absurd and had no business in this movie. The producers just sold this series out to the teenagers because they know they don't have an original idea left in their puny brains.Busta Rhymes made an a$$ out of Michael Meyers (and himself). He makes Kung Fu noises when confronted by Michael, he has the worst dialogue of the movie ""Trick Or Treat Mother Fu....."", ""You fried like a chicken"", ""Hey Mikey"". I did everything I could to keep from throwing up when he spoke. I got a stomach ache every time Busta Rhymes entered a scene. Then Busta Rhymes scolds Michael and Michael cowers down and leaves. Michael Meyers, the psychotic killer, is afraid of a rapper with a big mouth. Yeah, right. This is an obvious sell-out and the producers should be rewarded with bankruptcy. They do not deserve profits from this movie.Then you have horrible acting by all the ""teens"" in the movie. And more horrible dialogue. You have a girl attacking Michael Meyers with a chainsaw saying ""This is for so and so, and this is for so and so."" God, I have never seen anything so lame in my life. Then you have the horrible Blair Witch ripoff camera work that shows the viewer absolutely nothing. This is space filler, nothing else.
I would rather watch Halloween 3 without Michael Meyers than have to watch Halloween 8 where they made a mockery of him. Busta Rhymes SUCKS for doing this to Halloween, and so do the producers. Rick Rosenthal and Moustapha Akkad, may you not profit on this bile that you call a movie. This movie shames the series beyond repair and anyone with a functioning brain will just roll their eyes in disgust.",Halloween - Resurrection

195,symbioticpsychotic,No offence Mr. Rosenthal but you suck!,5,26 December 2002,"Is it not bad enough that we experienced Rick Rosenthal's travesty of the Halloween series as early as part 2?Is not enough that we have sat through countless cliched horror films? Why must we be subjected to the same old thing, Rick?  Why bloody rip scenes off from John's very fantastic original Halloween and NOT EVEN MAKE THEM SCARY? Can you not think of your own ideas?AND (forgive me for being so negative), that whole story at the start that showed why Michael was still alive? I mean PUHLEASE! If it was a paramedic in the back of that ambulance and not really Michael at the end of the last film, why in the name of Norman Bates was he trying to kill Jamie Lee? Because he was angry?  Because he was p***ed that he accidently washed his white shirt with his coloureds and it came out pink? No wait, he was a jilted lover of Jamie Lee's and wanted revenge.  Or maybe he was Donald Pleasance and he figured that the only way to stop Michael was to kill her!I am so sure that Jamie Lee Curtis said ""Sure I'll do ANOTHER Halloween film but ONLY if you kill me in like 10 minutes so I can NOT come back cause I'm so OVER these films.""And what's with Michael opening his eyes at the end? - Gee! Michael is not dead, how surprising, I really wasn't expecting that!!!!!!!!! How insulting!Not only was this film boring, it was cliche ridden and it was no fun. And I really needed to go to the toilet about 30 minutes in and I thought to myself ""no, I won't go cause something really good is going to happen"", and GUESS WHAT??

Seems this man isn't human and he just won't die.This sequel didn't really need to be made when the last movie had the perfect ending.

200,davidhutch007,Evil Has Found Its Way Home,6,13 June 2006,"Halloween Resurrection is the eighth film is the Halloween franchise, it's one of those that's been going on a long time such as 'Nightmare On Elm Street' & 'Friday The 13th' but like the latter these films are just about drying up.Resurrection finds a group of teens entering the birth home of Michael Myers for a special web-cast that will be broadcast live. The teens are to spend the night there and find answers to the big mystery of Michael Myers. But Michael intends to crash the party LIVE.This film i enjoyed and i cant understand why so many people hate it, i found it to be a good way to spend a couple of hours with a classic icon that is Michael Myers.The opening of this film is quite interesting, and opens with Michael trying to kill Laurie something he's been attempting to do for quite sometime. The opening to the film i thought was great but just a little too short to give me the satisfaction of ending that particular era of Halloween. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a good performance as this battered, beaten down woman and i think she can be satisfied with the performance as can the viewer.The film then turns to a different level with the film turning into one of those teen slasher films, now while usually this would be a terrible route for a horror film with Halloween in the title, it uses story as reasoning for Michael killing people. These teens have come into his home and so that is the reasoning for killing the teens.The acting is mediocre at best, the best performances have to go to Jamie Lee Curtis and Brad Loree who portrays Michael. Loree really gives a performance to Michael that we really haven't seen since the original, he also looks menacing which always helps, he should definitely be considered for future Michael outings! Busta Rhymes definitely puts in the worst performance of the entire cast, he portrays a guy that in his words ""just wanna give America a good show' well Busta you didn't so don't bother doing it anymore.The set design is creepy and the darkness throughout really makes you cringe not knowing if Michael is in the shadows waiting and i think that is such a clever usage of the lighting.Now this film does something interesting as far as cinematography is concerned. The story has the cast wearing head cams that films everything they see and a lot of the films footage is this sort of stuff with the head cam. I liked that idea and thought it worked quite well throughout the film and made it much more interesting, as though you were there with the actual characters in the film.Of course deaths are always important in a film like this and Michael has his fair share in this outing. To name a few, Decapitation, Stabbing, and a clever use of a tripod. The deaths are really what we've seen before so don't expect anything original here.The direction is all over the place with some bits like the opening done well while other seem like like he has let the cast run wild.So what's bad about the picture then? well i think the main problem has to be that Michael just keeps coming back and i think that is a real problem when they kill him off in one film and then decide hes not for the next film. Also this film seems to ignore Halloween films 3,4,5,6 which seems pointless but hey this is Hollywood.Overall i enjoyed this film, it had some good scares in places and the opening really intrigued me and sit up and pay attention. While the acting is sour and Busta Rhymes is just the most annoying guy in the whole film, this picture works and i think if you're looking for a little piece of horror to get your teeth into then look no further than this, its no masterpiece but its no piece of crap either.****** out of **********",Halloween - Resurrection
201,RebelXStar,Let the Dangertainment begin!,3,22 August 2016,"In Halloween: H20, Michael successfully tracks down his biggest adversary and opponent, his own sister Laurie Strode and the two go head to head in a battle of wits resulting in Laurie walking away the victor when she faces the fear of her brother and kills him with a swift axe blow to the head, decapitating him; a fitting and epic ending for an iconic horror villain and beloved horror heroine.So then, how is it that Halloween: Resurrection exists?Well, it turns out none of the above actually happened.No, it turns out that Michael switched places with a paramedic at the scene of his murderous rampage, crushed his larynx so the man couldn't speak and walked away undetected. Overcome with guilt at murdering an innocent man, Laurie is subsequently committed to a mental institution where she patiently waits for Michael to find her again, which he inevitably does.Laurie manages to trap Michael on the roof of the institution but terrified of killing the wrong person again, she falters at dealing the final blow and Michael is able to exploit her moment of vulnerability to stab and throw her off the roof to her death; a feeble ending to her character in stark contrast to the triumphant ending at the conclusion of the last movie.With Laurie finally dead, Michael is free to return to Haddonfield, where he lives under the foundations of his old, abandoned childhood home - presumably to live the rest of his life in peace.Unfortunately for Michael, a reality TV producer (Busta Rhymes) has commissioned a live internet broadcast to take place on Halloween night inside the Myers house, where a group of college students agree to be filmed spending the night at the scene of Michael's first murder as a child, completely unaware that the man himself still lives there. Cue a new murder spree, broadcast live on the internet to an unsuspecting audience not realising that they are witnessing real - as opposed to scripted - deaths.This film is entirely pointless, and yet I can completely understand why it exists. Made in 2002, reality TV and the internet were still relatively new and innovative commodities that hadn't been used a lot in horror movies at that point. In fact, one of my favourite (and arguably, best) parts of the movie is where the main heroine, Sara, receives instructions of Michael's whereabouts in the house on her palm pilot via her friend watching the broadcast on the outside world.I feel as though the script would've fared better as an individual horror movie, not as part of the Halloween series. The retconning of the events of the previous movie and opening sequence with Laurie feels forced and Michael could've been replaced with a new horror villain and serial killer. After all, no-one wants to see their favourite horror icon karate chopped through a window by Busta Rhymes. Yes, really.",Halloween - Resurrection
202,tommyboy-16,Cheapens the original,4,19 January 2003,"I thought it was bad. Predictable Cheap Stupid It takes away from the original. The original to me had a good story line and plot, mystery, and  was made more real. The old one took you to a region in your mind that made you wonder if there are monsters out there in the real world like Mike.

203,TomConnors,"23 years of Terror, boy Mikey looks good...",6,18 July 2002,"Halloween will always stand it's ground against all the other wannabe's because Michael is the one, and only original slasher king. So how is Michael looking after 23 years of taking out teenagers and chasing his sister Lori? Michael looks pretty good, but not great. I wish I could say I loved ""Halloween Reserection"", I really wish I could say that I had a great time sitting through the 85 minute film, but again, I'm at a loss for words. As I was at a loss for words the first few minutes following the first viewing of ""Halloween:H20"", on the big screen 3 years ago after the thrilling ending that made up for the first hour and 15 minutes of re-hashed ""Scream"" formula that was already killed by such rip offs as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". Unfortunately ""H20"" would become a silly romp that should have been spanked and sent to the corner, for doing exactly what all the films have done since the original ""Halloween"". 15 minutes after 20 years is not even worth the other 85 minutes in ""H20"", so does ""Halloween Reserection"" follow suit? No, but there's a different kind of wrong here. We are given an opening that hasn't been this fun since ""Halloween 1"". But we are shocked and shook and fed an unbelievable explanation for all of the events that happened in ""H20"" and then the film goes farther down hill from there. This film suffers from the same problem that Director Roesenthall's ""Halloween II"" had, no character development of new characters. We get to know them well enough to know who they are when they're butchered, and that's about it. You've heard that from critics since the beginning of the slasher days, but what's wrong with that? Everything, for all the reasons that makes ""Halloween"" stand out above the rest is the characters, we knew them, we cared about them. In this film they follow that formula, but they really don't let us in on who these people are. We don't even care about the female lead enough to care if she gets out of the house alive anymore then the rest of them. Busta Rhymes has his moments, but you can't let him carry this movie with Michael alone. So, I guess what I'm saying is this, good idea, bad presentation. 6 out of 10, only because this Michael is more believable then ""H20's"". Let's make ""Halloween 9"" a little better than this, but better than the derailment of ""Haloween III, 4, 5, and 6"".",Halloween - Resurrection

A lot of the content is copied from other films and some of the plot holes and jokes are so corny that it's not even funny.

Let's face it, were never going to get another part 1 even if John Carpenter himself directs it!  Were at a time now where horror is back on the big screen and it won't last long.

I also loved that it took into consideration the sequal before, in which Jason X did not do, but i still love ya Jason! Myers is just an evil killing machine in this movie, the way it must be. The only problem with the film is busta rhymes, he kind of spoiled it with his terrible humor, but myers makes up for that.

Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks, clearly only cast due to their current popularity, aren't natural thespians by any stretch of the imagination and this hurts the film.

When are Hollywood producers going to realize that letting acting skills go because someone is pretty defeats the purpose of good film-making? Rick Rosenthal - Look at Halloween part 2. One of my favorites, but it's still flawed to death. It's rumored that Carpenter had to do a lot of re-shoots to try and salvage something from Rosenthal's shoddy work. This should have told us something. Rosenthal just showed his lack of talent for directing. He had a good premise and blew it.

For the record, I found the explanation for Micheal's survival at the end of H2O very plausible & ditto with Laurie's death in H.R. Afterall, it really wasn't Michael that did Laurie in (she had him dead to rights), it was a combination of HER uncertainty & his cunning. The camera on the heads of the would-be victims was a nice touch. And in regards to their poor acting, I think that this was intentional because they're reflections of most of the real life wannabes we all see on those crappy ""reality shows""-no real talent & can't act worth a damn.

It is an absolute mystery how Moustapha Akkad allowed the series to go from H20 to this mess, which isn't even up to par with a Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie. True, Akkad, rest his soul, was transparently in the Halloween series for the money, but even he had his standards -- or so I thought.Director Rosenthal, no longer under the tutelage of John Carpenter and Debra Hill like he was when he helmed the decent Halloween II, can't even get the opening title sequence right (is that Arial Black I see?) and relies on a tepid John Wayne Gacy knockoff and an oh-so- convincing decapitation with a kitchen knife for scares. Even back in 2002, he was way late with all the reality TV/webcam gobbledygook. The film's premise plays out like your Great Aunt Gladys trying to sound hip and with the technological age because she managed to buy a tea cozy on eBay all by herself.It is best not to talk about Jamie Lee Curtis' involvement in this, so as not to exacerbate matters.

You'd think, that when he woke up in the van, he would have ripped his mask off, so Laurie would know that she had the wrong guy? Oh no...And thus, is the beginning of a truly terrible addition to an otherwise successful franchise. We finally get closure between Laurie and Michael right at the beginning... but after all Laurie has been through, I didn't think she would be stupid enough to double check she had the right guy, especially when he was stalking her with a knife anyway..Weak direction. Weak script. Weak cast. Busta Rhymes is obnoxious as Freddie Price, an entrepreneur of an internet web cast called Dangertainment, who selects 6 high school clichés to spend a night in Myers childhood home. OF course, Myers trashes the party, and offs people in a way that doesn't go with the Halloween movies. In earlier movies, the violence and the gore was kept to our imagination. We would see the events leading to it, the flash of a knife, and then we would imagine the rest. ""Resurrection"" has blood and gore like there's no tomorrow, and it felt like I was watching some tacked on slasher movie, not one of the many sequels to Halloween.The Halloween movies were a rare franchise, that was intelligent, and always had the ability to shock, and entertain. The first movie sets the standards for all of todays slasher flicks. Halloween II was slightly dodgy with its story, and the pace was slow, but it was entertaining. Things dipped a bit in the late 80's, early 90's, but by H20, new life has been breathed into the series, and I thought things could only get better. How wrong I was.I almost feel ashamed for watching it all the way to the end. Saying that, I will watch it again. It's Halloween after all, and every movie franchise has a bad turkey (Phanton Menace, Freddy Vs Jason, Any hellraiser movie after the third...) All in all, as long as your pi$$ed as a fart, you wont care, and will gladly cheer on Micheal as he slashes his way through 90 minutes of total torture.",Halloween - Resurrection

Okey, the acting wasn't brilliant, and 'the shape' wasn't the same as in the first movie, but it was just a nice movie, nothing more and nothing less. Jamie Lee Curtis died in the first ten minutes. That's a shame, I think. But although: the scream-queen is finally kiled. At the beginning of the movie I just knew who was going to survive, and I was right!

Halloween Resurretion... my version was named Halloween: The Homecoming, or as i will call it Halloween: Featuring Busta Rhymes! haha the movie borrows no-names and hardly stars from several things: *The nerd on all those Disney films (he's got the babyface look. i think he was on like Smart House and some other Disney things) *American pie kid (no not the cool one Stiffler, the guy who did it with the pie, the guy doing stiffler's mom or the slick one... the OTHER guy) *Tyra Banks (who cannot act to save her life....literally as this movie shows) *Busta Rhymes (WHOO HAH!)as some of you know i played the Reaper in ""Scream Louder"". a totally independent film made locally by the film crew at Sandalwood High and produced by Robert Lasowski. it was pretty bad really but sadly, very very sadly, this movie actually Borrowed a scene from it! explained simply: Make a sexually suggestive comment, get the middle finger. HAW! there was a tit bit of nippledge but nothing to write home about. the girl was so obviously trying to look Drew Barrymoreish. Memoriable quotes? Busta Rhymes had some: You hit like I murdered your f*ckin mother or somethin' and How do I FEEL right now? Feel this!and thats ALL! Busta Rhymes would be the only reason to see this. mainly because of the Kung Fu moves he busts on Michael Myers near the end. he saved this film from being say...

The plot of this poor excuse for cinema is that Michael Myers survived being beheaded by his sister in Halloween H20 by..well let's just say the explanation is dumb and leave it at that. Well then he hunts down his sister Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) who is now in the loony bin to kill her. These opening minutes in a dark loony bin are actually very good, Jamie Lee is outstanding again as Laurie Strode, and the atmosphere that director Rick Rosental presents in outstanding.  *SPOLIER* Then good old Mike kills Laurie and the movie becomes a lame Blair Witch Project copy after that. My main reaction to this movie is that killie Laurie was a mistake because the movie actually is pretty good when she was in it, after that it turns to ville brainless crap. Maybe they should have taken John Carpenter up on his offer to write and direct the final instalment of this mess, and do all of us a huge favor.  There is clearly gonna be another one of these movies and they have killed the most fascinating relationship in slasher films, Laurie and Michael were a classic without them the movie just like parts 3-6 are pure drivel.

225,stefant,Rick Rosenthal rocks Halloween,8,15 December 2002,"Rick Rosenthal is the absolutely best Halloween director;Sorry Carpenter! This is the seventh sequel, along with Halloween 2, these two are the best in the series, Rosenthal uses the moody creepy athmosphere, that also were in the early Halloween movies. I´m delighted to see that Jamie Lee Curtis also appear in this one, this movies only problem is that, there seems to be some kind of rule, to use, rap music singers like Busta Rhymes, in the last Halloween H20, it was LL Cool J, and other movies like Exit Wounds and Half past dead, so get rid off the Rap music singers and use them to play music, or put them in movies like: Menace to society or Dead presidents.Hope there will be a perfect final Halloween, that is 100% creepy in the old fasioned way, without Rap music artists. The ingredients must be of the following.1. Dean Cundey´s art of cinemathography 2. Rosenthal or Carpenter´s direction 3.The same creepy facemask, which Michael Myers used in the first and second Halloween, the modern mask doesn´t measure up. 4. Let Nick Castle or Dick Warlock play the Shape. 5.Finally make it a bit more brutal and graphic,I gave it a 8 out of 10",Halloween - Resurrection
226,buckleym-1,Same old routine,3,13 July 2002,"Okay, you knew it was coming, I knew it was coming, everyone knew it was coming. Michael Myers is back (and I don't mean the ""Austin Powers"" star). He is back home again, killing teenagers in the eighth Halloween film, ""Halloween: Resurrection"". Anyone who saw the seventh one, ""Halloween: H20"", might remember that Myers supposedly had his head cut off by his grown-up sister Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) at the end of the film. But since, this is the eighth film, the writers conjured up a way to have Myers slicing his way through yet another picture.Surprisingly enough the director Rick Rosenthal (""Halloween II"") and the screenwriters do create a fairly effective show down early on between Michael and sister, Laurie, who has been put in a mental hospital. After the opening few minutes though, the film becomes a mixture of the cliche and predictable. The plot revolves around having six teenagers spend a night over in the old Myers home as part of an online publicity stunt for a website. And surprise, surprise... Michael Myers is home.
The one trait ""Halloween: Resurrection"" lacks is tension, an obvious key ingredient to so many horror or suspense flicks. What made the first ""Halloween"" by John Carpenter so effective was a mood of genuine terror and tension based upon the unknown. Myers (in that film)appeared, then disappeared, he was basically a ghost and you waited and wonder when he would pop out of the darkness. This film as with virtually all slasher films now, possess none of that terror. Each killing in ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is telegraphed way ahead of time. So either Myers can stare at his victim for hours before he kills them or there will be a small meaningless chase before Myers shows his knife cutting abilities.The film has a few other low points, especially in the plot. No one seems to notice the cameraman go missing for hours after being killed and despite a loud scream not a sole hears Bill (Thomas Ian Nicholas) meet his doom either. Although, this doesn't matter too much, since plausibility and the slasher film just don't go together. Then, there is rapper Busta Rhymes. I didn't know whether to laugh or cringe at some of the dialogue he spoke, which was just plain awful and silly at the same time.
The interesting aspect of this series as a whole, is how little things have changed in terms of the basics of the plot. Sure, some minor details are fixed. The teenagers in ""Halloween: Resurrection"" play on computers and e-mail rather than riding around in cars. There's even a mention of the TV show, ""The Osbournes"" in this movie. Despite the updating in visual and verbal references, little of substance has been added since the original. Michael Myers is still that unkillable boogeyman, and there are still teenagers waiting to be butchered. At least until movie executives stop seeing dollar signs next to the word, ""Halloween"".

But i loved this film as soon as it comes to video i will be getting it. I think the actors did great in this one its to bad that Jamie died.The story was great to and the locations i liked the old house what they did with it. I gives this film a 10 out of 10,Halloween - Resurrection
228,SteveDonnachie20022001,The worst in the series before the remakes.,1,18 October 2005,"I remember when this movie came out a lot of people including me were excited but wondered how it could even be possible. Considering the events of H20 with Michael Myers getting killed due to decapitation. I thought this would be very confusing and would need to be explained. I was glad that the Laurie Strode character was braught back and they explained the whole story that it wasn't Michael Myers but a paramedic that Michael switched places with. And Laurie Strode was put into a insane asylum. But then when she was killed off too easily by Michael Myers in the beginning of the film no sooner did the film go downhill.The opening story goes like this. Some teenage kids are picked in some contest to spend the night in the Myers house where Michael Myers once lived. It was some goofball reality show decided to hosts the contest and pick teenagers to go into the house. Needless to say this was a early silly plot. While the Myers house did look slightly dark and would fit almost with Michael Myers being a killer, I just couldn't see the logic of this story. This film has way too many downsides to it.1. Weak plot. I never could understand why Michael Myers killing Laurie Strode was at the start of the film. In H20 Michael had to break into someones home and find the info on where she was located and living. In this film he just shows up at the hospital where she was. No explanation as to how he did this. And Laurie Strode got killed way too easily. I think she should had been more active in the film considering she was traced back to the very first film. And to kill her off that easily and that quick just didn't do it for me. And while the back story to Michaels survival was interested and it did show Michael wasn't just a killer in a mask but very smart and cunning, why didn't the guy who he switched places with just take off the Michael Myers mask and reveal himself to Laurie before she killed him? Yeah he couldn't talk but he still could remove his mask. Couldn't he? 2. I never saw the logic how Haddonfield would let some reality show let kids into a killers house like that. And there were no police officers there to keep things safe. I thought with a well known killers past, their would have been tons of police outside the Myers house. And did you notice house the house was so easily axcessable? People could just walk into the house. 3. I didn't like Michael Myers in this film. He didn't have the dark creepy presence he did in previous films. He was just a guy in a mask. That's it. It didn't have the same feel. 4. Busta Rhymes. Up until this film I didn't even know who the hell this guy was. But I found his character really annoying. The whole using kung fu on Michael was so stupid and pointless and made Michael look very stupid. This was a attempt by the film maker to add comedy to Michael Myers. In other words it made fun of him. This is a rule you never break in a series because it makes the killer look very weak and foolish. This is why Paramount Pictures said to the director of Friday the 13th part 6 Jason Lives. The director was told do not make fun of Jason by putting him into situations of comedy and corniness. And that's what the director of Halloween Resurrection did with Michael. 5. And during the scenes where people were watching the whole thing in the Myers house go down and people getting killed why didn't anyone try to call the police? Or how no one in the neighborhood even heard what was going on.This movie just didn't do it for me. I thought with Jammie Lee Curtis in the film it would be more exciting and have a Halloween feel to it. But to kill her off and mislead the fans was just insulting. This movie didn't have the Halloween feel to it. They could have done a better job with this film but failed. I don't know if this film is worse then the Rob Zombie remakes but overall it wasn't a good film. Pass on it",Halloween - Resurrection

230,MrTaft,Utter disgrace!,2,4 December 2002,"I cannot believe how bitter I was leaving this film after it's premiere. I was so disappointed that I could not stop raving about it all night. The acting/plot/music/etc was good and had potential, but it was just carried out in such a way that it ended up flawed and just didn't work. There were so many bad, laughable moments that I wished the film had never been made.Kudos must be given to Rick Rosenthal for what he did after the film was dumped into his hands, though. But ultimately the film is poor and does little to help the series, as this is just another made for the hip teen audience and not to continue the storyline. Watch out for the duplicate, ridiculous deaths and the stupid, ridiculous one-liners, particularly from Freddie (Busta Rhymes - whose effort was poor). The kung-fu scene is also an absolute joke!This film gives the series a bad name and does little to restore faith in the ""Halloween"" movies. Steer clear!",Halloween - Resurrection

Yeah, I'm 17, I'm a girl, but I do have taste, and this movie was just plain stupid. Is it just me, or are 98% of horror movies since the 80's all the same and stupid? *Spoilers*At the beginning, I thought it was going to be good... it started out decent... But... when she went up on the roof... and Michael got caught in the leg thing it turned stupid. Boy she had that planned, didn't she? And did she not think he'd grab her when she went to take off his mask? And in H20... ummm... the guy was crushed in between the van and a tree... would he have lived and been ok for her to cut off his head? No.
But all that aside.... The whole Deckard at the party thing got really old...
AND THE ENDING.. was BY FAR... the STUPIDEST MOST STUPID STUPID STUPID, lol, thing I've seen in a long time!!!!!!!! The absolute end, when he opened his eyes... ARE WE SUPPOSED TO SCREAM, OR GIVE A S**T!??! OH BOY ANOTHER SEQUELS ON THE WAY. WHY CAN'T THEY JUST FREAKIN CALL HIM!!!!!!!!

Many large plot holes (including a scene where Michael Myers inexplicably spares someone's life when given the perfect opportunity to kill them), but does have a few good moments and can be fun, if you're in the right frame of mind.

PLOT: 6 people sign up to ""dangertainment"" in order to become 'famous', all they have to do is spend a halloween night in Michael Myers house. Michael being Michael decides to kill each one.

This takes out Tyra Banks and, more importantly, Busta Rhymes..the single worst character in Halloween history. Instead, have the group film (or even do a live webcast) of them exploring the house. Seeing Michael in the background and lurking in the shadows through a found footage view would have been pretty cool. It's almost like they had that idea then decided they needed some 'star power'. Enter the game show aspect. The idea of inserting humor is good. The idea of inserting horribly unfunny, cringe-worthy, humor is not so good.

Jamie Lee actually dies in the first ten minutes of the film which is seriously lame and for some reason Micheal Myers gets away without raising suspicion and returns to his rundown childhood home instead of stalking Laurie Strode's son, probably cause Josh Hartnett still has a career and wasnt willing to flush his credibility down the toilet the way Jamie Lee did.  The rest of the film is a reality show internet broadcast taking place inside of Micheal's house think the Real World only amazingly more pointless and insipid--now thats an accomplishment.  Busta Rhymes makes an ass of himself throughout the whole film giving the impression he didnt know what he was doing.

240,Carlo Houtkamp,If This Is Merely Entertainment (Then Make It So!),1,5 May 2003,"""They don't make 'em like that anymore,"" friends of the horror genre often remark on their web sites in reference to killer films from the late 1970s and 1980s era. They are right.It's not just that sentiments of nostalgia have turned those films into little treasures in our memories. It's because current horror films stink. Not all of them, but plenty or more anyway.Ever since Dwight H. Little last captured the right Halloween spirit and atmosphere in 1988's Halloween 4, the series deteriorated into a ridiculous, messy and pathetic show. I don't care how many fans of the series curse part 3, it was a pleasant watch compared to what came after part 4. Halloween 5 was a complete prank and lacked any sense of storytelling (compliments to Danielle Harris, who managed to perform extremely well under the circumstances). Part 6, well, let's not waste any words on that one. H20 had its moments and decent acting by Jamie Lee Curtis, but a Southern California private school seemed like a poor replacement for Haddonfield. The producers dedicated it to Donald Pleasance, ignoring the fact that his last name was Pleasence (with an E) and had been spelled correctly on all earlier installments that involved his acting. So much for Moustapha Akkad's commitment to the project!Halloween Resurrection had a nice opening scene. A 1960s home movie at the Myers house, with the sounds of Johnny Angel performed by Shelley Fabares. It was cut. Of course, the Akkads in their infinite wisdom must have thought, why bother young people with an old song from someone they have never even heard of! Let's keep the film simple (and let's take a popular hip hop artist as the lead actor).But, thank God, Rick Rosenthal filmed one other decent scene. It involves Jamie Lee Curtis's character hospitalized in a mental institution. This actually is quite a nice scene, with the actress performing wonderfully. It provides a satisfactory and surprisingly original bridge between the events at the end of H20 and the current state of affairs in ""Resurrection"", with Laurie Strode at the end of her wits and a killer still on the loose.And after this? We might as well have left. After the promising Jamie Lee Curtis opening scene there seemed no budget, and more important: no inspiration left to come up with something, anything. It's a bore. It's a drag. The prospect of a replica of the original Myers house showing up is a joke. We're allowed one glimpse, and even on that one occasion it is very unsatisfactory: a big car is parked in front and taking the view, as the camera briefly glances up from a low, moving position. It beats me why they even bothered rebuilding it. The interior scenes can be ignored in this sense: it may have been any old house that Busta Rhymes's character Freddie Harris decided to do his online reality show in. And about these characters: have they ever been this flat in ANY Halloween sequel? NO! The characters in Halloween 5 or 6 were drawn brilliantly compared to what is presented to us here! Okay I realize this is actually pretty much of an achievement. Credit to Larry Brand and Sean Hood. It's amazing. The unimpressive cast (I'm not counting Curtis) is highlighted by 'stars' Busta Rhymes (pop artist who is kindly given the chance to act) and Tyra Banks (model who is kindly given the chance to act). Let's suffice by saying that in this case the actors have been given the roles they deserve.Enough said. Or... We often are told one should not apply the same criteria to a horror film as the ones that apply to drama or classics. But why on earth not? I admire more than one horror movie, but that does not mean I feel I should appreciate the crappy ones by the grace of the good ones. I can see when a film is made with no heart, no spirit and Resurrection is the key example of that. Furthermore, if these films -as we are told so often by people like Moustapha Akkad- are made for entertainment (read: cashing in) purposes only and not for quality acting, complex storytelling or great photography then why, why, why do they so vigorously renounce that one basic goal, the goal of being entertaining???",Halloween - Resurrection
241,drdre1,Make way for Mikey!!!,7,14 July 2002,"After seeing Halloween 8 last night I would have to say it was one of the better sequels and really pretty much what I expected it to be. The portrayal of Myers is more like the original, maybe because of Rosenthal. Of course, Myers is alive after H20, and returns home to find out that his house has been occupied by a group of teens holding an internet webcast. This movie continues along the lines of H20, assuming that the house has been deserted since Myer's childhood. But in Halloween 6, remember that members of the Strode family move in the Myers house and refurnish it. But I guess that is getting into too much detail for a 7th sequel. Above all, Busta Rhymes gives a great performance and would recommend seeing it for some good scares and some good gore. **+ out of ****. My ratings of the best Halloween movies. 1) Halloween **** 2) Halloween 2 ***+ 3) Halloween 8 Resurrection **+ 4) Halloween 6 Curse **+ 5) Halloween 4 Return ** 6) Halloween 7 H20 ** 7) Halloween 5 Revenge ** 8) Halloween 3 Season (Don't Bother!!!)*",Halloween - Resurrection

The score/sound design is excellent. I loved how the film makers built the Myers house as a set and made it look like the original house. The opening with Laurie didn't make much sense, but I found it enjoyable and it is, by far, the best part of the movie. Michael and his mask were a big improvement over H2O as were the death sequences. I liked that it took place in Haddonfeild. Also the budget and production values were good also.But that's about it for the film's qualities. Now for the bad...Hated Busta Rhymes' acting and character. The webcam plot wasn't that good.

And of course he's The Great Bustah Rhymes, so he does more than his fair share of butt-kicking. Jaimie Lee Curtis was somehow really good with what I would describe as a dubious role.

Although there was some terrible acting. Busta Rhymes. What was they thinking! He is the most annoying horror movie actor I have and will ever see. There was also some stupid scenes like when Busta Rhymes managed to kick Michael Myers through the window. I liked the first part when Michael was searching for Laurie and he killed her. But the stupidest thing about this movie is the ending of Halloween H20. Michael switched bodies with a paramedic and strangled him until he broke his voice box but Laurie slammed him through the windscreen of the van she was driving and when the paramedic got up, he just waited there and didn't move out of the way! But this gets worse, when Laurie rolled the van down the hill and the van ended up slamming Michael against a chopped down tree and the paramedic was still alive! Personally, I think they just made this film for the money.",Halloween - Resurrection

That being said, it is only NATURAL for me to not like this one. It retcons the ending and all the characters are bland.

248,arkay,Halloween Big Brother?,3,8 July 2004,"This is the worst of all Michael Myers Halloween movies (I am not talking about H3 here which to me doesn't count as a real Halloween film).  The first 15-20mins or so are interesting mainly due to the fact that Jamie is there.  The rest is the usual boring run around, scream and get killed routine seen so many times before.  That is all there actually is which is not what I consider entertainment.  This movie has no real story to tell, the previous parts at least do have a plot and character development.  Looks more like a F13 movie to me than a halloween movie.  The script could be summed up like this: 'Lock up some teens in a house and set Michael loose'. 3 out of 10.",Halloween - Resurrection
249,woodfrtillson,I'll see you in HELL MICHAEL!!!,9,14 July 2002,"A great Halloween movie to be included in their series.  Everything that's comfortable with the series is there.  A few sets, many killings, screams, stupidity rampant at times, horrific jokes and of course, the music.  Going along with the times, Michael gets to see computers, he kills with a digital camera tripod and he's stalked by the internet which watches almost every move of his.  And in keeping with previous Halloween movies, Michael's mask is somewhat changed and shows a little more of Michael's expressive facial gestures.  And of course the movie ends with the eyes of Michael looking straight at us and the assumption that Laurie Strode survived her fall.  It may be a long time before Laurie sees Michael in Hell!",Halloween - Resurrection
250,Porkchop_Express,An awesome sequel!,9,15 July 2002,"'Halloween Resurrection' was one of the most anticipated horror flicks, just like 'Jason X'. But where Jason failed, Halloween succeeds. 'Halloween Resurrection' is a continuation of 'Halloween H20', taking place 3 years later. Laurie Strode is residing in a mental institution from the events of the earlier film. We find out that Michael Myers is still alive, & we find out how this is (note: it's a pretty convincing twist in events, which keep him alive). After *visiting* Laurie, Michael heads back to his home, where some events are taking place there. A internet businessman & his partner set up a contest where 6 winners will stay the night in the old Myers house. The house is rigged with cameras so all of the events that take place are televised. But there is one problem...Michael Myers is there as well. Decent effects & good direction help make this a worthy Halloween sequel.",Halloween - Resurrection

I couldn't agree more with what one of the users commented by saying its a clash of House on Haunted Hill and Blair Witch Project.  This movie really messed up with the bad performance of the teen actors and they made Busta Rhymes way over his head with all that bruce lee yelling and karate kicks...could they make it any worse?  This movie should only be viewed by die hard halloween fans that haven't missed a single sequel and want to continue it that way.  Too many coincidences in the movie, almost too predictable, you can also tell who will be the last survivor(s) right off the start of the movieall in all it's just another horror movie but in addition to that it wasn't scary whatsoever.  (i had no sympathy for those who were killed either, which is very rare, perhaps its because of the short running time so you can't get to know the characters all too well)",Halloween - Resurrection
252,rexdaugherty,well I didn't love or hate it,8,20 February 2011,This entry was OK at best. Too me I think it was good mainly for entertainment. The idea was good some of the carry out was as well but overall it just some of the scenes I liked a lot is where that one guy is trying to fight Michael with a couple knives himself. well its been a good while since I watched my DVD of this film but I recall a couple characters trying to fight back and thats one thing I like cause they don't go down without a fight but they go down anyway. Things I didn't like about this film is scenes that felt unnecessary one example is Trya Banks' character making a cappuccino. all in all the movie OK far from the best but I think my least favorite maybe part 6 because the whole thorn idea but thats a review for later.,Halloween - Resurrection
253,mullen1979,I love this HALLOWEEN movie,10,28 August 2020,"Is it scary? No! It holds nowhere near the tension that accompanies the installments that came before it and I think it enters unprecedented camp/cheese territory. It has some pretty bad dialogue and the acting isn't the best. It's not a HALLOWEEN movie I take on a serious level at all and to be honest I think it's quite ridiculous.
But damn, its entertaining and I absolutely love this entry. I feel warm and cozy when I watch this movie, especially in the fall.
The blue lighting is constant throughout this movie. Not since HALLOWEEN 4 have I seen that, and done so beautifully. It certainly doesn't carry with it, the dread that came with 4 but its visually stunning. The music score is one of my favorites out of the series. There is a cool crisp feel of the autumn captured here. Busta Rhymes shines in his ridiculousness, so ridiculous for a HALLOWEEN movie, it's almost charming.
I could go on about what makes this a bad movie or a bad entry in the franchise, but I cant hide that there is so much to enjoy on an equal level and although it breaks no new ground, my life wouldnt be the same without this movie and I'm so happy it exists.

254,savagerox-39160,Much better than Halloween Kills,6,17 October 2021,"In reading the reviews for Halloween Kills this movie gets bashed on quite a bit. Not withstanding the silly reworking of the ending of H20 This movie is clever in its use of technology and is probably better than many of the sequels. What is confusing is Laurie Strode tries unmasking Michael Myers to confirm his identity, wait a second didn't he break into your room five minutes before trying to kill you? The Halloween story centers around the Myers house and at least this movie tries to recreate the house closely to the original. In almost all the sequels the Myers house isn't even close to the original house. Seems trivial but John Carpenter went a long way with a shoestring budget, these other studios with much bigger budgets didn't even try to make the house look like the original.The lead character in this movie is likable and you want her to survive most of the other characters you could care less about, but like the original movie you had someone to root for. Not as bad as the 2021 release I've given up all hope for this franchise now.",Halloween - Resurrection
255,jacobhenrytucker-1,What a pathetic movie!,1,13 January 2007,"I have watched all the Halloween films and ever since the terrible Halloween 5, I haven't been so impressed. Halloween 6 was utter rubbish, saying goodbye to the legendary Loomis who is killed in H6. I then watched H20 and quite frankly the only thing good in the H20 was Jamie Lee Curtis. Then I found out about this ""Halloween 8"" coming out and since Jamie Lee Curtis was on top of the credits list, I went especially to the premier. Halloween Resurrection starts off well with Laurie Strode (Curtis) in a mental hospital trying to keep safe from the evil Michael Myers who has SURVIVED yet again in the Halloween H20. Michael kills numerous guards of the mental hospital including drowning a man by locking him in a washing machine which in my opinion is just pathetic, finally after the almost-funny murders, he get's to the room of Laurie Strode and here comes the worst part of all! He kills Laurie! It is with out a doubt the worst thing that's ever happened in the Halloween series. I thought I'd seen it all when they'd killed Loomis back in H6 but no they have to kill the main source to the series.Right now that they've killed all the original characters, it's not even worth watching. Mike Rosenfeld (director) has tried to bring the Halloween series to a new generation by casting ""cool"" characters. The first is the ridiculous Busta Rhymes who's acting was truly awful and supermodel Tyra Banks who in my opinion was just casted to promote the film and not that she could act (well she can't act so there!) Then the plot goes so stupid that I was actually considering leaving the premier half way through! I admit it was kind of a good storyline bringing six young wannabes into the childhood home of Michael Myers and making a reality show, but they made it funny. If it was a separate movie altogether I would consider it being good but it's not a Halloween movie. It's cheap compared to the original Halloween, it's more of a comedy than a horror!The director then tries to ""scare"" us by Michael Myers killing everyone in the house but the murders are so predictable and is a trillion miles away from scary.And just when you think the worst is over at the end, Michael opens his eyes after being hung, stabbed, burned, electrocuted, blown up and thrown of buildings, and then it's the end of the movie. I felt violated! Now that all the original characters are dead, God knows what Halloween 9 will be like and after all the Halloween movies I've seen, I am seriously considering not going to see Halloween 9 because it's probably going to have Christina Aguilera and Xibit or some other ""new"" characters in 2007!",Halloween - Resurrection

Any serious fan of Halloween knows Laurie Strode is one of the most popular horror characters in history and probably the most popular horror heroine ever. So how could Laurie's death in this film not annoy the heck out of you? In every Halloween movie there has been some sort of a human connection to Michael Myers. Of course, his sister Laurie, the psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis, his niece Jamie, and neighborhood boy Tommy. The three most vital of those characters are now dead and we were left with Bustah Rhymes to duel with Michael Myers??? GIVE ME A BREAK! The writers and producers of this wretched film have slapped all of the true Halloween fans across the face. They seriously messed with horror history here in favor for Bustah Rhymes and all the other dreadful actors/characters in this film. Halloween: Resurrection was not made for the fans, it was made for the studio. And while that's the treatment that most horror films get nowadays, it's truely pathetic that they have destroyed this franchise with this piece of garbage. Amd shame on Rick Rosenthal and Jamie Lee Curtis for agreeing to sign on and kill off Laurie Strode. Let's just hope the producers pull another quick one and save Laurie to bring her on to kill Michael Myers once and for all...and this series.",Halloween - Resurrection

262,riot4kimber,The Night He Shouldn't Have Come Home!,1,21 November 2002,"Well, the strange thing is that this is part of an odd Halloween set of films the Jamie Lloyd series follows 1,2,4,5,6 and the Laurie Strode saga is 1,2,7,8.. They say in number 8 that Halloween 2 did happen. So Michael's hands as well as his body should be burned and scarred..... This movie contradicts it's self with many, many details. The movie had no redeeming features. College students that you really didn't care for thrown into a MTV's Fear kind of setting that is the Myers House.Tyra Banks by far was the worst actress in this film, she played an idiotic role and was no need for her in it. The whole Internet thing takes the confined spaces that the other films offered and puts it on display like a freakshow for all to see. The Halloween series is supposed to be dark, scary, and extremely shocking. This entry is boring, lackluster, and just plain dull.*spoiler* And why did they have kill off Laurie Strode? She survived all of Michael's attacks, shouldn't she have been given a reprive?
This movie sucked tho, and that is thanks to Mostapha Akkad, in any interview he does, he jerks his thumb at the statue of Michael that is behind him and says 'As Long As This Guy Is Around, We'll make money.' Sadly, the production, and scripts suffer due to this. Akkad won't let Michael die...and then the films will become a joke.Rick Rosenthal was ripping off his previous halloween 2 directing days. Michael appears out of the shadows, a character slipping in blood, and 'Dr. Mixer' a character out of H2.... *sigh*  Rosenthal should stick with directing TV episodes, which he's done for the past 10+ years. Don't direct a bad movie.John Carpenter or Kevin Williamson has to come back and write a decent script for this series! If you want to understand what really drove Michael to kill his sister, read the Halloween novel by 'Curtis Richards'. It is much, much better that any of the sequels and ranks up there with the first film.I thought Halloween 6 was bad, 6 is actually one of the better films in the series compared to this. this is the worst in the series!!!!

264,cewasmuthiii,"Story line very, very bad",3,2 August 2003,"*** SPOILERS *** I've enjoyed many of the Halloween movies, especially the first one.  I saw H20 back when it came out and thought it was a good way to end the series. H20 satisfied the following...Michael Myers met his doom.  An ending which completely wraps up the saga with Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers. 
Now comes this film which, literally, lies to the viewer.  There is really no other way to put it.  To say Michael Myers was not killed at the end of H20, that it was somehow another man who survived being pinned against a tree at high speed, is tantamount to the most foolish storyline I can imagine.  Not so much because it is ridiculous but because it's a complete lie.  The film was ruined for me right there.  I couldn't believe the writers actually expected the audience to believe such a thing.  A total insult the audience's intelligence.The rest of the film just never worked for me.  Busta Rhymes.  Man, I don't know what to say.  Worst actor of the year award?  And the whole reality TV angle with all the Myer props in the house, which had nothing to do with Michael Myer's real childhood, was absurd as well.  Just a bad, bad storyline.  I read an interview with John Carpenter a long time ago which stated he never wanted a single sequel made with Michael Myers.  The first movie back in 1978 was it.  A great open ending but the Michael Myers story was complete.  Carpenter actually wanted other writers to write stories under the name ""Halloween"" each year with different characters and story lines each time.  It is past time for that to happen.Please.....No more Michael Myers.  The man is gone...Dead in H20.

The explanation they used works really well it even gets you thinking back to the previous instalment H20 and wondering if you could actually see this happening. The plot moves along quite quickly and mixes the laughs you have grown to expect from modern horrors with the good old fashioned shocks. My main problem was with the new mask he got himself, why the hell do you change the greatest mask in horror history??? Busta rhymes is amusing and fulfilss his purpose well, but they had to go and bring him back at the end this is a silly thing to do with black rapper actors as far as im concerned!!!!! But the ending once again sets it up for another sequel, i just hope that it is as good as this was. Still not as good as Halloween 6 but thats just my love for slipping back perfectly into the story of Mr Myers. overall a good film 7/10",Halloween - Resurrection
266,jjpurwitsky,The Halloween Saga: Halloween - Resurrection,6,4 August 2012,"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later ended up being the best of the sequels in the Halloween saga. Around the release of H20, the horror industry was in an interesting time. Scream had reinvigorated the slasher (and horror in general) film at the box office. Horror movies were making money and doing well and being talked about. But unlike the original era of slasher films, where they dominated the box office for over a decade, the slasher as king didn't last nearly as long.In 1999, one movie came out that reshaped the face of horror. And like the original Halloween in 1978, it was a low budget independent film that went on to break box office records. This movie was The Blair Witch Project and it scared audiences to the tune of $140,000,000, an unheard of number for the type of film it was.Blair Witch was a found footage, faux documentary horror film. The camera was hand held and shaky and was controlled by the characters in the film. It was shot on film and video and it had a simple story. And like 1978's Halloween, it had no gore, no special effects, a simple story and about an hour and a half of sheer terror. That's not to say the slasher film didn't play it's part at the movies. A new Friday the 13th (although now they were 'Jason' movies) film was released, a third Scream came out and a new original slasher style film came out called Final Destination. Horror was doing well and on July 12th, 2002 Halloween returned to the big screen.Halloween: Resurrection follows the continuing story of H20, and like that film it ignores parts four to six. It turns out that Laurie had chopped off the wrong person's head, not Michael's. Technically this doesn't make sense based on the behaviour of the man behind the mask in the last 10 minutes of H20, but as a Halloween fan, sitting in the audience, one can let it go.Resurrection goes on to wrap up the story of Michael and his sister and introduces a new story line. Michael returns home to Haddonfield, to his house and finds a reality game show being filmed there. Hence he has to knock off the people in his house, one by one and in increasingly gruesome ways. The reality game show allows for Resurrection to throw in a bit of a Blair Witch influence. Each character in the house gets their own camera and thus the view switches back and forth between shaky, video style footage and nicely framed, smooth film footage.This makes for an interesting idea, and some cool scenes with Michael making his way through the halls and not being noticed by anyone except the audience, but overall Resurrection fails as a movie. First and foremost it fails because it is not scary. Myers himself works pretty well, he seems looming and scary, he walks the right way and he has the creepy head tilt, but once again he no longer looms in the background for very long. He's always clearly visible and ready to strike. Technically, for Resurrection's given story, this makes sense, but it doesn't work for the scare factor.Like Halloween II, this film is directed by Rick Rosenthal. When he made part two he had taken Michael Myers and made him less of a realistic monster. He made the second Halloween a film filled with jump scares and didn't capture the tension that the original did. And following H20, he does the same thing here. But it isn't only the lack of terror that makes Resurrection ultimately fail. The story is plain and generic (although the first 10 minutes with Jamie Leigh Curtis are pretty good) and the dialogue is pretty poor. Most of the actual dialogue sounds fake and expositional, where the characters instead of sounding like they are talking to each other end up having conversations that spell out the story for the audience.The acting for the most part is okay. The acting by the staff at the hospital is sub par but all the leads do a pretty decent job. Although his performance isn't bad, Busta Rhymes does end up sinking the movie some what. His character says some really stupid things and in one scene he does some really cheesy and out of place kung fu poses and noises before he drop kicks Michael Myers. What was Rosenthal thinking when he included that?Another really strange omission is a wide shot of the Myer's house. Although it sounds small, a wide shot to show the outside of the house would of helped the atmosphere of the film in many ways. For example, seeing the Myer's house in a wide shot, establishing to the audience that they were back to where it all began could of built up tension, but for some inexplicable reason, all the audience ever gets is interior shots and quick close ups of various outside features. The film is rather well shot, with great choreography and editing, especially when you take into account that in addition to the film cameras, there were the six or seven video cameras that were used throughout the film. So the film does flow nicely and never really leaves the audience bored. But when all is said and done, and the end credits start to roll, especially after H20, Halloween: Resurrection sadly end ups leaving one with a strong and overbearing feeling of disappointment.Film Rating: 64%Breakdown (How Halloween: Resurrection scored 64%):Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 7 out of 10 Re-playability: 6 out of 10 Originality: 6 out of 10 Costumes: 7 out of 10 Directing: 6 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Music: 7 out of 10 Script: 4 out of 10",Halloween - Resurrection
267,generichorrorfreak,blah,4,2 October 2010,"Halloween: Resurrection starts off on the wrong foot and it's all downhill from there. Sure they found a clever way to undo the closure of Halloween H2O and make it possible to bring Mike up to his old shenanigans, unfortunately that whole segment is hasty and the rest of the movie's garbage. The ""what really happened"" explanation is just a loophole for making a movie that's neither necessary nor any good, and so I present to you Halloween: Resurrection.I'm not going to write any spoilers about what happens to Laurie, but I think anyone who loves the original Halloween and its characters will think what they did with her in this movie is crap and only put her in here for the sake of having Laurie in it.The characters are plastic. Even by the end of the movie when you get to know all of them a little bit, you don't care enough about them to want to see them escape the wrath of Mike Myers. In fact, you'll probably look forward to their demise at his hands. That's how flat and/or despicable these characters are. Even the lead role doesn't have much personality. She's nice and smart and decent, just like Laurie was in fact, but somehow she doesn't have much personality. I don't think her character was developed enough, otherwise she could have made a good heroine. The rest of the characters are people you pretty much hope get killed off, especially the tech lady played by Tyra Banks and most of the kids that tour the haunted house. Obnoxious people, hastily made characters. And Busta Rhymes plays the typical black dude with a boisterous personality. Not a bad acting job, but what a typical cliché character.The technology is another factor. Another case of fusing horror with the fancy gimmick of modern technology (or what was modern in 2002 anyways). Just because we have things like reality shows and phone-texting nowadays does not mean it will make a horror movie any scarier, or realistic, or better at all. Having people emailing and playing on their phones and all in the movie takes away from the good old-fashioned terror you get from something as simple as a lurking shadow or the gleam of a butcher knife.There's a couple of notably cool things in the movie, like when Freddy dresses up like Mike Myers while Mike is there in the flesh and you see two Mikes walking one behind the other. Well that was more funny than anything. The scene with the bong was funny too. And the murder scenes are alright and in typical Mike Myers fashion, but otherwise Resurrection bombs as a horror film and leaves you yet again with no closure, except this time you wouldn't really want to see another sequel.",Halloween - Resurrection

From beginning to end it was nothing like any Halloween that I have ever seen. Even that Rob Zombie crap was better. Michael's mask was goofy and didn't look right. He floated around and sometimes speed walked! What the f**k. We're not at the mall with grandma. After the years of this wonderful marvel of a movie. You would think they could get the facts straight. The time line doesn't make sense. Plus after all of what Michael has been through, do you really think Busta Rhymes, with his yo,yo,yo crap would have any effect on him. Come on people. Why even waste your time.

269,mike0120-1,Terrible follow up to a fantastic previous installment,2,11 December 2010,"Halloween H20 was without a doubt the best horror sequel of all time. It was slick, fast paced and actually scary. It did not dumb down the characters too much. It had a purpose in bringing back the savior of the franchise (Jamie Lee Curtis). Most importantly it tied the story up all the way and there was no need for another one.Enther Halloween: Resurrection in 2002. Originally slated to be released in 2001, rewrites and re-shoots caused a delay which was not for the better. The idea was to bring Michael back and explain he was not the one who got his head chopped off in 1998. Well, nobody ever said horror films had to be taken seriously but as the events unfolded in Resurrection none of it could be understood or explained.Laurie Strode was a vital character to the franchise. Every I repeat every horror film franchise needs one survivor from the previous installment to come back, kick butt and get out. During her short 10 minute appearance, we see how badly the producers wanted to make it work. Yes, we see a stronger Laurie. Yes, we see a passable explanation for what has happened and the spook factor is at an all time high.Reportedly, Jamie Lee wanted out and did not want to see Laurie alive because that would mean another return down the line. Smart girl. Badly written exit. Here she is about to kill Michael Myers and she thinks he has somehow pulled a fast one on her again? Please. This guy WANTED to kill her. He chased her around the building. Tore in her bedroom. And she thought she ""needs to make sure?"" 10 minutes and we are out people. No more Laurie. No more excuse to witness the tragedy about to happen to out eyes and ears.Nothing can save the viewer from this badly written script and one dimensional idiot characters. The camera idea did not work. The jokes were funny for all the wrong reasons and Tyra Banks along with Busta Rhymes need to be reminded they are not actors. While some parts entertained me, the fact that I felt less smart coming out of the theater is a red flag people. Should have waited for the DVD. Oh well.*/4",Halloween - Resurrection
270,steveneven,Halloween: The Disappointment,4,5 July 2014,"Alright, so the review title is not too original, but neither is this movie. I really could not find an antonym for ""Resurrection"", so I will just say how I felt: disappointed. This is the eighth installment in the prolonging ""Halloween"" series, and by the time you see Jamie Lee Curtis, you will already get tired of the same shtick. Cue Michael Myers hiding behind a bush outside. Cue Jamie Lee Curtis fighting Michael. Cue generic ""Boo!"" scares. Surprisingly, I did not find this movie to be terrible, like with ""Curse"". Here is why: The beginning and the ending might be horrendous, but the middle portion is kind of entertaining. Now do not get me wrong, I am not talking about John Carpenter's level of ""entertaining"". More so, I am talking about the entertainment you get out of watching a train wreck. Now onto our characters: we have Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes. Alright, saying that alone is enough to make someone scratch their head, as they should. Both stars are abominable. Katee Sackhoff is also annoying to no end, and Jamie Lee Curtis is fine, but she wares out her welcome. As for the others? Brain-dead and not likable in any sense. However, I did like Miles and Sara's characters, and how they contributed to this movie. Dare I say, I would have liked their characters a bit more fleshed out?As for the script, it is just horrendous. Whenever Busta Rhymes speaks, I just wanted him to get impaled. However, I did like some of Curtis' lines, and the asylum opening definitely has some potential. But, what really makes this this movie suck is the slow motion. Oh my GOD, and I apologize for sounding 14 years old when I say that, but Rick Rosenthal needs to stop slowing down every g-damn scene. He is just not a competent director. The pacing was fine I suppose. The film never ""dragged"" so to speak, and if it was in the beginning, the middle portion of the film packed enough cheap thrills to keep your attention.If the script/acting/thrills are cheap, why the generous 4? For what the filmmakers were trying to do, and please do not kill me, I think it might have worked somewhat. I mean they wanted to make this movie a haunted-house/Blair-Witch style project, and it gave the movie a different angle (albeit a formulaic one). I believe incorporating the survelliance cameras, and having people watch them made the film a little different. Yet, that cannot save the film. How about the kills? Some were brutal, but nothing too out of the ordinary within the ""Halloween"" franchise. I just wish that there were no cutaways. This is Michael Myers. He is vicious! Show that. All in all, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is not probably as horrible as everyone is making it out to be, yet it still deserves a 4. There is no side-skirting the many, many problems of ""Resurrection"". I would only recommend this movie for a drunk night with your friends or if you have a ""Halloween"" marathon to finish. You COULD do worse, but you could also do better. I would recommend ""Season of the Witch""or ""Halloween 4"". They are better sequels with better kills, as well as having better story lines. You might get some cheap thrills here and there, but you will not miss Busta Rhymes' cringe-worthy dialogue and Tyra Banks' abysmal acting.",Halloween - Resurrection

It's just chalk full of *clever* one-liners and *amusing* deaths.  I mean, it's got a rapper as a main character!

273,savagerocks,Halloween Overkill,6,5 September 2006,"Resurrection is an improvement over the last 2 or 3 entries in the franchise. It has a clever theme using the reality show idea. A few problems I have with this movie is they changed the ending in H20 to make this movie work and this movie keeps tripping over itself because of it. Laurie Strode didn't actually behead her brother it was actually a paramedic gagged and wearing a mask. When Michael is on the roof hanging upside down Laurie wants to unmask him and says ""This Time I have to be sure"" before she kills him. Did he not break into her room just minutes before and try to kill her, C'mon. And this film further deviates as many of the sequels do, Michaels sole purpose was to kill his sisters, he killed the older sister in the original and kills his other sister in the opening of this movie further undermining the original story. Nonetheless this movie is a fun ride with overkill in the graphic violence department.",Halloween - Resurrection

Most times an eight installment of a horror franchise usually is one of the worst in the sereis, not this time. Halloween 8 gives us enough thrills, chills and laughs all the way through. I really call this movie Halloween 4, why you ask ? Jamie Lee Curtis wasnt in those sad poor excuses of a movie 3 4 5 6 so they dont count bye bye. My Halloweens begin at one and continue on through this one. The movie surronds a bunch of college kids who enter the childhood home of the famous killer. Now I really dont have to explain what happens next because you kinda already know.

This movie was a suprise to me becasue most of the times the eight installment in a horror franchise isnt good. Then comes along Halloween 8 a action packed thrilling, humorous movie. The movie is alot diffrent from other Halloween's but that doesnt mean its worse. It's no where near as good as the first(casue the first is a classic)but it is better than Halloween II, and it's close to Halloween H20. The franchise is ready to go into diffrent directions I think (As long as they dont go back to the Senseless story line of 4,5,6). The movie stars Bianca Kajlich,Busta Rhymes, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Sean Patrick Thomas, and Jamie Lee Curtis. They all do a great job, especially Curtis. Of course the Halloween franchise will keep going on. You know there will be a Halloween 9 and so on. Halloween Resurrection and Jason X are the slasher movies so far this year. Both franchises went into diffrent directions and only one pulled it off good. Jason X is pointless dribble, When on the other hand Halloween Resurrection intrigues you, scares you. It grabs hold of you and never lets go.",Halloween - Resurrection

277,Hotstar,Absolutely appalling.,3,6 September 2004,"As a stand alone horror movie, this is just fine. As the eighth installment of the fairly successful 'Halloween' series it's terrible.*SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW* Firstly the viewer is insulted before the creepy Halloween theme music even plays. It consists of psychiatric nurses discussing how Myers survived having his head chopped off in H20. It wasn't Myers you see, no, he'd torn out some policeman's voicebox, and put his own mask and suit on the poor bloke. So, Laurie Strode only succeeding in killing a law enforcement officer and not her psychotic brother. Myers has once again got off scot free. This in itself is laughable but what's even more shocking is that Jamie Lee Curtis' appearance in the film is nothing more than a cameo, yes she's hacked to pieces within minutes.Therefore an audience is left wondering what direction Halloween: Resurrection will take, now Loomis, Lloyd and Strode are all dead. Does Myers have any more family members to hunt down and kill? Apparently not.The deranged killer instead takes it upon himself to kill teenage interlopers who have taken up residence in his old house on Halloween night for an internet reality show.So, after bludgeoning to death most of Haddonfield for over twenty years and surviving more physical harm than Rasputin, it seems no one can end Myers tyranny. All except, Busta Rhymes? Yes, after conquering the music world, Rhymes almost single handedly conquers Myers and puts an end to his latest killing spree.This is a sequel we could have done without. H20 seemed a relatively fitting end to the series and if they needed to follow it up, they should have tied up the loose ends from parts 4, 5 & 6, instead of wasting time on this rubbish.With Halloween 9 on the horizon, Michael Myers is in grave danger of becoming a parody of himself, much like Freddy Krueger did. Hopefully, the writers and film makers will see sense and give the Halloween series a fitting finale, (maybe by reintroducing Lloyd's baby) while it just about maintains its credibility as a superior horror series.",Halloween - Resurrection

I don't know what was more irritating the terrible acting of Busta Rhymes or the mindless dialog of the other no-talents. What really p*ssed me off was that the movie was never scary, not even once. After a few minutes into the movie I could tell right away it was going to be boring and predictable and man was it ever. This is real proof that a movie can still be made without talented writers or actors. If you want to rent this movie because you enjoyed the first movie don't waste your time. This crappy movie was made for a very young audience and not for the older fans of this series. I should have never rented this movie. I made a huge mistake, oh man never mind.

John Carpenter should of added the first 10 Min's of Halloween 8 to the end of H2O to finally close the whole chapter of the series. It be upsetting to most Halloween fans that there wont be no more but its just cash at the end of the day for the producers, but i wont see anymore if they make a 9th or 10th cause it would have no connection with Halloween 1,2,4,5,H2O.

280,spikejumper,My review,1,13 October 2021,Halloween resurrection was terrible it was so bad I've only seen the movie once and it was terrible I would never watch it again and I don't recommend it at all.,Halloween - Resurrection
281,cjlines,"Loud, crass, pointless - an insult to the viewer",1,26 October 2002,"What can I say? If I've seen a film worse than this, it certainly doesn't spring to mind right now. I managed to get to the first screening in the local area and, even though the audience was fairly small, I still counted eleven people who walked out at various points in the movie and never came back. Now either Michael Myers slashed them up on their way to the lavatories or, like me, they were bored stiff by this absolute CLUNKER of a flick.The plot, or what little semblance there is of one, is simple yet completely ludicrous. An organisation called Dangertainment, headed by the entrepreneurial Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes), gets together a group of six students (!) to spend the night in serial killer Michael Myers' childhood home, in the hope that they will ""find clues"" as to what drove Myers to kill and kill again. Quite why, 25 years on from the murders, they think they will achieve anything by sending a group of teenagers into a house that, in the real world, would probably have long been demolished, is beyond me. Surely it is the job of police psychologists to dissect the minds of serial killers anyway? The film conveniently forgets the previous five sequels (with the exception of ""H20""; this gets an irrelevant reference in the gratuitous opening scenes which serve merely as an excuse to waste Jamie Lee Curtis' talents in some customary 'running around' antics) and throws us almost immediately into the environment of the house, where each of the six kids are given a little handy-cam to strap to their heads and told to go searching for clues... You with me so far? Well, that's pretty much all there is to it. Needless to say, Myers himself shows up at the house about 10 minutes into the movie (how? why?) and decides he wants to kill everybody one by one, in the style we've now become accustomed to.This paper-thin tale is told so badly, it's almost hard to believe what you're seeing on screen and that anyone was dumb enough to spend time and money filming it. I suppose you could almost see it like a series of noisy soundbites strung together randomly. It keeps things simplistic to the point of being nonsensical, presumably to avoid confusing its target audience of dribbling inbreds. I think I could've written a better, more entertaining and reasonable script myself on the back of a beermat. Nothing is ever explained or justified, no matter how implausible and ridiculous things get, and yet, bogglingly, the film still seems to take itself fairly seriously. It tries desperately to shock with a series of boring but bloody knife murders (nothing we haven't seen ad nauseam in any of the previous films) and innumerable 'false' scares with flashlights and toys falling out of cupboards. It's all so by-the-books and done-to-death that you'd have to have never seen a single horror film in your life to find it even remotely tense or scary.I think what bugs me the most about the film is just how terribly made it is. Even forgetting the GAPING plot holes, there are loads of obvious continuity errors and a sad, desperate style of direction that seems to drag every scene to the point of agony in a desperate attempt to pad out the already-short running time of the film. The cast do nothing to help things - all the characters are cardboard stereotypes and the ugly, plastic teens seem to be having a battle to see who can be the most skin-crawlingly irritating. I think it ends up as a tie between Katee Sachoff's hyperactive, squeaky airhead and Bianca Kajlich's jitterbug 'heroine', who spends the entire movie simpering and screaming loudly every time someone drops a pin. Oh, for the record, Busta Rhymes is absolutely ATROCIOUS in this. His entire purpose in this movie seems to be to deliver the worst examples of wisecrack-by-numbers dialogue I've ever heard (ie: ""Trick or treat, motherf**ker?"") and he plays his role as a cross between Eddie Murphy and Vin Diesel, but without the charm or charisma of either.I'd like to say John Carpenter would be ASHAMED to see such a horrible mess made out of his characters, but when you consider the maestro himself is making films almost as bad as this these days, he probably couldn't give a toss so long as the money keeps rolling in. I think this fact in itself proves just how much horror movies have changed since the first ""Halloween"" was made and, to its credit, ""Halloween Resurrection"" would be a perfect example of an ""of its time"" product you could stick in an 'early 21st century' time capsule for future generations to balk at. It is every bit as throwaway and pointless as the culture that spawned it. It is loud, crass and in-your-face constantly, despite having absolutely nothing to say when it gets there - it's like the movie equivalent of an annoying little brat screaming at you, desperate for attention. ""Look at me! Look at me! I'm being noisy and irritating!""... I would highly advise, for your sanity's sake, that you don't look since, like that annoying child, you'll only encourage it and I, for one, don't think I could cope with another sequel this bad... This film is utter garbage and I fail to think of a single way in which they could've made it any worse. A resounding 0 out of 10.",Halloween - Resurrection
282,smoothgroove16,I wanted to love it...I really did!,5,6 November 2002,"When I heard this film was being made back in 2001 I was over the moon. The death of Michael in H20 was brilliantly done, but deep down I think all Halloween fans just wanted to see Michael back on the big screen! Who cared about plot I thought, they can bring Michael back anyway they liked for all I cared!!This was my first Halloween at the cinema so when the music began I was ecstatic! But 90 minutes later I was just so so dissapointed. I'd seen Michael back again, but that alone was not enough I realised, and wished this had never been made.**(Spoilers ahead)** There were 3 main things wrong with this film-1) Busta Rhymes (Freddie Harris)...for me this guy alone ruined this film. His character was so fake, his dialogue was pathetic, and his overall acting was atrocious. How could they allow a character like this in a Halloween film, ok if they want to kill him off quick to raise the death toll, fair enough...but as a main character!!!!2) The death of Jamie- I knew this was coming and I dont think its a secret to anyone, but its the way they did it, making Jamie look like a complete idiot. Ok she wanted to make sure, but who else was she expecting, he'd obviously killed alot of guards to reach her, so even if she did kill him- who cared!!! And her final words- 'see you in hell', call me crazy but don't we want to hear after all her suffering, she's finally being able to rest in the place upstairs, not down below!!3) All the characters were just truly annoying, you was just cheering Michael on wanting him to kill this irritating character in the goriest way! And when a film gets like this like the Nightmare on Elm Street films did, aren't they just pretty pointless?I thought they did the 'bringing back Micheal' without too much stupidity, but when you watch H20 you realise how daft it is. In that the poor ambulance driver survived a broken layrnx, going through a glass window, being hit by a van, and finally being crushed. And to top it off after being hit by the van, he did the classic Myers sit up. There were however cool deaths in this and Michael was truly brilliant and looked great. One bit where the director obviously went mad for a while was the scene where Busta Rhymes screams at Micheal. I was enjoying this moment thinking this is it, he's gonna really make him suffer now, and I waited...and waited, before Micheal obeys him! What the hell was that all about!! Overall the whole camera thing works quite well, a little daft but its a different approach. It's obvious 'innocent' Sara will survive but the whole Deckland thing was so lame!  When no-one believes the killings are real, the film got stupid, I know special effects are great these days but this was meant to be live, so how the hell would they do it!As I said before the main reason why I hate this movie is Busta Rhymes, he wasn't funny at all. You knew when Michael stabs him he'll still be alive. But I thought this was building upto a big kill between the two at the end, but I couldnt believe my eyes when it was Michael on the recieving end, not only did we have to watch Busta's awful martial arts, but listen to his pathetic one liners (Trick or treat mother fuc*er), these corny lines should not be in Halloween films!My only wish is please, please, please kill Busta Rhymes character straight away in the next Halloween, and my faith in the series will be re-stored! Overall I gave this 5/10 coz of the cool deaths, and quite simply Michael's back!!",Halloween - Resurrection

Yeah.scared that I would have to sit through the entire.uh, ""film.""  Well since I was watching it with two others I did have to sit through it, although I had to tape my eyelids open with duck tape and have myself tied to the chair to do it.Michael Myers is submerged by this terrible, stinking entry in this series. I really like the Halloween series, but this one should have never been made the way it was made.  The acting is absolutely horrible, the filming is atrocious, and the entertainment value is non-existent.Jamie Lee Curtis is featured in the very beginning, but is only in the film for a very short time(lucky for her), and after this the title comes up. Then it is nothing but downhill all the way to rock bottom.A group of ""young"" people (it must be tough being a 35 year old teen-ager) is stuck in the old Myers' house doing something.  One can never be sure just what they are supposed to be doing except perhaps showing how they cannot act.  ALL of these characters are very unlikable, two-dimensional parodies of human beings.  One never gets involved with any of them because there is no character development what so ever and no plot to boot!  The most obnoxious of the characters is the black guy with the long hair extensions, whose favorite word is, ""motherfu@#a,"" and he mouths it through huge lips (that seemed to have been over-inflated with collagen injections) through the whole mish-mash.This movie is NOT scary at all, has no tension, no excitement, and ALL the special effects are ruined by the constant (very irritating) injections of the ""view"" through the characters mini-cams they have attached to their heads (or whatever).What were the makers of this film thinking when they made this piece of crap?  I would like to know that, because it seems like they must have been on ""crack,"" or maybe sitting on their cracks when they put this drivel together.  Man, it just plain sucks!  It is no wonder that this films release was delayed so long, went through so many name changes (this always happens when the makers know they have a loser), and finally emerged only to be stillborn at the box-office.Maybe if they make another one of these movies for the ""Halloween"" series, the makers will pick some plain, regular people off the street to star in it, because there is no doubt ANYONE chosen off the street would be better at acting than the..uh.""actors"" who appear in this bomb.

The music, the mask and Donald Pleasance have never been far from my mind so rating Resurrection has been very tricky.Let it also be known that I loved 2 and even 3, hated 4, despised 5 loathed 6 and adored H20. So again this made Resurrection trickier still.I think the best way to do this is via pro's and con's.Pros:Link to H20 was very well handled indeed. The mask is the best it has been since number 2. Busta Rhymes was most entertaining. Michael on the whole was very effective. (Maybe too mush emphasis was used on him studying death).
Cons:The beginning was poor. Laurie Strode was too important for it end like that. I felt nothing for any of the victims. I almost felt sorry for Michael, having these idiots in my house would have driven me to murder. The end was awful. We should at least be left with the uncertainty of whether he is dead or not.So in the scheme of things Resurrection is fifth best out of eight.

I then found out there were a bunch of sequels, and Saw Jamie-Lee came back in H20, and was in H:R which I saw got terrible reviews, which I found out why after watching the whole franchise, and especially after seeing how H20 ended. This film completely ruins the entire Halloween series. H20 ended the best way ever, and was even better because the main Halloween character (Jamie-Lee Curtis) ended it (at first). I feel like I'm Jamie-Lee from H20 after what happened 20 years ago, she couldn't get the horrible incident of her head. I can't get it out of my head knowing they made something like this unnecessary to keep it going. The remake of the first one should have been the only continuation.

The famous villain would come back, cause hell, and when you think they'll finally put an end to it, they choose to hint at the end that ""It isn't over yet."" 24 years after the reign of terror began, they chose to keep the legend alive.Don't let Michael Myers wind up like poor IL' Freddy.

289,powersd-48281,One of the most polarizing of the franchise,5,30 October 2020,"I say it's one of the most polarizing of the franchise for me because there are some others that I have similarly mixed feelings about. Halloween II was an unnecessary albeit mostly good sequel that introduced mythology to the character that they thankfully retconned with the most recent entry of the series. Halloween 4 did well with its source material, but was kind of bland and boring compared to the first two. Halloween H20 was good for its time, but it seemed like more a knock-off of Scream than a sequel to Halloween II. Rob Zombie's Halloween is probably the one I have the most mixed feelings about because of its depiction of the characters mainly. But then there's this. They had some good ideas for a film that was an otherwise bad idea in and of itself, but they were all poorly executed. With the advent of live streaming on the horizon, Resurrection has a neat plot, and it feels disconnected from the rest of the franchise because of its concept and characters, which I don't mind so much at this point. The original series wasn't that great to begin with. The kills are okay, and I like Busta Rhymes even if his widely hated karate skills were a touch ridiculous. It's certainly not a good movie, but it's not as terrible as I want to think it is either. Just a stupid movie that's pretty much harmless.",Halloween - Resurrection

Six teenagers have won a contest, sponsored by Dangertainment, where they must spend Halloween night inside the Myers' residence. They are unaware that the ultimate evil lurks in the house. It is wonderful to hear the theme song, or variations of the John Carpenter theme made popular in 1978, and its always a treat to see Jamie Lee Curtis on the big screen, once again playing Laurie Strode, whose role in this is reduced to nothing but a cameo.

294,5StarFonzie,HALLOWEEN : THE DEATH OF THE SERIES,5,12 July 2002,"I am without a shadow of a doubt, the biggest Halloween fan in Canada, no doubt.  I saw the very first screening off this movie just about 3 hours ago.  I already complained to halloweenmovies about it and now i'm going to do my usual ranting here.  Usually when I see a bad Halloween movie now and then after the original and sequel, I accept it and tell myself, "" It's ok, it could've been worse "".  Well, that line just bit my in my ass! I have never wanted to throw up so much in my life and I can't believe I am saying this as a Halloween fan.  This movie makes a complete mockery of Michael Myers and I would actually pay money to see this movie, the first 10 minutes of it with Jamie Lee Curtis was very very cool for hardcore fans like myself but after that, the movie died with the franchise.  *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* The kids in the movie were making a total mockery of Michael. Smoking from a bong in the Myers' house?  I can't believe they actually taped this frikkin' movie.  Busta Rhymes did not accomplish what LL COOL J did in H20 which was proper humour.  Tyra Banks was in it for a total of 10 minutes.  The 6 kids absolutely sucked.  The whole internet broadcast thing killed this franchise.  Just call it Halloween Online, better than Ressurection.  Now, I am very pleased however at Jamie Lee Curtis departure. It was very cool to leave like that.  I am also not that dissapointed in Rick Rosenthals work at all.  It's not his fault the movie sucked, it was the actors.  I especially liked the camera angle he had and the shot when Laurie Strode was falling in the beginning.  Very emotional.  Brad Loree did an ok job as Michael Myers but for some reason, he did much better in Halloween 2.  I am very dissapointed and sad at the same time.  This movie was obviously made for cash.  Everybody actually had me thinking this was a really good movie by looking at the people who reviewed it before hand when they saw it at the premiere.  Wow, you guys should be locked up like Michael if you think you can give this movie a good rating.  I hate myself for even bashing a Halloween movie.  I give this film */***** just because of the beginning...",Halloween - Resurrection
295,fenstonwinklepickers,Terrible!!!,1,5 October 2009,"This is one of the worst horror films I have seen. Soo predictable. Just another film with a bunch of teenagers getting chased then dying. And why the hell is Busta Rhymes in it? I didn't find this film scary at any moment. I didn't think much of the first Halloween film and I don't know why it got carried on this long and got turned into this garbage. I also don't get why Michael Myers gets hung on a wire and stays alive! If you get hung you die straight away. Also at the end how does he come back to life? They check that he's dead, and then right at the end we see him open his eyes. This film defies logic. The only thing I liked about this film (as with the first one) Is the soundtrack. Its cool. creepy and suspenseful.Stay clear of this film. 1/10",Halloween - Resurrection

297,wormtheace,Top 10 worst movies ever!!!,1,3 September 2008,"On the one hand I'm happy Jamie lee Curtis took the 3 million to do this. It's nice that she got some of the payday. I also like that it took the character Laurie away form the horror that this series became. But on the other hand Laurie should not have died and this piece of crap should never have seen the light of day. The movie starts based on the worst premise ever having had Michael switch places with another person in H20 so he didn't actually die. That doesn't really explain why he would rise up in the back of the ambulance, attack Laurie and be able to stand right up after a car hits him. After that we get a little Laurie vs Michael, Laurie dying, then Michael killing a bunch of college students on a reality show. The performance of the movie is made by Busta Rhyms. He yells things like f*** and motherf***er and it's actually some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. He then Bruce lee battles Michael myers complete with Bruce lee sound effects and ninja kicks.( I am actually being serious this really happens!!) All and all one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I wonder why the director from Halloween II would come back for this. I always felt the second film could stand up almost equal to the first. I'm sure he got a much needed payday. If there was a zero rating I would give it to this movie it should never have been made.It destroys all the good the series had and should be burned and forgotten forever!",Halloween - Resurrection
298,lord_james_2001,Horror? Only if you watched it....,1,2 August 2002,"This was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. To think that the producers, directors, and everyone associated with the ""Halloween"" series would even attempt another movie after H20 boggles the mind. I assumed that the Laurie Strode/Michael Myers conflict was resolved, and that Laurie would get on with her life, which has been put on hold for long enough. The acting - a term I apply VERY loosely - was deplorable. The plot - if there was one - was ridiculous. In the quest to cash in on ""reality entertainment"" which only reminds us that our TV networks don't think that actually hiring writers, producers, directors, and actors is important, this movie ranks down there with ""Fear Factor"" or ""The Real World"".... The ONLY saving grace of this movie was over in the first twenty minutes. To FINALLY bring closure to Laurie Strode's life was a very welcome event. Unless, there will be some Halloween Part 25 where she actually is still alive and simply dreamed up the whole thing.... who knows? Thumb's down.... WAY down.",Halloween - Resurrection

I think that this sequel in the Halloween franchise was the best as it had a different feel to it than any of the other films.SPOILERS!!!! I was disappointed that Jamie Lee Curtis was killed off within the first 15 minutes and Tyra Banks death scene was done off screen which the viewer themself didn't know she had been killed until near the end of the film End Of Spoilers!!!!Anyway the film had an interesting storyline and the acting performances from the leading characters were good but i wonder if they are going to take this series to a different level after all this is Part 8.If they do ever make decide to make a Part 9 then i would be curious to find out which direction they will take the series in. I would give this film 7 out of 10 and say go and see it!,Halloween - Resurrection
301,guse23,"Well, it had some good parts",5,15 July 2002,"The beginning starts with a way too easy way of bringing Michael back, showing a lack of effort. It then concludes with a not bad death scene. Now with this type of beginning you expect something big. You hope to see Michael continue on as he always does to rid the world of his blood line. Does that happen? No. Instead he stalks and murders a group of college students who represent a modern version of both the Breakfast Club and the original Halloween cast. The whole movie has no point and seems to completely give up within the last half hour of the movie. Not too different from Jason X (but not as bad). The lead is likable but they write her as if she has some hidden dark past. As if maybe she's met Michael before or possibly had something traumatic happen to her. But of course nothing comes of it. Now Michael is less PG - 13 returning to his bloody roots as is previous movies (head crushing, head stabbing, etc.) Unfortunately the writer didn't fully understand how to write the character of Myers and ruins it. The movie also continues to ignore pt 4 - 6 but making it more noticeable this time. On the ups the movie is nicely directed and has a good scene of suspense, dealing with the main character and her on-line chum. Letter grade: C + at best.",Halloween - Resurrection
302,ced650,"Bad, even in the concept.",1,30 March 2011,"Concept that is so basically, introducing Michael Myers in the world of reality TV. And the film looks more like a reality TV show has a Halloween episode of the saga.Already started, the writers came saddled with the film trying to explain why and how Myers is still alive (Which is simply to spit on the previous episode, namely H20).Then the concept of the saga, is itself the victim of a spit (as Myers arrives at the beginning of the film indeed his goal, I would not say more, however, on its ""fine"").So why then he returns to Haddonfield? Does he want an autograph by Busta Rhymes? Not at all, the writers have not had to do with Myers, a music lover. Let's go to Busta Rhymes, therefore, is very excited to be part of, but whose performance is not at all enthusiastic. Basically the character of Busta Rhymes is a manufacturer and a fan of Bruce Lee, it is almost the only features of his character, but surely the role of composition in his eyes.Other casting error, with a role which slows the film more than anything else, namely: Ryan Merriman, in the role of Myles, Myles so that at a party disguised as Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction, one of the best ideas of the film, making a nod to Pulp Fiction (because we said to forget what turnip Halloween Resurrection, may have always admired what's masterpiece Pulp Fiction), Small problem Ryan Merriman did not have the charisma of John Travolta.Bruce lee,Pulp Fiction longer a reality TV show .... Forgot the first two, it'smore like the last, a big reality TV show of horror (in every sense),horror and boredom.

303,drloomis311,"Watchable, but nowhere near what it was hyped up to be.",5,15 January 2003,"Michael Myers is back.   Being a huge fan of the Halloween series I couldn't wait to see this one.  I liked it because, hey it was another installment, but overall, I was  disappointed.  I'll tell ya, you like Myers going around building up the body count then you'll enjoy it for what it is. There are some genuinely funny moments with Busta Rhymes and it was good to see Jamie Lee Curtis reprise her role as Laurie. I'll tell you what disappointed me the most,  the ending.  I feel that every good horror movie has to have a good ending.  In case you didn't know, director Rick Rosenthal delayed the movie for almost a whole year because he wanted to re-shoot the ending.  He said that once filming was complete and went into post-production, and idea for a better ending hit him and it was so good that he had to call back cast and crew to redo it.  Upon writing this,  all I can say is, what the hell was he thinking? Ive seen this ending in so many other movies, there was nothing original about it.  Major let down.  I have seen Halloween 6:The Curse of Michael Myers and Ive also seen the unreleased Producer's cut of the movie and Im one of the true believers of the fact that it was better than what was released.

Halloween 4: the Return of Michael Myers is the 4th best. Halloween: the Curse of Michael Myers is the 4th worst. Halloween 3: Season of the Witch is the 3rd worst. Halloween 5 is the 2nd worst. And Halloween: Resurrection is the worst in the series. I don't know why this movie was even made. Michael Myers was decapitated at the end of Halloween H20. The acting was terrible. there wasn't one original death. And since Laurie Strode died at the beginning of this movie, there are none of the original characters remaining other than Michael Myers himself. And there are so many things that could've been better. 1. the title would've made more sense if Laurie had succeeded in killing Michael. Then he really would've resurrected for the rest of the film. 2. They should've kept the original opening with the home video of the Myers family before Michael killed Judith. 3. They should've gotten a better cast. Even Jamie Lee Curtis was bad in this one. This movie is just plain stupid. Anyway, I'll be reviewing the Friday the 13th movies next.

Halloween 8 is an awful movie that is devoided of any orginality or redeeming qualties (Trya Banks is smoking hot, but is little more than an extra with a line or two). Halloween 8 spits on everything that previous movies have worked hard to preserve since John Carpenters genre inventing original, the worst Halloween 8 actually think's it has the goods.H8 had an impressive budget (due to the healthy box office of the last film) but squanders it on actors that add nothing to the movie but prolong their own dismial carrers. Busta Rhymes actually proves a good leading man until becoming undone by his own ego, most of the other actors have tongue firmly pressed in their check and most phone it in. Jamie Lee Curtis deserves special mention as she almost displays hate for her iconic cult character and cant wait to put to the whole franchise in the past.As a fan of the franchise the biggest problem I had was an arrogance to acknowledge previous movies in the series and tries to forge it's own path that leaves Michael Myers holding his dick in his hand.

That would have been great.I thought Halloween 6 was bad. This makes it look like the Godfather. Simply think about this. Someone actually pitched this idea and it worked: Why don't we kill Jamie Lee Curtis 10 minutes in, have Michael Myers come back to his house where Busta Rhymes will be filming a reality internet show. Michael will kill some kids in front of a big internet audience, only for Busta to whip him with some kung fu. Nice. And some fool paid a bunch of money for this to get made.

Luckily I didn't rent this movie and it was on TV on Friday night so my money wasn't wasted on this movie. What I didn't like about this movie was the poor acting on some of the characters, the acting didn't convince me enough, it made me laugh a little. But most of all, I found Bianca Kajlich the actress who played Sara Moyer a weak screamer, she screams most of the time in the movie and every time she screams it just wasn't powerful, it wasn't convincing to me. It was just weak.

310,movieguyangelus,Better than expected,7,12 July 2002,"OK, after much controversy over how much this movie would suck, it turns out that it is far from the worst sequel in the series (That honor still belongs to 6). The film gets off to a great start with an extended cameo from Jamie Lee Curtis facing Michael Myers for the fourth (and final?) time. Watch for several interesting visual references to the early films in the series, especially the last shot of the original. We then return to Haddonfield and the original Myers house where a group of college students are spending the night armed with webcams. Bianca Kajlich is quite good as the new heroine, Sarah, probably the best since Curtis herself....there are quite a few gruesome and memorable deaths, and some entertaining scenes. Perhaps my favorite moment of the film comes where we finally see where Michael spends his time on the other 364 nights of the year. The films only big problem is the casting of Busta Rhymes as the hero...but at least his annoying kung-fu fightin' antics are kept to a minimum until close to the end. I truly came to Halloween: Resurrection ready to hate it, but came out satisfied.

311,happytown79,New gimmicks breathe life into an old franchise,5,12 July 2002,"I've seen all of the ""Halloween"" movies (the ones that count anyway), and I've always had a soft spot for Michael Myers, so I was mildly excited about the thought of a sequel. So I attended a sneak preview of ""Halloween: Resurrection"", and was somewhat pleasantly surprised.(Possible Spoilers Ahead)Jamie Lee Curtis makes a memorable appearance at the beginning of the film (though she doesn't stick around for very long), and from there we are thrust into the movie's main plot. A reality Internet show called Dangertainment has selected 6 teenagers to spend a night in Michael Myers old house, back where all the killings began in the original ""Halloween"", in the hopes of finding some evidence of what might have driven him to murder.It's here that ""Resurrection"" attempts to innovate, and nearly succeeds in making this an excellent little horror movie. Each person in the house wears their own personal camera, which allows for some interesting perspectives particularly when Michael is on the loose and doing what he does best. This brings me to another point in this film's favor. If you saw ""H20"", you saw a toned down version of Michael, he toyed with his victims more than he had in the past. In ""Resurrection"", however, he's all business. He has a job to do and he doesn't waste time doing it.With all of this said, however, ""Resurrection"" becomes just another horror film, falling into some of the tired cliches that we've seen ad nauseam over the past 20+ years. Also, I found the ending to be very weak, certainly nowhere near as powerful as the ending of ""H20"". Also, I wonder if this film signals a sort of passing of the torch from Jamie Lee Curtis to Bianca Kajlich (once you see the film you'll know what I'm talking about). With all of that said, however, ""Resurrection"" manages to be just another run of the mill horror film, although sadly it could have been so much more. 5 out of 10.",Halloween - Resurrection

I have enjoyed every one except the most recent installment, ""Halloween Resurrection."" The ""Halloween,"" movies have always been suspenseful and well scripted and they did not need all the typical blood and gore like so many other horror movies. That's what made ""Halloween,"" different. It had a good story going. I admit the opening sequence with Jaime Lee Curtis was good, as she always is, but the rest of the movie is nothing but a waste of time. The acting is horrible. Michael even gets to chop a head off with his butcher knife. How fake is that? Bascially, it's about a bunch of college kids spending the night inside the famous Myers house trying the find the reasoning behind Michael's madness. Something I thought we had already covered in Halloween 6. But as it turns out, it was all just a set up. The use of all the camera's (an obvious Blair-Witch rip off) is enough to make you want to vomit. This movie is a disgrace to the ""Halloween,"" franchise and to the fans.

314,DaysFan79,Terrible! Garbabe! A disgrace and disappointment to fans!,1,29 October 2004,"When I watched this, I was hoping it was a dream. I wish they would have ended the whole series after H20. The opening sequence with Jaime Lee was fun to watch - she is great in everything she does, we know that, but the rest of it was truly pathetic! Sadly, we no longer have Donald Pleasance who practically kept the films going. Jaime Lee is done with them. So what do we do? We cast a bunch of sorry unknowns who we don't have to pay much, plus a supermodel named Tyra Banks who has only a few lines, plus we put an Oscar worthy rapper (NOT!) in it that loves using the F-word every 2 seconds. The whole idea of using the cameras and a group of stupid, drunk kids at a Halloween party watching the whole thing on a pda/computer screen was so cheesy. And what I enjoyed about the Hallowen films up to this point was that they were cheese-free. The Blair Witch Craze is over - find something fresh guys! And the head chopping scene with the butcher knife was really ridiculous. I loved all the films up to this one. I like the direction they took with H4 and H5. H6 was OK. I hated that they cast another lame unknown in the role of Jaime Lloyd and then killed her off - another dumb idea! Danielle Harris should have been paid what she wanted. Anyway, John Carpenter is probably ashamed and disgusted by what they have done with this series if he watched H8 and I'm sure Donald Pleasance is rolling over in his grave. I hope H9 will be decent, but if they expect to do anything like they did in 8, I will not watch it and the series will be dead. Please let them have a decent plot and some real star-power with decent acting. Whoever came up with the idiotic ideas for this film really needs a hearty slap in the face for stupidity.

I wish filmmakers would learn to leave well enough alone and stop wearing out original ideas. Its the same scenario with the Friday the 13th movies where part one and two are excellent and the rest of the sequels are an insult to fans of the horror genre. Why can't Hollywood come up with fresh ideas instead of messing continually with the classics by remaking them? The Omen has just been remade and the reviews are terrible. The only highlight from what i have read is Mia Farrow's( Rosemary's Baby) performance as one of Damien's nannies. Otherwise its a poor imitation of a great horror film. Halloween Resurrection is inconsistent, poorly acted, predictable,boring,and full of every cliché you can imagine. Jamie Lee Curtis shows up in the first ten minutes of the film and even her gracing the film with her presence can't save it from itself.

Busta Rhymes and Sean Patrick Thomas kick butt and provide us with some comic relief. Ryan Merriman was also good as Miles. The score was brilliantly done by Danny Lux.

There are an abundance of limp thrills and cheap gore sprinkled with some genuine cleverness.  It was great to see Jamie Lee Curtis resurrecting her role as the homicidal maniac's favorite sister, but her part seemed to have been added solely to give credence that the movie is connected to parts 1, 2, and H2O.

321,misterronaldweasley,The sequel that ruined a franchise.,3,4 November 2005,"Say what you want about ""Halloween""s 1-7, while some installments weren't exactly horror classics, they were at least respectable, well-made sequels. The great thing about the ""Halloween"" series was how true to its roots it managed to stay. Every other horror franchise from ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" sold out long before they hit a number 5. Freddy Krueger suddenly became a comedian and Jason did the same routine in every movie with a different cast. The beauty of ""Halloween"" though was that it managed to stay scary and not turn Michael Myers into a joke.This film destroyed all of that.The biggest mistake is in the writing. The main arc of the entire series was Michael and his family. This movie focuses on that part of the story for maybe 15 minutes in the beginning (with Jamie Lee Curtis returning as Michael's unlucky little sibling), then veers so far off course it makes you wonder how a franchise can go down the toilet so quickly. The rest of the movie is just about a bunch of (annoying) college kids running around in a booby-trapped Myers' house with cameras as part of a reality show broadcast on the Web. Of course the kicker is that the REAL Michael Myers has decided to come back to his childhood home, and doesn't exactly like his new guests. We can't blame him.Every character here is stock. There's the goody goody you just know is going to be involved in the final chase scene, the sick perverted boy we all know is going to bite it, etc. They're the same characters from every other bad horror movie ever made. The previous ""Halloween""s at least took pride in having good characters you actually cared about. It meant something when they died. Now all you can do is cheer Michael on as he slashes his way through some of the most annoying characters.The acting isn't nearly up to par, either. I realize this is the 8th film in the series, but who are these people? They can't act their way out of a paper bag, did the casting department just stop trying, or did these people win their roles through a contest or something? I'd like to know. Whenever the characters scream or try to show fear, it's so badly acted you just have to laugh at the comedic value of it all.In fact, at the halfway point of the movie you'll be laughing (or crying possibly) at how easy it is to take a respectable series and drag it through the mud.The only saving grace is Rosenthal's direction and the oddly good cinematography. Rosenthal does his best with the crap script he's been given, I doubt anyone could have improved upon it. And the cinematography is really quite great...the lighting and color of some shots are outstanding for a film of this type and the whole movie is bathed in orange and blue hues. I like it! Good stuff.Unfortunately that can't save this movie.This is basically just ""Friday the 13th"" in a house. Kids come around, masked killer shows up, kills them all of one by one. That's it. This movie alone managed to turn a once clever and meaningful series into a standard run-of-the-mill slasher movie. The main focus of the entire series is gone. Now we get hilariously bad acting, cheesy scares, and nauseating one-liners (the previous installments never resorted to comedy).Busta Rhymes steals the show though, with acting so bad it makes you afraid for all the wrong reasons.Just pretend this franchise ended with the at least respectable ""H20"" and forget this travesty ever happened.R.I.P. ""Halloween""...your ""resurrection"" was also your death. No one will take this series seriously anymore.",Halloween - Resurrection

Rick Rosenthal isn't a terrible director (Halloween II is one of the better sequels) but after watching this, you'd think he were in a coma for 10 years and forgot how to direct.Awful, awful movie, basically no plot whatsoever, contradicts the series even MORE than H20 did (at least that was good), terrible acting, and a disgusting Michael Myers that hopefully will never be seen again.H20 should have been the end, as it was perfect for closing the series quickly and even going back to it's roots (sorta) without any supernatural bull and more suspense than gore. This bastardization of Halloween makes the previous Halloween film look cheap and lazy, while this is really the cheap and lazy one.If I had to choose between Jason X and this, Jason X would be it.

I am going to start with saying that this is one of my least favorite movies of all time. It's not just a terrible movie, it is an insult to all Halloween fans in my opinion. Halloween H20 had an amazing ending and this movie just ruined it. Just the plot of this movie alone is just the worst thing ever. ""Yeah let's just put some found footage stuff into the movie because everyone loves found footage, right?"" No. Found footage is my least favorite genre of all time and i know that i'm not the only one who hates found footage this much. Also some of the acting in the movie is atrocious. And do i even have to talk about Busta Rhymes? I don't really have anything against the guy, but why the hell is he in a Halloween movie? The only good actor in this movie is Jamie Lee Curtis, but she dies on the opening scene of this movie. Not even the kills are good. They don't look good or are anything special or new at all. To be honest, i don't even want to waste my time on this.

The only reason you may even think about watching this is if you want to say you've seen all of the Halloween movies, which I understand but lucky for you 95% of the population has forgotten this movie even exist so you can already say that. It's not scary or suspenseful in any form or fashion and the characters are just annoying objects that are there only to be killed. Busta Rhymes takes out Michael Myers with karate, do I need to say more. Every aspect about this movie is just bad and it's one of those rare movies where I can't find one redeemable quality in it. I'm very lenient on horror movies and I usually give them higher ratings than others as it's my favorite genre, but this is actually one of the worst movies I've seen.

326,Eugangus,I want my money back!,1,21 July 2002,"Ouch! This turkey has to be the worst entry in the seemingly endless Halloween film series.I don't even know where to begin. Aside from a few creepy moments in the beginning of the film, I can't write anything kind about it.
The characters were annoying and completely unlikeable. The writers appeared to go out of their way to make them so unappealing, that the audience can't help but root for the psychotic killer. Note to the writers of future installments: If you allow the viewers to care about the protagonists, the next sequel may regain some of the tension and suspense that made the first movie a classic.The direction was awful. A good portion of the film is seen through ""state-of-the-art"" camera equipment mounted on the heads of our witless heroes. The image quality of these cameras is terrible and the actors jerk around so much it's often impossible to tell what's going on.
A horror film doesn't have to be gory to be frightening (i.e. ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Blair Witch Project,"" etc.). But when you're making a slasher film, the fans expect to the special effects make-up artists to pile on the blood and guts. Fans of classic slasher films like the original ""Halloween"", ""The Burning"", and ""Friday the 13th"" will be disappointed. There's hardly any gore in this crap-fest. Most the special effects shots are destroyed by poor lighting and/or shoddy camera work.Horror films, in general, have been in a state of decline since the early 1990's. But the slasher film sub-genre died in the mid-1980's, when the MPAA finally squeezed most of the gore out of them. ""Halloween: Resurrection"" does nothing to bring it back from the dead.",Halloween - Resurrection
327,charredwind,Absolute garbage.,1,21 October 2019,"I will admit that going into this movie I was quite apprehensive. I knew that Michael didn't die at the end of H20, which angered me slightly- H20 would be quite a good way to send the series off, Laurie finally getting her revenge. But the audience wanted more, so they brought him back once again.
So now Michael's died four times (2, 4, 6, 7), and they've brought him back every one. It's getting quite old and removes the surprise.
But anyway, onto the movie proper.
Halloween: Resurrection has no reason to exist. It is a cash grab, plain and simple.
Even at its worst (6), Halloween has never stooped this low.
My main problem with the film is its characters. Out of the six teens, only the main three are even remotely fun to watch- and at that, only Rudy and Sara I would consider ""well-written"". Of the others, Jim is a disgusting  that I hated every second of watching- it's not pleasant to watch a guy try to use his camera to film a girl's but once, let alone every five minutes. Donna seems to take a liking to him for some reason that I'll never understand. I can't even remember the name of the other guy that was with them despite just watching the movie last night.Busta Rhymes beats up Michael Myers with kung fu. Enough said on that.The premise of the movie is also weak. When I imagine Michael Myers, I never imagine him having anything to do with electronics or heaven forbid livestreaming. He should know nothing but to kill.Some may question my rating being so low, but I cannot think of a reason why anyone should watch this movie. End it at H20. 1/10.",Halloween - Resurrection
328,moviedemon,Michael Myers should kill Moustapha Akkad,3,14 July 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I have seen H8 and I must say ""Poor John Carpenter"".As many know, Carpenter will rarely divulge into a conversation about the sequels that followed Halloween.While being interviewed by John Stewart, for plugging Ghosts of Mars, Carpenter shrugged off the question of the numerous sequels that followed Halloween.Also, all the DVDs that are released of John Carpenter films, they have audio commentary - except Halloween. Not to mention that Carpenter turned down an offer to direct H20 because he felt that there was no reason to re-visit the film ... again.And with H8, I understand his apparent bitterness and annoyance with the many of the sequels that followed Halloween III.Halloween: Resurrection is a disgrace to Carpenter's 1978 classic. The film ignorantly (SPOILER ALERT)kill off Laurie Strode in such a non-suspenseful, quick fashion. But yet Busta Ryhmes schools Myers in a good ass whooping. Not to mention the film has no sense of - nor no attempt of - character development. You know absolutely nothing about their characters. Nothing. They are just there to be cannon fodder. H20 which took place in California, Myers and Laurie are back in Haddonfield (?)... which also inexplicably has it's own college university(!). The film also had no respect of Michael Myers, as Busta Ryhmes shoves a electrical wire into Myers' crotch. I won't even mention the film's loopy logic like the indestructible behavior by Michael (consider that this film picks up from H20 - which ignored all sequels after Part II), or characters who are strapped with cameras (with a worldwide web looking on) partake in sexual activities and smoking a bong. I know ""it's only a movie"". But why insult the viewer by trying to rationalize the film's incoherence.
(END OF SPOILER)I am ashamed that Myers character is so poorly handled and that this cash cow is having its udders bruised. It's a shame that for those who complain of the stupidity of horror films, fans can not argue with such films like H8. It is simply idiotic. Apparently, even the studio thought nothing of this film because they did not allow a screening for critics. Logically handled because the studio don't want horrible reviews to affect potential box office grosses. The critics will have to pay to see the film like everyone else and will feature their review in Monday's paper. By then it's too late and H8 has already had a successful weekend. Take in mind that all of the prior Halloween films, NOES films and Jason films (yes, even JASON X) had a screening for critics. The studio obviously smelled a stinker with this one - which also explains a 1900 theater release as opposed to H20's 2600 theater count. And it's all deserved. H8 is a stinker - by far one of the worst sequels in the series. But those who like gore instead of a cohesive storyline and any sense of character development will enjoy it. Others beware. H8 is not awful, but it's not good either.And who do I blame ... yes, Moustapha Akkad who has apparently gone to the well once to often.And I also blame Kevin Williamson for rejuvinating the series with the ultra successful H20. He should've just not have made the film. Now, Akkad has a few more movies to rinse out of H20s success. It's a shame. Poor Carpenter. A great classic is being dragged through the mud. 3/10 or *1/2 out of 4 or D+. However, you rate it - it's just not good.",Halloween - Resurrection

This one isn't nearly as good as the original, but it's done very well and effectively. It's suspenseful enough and the premise is interesting. However, I must admit that I preferred L.L. Cool J. in H20 over Busta Rhymes in this one, but that's not too problematic. Aside from Busta Rhymes, I liked the people in the movie, and the characters were fun. There were a few jarring moment, but those weren't that bad. Anyways, this one is a good movie and a fine addition to the Halloween legacy. 8/10",Halloween - Resurrection
330,jockk407,"Sadly, Michael should have stayed headless",3,12 July 2002,"I suppose the explanation for how Michael could have survived his beheading in H20 is passable, and the final showdown of Jamie Lee Curtis and her homicidal brother that opens the new film is indeed quite strong, shocking, and oddly moving.  Unfortunately, once the new story gets underway 20 minutes into the film, director Rick Rosenthal can't build suspense thanks to the choppy, annoying ""reality TV"" approach that owes more to Blair Witch 2 than Halloween. Worse, aside from Jamie Lee Curtis, the film is poorly cast, with Busta Rhymes giving an embarrassingly unfunny and stereotypical performance as the ringleader that brings all of his scenes to a screaming halt. The rest of the cast isn't really bad, just knife-fodder, though admittedly they haven't been given characters to play.
Though Rosenthal can't build much suspense and proves, as he did in Halloween II, that he doesn't know how to time his shocks, he does create some creepy atmosphere and a couple of scenes toward the end do build some excitement.  The film is admittedly clever in spots, and mostly entertaining, though it never comes close to topping the opening sequence with Jamie Lee, and even as films in this genre go, it's mostly just unnecessary.It isn't the worst of the series (that honor goes to Curse of Michael), and I wouldn't say it was a really bad film (I WAS entertained)...but it's not much of a compliment when the first thing you can think of as the end credits are rolling is, well, at least it was better than Jason X.",Halloween - Resurrection

The story is so horrendous, so boring and half assed, that you just tend to forget it afterwards. Nothing matters in this movie. It's just a cluster of scenes in between Michael slashing everybody in sight.
The opening scene shows Jamie Lee Curtis locked up in a mental hospital. She's sitting there with a blank and terrified expression on her face and tears are coming down her cheeks. They must've found a footage of the actress right after reading the script and realising that she's contractually bound to star in this pile of crap. She checked out pretty quickly and so does the viewer. I doesn't get any better.

333,kga58,Michael Myers on Fear Factor,4,12 November 2005,"This movie is a good time waster, no more. The first mistake was the ridiculous explanation of how Michael is STILL alive, but OK I'll go with it. The next and for me unforgivable mistake is killing off Jamie Lee Curtis' character of Laurie Strode. She is as much to credit with the success of the HALLOWEEN series as is Michael if not more so. Her presence in the lead role in H20 lifted that film above mediocre status. To kill her off in the first 10 minutes was inexcusable. She is the only one who can properly end the series hopefully with an assist from son John. Of course she IS the sister of the unkillable one. Maybe it runs in the family? The casting of Busta Rhymes is yet another screw up. He is nothing but irritating and his constant stream of M.F.s is tiresome and offensive. This is good dialogue?! They throw in a girl whose emotional extremes make things go haywire in the auditions, then do nothing with it. That at least could have been something different, but maybe they were afraid it would look like a ripoff of F13TH THE NEW BLOOD'S Tina. On the plus side it was good to see a reasonable facsimile of the Myers'house, not the more traditionally haunted house looking one used in H4 and H5. They got that right. What made the house frightening was its ordinariness. Also it was funny when the real Michael came mask to mask with the pretend Michael. A little more should have been done with that for comic relief. A time waster--nothing more.",Halloween - Resurrection

From the absurd retcon of ""oh by the way it wasn't Michael Meyers whos head was lopped off by the series protagonist, (who is unceremoniously killed within the first 15 minutes) it was a guard"". The old switcheroo, mixed with extremely contrived, plot driven scenes, Busta Rhymes inexplicably being in it, apparently as an adept knife wielder (who is killed in an uproariously absurd way after ""fighting"" Meyers, all come together to make a great comedy.It hits every trope and cliche while still finding a way to convolute the plot, be unoriginal, and fail to create any interesting characters.But, as I said, this movie should be held in high esteem for it's comedic edge.

It was after Michel Myers fell down with a lot of knife stabbings, Michael putted the mask on someone else. Someone who flew out of a car window, got hated by the van and then squeezed between the van and a tree. And he survived. But only Michael Myers would survive that! What a terrible excuse to make another sequel. And all this happened in the intro. Jamie Lee Curtis accepted the movie just to make sure that she wouldn't appear in any other sequel. Why didn't she just reject every other sequel, and live happily ever after? We were all so happy when she survived in H20, but she just had to die in this movie! I got very angry!

Sad to see they killed Curtis's character off because the movie may have had hope if they kept her alive until the end. Without Curtis or Donald Pleasence this movie is an outright dud. These two characters are what make the Halloween franchise viable. Without them it is just a C-grade slasher flick with no purpose or direction.,Halloween - Resurrection
338,poppa_pump2,What a pile of feces,1,28 January 2003,"I had resisted the temptation to see Halloween: Resurrection at the theaters, and it turned out to be a wise decision. Better to waste $2 on the rental than $9 at the show. This is quite possibly the worst of the lot, and that says a lot considering how bad the last 4 of these movies have been. This film makes Season of the Witch seem like a cinematic masterpiece. The first 16 minutes of this clunker serve as a sort of prologue. In this part we see Jamie Lee, again proving why she is among (if not THE) worst actresses ever. The premise in which we discover why Michael still lives is laughable...come on, watch the paramedic walking around an accident scene while brandishing a large knife and tell me you didn't laugh at it. I'm guessing her appearance semi-served to identify this movie with the rest of the series, to ""validate"" it if you will. All it did was bore me.Then we get to the main premise which is actually something that showed promise: put some people in the Meyer's house on Halloween and do a webcast. But right away we get your generic ensemble of victims thrust upon us, and you find yourself not caring about them a bit. Why? Partly because you know nothing about them. Upon viewing the deleted scenes you see an extended version of the scene where they're all introduced, but as the director explains he felt it was too long and that he could more effectively introduce them with the scene used in the movie. He was wrong. The deleted scene, while a bit draggy (could've been streamlined though), actually was much better than what made the final cut. You end up not being able to get a clear feel for anyone in this film, and you honestly could care less what happens to them. Yes its a horror film, but some type of character development/introduction is still necessary for the film to work. Another shortcoming was the reasoning for them being in the house. I think it would have been suitable for them to be there as a publicity stunt, to put them in a scary place and see if they ""survive"" the webcast. Instead we're told that they're in there to ""find the truth, to find answers"" of why Mikey went bad. Bah. Anyway, the movie has its generic kills and a really uninspired ending.The whole concept of what Michael Meyers is/was (and why) has been misused, abused, and generally distorted. This movie, like most of the sequels, has no style and no sense of what the franchise should be. Its easily among the worst movies I've ever seen, a list that includes H2O as well.

Some lines were intended to produce laughs from the audience, however, many were not but came up with the same result.  The plot has been done before, not in the Halloween series, but through countless other movies and TV Shows... try Blair Witch Project, Big Brother, and MTV's Fear (Fear was probably ripped off the most in this movie, it was almost a replica of the show) all mixed together. Although the movie has its frightening moments, such as sudden appearances by Michael Meyers or dead bodies, knifes, etc, showing up on the screen and scaring the characters, the overall fright factor is next to zero.I would definitely not waste my 9 bucks on this movie, if you long to see it that bad, try to constrain yourself until its out on video... trust me, you'll be glad you did.",Halloween - Resurrection
340,jack-frost,Decent movie but very bad idea,7,31 October 2002,"HALLOWEEN: H20 was the best ending that could ever reach the screen without John CARPENTER on board and after the great Donald PLEASENCE's disappearence. Although it was a great movie,it lacked Donald PLEASANCE's presence (who is to me more essential to the series than Jamie Lee Curtis) but he wasn't forgotten as the opening credit was a moving tribute to his character. Without LOOMIS, the series had to end and Laurie was the only character that could finish the doctor's job: killing MYERS. I thought the producers had a wise idea that respected the memory and work of the greatest actor of all times. But now comes HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION that wants to bring the series in a new era and gets rid of Laurie: bad idea as HALLOWEEN films were so great because Michael MYERS always came with at least one of these two strong nemesis that could preserve all the interest when the killer wasn't not on the screen and enhanced his impact.RESURRECTION falls into two different movies: an opening sequence for true HALLOWEEN fans and the rest of the movie that represents a new beginning.This opening sequence finds the spirit of the previous movies and is made as a farewell to an entire age and maybe an entire bunch of fans too: those who, like me, believe that Michael MYERS' nothing without Laurie or LOOMIS.This sequence was both moving and a bit annoying as it ruined H20's great final scene. And now starts the ""new"" HALLOWEEN...When you watch the rest of the film, it confirms how essential Donald Pleasence and Jamie LEE CURTIS were and the mistake the producers have made by deciding to continue the series without them. Take the first movie for example: LOOMIS' dialogues presented MYERS has pure evil and were so effectively performed that they gave a new supernatural dimension to the killer, enhancing the audience's fear. Now we only have silly dialogues and neverending explorations of the empty rooms: quite boring. The attempts to create the suspense of the previous movies are all failures and you wait for MYERS to show up and chop all these hollow characters.Hopefully, anytime he's on the screen, it's obvious that Michael MYERS hasn't lost his power of fascination: he's threatening, brutal, scary, invincible and save the last part of the movie. After JASON X, RESURRECTION is another proof that the 90s haven't created any slasher icons: killers from SCREAM or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER never have JASON or Michael MYERS'charism and are bound to oblivion through the ages. Here, Brad LOREE delivers a great performance.The last 30 minutes are pretty nervous and show a few interesting ideas that, if better exploited,could have bred real and original suspense, for example the fact that Sara's informed of Myers' position in the house with her electronic agenda. This final part saves the movie by compensating for the lack of scares by a breath-taking pace and intensity: you finally leave the theater on a positive feeling. Of course there are still a few bad points: Busta RHYMES' Bruce LEE-like screams in the kung fu sequences are a bit ridiculous and so are his one liners, especially after Jamie Lee CURTIS' last words in front of MYERS. Also, the way they get rid of MYERS seems a bit easy for an invincible killer. And there's also something quite shameful: they have chosen to ignore part 4,5 and 6 but they don't hesitate to copy entire scenes from those movies. There's a HALLOWEEN 4-like roof sequence and a murder that really reminded me HALLOWEEN 6.As a conclusion, I will say that even if I was pleased to see Michael MYERS again and there was excellent opening and an entertaining last section, this movie should never have been made. Myers is a fascinating character but can't support a movie on it's own. Next chapters will always lack LOOMIS and Laurie and will only be interesting when the Shape's on the screen:just like this one. Furthermore, I insist on the fact that such a legend could only die from his two nemesis' hands, it will now be impossible to have an ending that equals H20. In this movie, we have Laurie's last stand and Donald PLEASENCE is totally forgotten (what a lack of respect for such an actor and for all he has brought to the series!): HALLOWEEN enters a new era, but I won't follow him there. For me,Michael MYERS died in H20, the only possible ending of a great series.",Halloween - Resurrection
341,Pitchforkdisney,How to kill a serial killer...,4,27 October 2002,"Apparently the new way to kill a movie serial killer is to get some dodgy rap artist (in this case Busta Rhymes) to add some tension destroying quips and then perform some karate on the b****rd. But this is Michael Myers for gods sake...he's a movie legend. Come on, out of all the 70's generation slasher movies Halloween was the first and most powerful, mostly because of how *serious* Myres was about going about his business - he was the freaking BOOGYMAN! Resurrection follows on from the O.K.ish H20 (which managed to totally forget the other 4 sequels to the franchise after Halloween 2 (not forgetting the Michael-less III)) with a diabolical opening scene starring Jamie Lee Curtis. She gets the hell out of dodge and things go downhill rapidly. The excellent John Carpenter score is used in a completely cursory way once again - no one seems to understand how exactly it managed to add to the awesome tension in the first films closing sequence.Look, basically, it's a waste of a great movie serial killer legend. At the age of 14 Halloween scared the hell out of me, since then most Halloween movies (good, average or bad) have still chilled me when that blank masked freak hits the screen - Resurrection left me bored and oh so disappointed.

Rick Rosenthal, who directed a flawed but decent ""Halloween II"" in 1981, doesn't seem to have a grasp on what makes a horror movie work. Though I liked the camera effects used in this (FINALLY, Michael Myers is walking in slow-motion), I felt that the characters were poorly written (almost to an extreme) and the character of Freddie Harris played by rapper Busta Rhymes was particularly annoying.The ending, while predictable, made me laugh because it almost fooled me into thinking that he would NOT open his eyes. How lame of me!",Halloween - Resurrection

People who cant sleep you no longer have to count sheep you just have to pop Halloween resserection in the DVD player. Halloween is easily one of the best slasher movies ever made. I liked the second too, but the third I hated and I was so angry because I thought Halloween was ruined. When I watched 4 I was happy again, but this one has put me back in that place of pure disappointment. Hopefully the one coming next year will be better. When they bring the new one out, they better make it the last one. Micheal myers should be remembered as a legend, not a dork. Happy Halloween (not this one!)",Halloween - Resurrection
346,ajs2004,Surprisingly Creative,7,12 July 2002,"I was surprised at how good the movie really was.  Though there was one plot point that I found sad and depressing.  Other than that it was the best since the first two.  There was a excellent creepy atmosphere to the film. The camera work was the best since the first two.  Michael was played really well by Brad Loree.  I would say his performance was the second best behind Nick Castle's chillingly effective performance in the original. The was a nice build up to the carnage with scenes where Michael stalked and teased but did not kill.  And when the killing started Michael was both creative and traditional.  Busta Ryhmes brought a charm to film with his character that was refreshing.  The plot of the film was original and not just someone killing people.  The plot had a modern twist to it that brought suspense and excitement; something that has been missing from the series since Halloween 5.  Rick Rosenthal did a wonderful job with this film and it was just as good as Halloween II.  Which was also directed by Rick Rosenthal.  The acting was bad either.  I mean the acting was not amazing but it was just the right kind of acting that film needed for it to be effective. Overall, this installment in the enormously successful franchise is creative, suspenseful, exciting, fresh, fun, and most importantly scary.  Even if your not a fan of the series or only saw the first two or just the first one GO SEE IT!! You'll have a great time.",Halloween - Resurrection

It was gory, it was suspenseful, it was funny at times and when you leave the theater you had a good time.This movie was probably one of the most original of all the sequels, it's originality alone made me enjoy  the film a great deal, however the most enjoyable part of the film was Busta Rymes.. Just seeing him Fight Mike Meyers Wu Style was one of the most entertaining fight sequences ever. Also the fact that he said Mutha F**ka about 36 times made his character all the more enjoyable.This is definatly the first horror movie I may consider going to see again in the theater. The only bad part of the film is the way Jamie Lee Curtis met her fate, there should have been a lot more to it as she is what made the first two films  and H2O the gems that they are.I reccomend this film to any fan of Slasher movies",Halloween - Resurrection

350,Quincey_P_Morris,Disloyal,5,13 July 2002,"***WARNING: SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN***I consider myself a die-hard fan of the Halloween series. The original is my second favorite film of all time and I own multiple copies of all the sequels.This particular installment was just atrocious. Being twenty-one, I really didn't expect this film to be scary, but I was really upset to see that it was trying to be funny. What has happened to Michael Myers? He used to be such a remarkable villain with all his subtlety and sparse appearances on the screen. In this film however he is constantly in front of the camera (both the actual and the Internet ones) skulking around the house, giving his knife to some human serial killer encyclopedia, backing off from a berating rapper, to name just a few of his unorthodox acts.I like most people, thought the first 15 minutes were relatively decent (except that bozo in the clown mask) as they put the puzzle pieces together pretty well (although that paramedic seemed to have some immortal qualities of his own), but from that point on, the film went straight downhill like an alpine ski course.Rick Rosenthal just didn't seem to be taking the film seriously at all. The serious and somber tone of the previous films was what used to set the Halloween series apart from the other horror franchises. I'm afraid that Halloween may be going the way of Jason X or even the dreaded Leprechaun series. I mean Busta Rhymes doing some kind of crazy Kung Fu on Myers? How do these people sleep at night? This one was full of uninteresting annoying characters that you didn't know much of anything about and couldn't have cared less what happened to them, and even the kills themselves were tremendously bland and unoriginal. Some of these deaths appeared to be homages to deaths in the previous films, but they just didn't work as well.Also, where were the traditional scenes of the Halloween series? There was next to no reference to the name Haddonfield save for a sign on the Haddonfield University lawn, no black screen with text notifying the date and town, the classic score was mutilated once again, and hardly  enough references to Autumn and the Halloween holiday itself. There was also zero interaction with Michael Myers and the local law enforcement. That for me was always one of the coolest aspects of Halloween, Michael Myers making mince meat of Haddonfield police officers. They are just more of a formidable stumbling block to Myers than a bunch of extremely inept teenagers.All in all, a very forgettable sequel. Hopefully next time whoever is in charge might have had some kind of passion for the series like a lot of us fans and turn out something which creatively emulates the original, but does not branch off into this nonsense. This is all just my opinion, however, I'm sure a newcomer to the series would probably enjoy it. I remember for the longest time I thought the fourth one was the best of them all, until I finally saw the original and realized it's genius.",Halloween - Resurrection

Wow, that is so depressing. I'm surprised no one who was involved with this movie needed therapy afterwards. And was another sequel even necessary?

And it has some familiar faces: Tyra Banks, Busta Rhymes, and Sean William Scott and I can't believe they have this many African Americans in a horror film. Plus I also liked the girl I think looked like Gwen Stefani. I was happy to see Jamie Lee again, she's always good. And I was absolutely shocked at the beginning, I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it. The only thing I disliked was the guy who played Michael Meyers, he wasn't too good.

THE END!BUT NO! H20 made a lot of money and the studio wanted a sequel. But they killed Michael Myers. ""I know we'll bring him back in some insane way that makes no sense call it Halloween Resurrection."" 'Resurrection' one of the most bland and overused sequel titles of all time. Are you kidding me.And you know what? Mabye I could forgive them for ruining the ending of H20 if the movie was actually any good, but it isn't as the story makes no sense, they decided to make it a found footage movie(which could have been good if it wasn't done completely carelessly), Michael Myers Looks like he is wearing eyeliner and his hair is puffed up like an afro,they kill an important character in the first 15min, Busta Rhymes is in this movie and roundhouse kicks one of the scariest movie villains of all time out a window like a cartoon character and worst of all it isn't scary.

361,UncleCreep,Michael is Back! A spoiler free review!,10,12 July 2002,"Ok here is a sequel with peaks & valleys, but I am HAPPY to say many, many, MANY more peaks! There are quite a few high points in this film, and it does a helluva lot right! Let's start off with the good stuff-Michael himself: 1st off- The mask is awesome, & that is OH SO important to me! (you can imagine my dislike for the mask in part 5 UGH) 2nd- Brad Loree. I've read in the latest FANGO that he watched all the Halloween movies to prepare for his role as The Shape and good god does it show! My hat is off to him! He was amazing! DEAD ON! He delivered perhaps the best Michael in 20 some odd years. Brutal. Machine like. Unstoppable. This man did his homework. Thank you Mr. Loree, you have ALL of my respect! Michael's @ his ""head tilting, admiring his handiwork, hiding in the shadows"" best!Jamie Lee Curtis: She is wonderful! Her + Myers = Magic! No question! The onscreen time that they share together, (even though its not very long) ignites the screen. Memorable to say the least!
The Music: I want to personally thank whomever was responsible for the decision to use not just the main theme, but to use almost ALL of the original music! It's just about all there & sounding better than ever!Rick Rosenthal: He brought all of his tricks with him from part 2. There's is NO question in my mind. This man knows how to do Halloween. Some really smart camera work & GREAT usage of the internet theme (something I was REALLY worried about btw) makes for a VERY entertaining bit of film making! The last half an hour of the film is fast paced & as intense as you could possibly get. Great job Mr. R! Please continue your work in the genre!The Killings: Brutal, bloody, fast & furious! ""The Rage"" Michael has inside of him has NEVER been more apparent. The blood flows freely but is in no way overdone.The Opening Scene: For a little over a minute long opening sequence it manages to somehow tie the series together in a very pretty package. Again, great stuff from Rosenthal.
Now the not so good-Busta Rhymes: While for the most part he pulls it off, there are some lines that he flubs horribly, & his fighting scenes with Michael came off kind of Goofy at times. This is due to him making these kind of mock Bruce Lee fighting screams during the fight. Although i'll say this, Michaels reaction to Busta's posturing is priceless! The two also share one of the most memorable scenes in the entire series together.
The storyline: The Laurie Strode stuff aside, this is without question one of the weakest plots of all of the Halloween films. Yet, IMO it's still way better than the silliness of parts 5 & 6. I never dug the whole Michael is the enforcer of some druid cult thing. The makers of those movies went out of their way to explain why Michael was evil. Why he was evil never mattered to me. I like it better just having him as a killing machine without the backstory. As I stated before Michael is back in TOP FORM!The script: Some lines in this movie are PAINFUL! I needn't quote any, you'll hear them for yourself!All in all, a worthy entry in the series & easily one of the best sequels to date. Halloween fans will not be disappointed by this one, although i'm certain some will find alot more things wrong with it than I have. You can't please everyone. Once again, Michael has come home. More vicious than ever. I'm putting out the Welcome Mat & running for my life!",Halloween - Resurrection
362,Gibb86,This movie kicks ASS!!!!!!!!,4,18 July 2002,"I love Halloween Resurrection!!!!!!! It's so awesome. I really thought it was going to be like the other Halloween 3-6 and before H20, but it really is a scary, interesting movie. Sure some of the deaths are kind of gross and nasty but it made me want to yell ""GET OUT OF THE YOU MORON"" or ""DON'T DO THAT"" and ""OH THEY'RE GONNA DIE"". I said a couple of those during the film, but I also scream a lot too. The scene with the guy in the clown mask scared the crap out of me, and Jamie Lee Curtis in her that's it your going down act was awesome. She played a crazy person quite well and Bianca Kajlich; even though I've never heard of her she's a really cool scream queen. One thing I wish they had answered was. Why is Michael like that? They sent 6 people in his house to answer that question but they never did. Oh well I can wait for the next one. I hope there'll be a next one it needs to live on. I was introduced to the Halloween series through one of the 3-6 ones but I wanted to know the origin of it, now I can't get enough of it. So I think the teens of my generation who are into this genre would like this series. I know lots of teens that like these kinds of series like Jason, Freddy, and others but Michael Myers is the one who scared me the most, it's the white face with the dark eyes. I would absolutely recommend this movie. It kicks Ass!!!!!!",Halloween - Resurrection
363,the chef,weak,5,12 July 2002,"*mild spoilers*They're really beating a dead horse with this series.  I'm a huge Halloween fan, and I don't remember ever expecting so much from a movie and getting so little.  I liked H20 a lot, and I thought it provided a very satisfying and logical conclusion to the series.  So when we're told right away that it wasn't really Michael who was beheaded at the end of H20 (it was, uh, a paramedic with the exact same size and build as Michael who swapped clothes with him, and apparently couldn't tell anyone because his voice box was crushed), I was left hoping against hope that the movie itself wasn't going to be as convoluted and stupid as its setup.Of course, it was.  The characters are all strictly cookie-cutter, with the majority of lines being completely gratuitous sound bytes (more on this later).  There are several stupid and obvious references to the first movie (e.g. bedroom closet door being smashed from the outside as girl cowers inside, MM pinning guy to kitchen wall with knives, MM sitting up creepily in the background as the camera focuses on the foreground), which only shows a lack of creativeness on the part of the filmmakers.  Perhaps worst of all, virtually all of the killings are unimaginative, garden-variety stabbings/impalings that we've seen hundreds of times in hundreds of better movies.  The other weak Halloween sequels could at least innovatively satisfy a general desire for gore.  Next, although I don't know a great deal about filmmaking, I could see some poor editing going on here.  At one point we're shown Michael lurking in the shadows, and the tip of his knife is stained with blood.  This is before Michael has used the knife on anybody (the knife he uses in the beginning of the movie is clearly disposed of). Really not good.  Finally, I don't know what other people thought of this, but I thought the concept of the movie was pretty condescending.  I can completely imagine someone saying ""Hey, since everyone's using the internet now, we'll tack this 'webcam' twist onto this classic horror series, and everyone will think it's really modern and edgy and want to see it!""  This is augmented by a lot of really stupid and unnecessary technological references and gimmicks (communicating on the palmpilot, etc.).  I could be overreacting here, but the whole attempt to ""adapt the Halloween series to fit the 21st century"" strikes me as really ill-conceived.
Last thing: I don't understand the impetus to keep casting rappers in action/horror movies.  Save one funny scene where he dresses up as MM and rants, watching Busta Rhymes was painful.  The talent he showed in Finding Forrester was drowned completely in an atrocious script.  Choice lines of his include: As Michael apparently gets his in the end, Busta shouts ""Happy Halloween, Mikey!"" (or maybe it was ""Happy Halloween, MOTHA****A!""... I can't remember exactly) in the most dramatic voice possible. Then, in an apparent attempt by the writers to lend ""street cred"" to the movie, Busta exclaims ""Damn!  That looks like some fried chicken-ass shit!"" or something like that upon seeing MM's body.  I'm reminded of LL Cool J in Deep Blue Sea or to a lesser extent Dr. Dre in Training Day.  These guys aren't bad actors, they're just getting stuck with terrible lines that the writers think are ""cool.""Anyway, please skip this movie whether you're a series fan or not, as it degrades all of the good Halloween movies that have been made.  It's very disheartening that instead of ending the series on a high note and preserving its reputation among horror movies, it was decided to milk the formula for more money.  We can only hope there's no Halloween 9, although this movie appropriately ends on the biggest unkillable-monster horror movie cliche of all time, leaving us dreading what they're going to come up with next to mangle this once-great idea.

There's nothing scary about this movie at all. I'd still like to know why Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks of all people was cast in this film. There's no suspense to Michael. Going back to Busta Rhymes, his cheap ""karate"" skills reminds me of the Batman series that starred Adam West. College students are watching 6 students get killed and they think it's all part of the show. The ***only*** decent kill in this monstrosity was Busta Rhymes character and it was meh at best.

From now on, I will ignore any instinct like the one I had tonight.  I knew something good was happening when the first show we went to see was actually ""sold out"".  We ended up having to catch the latest possible showing of this movie, and hey, better late then never!This was the greatest Halloween movie since the first one.  They should have just skipped over the travesty that was Halloween 2-7 and just jumped to this one.  This movie had everthing that was missing from the other ones. It went back to the old days when horror movies were actually about scaring the hell out of people.  There hasn't been a movie that has been able to actually make me jump out of my seat and scream since Friday the 13th, which I saw 10 years ago at the ripe age of 9.  Yes, the plot is a little worn out...spending the night in Micheal's abandoned house, Micheal's there, blah, blah, blah.  But honestly, when was the last time a truly original plot has been seen in movies, be it action, drama, comedy, etc?  The one thing that this movie had that previous horror movies didn't was smartness, and of course, great jump out of your seat and scream scenes.  (The one that got my friends was the flashback in the beginning).  It also had some pretty funny scenes too.  (My favorite, along with everyone in the theater was the whole ""Micheal meets Micheal in the hallway"" scene :0D)  All in all, without giving away the plot, this movie is excellent and you should go see it riiiiiiiiight now :)",Halloween - Resurrection
368,soerenft,No no no no no,1,20 June 2008,"With one single stroke, namely 'Halloween Resurrection', the entire Halloween franchise has lost all credibility. Even low budget horror films should have standards, and this film is so bad, it makes some of the worst 'Friday the 13th' movies look good. John Carpenter's original film is rightly considered a classic, and one of the most influential films in the genre. The sequels have been a very mixed bag, but I never thought it would get this bad. Other reviewers have commented on the fact that this movie is atrociously poorly made, so I won't repeat these charges, except to add that the musical score by Danny Lux is like everything else about this film: way below standard. My main gripe is really this: To me the 'heart' of the Halloween series was always the character of Laurie Strode, played wonderfully by Jamie Lee Curtis. The fact that they chose to dispose of her in such a casual way within the first 15 mins. of the film does simply not ring true with the continuity of the original storyline of 'Halloween', 'Halloween 2' and 'Halloween H20'. Not only is the proposed explanation of how Michael Myers survived his decapitation in H20 completely unbelievable, even for a film in this genre, but the way Laurie Strode meets her doom is utterly ridiculous and beyond 'suspension of disbelief' if you consider the way the character developed through the previous films. I can't understand why Jamie Lee Curtis would ever accept having Laurie Strode written out of the Halloween series as if she were a character in a day-time soap opera, but maybe she just finally wanted out of the franchise. In sum, any fan of the original 'Halloween' film should feel offended by the low quality offered us in 'Halloween Resurrection': The movie is so bad that I consider it an insult to the audience.",Halloween - Resurrection

Like many horror films, it has blood, guts, a psycho killer who won't die, and his victims stupidly running upstairs, into corners, and separating themselves.  On the upside, Busta Rhymes has a great comedic performance as the webcast's producer, the plot flows smoothly, and at least 75% of the hour and a half film was filled with action and suspense, which keeps the audience entertained.  I haven't seen any of the other Halloween movies, so I can't compare it to them, but if you like the typical horror film, I would recommend seeing this, and the sooner the better, as the packed opening night crowd in the theatre I saw it in definitely added significantly to the atmosphere of the movie.

371,GoMJB12,One of the Best Sequels!,10,4 July 2002,"CONTAINS SPOILERSThe film starts off at Grace Anderson Sanitarium where two nurses tell stories of Laurie Strode. They say she decapitated a man. Laurie is all beat up, dirty, and basically in bad shape knowing her brother, THE SHAPE, is coming for her again. We find out that the man whose head was chopped off was really a paramedic who had his larynx crushed by Michael before they got to Laurie. Back at the sanitarium, she sets a trap for him in her room. She puts a fake her inside her bed and when Michael gets to the dummy, Laurie hits him with a lamp and shocks him a little bit. She hides and sends him up to the roof, her following. She says some strong dialog (rewritten since the internet draft) about how he has failed (although not said, she gives you the idea). He is lifted by his ankle upside down with this crane thing. He drops his knife. Laurie picks up the knife and goes to unmask her, to make sure it really is Michael. He grabs her and brings her off the side of the building. Michael's knife goes into her gut in the process. She does something really sweet before Michael pulls the knife out and she falls into some trees below (really cool shot) and then Michael does a really shameful thing. Now we're at the Haddonfield University where we meet our six main characters, Bill, Jim, Rudy, Jen, Donna, and Sara, who are six teens who are going to go into the Myer's house for a internet thing with Dangertainment, entrepeneur Freddie Harris' company, along with his ""assistant"", Nora Winston. Halloween arrives as they explore the house. They all have mixed opinions about the house, but they can't leave till the next morning, and they get scholarships for doing this. That night, after we get to know more about our characters, Freddie plans some Michael Myers fun, with his own costume and mask. When the real Michael Myers shows up and everyone sees both of them, something really funny happens. The real Myers begins to kill most of them, and only a few get out alive. When Sara escapes to a shed outside, she cuts some electrical wires and cases a big fire around the Myer's house. Myer's gets tangled up in some electrical wires. I'm not going to spoil the ending, so go see the move. It's one of the best Halloween films ever (although there are some points they could have worked on a little stronger), and anyone, even those who haven't seen any other Halloween movies should see this (they explain most things in the opening monologue over the credits).",Halloween - Resurrection
372,GoMJB12,Michael Myers is back,10,2 February 2003,"Unlike most believed, this film is by far one of the best sequels to date. Like the film before it (Halloween H20) it ignores the storylines from parts 3-6 (which in this case is a good thing), but still manages to bring fresh things to the series. We finally are told Michael's whereabouts throughout the last 20 some years, and we also get a stuntman worthy of playing Michael. Not only did the producers finally give us a good looking mask, Brad Loree's potrayal of Myers is the best to date, even better than Nick Castle in the first film. The walk and pace is right, as is the head tilt (finally returned from the first film). This film may lack some qualities, but it is nice to see Rick Rosenthal return and give us a worthy sequel. I give it 8/10 stars because (after watching it a few times) I was able to notice a whole lot of goofs! Other than that, good film, especially some of the shots in the opening sequence. Danny Lux's score is AWESOME!",Halloween - Resurrection
373,wildroses,Is this the end? *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*,7,29 July 2002,"This is one of the better sequels to John Carpenter's fantastic original. The story line is interesting (though done before) and the cast does a great job. It's good to see Curtis back again, this time only for a cameo.
The film is about a group of students that get picked to spend the night in the Michael Myers house, which is to be broadcast over the internet. Each student is fitted with a camera, so the producers and the viewers can see what's going on at all times. And guess who shows up? Yep - You guessed it - Michael Myers. With any luck, this will be the final Halloween film. As much as I love the series (well, part of it anyway) its time Michael Myers was laid to rest. The way this film opens, it SHOULD be the final film. Only time will tell...
Overall, one of the best sequels to a fantastic film. 7 out of 10.",Halloween - Resurrection
374,WillM02,Nothing new....,6,24 June 2011,"A film like this, is a film which doesn't deserve an intensely critical review (like some of the others I've read) nor does it deserve an overwhelmingly positive one. I'm sure the cast and crew involved didn't start filming, believing they would be part of an inspirational, brilliant, award winning cinematic masterpiece. It was just for fun, and of course, carrying on the Myers legacy.Now this movie is nothing new , nothing special, nothing ""ground-breaking"" It is just your typical slasher movie. This isn't the type of movie that demands for brilliant acting , directing etc, and for me, It was just an entertaining, fun film, with some thrills and kills and a concept that kept me interested as the standard slasher madness played out. So as long as you don't expect a revolutionary horror film (Such as the 1978 original) then you can't go wrong with this movie for a bit of late night fun with friends.6/10",Halloween - Resurrection
375,krissy-kins,Terrifying! Hugely Entertaining!,10,23 July 2003,Halloween Resurrection was a great installment to the Halloween series.The casting in this film is also perfect we even get an appearance from the survivor of the original film Jamie Lee Curtis.With the stage set (Michael Myers' House) and all the young people hell will break loose when Michael comes home. The deaths are newly imaginative and fun. This one is much much more darker and sinister than the rest. Michael has been delivered to the new year safely. The best in the Halloween Series. Brilliant!,Halloween - Resurrection
376,damiencorso,Surprisingly good. Go Busta!,7,13 July 2002,"I thought this movie was most definitely one of two or three best of the entire series.  The movie contained plenty of TERRIBLE acting, so it actually made Busta Rhymes look like he could act.  He impressed me quite a bit, but I'm sure it was because his acting was a ""lesser of two evils"" thing.  I don't know why people get upset when there is comic relief in horror movies.  The movies shouldn't be taken so seriously anyhow.
The main problem I had with the movie was with how they made Michael Myers a bit too intelligent.  In the previous movies, Myers was diagnosed as having Antisocial behavior, which according to psychology, means that he does not care who he kills, etc etc.  He never worried about getting caught before, but in this movie he hides and worries about getting caught, which is unrealistic (yes, so is having an unstoppable killer, but at least stick with the creator's formula).  There were obvious references to Jason and Freddy movies in the movie.  Busta Rhymes was named Freddy and dressed as Myers in the house.  Is that some sort of subliminal message saying Freddy Krueger wants to be like Mike...Myers?  Maybe they took these shots at the Freddy and Jason movies since those two are seen as the two premier horror characters and they're supposedly going to have that showdown.
Well, I would give the movie 7 out of 10 stars",Halloween - Resurrection
377,NeoMyers,Michael Myers is back and better than anyone could have hoped.,10,13 July 2002,"Upon going to see ""Halloween: Resurrection"" I had somewhat low expectations. I've always loved the Halloween movies more than any other series and I expected a drop off in quality. What I got was easily better than H20 and most likely better than ""Halloween II.""I never expected the movie to be as good as it turned out to be. H20 was scary and suspenseful. ""Resurrection"" is twice as scary and twice as suspenseful. Michael Myers continues to be clever and more than a mindless slasher. The mask is clearly the best one since the original.My only complaint about the movie was the lack of an explanation concerning Laurie Strode's son, John (played in H20 by Josh Harnett). Myers whole motivation for killing is the pursuit of his family and while I thought it was excusable for him to clear the invaders from his home as a means of plot, I think we need to know what happened to his nephew, John.
From the conclusion of ""Resurrection"" I would gather that there could, and I hope will, be a ""Halloween 9."" Now that this little side journey of Myers has been catalogued we need to get back to his primary target, John Tate. I only hope Harnett doesn't think another ""Halloween"" is below him.",Halloween - Resurrection
378,Slasher_63755,I liked it!!,10,15 July 2002,"CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!Ok everybody seems to either like this movie or hate it with a passion!  I however am in the 1st part of that crowd I LOVED IT!! I have seen all the Halloween films, all at the theater.  And I say with out any hesitation that this is a great flick!!  The opening finally killing off Jamie Lee ""Nice"" a semi surprise I guess, You had several things that made this a good movie 1.Good acting, 2.A good story line and 3.Its a Halloween movie that should speak for its self!!  I thought it was great!  I do agree with you all who say it is not as good as the first but then again few movies are!!  I would say after the 1st two films and maybe H20 this one would be next on the list.  Go see it!!",Halloween - Resurrection
379,ShatteredChaos,You have got to be kidding me!,3,20 December 2006,"Being a major Horror movie geek, naturally I was a big fan of the first two Halloween movies. Even the third could have my appreciations. Buth after that, it made me real sad.The first minutes of this movie got my expectations up. But unfortunately these are the only nice minutes of this movie. The branche has become nothing more than a teenage scary movie. Even the acting had relegated itself to second hand actors and rappers. Shameful in my opinion.Let's hope this will be the last movie in the Halloween branche. The only 'new' Halloween movie that might be interesting would be a prequel about the youth of Michael and his sister! Pity",Halloween - Resurrection

381,FFBOikaze,The Worst Movie I Have Seen In Its Entirety,1,16 October 2013,"It starts out well, as Jamie Lee Curtis, of course, never goes wrong, but simply put, Busta Rhymes destroys this movie. Even granting that the premise of most of the film is formulaic, I probably could have given the film 5 or 6 out of 10. Busta singlehandedly knocked it down to a 1. He's a good rapper, but a TERRIBLE actor.Tyra Banks is beautiful, of course, but should have been involved in a chase scene with Michael Myers rather than dying off-screen, and the ""smart, uptight girl"" suddenly becoming hormonal was rather stupid as well.However, if one watches the mental hospital sequence at the beginning and the morgue scene at the end, those alone would make this a decent slasher were it not for... well, you get the idea- a certain rapper turned failed actor.",Halloween - Resurrection
382,bammyjastard,The idea was good...unfortunately not the execution,2,25 August 2019,"Ok, so the idea was good...Teens spend a night locked in the infamous Myers house, where 6 year old Michael killed his older sister Judith in 1978. They are all wearing head cams so we can see action unfolding from each person. Michael turns up for another killing spree. This could have been a good film.
Unfortunately the acting was awful and very forced, the casting is a joke...Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks both have bigger egos than the films budget and non existent acting abilities. what started as a good plot quickly turned into a farce, and unrealistic and unbelievable farce.
Overall 2/10. i'm giving this 1 star for the idea and one star for my uncontrollable laughter every time i hear Busta Rhymes say the ridiculous trick or treat line.",Halloween - Resurrection
383,bratty101,Micheal should never have been resurrected.. AGAIN,3,29 March 2007,I just finished watching this mess of a movie and it should have never happened IMO. H20 was the perfect ending to this franchise but oh well.the 1st 15mins of this movie is great but those 15mins should have been attached to the end of H20 and then h20 would have been even better.the acting is diabolic in this wait hang on it better than H5 but that not saying much. bustha just should not be in this movie he is so annoying he acts funny but hes so not. the blonde bimbo is also very annoying and the rest well there watchable anyway.Michaels mask is on top form in this one altou still not as good as the original but its better than H20s mess of a mask.the story i actually didt mind its just it didt fit in with a Halloween movie and he didt go after a family member A BIG NONO IN THIS FRANCHISE.this Halloween is watchable ONCE and simply nothing more its not the worst in the series that title goes to H5. H3 WELL ITS NOT PART OF IT REALLY.,Halloween - Resurrection
384,jeffhardy1,Mildly entertaining,6,15 July 2002,"For whatever reason, I'm a big fan of the Halloween series so my review may be slightly biased.  Then again, who else but a fan would have seen the film or be curious enough to read reviews of it?The first Halloween was brilliant.  Definately one of the best horror movies ever and a very entertaining and creepy movie.  I guess it hooked me for the rest but one of the cool things about Michael Myers is the fact that he is fairly ""real"" for a slasher movie.  He is strong and hard to kill but human and he has an M.O.  He wants to kill his family and anyone in his way.
And that's my biggest problem with this sequel.  He's hunting people that are doing an internet show from the house he grew up in (yeah, that'd be real popular - the sad fact is most people don't have broadband connections at home, so why not just make it a tv show?  Not a big deal though). There are several instances in the series where Michael ignored people who aren't in his way so this seemed fairly gratuitous.  Also, the six kids who are doing the show are just plain boring.  Not likeable, not annoying, just THERE.  The kills are what you expect out of a horror movie - brutal.  Not many ""false scares"" of people bumping into each other fortunately.  Still, the kills aren't very inventive.  There is nothing here you haven't seen before.I personally was a little annoyed that it ignored Halloween 4-6.  H20 didn't refer to those but it also didn't contradict them.  This one has two or three small references that infer that 4-6 never occurred.Anyway, this one's totally a filler.  Nothing significant is added to the mythology in any way.  It's just a guy killing people for no real reason. Decent acting and directing, just... no real reason for any of it.  I give it a generous 6 out of 10.",Halloween - Resurrection
385,pawsha57,A slap in the face to the fans.....,2,5 September 2006,"You know how a lot of critics like to say ""don't waste your time by seeing this pointless sequel"", I get sick of that, but in this case it truly applies. This is an absolutely putrid excuse for a Halloween film, and this is coming from a life-long fan. The original is my favorite film of all time. To say that I am disappointed by Director Rick Rosenthal (who also directed the best of the sequels, Halloween 2) is putting it lightly. The casting is just ridiculous. Busta Rhymes?! WTF is he doing in a Halloween movie? No excuse for it, none. Bianca Kajlich has to be the most boring female lead I've seen in a long time. You never learn enough about her to care and she's never convincing. The rest of the cast has so little personality that they are hard to remember after you see the film. I know they are simply there for Michael to kill, but can they at least be slightly entertaining? Can I care about somebody? Even H5 had better characters and that's saying something. I never missed Loomis more than I did watching this trash. The only upsides to the film are Michael himself and Jamie Lee's cameo. Michael's mask looks better than it has since 2, and he keeps the more aggressive style he had in H20. But other than that this thing sucked up one side of the hill and down the other. I can't believe that H6 is widely considered the worst in the series when you have this and part 5. 6 has much better acting and characters in one frame than this garbage. And it's scarier. Where were the scares beyond the first ten minutes? It's way too dumb to be scary. Donald Pleasence must be turning in his grave.",Halloween - Resurrection
386,geoffrey-kirk2,The Grandfather of Horror proves old people should not be ignored,8,27 September 2006,"It was a good film, I enjoyed the others also, specifically being Halloween 1, 2 and H20. However I do get a little bored with all the teenager slashing. Does he only kill teenagers? Isn't that discriminatory under new laws? Although I cannot say whether they leave the ending open for a further film this is a character that I find appealing in that he is genuinely scary and therefore I hope the films continue.I like the fact the he is now older where as in the first one I think he was in his early 20's. For some reason older people are scarier in films, I do not know why, perhaps because we cannot see ourselves as old, even if we are.The next film after this one needs to be better written with a more involving plot. Perhaps he could be in an institution, an isolated patient, wearing his mask because he freaks out if he takes it off. They need to make him a little more human and a little less like a cyborg. That will make it scarier.",Halloween - Resurrection

That was until I watched this pile of manure!The opening 15 minutes was passable, though I pitied Jamie Lee having to put her name to the overall film. What followed was an exercise in how to completely bury a horror series. Granted the only films that have any credibility were Halloween, H4 and H20, but even in the darkest (or should that be lightest) moments of the fifth and sixth episodes at least Michael himself was scary. Not any longer.There wasn't a believable or likeable character in the film, Laurie apart, and how the hell Busta Rhymes was cast I will never know.It is almost wasting breath to plead that there will be no more Halloween films, because there will be.

H4-6 gave us lines like ""i prayed that he would burn in hell but in my heart i knew that hell would not have him"" to ""your fried like chicken!"" this is ridiculous! the people who liked this trash are NOT Halloween fans they are Busta Ryhmes fans who enjoyed watching Tyra Banks shake her groove thing.

She did a good job in part one, was pretty much forgettable in part two, was NOT even in 4-6, did ok in part 7 but she just went on and ego trip and made laurie strode and her mental illness the focus rather than michael myers! Halloween really comes down to Michael Myers desire to kill his FAMILY not a rapper and a hooker, and Dr Loomis's equal insane determination to stop Michael.

And then, the final chapter, the girl that we loved during 25 years, the girl we wanted to protect....is killed by her own brother.

406,keoseyan-66002,A solid new and refreshing take on the Halloween franchise.,7,19 November 2019,"Short Take: Aside from a few terrible in basic cinematography, this movie is a solid new and refreshing take on the Halloween franchise, exposing a side of Michael Myers we hadn't seen before as well as a whole new storyline that has little to do with the ""Killing his family"" bit, and presenting us with a modern version of Halloween in the innovative internet world of the early 2000's.
Review: Despite being one of the least liked of the Halloween movies, I sincerely believe that Halloween resurrection is one of the best Halloween films ever made. Of course, it is not without faults, especially in terms of cinematography, (as every time the camera switches to the point of view of the ""Live"" internet camera's the quality of the picture decreases and turns grainy and almost unwatchable), and in relation to rebooting the events of the previous film via unnecessary exposition and a completely not-believable situation. However, I really think this was the only way of making another installment to the series without creating a full reboot or remake, and the filmmakers really redeem themselves after that weak set up.
The film is paced really well, it has some tremendous suspense, amazingly gripping and chilling scenes (such as Busta Rhyme's one on one encounter with Michael Myers, both with the mask on or Michael Myers' second murder by attacking a victim through a mirror), it stays low on the cheap scares, and makes it work by setting its story within the internet world of the early 2000's, complete with instant texting, live internet reality TV, and much more.
Michael Myers is as menacing as ever, and Busta Rhymes, the main protagonist, becomes Michael Myers the first worthy adversary in the history of the film franchise, beating him mercilessly without the need for any tranquilizer or firearm.
The film is wildly entertaining and it doesn't pretend to be anything more than that. In short, the filmmakers found a way to create a new refreshing version instead of yet another overly formulaic sequel. One of the best Halloween films ever made.",Halloween - Resurrection

The main star is a rap singer who can't act, and the rest of cast are annoying teenagers that are completely uninteresting.  The ten minute introduction was acceptable, but the rest of the movie started and I was left wondering what the hell is this crap.  Why did they make this movie? Instead of feeling scared I felt mad, and betrayed. Before long there all in his old house, and its one boring scene after another of long mindless chatter.  When the hell is he going to kill all these little friggin snots. Finally the first ones gone. Good. Go get the next one.  This was nothing like the original movie where you actually cared about Jamie Lee Curtis getting hurt let alone the sad chance of her dying.  This movie bugs.  Its almost impossible to watch.",Halloween - Resurrection
410,Richnlkhd,What an awful movie!!,1,20 February 2003,"I just can't stop trashing this crappy movie.  Those pompous annoying teenagers were no more then cardboard character with too many lines.  But what really sunk this movie was Busta Rhymes and the lousy performance by Tyra Banks.  They could have found better actors at a community college. Spoiler!!  That scene where Busta takes on Michael Myers then karate chops him thru the window.  Please.  Finnaly Michael comes back in his house and stab Busta until he collaspses dead -the highlight of the movie. I rejoiced thinking that boring ass clown was gone forever.  But no, he gets to live again, his menacing attempts to act have been resurrected. He's up and around jumping and functioning as though nothing happened to him. Predictably he gets to kill Michael Meyers then calls him a motherf*cker for about the tenth time.  Naturally his lines are all seasoned with that charming phrase whenever possible.  The very final scene was also painfully predictable and quite dismal.  After complety trashing the Michael Meyers series these idiots have the gall to suggest a sequel.  Which washed up rap singer will they recruit for the next flop?  M&M?  Another thing is that mask.  Busta must have stoled the original because Michael's mask looked terrible. Something was wrong it didn't fit right.  This whole movie went wrong. Iam sorry I saw it.",Halloween - Resurrection

Exlllecent movie!,10,13 July 2002,This was a very good movie.It is a lot better than some of the other sequels.It starts out exciting and stays exciting thoughout the movie.I am also the biggest fan of all the Halloween films except for the third sequel.But in conclusion you must see Halloween Resurrection. It will be one of the best movies you will see this year!,Halloween - Resurrection
412,ThePhiladelphiaKid,The Proverbial Dead-End,1,14 July 2002,"The following review is possibly a ""spoiler"":It used to be, that you could see a ""Halloween"" film and say, ""It was bad, but it was no Halloween 6."" This latest installment of the ""Halloween"" series ""The Resurrection,"" is so unmistakably horrible that it could possibly BE worse then ""Halloween 6,"" and in fact the worst film of the ""Halloween"" Series (Possibly the worst big budget movie of all time).To say this films stinks, to say it was bad, to say it was a waste of your life would be an insult to such other stinking, bad films that have wasted your life. How to begin counting the ways?First of all, the music, the name ""Michael Myers"",  and Jamie Leigh Curtis are the only things that bare any resemblance to the first Halloween - Oh, and the executive producer Moustapha Akkad, whose bank accounts are surely solely responsible for bringing the series this far in the first place. There is this ridicules subplot at the beginning which is over in about five minutes, and has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the story (I use that term as loose as possible). Characters appear and disappear, having left no clue to their significance at all whatsoever (Including Jamie Leigh's character!!!).Busta . . . Oh, Busta . . . Actually, thank Buddha for Busta, because not only did he steal the film from Michael Myers, but he is (if you can find a reason) the only reason to wake up from time to time.There is - albeit a pretty stupid one - some assemblage of a plot. It is all-interneted and Mtv'd out. I never thought of the 21st century in terms of youthful cliches, but this film definitely put them out there. The Internet, the palm pilot, voyeuristic entertainment: they all show up to provide future generations with the ideal image of the most cliched 21st century American (And what the heck was the point of the motorbike? I've never seen anybody riding a motorbike around campus.) .Subplots appear seemingly out of nowhere. There is absolutely no consistency. You hate every character except Busta. There is no humor except Busta. There is no suspense, but that of the cheap Haunted House variety. When I saw Rick Rosenthal's name (director of ""Halloween 2"") during the opening credits, I actually thought for a spilt second that there might be some redeeming qualities to this film. I was wrong.Okay, it's a ""Halloween"" movie, why be so analytical about it? Perhaps, because the first ""Halloween"" was such a cool, well made film. Sure, some of the sequels have been pretty dumb, but for the most part they've been entertaining. This one is a conglomerate of stereotypes and irrational nonsense.This film would serve perfect usage in a film school, under the chapter on how NEVER to make movies.On a side note, the formula (which Akaad certainly understands, because he obviously knows NOTHING about quality storytelling) is pretty obvious: young characters (including the obligatory ""boob shot"") with all the typical cliches, a popular rapper and a sexy model. He can't go wrong. I fully understand his motives, but there is just something repulsive about associating this garbage with John Carpenter's classic. It is a tragedy - the proverbial dead-end - that it should have been the spark from which this latest piece of undeniable trash is descendent.",Halloween - Resurrection
413,lopezreme,Not a bad movie!,9,17 July 2002,"Warning spoiler in this review!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The movie was great, all the parts were really good the only problem I had with the movie was Busta's roll they just made him look to hardcore. I mean Micheal stabed him about two to three times and he didn't die (please).The next movie should be about Jamie's son (Micheal's niece)or Laurie Strode's son (from H2O). Also the movie had so humor in it and I think Holloween shouldn't be about funny parts, that just makes it look like all the other horror movies out right now.. Anyways the movie was good and I hope they come out with the next one as soon as possible..",Halloween - Resurrection
414,kissmyassphault,mini-review,1,6 November 2002,"I'll keep this short and sweet, rather unlike this film... The Halloween series has become a horror film legacy and rightfully so purely on the basis of the first 2 films alone. They expose the Nightmare on Elm Street films in comparrison for the poor, weird films they are. However, the Halloween legend has been tarnished in the past by poor films in the series, Halloween 3 and H20 spring to mind. Sadly, carrying on from H20 in more ways than just plot (ie. it's poo on a stick...), Halloween Resurrection is nothing short of a joke. It's original, (but then so was Scary Movie once, and that has 1 decent gag in it...) but flawed. Terrible acting from no-hoper teen newbies, no suspense and/or terror and laughable special effects make this one of the worse horror films of recent years. Avoid.",Halloween - Resurrection

DID NO ONE THINK TO CHECK HIS PULSE? DID THEY JUST SEE HIS EYES SHUT AND PRESUME HE WAS DEAD? this movie is so silly and ridiculous it is beyond belief.thirdly, the storyline is disgraceful. some students get to visit michael myers house to snoop around...without knowing that he lives in the basement.DID THE ORGANISERS NOT CHECK THE HOUSE? abolutely pathetic film-making. the only positive is that it is amusing from scene to scene how bad this movie actually gets. if you have seen a worse movie, then i really feel for you.aah...rant over",Halloween - Resurrection

420,bigbrother131,Good,10,15 May 2003,i think that this film was good but i don't agree with them killing off lorie strode. I thought that this film was an up to date slasher film but i think that the Scream trilogy was better. When is michael myers going to die. 8 movies and hes still not dead i think that they have taken it too far. Overall this was a good film to watch. 8/10,Halloween - Resurrection
421,Bumperklever,Average at best,4,27 January 2003,"After watching Halloween:H20 some time ago I didn't expect very much of Resurrection, but since I'm a fan of the horror/slasher genre I watched it anyway. After all the Hellraiser series is also reviving with the releases of both H5: Inferno and H6: Hellseeker so there's no reason why the Halloween series couldn't take a turn for the better.The start of the movie actually got me excited but after the first 20 minutes or so the quality of the plot dropped rapidly. Resurrection's plots exploits 2 completely different ideas. On the one hand it tries to make some sort of ethical statement about reality-TV and the TV-stations who are exploiting people for pure profit, on the other hand Rick Rosenthal just tried to put in as much gore as possible to keep the fans happy. The plot stays very superficial throughout the movie and for those who have watched their fair share of slasher movies it isn't hard to predict the outcome of the movie when you're not even halfway trough it.The man with the white mask has a lot of screentime in this one which isn't bad at all. Without his regular appearance you wouldn't be able to know if you were watching Resurrection,Scream 4 or I still,still know what you did last summer ! The whole movie is just an average teenage horror movie. Scream was exciting but after all the ripoffs and spinoffs we have seen it all. Teenage horror is just as dead as it was before Scream's release and the fans are desperately waiting for some fresh ideas.The cast is young,enthusiastic and trying to make the best of it except for Busta Rhymes, who is the perfect example that not all rappers are also good actors. His performance is an absolute joke; was it that hard to find somebody with at least some talent ?Those who are looking for some easy entertainment can't go wrong with this movie. There are body-parts,enough blood and a few twists to keep those who are new to the genre on the edge of their seat. The diehard fan will be disappointed however and it's once more the proof that legends like Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees have become pure cash-cows for Hollywood. I can only advise the people who plan to spent cash on this one to look around carefully if they can't find any of the true slasher-classics (from the 80's) before you take Resurrection to the checkout-counter.",Halloween - Resurrection
422,ThePhantomKiller,An absolute travesty....,1,26 October 2011,"To say this is is the worst Halloween movie in the series is way too much praise. This is, I believe, one of the very worst movies of all time. It is purely and simply... awful. From start to finish, top to bottom, up the hill and down, this is a huge load of toxic waste on an old soggy cracker. Spits in the face of the fans in too many ways to count. Completely derails the tremendous steam the series regained with H20 purely by existing, let alone the actual puke inducing events that take place within the film. Busta Rhymes? Karate kicking one-liners through a major role in a Halloween film? I really don't need to say too much more after that. I consider this film fantasy land. If this is the modern Halloween movie, the original might as well have been made in the 20's. Thats how far removed it is from Carpenters (or even Rosenthalls!) film. Its not a real Halloween movie. It almost doesn't qualify as a movie at all. It looks a joke made by fans to spoof the series on you tube. Sets look like sets, nothing is believable from the acting to the lighting. Greed spawned this little bastard. And it is, I believe, one of the worst things ever captured on film.",Halloween - Resurrection
423,ivc7-1,Can I give this a 0?,1,27 October 2005,"Not only is this the worst movie of the series(as well as the most unnecessary), it's one of the worst I've ever seen(out of thousands). Why Jamie Lee Curtis ever agreed to do this cameo, I have no idea. The plot is absurd. The idea behind how Meyers is not dead after H2O is mind-numbingly stupid. And from there, it gets worse. A live broadcast from the Meyer house on Halloween night with the great actor, Busta Rhymes? Oh, lord, why did I keep watching. Further taking the viewer into the depths of idiocy we get to see secrets in the Meyers' house and lots of neat places for a serial killer to hide. I'm still stunned this movie was ever made, after a fitting end in H2O, but it proves Hollywood will do anything for money.

428,tarzan-4,"Repulsive, unbelievable sound effects, stupid effects",2,13 July 2002,I attended the opening here in S.L.C. and sorry I went. Suspense has become how loud can the sound effects become in exchange for action. Sound effects of knives moving through air doesn't sound like steel grating on steel. How can a 10 inch knife go through a body and a door and still be 6 inches long with blood dripping off it's end? Last time a chain saw came in contact with my skin it left a scar. Is Michael some kind of superman that can play dead when the situation arises or be immune to injury? Can't we find a pool of steel and drop Michael in? Maybe that's the only way to rid the world of this low-life. It seems Jamie is going the way of her father in joining movies for the money rather than the plot. A reviewer of the original Halloween commended Jamie's character for her courage but she seems to have lost it in the pile of trash. If Jamie is no more who's left in the world to combat Michael the next installment? Can be maybe find someone with some smarts to chop off a few of Michael's appendages so he can quit playing with knives? And do we need the drug use so the audience can cheer and ask to join in the festivities? Maybe I'm out of touch with today's group that enjoys this horror but repulsive doesn't equal entertainment.,Halloween - Resurrection

The body count was good, there was some gore, and I liked the look of the movie and how quickly paced it was, so it delivered. Better not think too much though, this movie has ultra one-dimensional characters and the plot is just an excuse to get kids slaughtered(F13 films are more complex). But this is escapism, folks; there is nothing remotely cerebral or intellectual about this movie. At least they use original music(pretty good,too,the new version of the theme is almost haunting)instead of the Scream music they used in H20.",Halloween - Resurrection
430,buzz-60,A Disappointment to True Halloween Fans,3,12 July 2002,"While some might find the recent installment of Halloween to be thrilling and exciting to watch thanks to the recent splurge of popular reality shows that have been frequenting the TV, the movie is nothing more than a get rich quick scheme for those involved with its production.  Those responsible sold out big time and the true roots of the Halloween films (which were laid superbly by John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Jamie Lee, and the late Donald Pleasence) are nowhere to be found in this movie.  The town of Haddonfield, in previous installments, seemed like a character in and of itself.  You would see Michael lurking into people's houses, backyards, and hospitals in the town, which makes the audience feel like they are a member of the town themself.  In this installment, Haddonfield is nothing more than your regular, run-of-the-mill, city in America.  It has certainly lost the charm it once had.  In addition, you never understand why Michael goes home and with the bad dialogue and acting, you don't really care, either.  The same goes for the Myers' house.  While it may look like Michael's home, it doesn't feel like it is. The only good thing the movie had going for it was the various ways you could view events that took place in the house thanks to head cams used by the actors.  In all, those responsible took the true meaning of ""Halloween"" and turned it into a summer slash fest.  They should have stopped at H20 (which did not follow events of previous sequels, but was in and of itself a good movie) or at least thought of something more clever to revive the series.  There are no surprises in this movie, and that includes the very predictable ending.  There is nothing left for the true Halloween fans to come back to.  The original characters are gone, Haddonfield is no longer Haddonfield, and as you will see, Michael's house is no longer Michael's house.  Halloween used to be the night HE came home.  Now, it's the night THEY sold out...",Halloween - Resurrection

It ruined all the resolution with Laurie and Micheal, it was horribly ill-timed (I don't care about Halloween now, it's July!), and worst of all, LAURIE WAS KILLED!  So that's it for her?  She dies?  I can't believe Jamie Lee Curtis decided to do that.  It ruined all the other movies; her surviving in all the other movies means nothing because he actually did kill her now.  H20 was SUCH a better movie; the plot meant something to the series, the characters weren't all just a bunch of horny teenagers (although some were), and the overall direction and music was better quality.  I can't believe that the guy who did the 2nd movie directed this one, too.  Micheal has NO purpose for existence now that he's killed his sister.  It's what he's been trying to do for 23 years and now he's done it.  There's no point now.  And did anyone actually think he was dead at the end?  If they can weasle out of a freakin decapitation, they can make him live till he's 300!

Not once!!  I just stared at the movie screen and shook my head in disgust through most of the movie.  It was predictable, and even boring. Not to mention the entire Halloween series has now been butchered by 'resurrection', since they unwittingly decided to make this movie into another brainless modern day ""Teen Flick"" where a bunch of ditsy Britney Spears look-alikes and boy band wannabes run around like sheep getting slaughtered.

The death scenes are nothing compared to the recent Jason X, and seeing as this movie only has its death scenes going for it, quite disappointing.  Many points in the movie I found myself saying ""Did they actually just put that in the movie?"".  The only thing that stopped me from walking out was Busta Rhymes, and only because I had the inclination he knew the movie was a joke too.

435,horrorfreak3000,"GREAT!!!!!! , warning, contains spoilers!!",10,13 July 2002,"I have been waiting to see this movie for 4 years. And after Halloween H20, me, my brother, and my best friend has disputed over the fact that if that was the real Michael Myers in H20, or just a copycat. Halloween Resurrection cleared this argument up, and is one of the many pleasures of Halloween: Resurrection. In the beginning, Michael tracks his sister Laurie down after 3 years in a mental hospital. On top of the roof, Michael finally kills Laurie, and then proceeds to go back to his home. The beginning sequence is very exciting to watch, and the music pumps up just at the right times. The story follows a group of teenagers who have won a contest set-up by Busta Rhymes, and Tyra Banks, to spend on night in the house of Michael Myers. Attached to their heads are cameras which they use to go around the house to try an uncover the mystery behind Michael Myers madness, and rage. But what they don't know is that Michael is already in the house, hell bent on killing them all. Halloween: Resurrection sets up these characters to die in cool, and sometimes elaborate ways. This movie cranks up the suspense by having Michael Myers at sometimes pop out of nowhere, and the score gives you that crank of music just at the right time to create an even more atmosphere of terror. Another pleasure of this movie is that is able to interract with the people who are watching over the internet, and sets up a very suspensful, and creey scene in which the heroine has a little palm computer device which allows her to make contact with the people wathcing, and they are able to tell her where Michael is. The movie not only has great suspense, I found my heart pumping at the end, and that's what a great horror/thriller should do. Halloween: Resurrection has a lot of funny line, and scenes, including a great one where Busta Rhymes { dressed up as Michael Myers] meats up with the real Michael Myers, and delivers a very funny outcome, which I will not reveal. Not only is Halloween: Resurrection creepy, and suspensful, it is able to create all that with a believeable plot which has characters, and events that are believeable. Followed by ok acting, and a funny performance by Busta Rhymes, great music, cool death sequences, a believeabl story, and ending which made me jump, Halloween: Resurrection is not as good as the first, but not that much close behind the first, Halloween: Resurrection stands as the best of Halloween sequels. 4 out of 4 stars.",Halloween - Resurrection

The idea of live-streaming a whole massacre in the house of an urban legend isn't as bad. But Jesus, Bianca has the worst acting skills I've ever seen, just rewatching the whole ""this is for Ray!! This is for Jen!! for all of them !!"" scene is so cringy.As for Jamie Lee Curtis, she's too good to be in this movie. I read that she didn't even wanna do it, she was tired of the Laurie Strode role, and she probably had the worst kill of the entire series. Her character deserved so much more than that 4 minute scene.The movie itself had some good kills and a good chase scene in the basement. This movie itself was not well written or acted out. I could've written this is in one night. It was completely unnecessary. H20 would've been an okay end to the series. But Akkad also had a legal clause for Michael to never be killed.Overall, it's watchable, could also scare you a little (if you don't really like scary movies that is) and overall had laughable moments.

It could have been a completely different movie about people on a game show who go into a killer's old house. NOT Halloween. *spoilers* Aside from the boring plot and cheesy acting, the worst thing has to be that Laurie dies in the first 10 minutes. It was really a stupid twist that she killed the wrong person in Halloween: H20. The series should have just ended there... Why kill Laurie? She's the best Halloween character. It's just depressing that in the end, Laurie doesn't defeat Michael and instead she's an opening kill. Other than that, this movie could have been OK.

First of all, if Michael kills Jamie Lee, then there's no point for the rest of the movie. That was the whole story throughout the entire series! Second, having Busta Rhymes in the movie was a BIG mistake. You couldn't have chosen anyone worse to deliver that one-liner. That one-liner (Trick or treat, mother f***er) would have been really cool if someone better did it. I could see Ving Rhames doing that line perfectly. He was probably busy doing Dawn of the Dead, though. Third, making a reality TV show out of the Myers' home?! That just shows how f***ing stupid MTV is! What the f***?! The only redeeming factor of this movie was the very beginning where they reveal how Michael Myers survived H20. That actually seemed like something that he would do! Although, I watched H20 again and saw that it was highly unlikely that that actually DID happen in the world of Michael Myers. If it truly was like that, he would have taken the mask off at the end of H20. Would anyone NOT notice they have a f***ed up Captain Kirk mask on them? I just hope they put Michael to sleep forever now. They better not make another Halloween movie.",Halloween - Resurrection
444,darkpowerz,Worse than Halloween III! How could this be!,1,12 July 2002,"I saw Halloween Resurrection and I must say I was very disapponted.  Even how they described how he survived the decapatation.  I am sorry but that was lame.  I am a die hard fan of the films and Michael could not have undressed himself that quick come on.  The paramedic!  He would have died after getting thrown trough the window let alone when the van hit him. Plus, why wouls he sit up like Michael?  Another bad element:  Halloween has been about Michael killing his family right?  Who was his family besides Laurie?  No one!  I am sorry but I cannot believe a Halloween movie involving Michael could be as bad as Halloween III, but there is now. Most people were leaving the theater saying: ""I'll never see another Halloween again.""  We need to know what happened to Laurie's son?  How about Jamie's baby?  Kara and Danny Strode?  Halloween Resurrection resurrected one thing and that was a terrible idea.  Michael should have been left dead since seeing this movie.  I would rate this as 1 for not continuing with the Halloween outline of previous films.",Halloween - Resurrection

446,Smithfan,Somebody please check my pulse!,9,13 July 2002,This movie was amazing!  I went into the movie theatre hearing two different sides of the story...some said that the movie was terrible and then some said that it was better than the original.  I must say that both are extremely wrong.  The movie was nowhere near terrible and it totally kicked the originals explatively deleted.  I am a huge fan of the original and the whole series for that matter and I want to give major props to all involved.  It was pulled off very well and it gave me the biggest scares that I have recieved in a long while.,Halloween - Resurrection
447,Gilbert-Rodriguez,The Most Frightening Movie You'll Want To See This Summer!,10,12 July 2002,"Halloween: Resurrection is the eighth installment in a series started by director John Carpenter with his sinister and ground-breaking 1978 film Halloween. The first film, was a milestone in horror. Then it got stuck with a long line of sequels - some good, some awful. The last entry, Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later was a pleasant surprise. It was both clever and suspenseful.The Halloween franchise was supposed to end in 1998 with H20. The cast featured original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred in the first two movies. Her character, Laurie Strode, sister of Myers, resurfaced as a divorced, alcoholic headmistress who stopped her homicidal brother, once and for allor so we thought.In the prologue that gets adrenaline pumping, the long-suffering Laurie is catatonic and locked up in a sanitarium after having decapitated an innocent man at the end of H20. We discover Laurie hasn't been taking her medications and is ready for an escape or a showdown with her brother.Myers has tracked her down and enters the building. On the run, Laurie lures him up to the roof, where she lays a trap and has him dangling from a rope by one foot. In a twisted gesture of sympathy, she attempts to unmask her brother and he seizes the opportunity for freedom.Then the real movie starts. Six Haddonfield University students, Sara (Bianca Kajlich), Jenna (Katee Sackhoff), Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Bill (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Jim (Luke Kirby), and Donna (Daisy McCrackin) have made the cut to appear in a live Internet broadcast.Dangertainment - the online company's concept is based on a combination of familiar reality TV shows. The students are locked in the childhood home of Myers on Halloween night and wear cameras so the viewers at home can see everything that happens.The show is run by Dangertainment's proprietor, Freddie (rapper Busta Rhymes), who has the place loaded with hidden cameras and fake props. Although the reality thing is pretty much burnt out at this point, the whole Internet angle and webcams were cool.There's also a subplot involving Sara (Bianca Kajlich) and a teen, Myles (Ryan Merriman) flirting via palm pilot (it ends up being an awesome plot device during the tenser stalk sequences). The broadcast is being watched by students crowded around a computer at a costume party.  Soon, Myles begins to suspect the murders are not staged but real.Screenplay wise, this has to be the scariest of most Halloween sequels. The dialogue isn't lousy, but the lead characters are a bit underdeveloped, but not a screenwriting crime. Why is Tyra Banks' character Nora, Freddie's assistant, in this movie? She's absent most of the time.At least our heroine, Sara (Kajlich), is vulnerable, yet strong. She's likable and a worthy predecessor to Curtis' Strode. To be honest, I dug Busta Rhymes' Freddie. I enjoyed his performance that gave the movie some comedic relief. He did some over-the-top martial arts gestures and also had a few tough guy lines. Brad Loree (Michael Myers) comes on strong as the masked maniac. His subtle moves and his eyes projected evil. the man is scary!The original film built suspense by revealing emptiness where you thought Myers might be. Halloween: Resurrection has fast paced editing, the on-screen presence of computer technology and multiple views of stalking and murders. It gives the series a modern feel and makes it enjoyable.Halloween: Resurrection also marks the return of Rick Rosenthal, who directed the thrilling second installment in 1981. Rosenthal does a solid, impressive job and generates tension in many scenes. He handles the web cam P.O.V. (Point of View) shots well, the murders are slick, and he manages to intensify the screen with the shadows of the dark location.
Its premise is smart, and the final scene is frightening. Halloween: Resurrection delivers suspense, many creepy moments, the murders are gruesome, Myers is an unstoppable killing machine and the pace is quick at 85 minutes.I can't say that I was bored one time. Fans of the horror genre, the Halloween franchise and Michael Myers should be pleased with this one.",Halloween - Resurrection
448,forgotten_demoness_15,Great,10,7 August 2002,I like the movie a lot.  I like its' graphics for one.  I also like this movie a lot because it follows the Halloween series and I feel that the producer has managed to grab the plot of the movie unlike Halloween: Season of the Witch 3rd movie of the Halloween series.,Halloween - Resurrection
449,mike_phoenix64,OK but not Great,6,15 July 2009,"OK so this is the 7th instalment of the Halloween series with our favourite serial killer, Michael Myers.Same old s**t, different year, a bunch of teenagers meet their gruesome demise at the hands of the Masked, Unstopable killing Machine, Michael Myers.There are some (suprisingly) good points to this film, it's well acted by the cast and Michael Myers' costume is pretty much spot on and he acts and looks the part. There are some good death scenes for the hardcore horror fans like myself and some tense moments for all the wimps who scare easy :).The only difference with this film to all the other Halloweens is that the others at Least had some form of plot worth watching (to some extent) and getting into, whereas the plot line of this film is basically just a bunch of teenagers (what a surprise) residing in the old home of Michael Myers' house in haddonfeild (wow so original) where he surfaces to kill the unsuspecting trespasser's.To make things WORSE they have rap star !!!Bhusta Rhymes doing KUNG FU!!! Say no more! All in all it's not the worst horror film by a long shot but it could have been so much better!!",Halloween - Resurrection
450,scottyb252005,this is terrible,1,1 November 2007,this movie makes no sense.. the previous one h20 shows Laurie strode chopping his frickin head off hello.... not even Michael comes back from that come on they ruined it bad.. why would they bother with this.. if they really wanted the series to continue why not have him not get his head chopped off....seems to me its a moneymaker do why not.... i actually cant believe john carpenter would lend his name to this let alone Jaime lee Curtis.... also whats up with the last 2 Halloween movies in this series having rappers in it???? in the next one are they gonna have ice cube coming back on Friday maybe to conquer the wrath of Michael myers with the help of Chris tucker??? they should have quit after h20,Halloween - Resurrection
451,Tedakin,Surprising,7,17 July 2002,"The first Halloween film is my second favorite movie ever made, right behind The Empire Strikes Back. So I am always anticipating another sequel and this one suprised me. It's one of the best of the series in my opinion, and that's quite amazing when you consider that it's part 8. Unlike the Jason and Freddy movies, Halloween is still a respected franchise that can get known actors and major releases. Michael Myers is the greatest movie slasher ever and this movie reinforces that sentiment. Out of the 8 films in the series this one ranks number 4.  Part 1, Part 2, Part 4, Resurrection, H20, 5, 6, and then of course the Myerless 3. Now I guess they need to find a new hero to replace Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode for part 9.",Halloween - Resurrection
452,shaney_boy1988,Its passable....and i guess they had to move on at some point..,3,31 March 2009,"After watching Halloween Resurrection I have decided to write a review which I don't normally do.Where do I start? Well the first and most obvious point is how can there be another Halloween movie when Michael thought to of died in the previous one?! The answer to that is money... Yet again these film makers were speaking for the fans and thought they would want another Halloween movie and thought that this one would make big money. Well for the first part yes. I would imagine that the majority of the Halloween fan base would of liked another one but not actually see another one made! As for the second part.....No... This movie did poorly and thus the reason there hasn't been another sequel made since. You can now see why they thought it would be a good idea to revitalise the series by Re-Making the first one but this isn't about that so lets talk about the movie itself.The first point I am going to make is what I made at the start of this review. How can Michael Myers still be alive after we presumed it was him that got his head cut off. This was the worst thing that put me off this movie when watching it. I do agree that the idea of which it was executed in order for Michael to still be alive was passable but there are so many reasons to explain why the paramedic, who was dressed by Michael, didn't just take the mask off and run away but I guess this is a movie and that does not count.....The second part is the demise of beloved Halloween star Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis). When first looking at the DVD cover which shows the actors and of course Jame Lee Curtis, I presumed that Jamie would have a larger role in this movie. The idea of killing of the most important character in the franchise right slap bang at the start was a terrible move. This not only wasted peoples anticipation to see how she and Michael would unfold in the movie but also wasted peoples money who actually bought a ticket to see this on the big screen(who i feel sorry for). Why didn't they just have her in the whole movie and then died at the end because at least this way it shows that she put up a last ditch effort..does it not it?! Also I am led to believe that somewhere along the line the franchise has to move on. We cant and couldn't have the same protagonist always escaping until Halloween ""H30"" because that would and did get very old. From H20 to Halloween(1978) and Halloween 2(1981) she had a good run but it was time to move on because after time the audience would start to question Michaels ability to kill just one primary person after chasing her for a long damn time (Story time) In my closing I would give this movie a 4 out of 10 because I am generous and didn't think this movie was that bad, it was just not everyones liking and I wouldn't recommend watching it more than 2 times.Thanks for reading! :)",Halloween - Resurrection
453,OzMeIstER8199,the BEST sequal of them all!!,10,12 July 2002,"If you are a Halloween fan, or just a horror movie fan, this is a MUST see. Okay people, lets face it, nothing will ever top the first Halloween. Halloween 2 used to be the best sequal, but Resurrection easily tops it. The movie was absolutely brutal.  I swear this should have been made in the 80's when the REAL horror movies were made.  The deaths were fantastic and they were all done with makeup effects. There weren't any computer graphics. That alone is worth seeing this.  One other thing, this isn't a spoiler or anything, the movie was shot from Michael Myers point of view.  I mean he still sneaks around like always, but the camera sticks with him a lot of the time.  I give it a 10 out of a possible 10.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!",Halloween - Resurrection
454,oct31st,the worst movie of the summer! one of the worst sequels in the series!,1,12 July 2002,this movie is just plain bad.  ignore any of the positive comments made by the other people who have posted on this website.  i'm not going to waste any time telling the story.  just know that this movie is almost as bad as halloween 5 and 6.  halloween H20 is the true ending to this series.  like one person posted earlier:  total crap!  rent halloween.,Halloween - Resurrection
455,squidconsumption,Busta a NO NO!!!!,1,30 March 2004,This movie was horrible. What is up with Busta rhymes doing the karate kicks with the sound effects. I couldn't believe they would put him in a myers movie. It was hilarious seeing Busta karate kicking and wahhing. What the! They couldn't pick a better person? It is ridiculous how bad these movies get. If a person has their head chopped off (Mike Myers in H20) then how are they going to come back. If the creators were smart they would just leave the series alone and stop continuing it. It is only getting worse. When i was 4 and saw the first one i was freaked out. But if a 4 year old saw this one they would start cracking up. Come on. Can it get any worse? Should i have even of asked. If anyone liked this they must have been on serious meds.,Halloween - Resurrection
456,colinmcgrath,Michael (Busta) Myers,5,23 July 2002,"I saw this movie the first week that is came out, and I left with a sense of disappointment.  I can honestly say that I am a true Halloween fan, and that I was hoping for more in the 8th episode in the series.  I thought that the movie started strong and came at the viewer with a furious pace.  They tried to make sense, the best way they could, as to how Michael Myers could possibly still be alive.  I guess there is always a way.  After that there seemed to be a series of agitating happenings as the movie progressed.  For instance, I didn't like the fact that the entire Myers house escapade was broadcast over the internet.   Obviously there is going to be an IM buddy to help save the day, right?  The most annoying though, has got to be that PDA that she was holding throughout the movie.  She even spoke to it once and the message got through to Dekkard.  I guess voice recognition on PDA's is fairly common nowadays.  I will stop here because I don't want to discuss the fact that they have a rapper as one of the main characters.....trick or treat busta.I had to walk away from this movie for what it was worth.  It was a sequel that I had to see because I call myself a Halloween and a horror movie fan. I was excited to see more slicing and dicing.  But next time, do all of us a favor.  Get back to the basics.  People come to horror movies to be scared and possibly to see the characters that have become horror icons.  A solid plot and a few decent actors are all you need to make a sequel in which the storyline is basically already set.  Michael is bad, Michael will kill people and Michael will never die.  We all know this.  After all this complaining I am going to do something that will offend many people.  I will recommend this movie if you are a fan of the series or of the genre because, well, I have to.",Halloween - Resurrection

I agree also with the other person who said that Myers was brutal in this one.  The action started off right away.  There was a little bit of comedy in it also which made it enjoyable to watch.  For this being a low budget film it sure seems they tried really hard to make it look good and in my book they did it.  The start of the movie kind of surprised me but then again who knows, (cant say what happens).  Only thing i wish was a bit better were the death scenes but we all know if a movie is to violent they may not allow it to go to theaters. Overall i give this movie an 8.5 out of all of them.

It starts off with Laurie Strode in the hospital, because she chopped of an innocent man's head off. So Michael comes to the mental facility and decides to search for her. He does a heck of a job on finding her. Well it turns to a wild ride, and results in a great movie because, Michael doesn't care who anyone is, because people are in his house.

There was a few things i disliked for example, someone gets killed while the other two do nothing but try and escape, if it was reality, sure enough it would have been different and then the ending was a disappointment.  There will be another sequel, but question is...will Josh Harnet come back for the role of John Strode?

The plot line, being in the house with the web cams, was a great idea although it wasnt entirely original. But that was definatly the way to go to get people to come see it. It was so good I might see it again today! If you havent seen it yet, I suggest you go because I recommend it and as Siskel and Roper would say, I give it 2 thumbs up!!",Halloween - Resurrection

466,Mr_Horror84,Good Movie or Huge Flop? Definitely a good movie!(SPOILERS),10,14 July 2002,"Hey everyone! Well, I went yesterday to watch the movie.  Usually in the beginning it updates us on what is going on now, and reminds us of what happened in the past.  This movie told what ""really happened"" at the end of Halloween:  H20 and updated us on what is currently taking place (three years after the last events occurred).  I thought the beginning was good.  I mean, where Laurie Strode ended up really shocked me.  What happened to her really shocked me. There were a lot of things that really shocked me.  There were a couple parts where it got sorta boring, but, I think the only reason I felt that way was because one of the people that I went with isn't really in to horror movies, and I didn't want him to be bored..lol, so in a way I was bored with him.  But, if i would have went by myself, I would have loved the entire film.  Anyway, I thought the ending was good, but what happened wasn't really surprising.  You wanna know my thoughts on making another one?  Bad Idea!  I mean, there is really no need to make another one, is there? Michael finally accomplished what he set out to do twenty four years ago. There isn't any reason to continue this franchise.  End it while it was good.  We don't want to ruin a good thing.  But, in conclusion, this was a good movie.",Halloween - Resurrection
467,EvilCenobite,This movie is insulting!,1,15 July 2002,"This movie is total TRASH!  I don't care if I get attacked for my review on this piece of crap.  I am sick and tired of reading reviews of you true ""Halloween Fans"" about how good this movie is.  This movie is pointless. Now that Laurie Storde is dead there is no more story to tell.  Dr. Loomis is dead, everyone is dead.  There is Josh Hartnett but we all know he will not be in another Halloween film because he is too big of a star now.  So for the rest of the series we are going to be stuck with idiotic college students who have nothing to do with Michael Myers's past.  H20 had the perfect ending to the series, Laurie got her revenge and Michael finally was dead.  But that idiot MOUSTAPHA AKKAD got money hungry again and greenlighted this piece of garbage.  Like one reviewer said earlier that he regrets killing of Ellie Cornell's character Rachel because of the fans, well what about Laurie Strode, she was the first and main star besides Loomis in the series, and does he regret killing her off, No!  I know Jamie lee Curtis did not want to be in this film, and you know what I do not blame her one bit!  Look who she would have been acting with, BUSTA CRAP and TYRA BANKS.  But do something with the character some other way.  The series is now pointless, his whole family is dead, there is no more story to tell. Now this series is just going to turn into a Jason movie.  I like Jason Movies but I always thought Halloween had a better storyline than Friday the 13th.  Now its just going to be KILL KILL KILL anyone.  That is not How Michael Myers works, he does not kill for fun, he kills because he kills his family.  His family is dead.  So now we are stuck with idiots who have nothing to do with Michael.  That is why it should have ended with H20. This movie also makes H20 pointless.  The whole point was for Laurie Strode to get her revenge and win,  but this movie took all that away from it for the sake of money.  I am sorry for complaining so much, I am just really insulted that how this series is going to end up in the future.  I grew up watching these movies, and I know some of the sequals were bad, (PART 5 and 6) but at least those movies has characters attached to Myers.  This one has no one.  And if I get attacked for my review well so be it.  This is how my feelings feel and they are not going to change,  worst wishes to Halloween 9.",Halloween - Resurrection
468,moviefreak31-1,The Night HE Sold Out.,3,17 July 2002,"The following contains SPOILERS, so beware.I can't say too much here about Halloween Resurrection that hasn't already been said, but I certainly can reveal a TRUE Halloween fan's reaction to what I consider the worst installment of this franchise.  It should be said that the original Halloween is my favorite movie of all time, so perhaps I am a bit biased here.  Yet Halloween 8 stands as a prime example of a studio (shame on you, Dimension) catering to the largest audience possible to maximize profits.  The filmmakers have clearly lost the heart and soul that made the original so effective.  What worked for the first Halloween was SIMPLICITY.  Realistic characters, the setting of the small town (go back and watch again and see how deserted, how HAUNTED Haddonfield feels in the first one), and a simple story.   Now, all of a sudden we have heroines attacking with chainsaws and Busta Rhymes doing karate on what was once a no-nonsense killer.  Please!  Back in 1978 Michael NEVER would have put up with this guy!The movie starts off fairly mediocre.  Having a remix of John Carpenter's classic theme over the Dimension logo got me pumped, and putting Laurie in the same mental state as her brother (loved how she stares out that window) was a nice touch.  I'm mixed on Laurie being killed off.  On the one hand, at least her torment is over for good (or so we think).  But on the flip side, a legendary character of the horror genre has been disposed of.  Wow, all those years of happily seeing Laurie survive so much torment just went down the drain.  Kinda feels like a waste of time rooting for her knowing that in the end she falls victim to the knife.  I'm still not quite sure how she thought hanging Michael and dropping him a few feet over the roof would finally kill this guy once and for all.  I mean, let's face it: the guy's a monster.  He's survived God knows how many beatings, and this is gonna be his ultimate demise?  Come on, Laurie, you're smarter than that.
The rest of the film I could really care less about in terms of story.  For me, the Halloween series ended when Laurie falls off that roof (actually, I previously thought it ended with the exciting finale of H20, but so much for that conclusion.  Thanks again, Dimension).  It's obvious that the producers are taking the films in a different direction now, and that's fine.  I can accept the fact that these movies will never be what they once were.  But goodness, can us die-hard fans please get a little respect?  Comedy has NO PLACE in a Halloween film.  If so, it should NOT come at what is regarded as the `climax.'  That's what separates the Halloween films from other milked horror franchises- Michael Myers is one of the few killers left we aren't yet rooting for.  Self-parody belongs in movies like Jason X and Bride of Chucky, NOT Halloween!  Can you imagine, in 1978 at the climax of Halloween, Laurie Strode dancing around Michael, poking him with that coat hanger while making Mr. Miyagi noises?  Sheesh.  I will admit that the scene with Busta Rhymes in costume mouthing off at the real Michael had me in stitches. There's just something about picturing Michael, with all his inner rage bottled up over the years, finally getting it all off his chest that puts a smile on my face.  But that's AS FAR as the humor should go.  When the comedy is PART of the scene, not the RESULT of it.There were a few things about Halloween Resurrection that I liked.   Aside from the atrocious script, bad one-liners (oh God, make it stop), and bland characters, much of the technical side of the film was impressive.  Danny Lux's score, while unfortunately not including many of the themes made popular in the original, was certainly a step-up from H20's overdone mix and Halloween 6's grating guitar rifts.  I appreciated the minimum use of locations as well, and for the Myers house being such a tight set, the cinematography and lighting were effective.Rick Rosenthal was an interesting choice as director, and as long as he didn't linger on Busta too long he did a good job.  While he handled the mix of the actual film with the Dangertainment footage appropriately, I still couldn't help but be let down with the lack of a Halloween night vibe to the movie.  Halloween II is a pretty mediocre sequel, but the one thing Rosenthal effectively captured in that film was a sense of doom threatening the entire town on an otherwise quiet evening.  Watching that movie, you start to believe that Michael truly could be in your backyard, staring at you through a window.  Here, the town of Haddonfield does not at all seem like the character it has been in previous installments.  As an audience, we're hardly ever pulled into the dark history surrounding this town's past, and for me that definitely took away from the movie.  And the film LOOKS like it was shot in the spring or summer, which proved to be quite distracting.There is one small sequence where Rosenthal brought me back to that unnerving feeling of 1978.  The camera booms down from a tree branch fluttering in the wind to a group of trick-or-treaters running down the street, as they place a jack-o-lantern on the front porch of the Myers house.  There's just an eerie combination of the way this sequence was shot, the innocence of the children against the evildoings inside the house, and Lux's ominous music that, for me, was the most effective part in the movie (albeit a small one).

469,servoet,Worst horror movie I've ever seen,1,18 July 2002,"I enjoy horror movies a great deal, and even though, since part four, each successive Halloween is disappointing, I continue to see them.  I love the original so much, that I just want to love every sequel as well.  But Halloween: Resurrection is without a doubt, the worst horror movie I've ever seen.  Even for a slasher film, which is a genre known for it's lack of plot and characterization, this movie stands above the rest as an example of awfulness.People have said, ""Just relax and enjoy; it's just a slasher film.""  Yeah, well so is the original and it manages to have likeable characters and an actual story.  This abomination, however, can't even make us root for Michael Meyers to kill all the annoying people.  And because events are part of a live broadcast on the internet, not only do we get to watch this garbage, we get to watch OTHER PEOPLE watching it.  Just sickening.",Halloween - Resurrection
470,egon2169,why comedy?,8,18 July 2002,"I am not disappointed with this movie but I am not overly excited with it either.  The whole comical relief with Busta Rhymes I thought was stupid, and they were reaching for ideas with the ""under the house living space"". On a brighter note the slaughters were good and Michael went back to his roots (Halloween I, II, 4 (6 was good too)) with his slow and perdition killing ways, unlike in H20.  I did however like a lot how the beginning of Resurrection summed up the end of H20.  They did that very well.  But once again like in H20 the whole coming down from the ceiling with one arm was retarded.  The whole Laurie Strode thing upset me, but I won't go there. Overall the movie was good and I do recommend it to all Halloween fans and for any for anybody wanting to become a fan.See ya in the theatres>",Halloween - Resurrection
471,siva670,THE WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,1,21 July 2002,"You would have to be a complete moron to give an ounce of credit to this worthless excuse of a (so-called) horror movie. First thing is there is nothing remotely scary. Not ONE good scare in the whole, entire movie. It is one endless false scare after another.Second thing is the acting. ""Note to Busta""- You can't act and you sure ain't funny. The rest of the cast may not be that bad but what can you do with writing this bad. There is sooooo much more to say about this piece of crap that I don't even know where to begin. I will say that the idea intrigued me when I first heard about the whole reality show concept but really it went nowhere fast. I can't believe that Jamie Lee Curtis had the nerve to express her disgust with the other Halloween movies(4-6)and then does this to her career. May you get what you deserve. You may think I am being harsh, but Michael Myers was the BOOGEYMAN that scared me when I was young. I remember watching the first two Halloween movies every Halloween. It was such a great experience to be curled up on your sofa in the living room, everyone else was asleep or out. The fear was so incredible, and so great at the same time. You just knew Michael was waiting in your kitchen. I hate to see that destroyed just to make a quick buck. I will never watch another new Halloween movie again. Thanks for nothing, Rick.",Halloween - Resurrection
472,Histeve426,Great Addition to the Series.,9,23 July 2002,"Halloween: Resurrection was a great movie.  Four years after the last 'Halloween' movie, this one turns out to be a re-freshing, new, up-to-the-moment thriller.

473,MOTABLAN,cool,10,26 July 2002,"this was one of the best halloween movies i've seen in a long time.  the ones before this one were all right but didn't really say much about why michael myers became the way he is. the fact that they were trapped in the house was cool. the killing scenes were good all except one but hey the movie itself and the rest of the killing scenes makes up for it. the ending was kinda trippy and for some reason i sense another halloween movie coming out, but we'll see what happens. by the way, ever notice how the hottest chic always lives at the end?  take it easy y'all.",Halloween - Resurrection
474,ferrisdagreat,Worst film I have ever seen.,1,23 February 2003,"This was the first movie that has ever made me want to vomit.  Storyline was so farfetched and the acting was some of the worst I have ever seen in my life.  Busta Rhymes proves my theory, ""If you sing it gives you no right to act"".  I wasted about two hours of my life on this movie please dont do that to yourself.  Never see this movie.",Halloween - Resurrection
475,pkrupa,"...FINALLY, a respectable sequel in the halloween series...",8,30 July 2002,"I enjoyed this sequel. I was very happy that Resurrection was made. At first, I thought, ""not another H2O."" (I felt H2O was disappointing because it was a knock-off...err, 2000 remake of the original.)I highly recommend this sequel, it is very scary and very intelligent. There are, of course, typical flaws, but not ones that ruin the illusion of the movie. I give it my thumbs up and a respectable 8 out of 10 for a horror/suspense/thriller.",Halloween - Resurrection
476,imago17sx,Truly a disappointment and waist of precious money.,1,6 August 2002,"I must say, this movie seemed to be disappointing from the very opening scenes.  I have been a huge fan of horror movies in my days, and to tell the truth, this movie did not cut it.  From the beginning, it seemed as if the writers wanted to cut to the chase.  This movie lacked a plot completely and could not deliver a sense of enjoyment throughout.  The so called ""scary, gruesome scenes"" were not scary at all.  I actually laughed through those scenes and people in the front row were startled at my disgust.  What disgust is that? The disgust that aroused when I remembered I payed $12.99 for this crap. The actors were, no doubt, pathetic playing their non-believable roles.  It was as if they were picked out of a high school classroom.  Absolutely no talent.  Anyways, it is recommended you do not watch this movie at all, but do so if your a crazed fan as I.",Halloween - Resurrection
477,TheShapesWrath,Better than expected !!,9,31 August 2002,"I cannnot believe how entertaining this film was for a sequel. It has had bad buzz from the start and turned out to be awesome. Just a few things though. After this sequel it should finlly put it to a rest. Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie Strode has fianlly been killed off and thats that. The plot of this movie was interesting to see because it led the series into something new. The characters were ""Ok"" not great though. The music was really good. I now have the soundtrack to the film because of the new Halloween theme. It was awesome. It wasn't to orchestrated and kept the score easy and quick. The film was actually funny at a certain extent. I honestly thought that Busta Rhymes would mess up this sequel, but I was wrong. He did pretty good and made me laugh espescially the one scene when he and Michael are face to face and he tells Michael off. The entire theatre laughed at that scene and myself as well. The death scenes were pretty cool and not to gory. I had heard that one of the reasons of the re-shoots of this film was because of some of the over-the-top cheesy death scenes and the ending. But really the death scenes and ending were fine and pleased me very much. Some of the dialogue is cheesy but oh well. It didn't bother me that much. Overall, this film was damn good and much better than 'Jason X'. That movie was terrible, absolutely terrible. But I liked this film very much and I'm sure I will buy it when it hits DVD shelves. One thing, I seriously hope that they stop at this one because, if they keep going with it, it will mess it up and start to get dumb. 'Halloween: Resurrection' = 9 1/2 stars",Halloween - Resurrection
478,cal-music-man,Whats people's problem with this movie?,7,28 January 2009,"first I'd like to say this movie's reason for existence is a lil lame (how they explain Michael being alive) but isn't that the same for every slasher sequel? i think so. i really enjoyed this movie for a few reasons, Laurie dies, there's a certain kill that reminds me of john carpenters original, its pretty gory n it holds suspense IF and ONLY IF you can accept it for what it is, the 8th movie in a very basic series. If you're gonna whine about busta rhymes bein there, you're taking it waaay too seriously, LL Cool J was in H20 and there was no backlash, busta allows you to laugh n remind yourself it is the 8th n by now the directors n producers can have a joke n laugh about the movie. just look at jason takes manhattan, seriously crap but people took it too seriously while the film is pretty much a joke. this on the other hand isn't a joke but makes for a good night of slashes n stabs with a few laughs in between. the halloween franchise is my favourite out of the slasher series' but cuz i lightened up.",Halloween - Resurrection
479,carloarias,great job with the music,4,4 November 2002,"I think you can tell the director´sinclination for a TV like thriller. The flow and the rithm of the movie is OK, but it´s like you are watching a TV series. The music and the sound effects are very helpful, nothing shocking about the images. it could be better.",Halloween - Resurrection
480,acpynn30,The best for me personally since the first,9,21 December 2002,"I have seen two different versions of this film, one was an on-line thing, the other was what finally came out. The latter was much more polished and much better. They have actually a very good script and they both answer and ask a lot of new questions. It started like the typical slasher flick but tended to be more stylized and thankfully very UN-Scream-like.It is amazing to see a character still be this fresh into what is his 7th entry in the series. Before you diss this as just another slasher flick remember it is number 8 in a series and that it is this good is phenomenal.",Halloween - Resurrection
481,SharkExpert78-1,Bad Ass!!!!!!!!!,9,29 December 2002,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** I don't care what you people say Halloween: Resurrection was damn good. The story is about a group of kids:Sara,Rudy,Bill,Jim,Jen,and Donna. These six kids do it for scholarships not money, suddenly they all start dying. This movie is good and the best since the first, and it is good to see someone direct who directed a Halloween before. Although there is one thing I did not get, Thomas Ian Nicholas is third in the casting and is mentioned on the back of the movie but he is the first one to die out of the teens. It doesn't make sense.",Halloween - Resurrection
482,sandor-enckell,"It's not all bad, but pretty bad...",3,2 November 2009,"Well, OK, I'm not a fan of the Halloween series, the only one I've seen other than this, is the first one. I'll say the flaws I noticed, while watching. 1) At the beginning, Laurie, is going to ""kill"" Michael. Now, is she stupid or something...? She has him hanging over a roof and thinks he will die when he hits the ground, when she 20 years ago expirienced stabbing him twice, seeing him get shot several times, falling off a balcony, and still be alive. 2) The acting was bad. 3) Sara, the maincharacter, screams at one time so loud that a glass breaks. This never happens again later in the film, which makes the scene: useless. 4) It was predictable, and you didn't really care if anyone died.I bought this movie, and wanted to see a horror movie, and that was what I got. The only good things were that you got scared sometimes, the beginning with the great acting of Jamie Lee Curtis (even though she was stupid at the end of her scene), and I also liked the ending. It showes that Michael is not a usual psycho, he is the Boogey Man, something that is forever.",Halloween - Resurrection
483,audrey-18,what was this?,1,28 October 2005,"First of all I'm a huge fan of the Halloween series i love scary movies especially the Halloween series. thats why i cant stand this movie first of all I've seen them all Halloween,2,3(dont watch it),Return of Michel Myers,5,6 and H2o and i love them all except this one because A.its dumb what installment of Halloween would have a concept like staying in Micheal myers old house as a OnLiNe reality show especially one with a name like dangertainment and whats with Busta rhymes character doing all that weird Karate crap in fact only one thing added to the story anyway and thats that Laurie Strood ""finally"" got killed but that was within the first thirty minutes(i would of saved it to the end)and that crazy phsyco patient forget all about Halloween 4,5and 6 he was listing off the kills and only talked about 1,2 and h20 as if the other movies didn't count and there's been a lot of times they killed Mike over the and he always lives but being Electrocuted come on he cant be alive anyway overall the movie was the worst in the series even worse than Halloween 3 that had nothing to do with the rest of the movies and as a die hard Halloween fan i admit i despise this movie and hope the next one is way better.",Halloween - Resurrection

This character was a total ignorant,annoying as hell,I could'nt wait for him to get killed,now that would've made my day! I give this one a 1,only rent if you really want to lose 90 min. of your life.I have no idea what they were thinking when they made this garbage, that's right...they was'nt!",Halloween - Resurrection
486,angmarsrealm,Not great but not terrible,8,11 October 2005,"Yes I admit I liked it despite the tech flaws and mostly flat acting. Busta Rhymes wasn't the best but hardly the bomb some would say. If he is, then blame the director who needed to do just that; direct. As it seems, its like he made the film by consensus. Second; fire the continuity person, he/she did a terrible job. Big diff between continuity and editing. Bianca Kajlich (?) while pretty was wimpy at times with her inexplicable screaming but did better when she summoned up some spine. Someone said there was a prob when Michael impales Sean Patrick's character. I took it for granted that the knives went in when Michael lifted him off his feet jammed the knives through the door then picked up the third knife. He didn't grow a third hand lol. Next was the scene where he's shown not to have been decapitated was a very good way to 'resurrect' him, as opposed to Jason and Freddy. Crushed voicebox was a good way to explain it but dumbed down as who wouldn't notice a paramedic carrying a knife around? So much more could have been done but still; an enjoyable timewaster. Didn't expect the bust through the mirror scene which actually made me jump, lol. A ninth? Only if it is a final movie with Michael hunting his last living relation; his nephew John. And only with Josh Hartnett signed on.",Halloween - Resurrection
487,ai_lb_fAN,Not as bad as people say !,8,26 June 2005,"There are a lot of people saying this movie is really bad, and ruins the Halloween series. I think not. I am a massive Halloween fan and think that after H20, we didn't want to see Laurie Strode running around and surviving for a 90 min film again. Introducing the new characters help give the film a new feel. A modern feel. Bianca Kajlich was a brilliant, a real asset to the franchise. Her great acting helped the film in any area's it lacked. The killing scenes were original and experimental, great. The death toll isn't to high or to low. Good for a 21st century horror film. The opening scenes are the greatest opening scenes in the Halloween series. The only downers on this film is the lack of suspense that the other films carried. This doesn't show to much as there are action scenes. Also, there are a number of flaws. These are hard to see if you're enjoying the film. I love it.",Halloween - Resurrection

489,valencia-harrington,Jamie lee Curtis,7,30 August 2005,"this was a really good movie, but i didn't like how Jamie's character dies within the first 20minutes. the entire Halloween collection was based on Micheal either killing his sister or running into another relative while looking for her. now that she's dead it doesn't seem like the Halloween series is going to go very far with another sequel unless they find away to bring Laurie Strode back into the picture. even so, i still enjoyed this film. being a fan of Michael Myers since the age of 4, any Halloween film that comes out, i will still watch. however the only other thing that i found upsetting about the film was how it branched off from Halloween:H20. that movie in itself was a perfect 10 for me, but then when Halloween resurrection came out, it seemed to undermine the great story-line of H20.",Halloween - Resurrection
490,lameerwho,yeah i loved it,8,7 September 2005,"So Halloween: Resurrection... number eight. Of course this movie wasn't the best of all the Halloweens, but it was viewable and it kept me entertained. More gore used then all the others, which was liable to happen, considering thats what every one wants now... just look at all the other horror flicks AND their titles (Bloody Murder 2, Freddy vs. Jason (which at the time wasn't competing against this movie but is getting put out there)) gore isn't what makes a movie scary, just makes you look the other way, BUT, with the brilliance I think this movie had taken on (yes I said brilliance), I think it at least deserves an 8. What other movie in 2002 can say they used modern technology (internet) to lure kids into wanting to see this film?Michael Myers (to me) is the scariest killer/murderer ever created in time. He doesn't need to say a word... he walks like he knows he's going to kill the next person he does, which scares me even more. The classic mask, the classic suit. This movie could have been better, but was brilliant in my mind, but I'm sick and twisted, what are you going to listen to me for?rent it!... actually if your a complete moron and call yourself and horror flick fan and haven't seen the original Halloween, go rent that first.

And NOW their making HALLOWEEN 9 just for money if you watch the deleted scenes on HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION they whack a Axe in his head and he's dead, People need money don't they. Some Think Michael Myers should of stopped in HALLOWEEN 2 but others say no way. I think H20 and Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers are the best. Laurie Strode is Michael Myers 57th victim out of 62. This movie is alright. When they find the head it looks different it's just the head not the head and neck. The mask is different but still looks cool.",Halloween - Resurrection
