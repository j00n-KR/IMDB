0,Leofwine_draca,One of the worst remakes,2,27 May 2019,"As remakes go, SUSPIRIA has to be one of the very worst out there. It's a film which copies the general set-up and plot of the original, but there the similarities end. I'm a huge fan of Dario Argento, one of my favourite directors, and the original film is an obvious favourite. This remake was made by an arthouse director with no interest in creating a horror movie at all. Instead we get two and a half hours of tedium punctuated by the occasional weird bit.The story is slow, static, and entirely without merit, populated by bland actors giving bland characters very little to do. If I wanted to watch a film about ballet made in an interesting way I'd go back to the excellent BLACK SWAN. This has an admittedly shocking scene in which a dancer is assailed by an invisible antagonist and an awful kooky climax which I ended up having to skip, it's done in such a ridiculous way. Cast-wise, the ubiquitous Tilda Swinton, so beloved of arthouse directors, fails to make an impact, and Dakota Johnson is just bland.",Suspiria
1,SnoopyStyle,part grind part amaze,6,1 February 2019,It's 1977 Berlin in an atmosphere of political terrorism. Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) is a wide-eyed amateur new to the free avant-garde Tanz Dance Academy. Former dancer Patricia Hingle disappeared and her psychiatrist Josef Klemperer reads her journals. Tilda Swinton plays multiple characters.This is about three quarter grind and a quarter amaze balls. The grind is a lethargic slow procession. Dakota is also lethargic and struggles to be the lead. Her 50 shades acting has infected this movie. She barely stands out in the sea of wraithlike dancers. It's weird and arthouse beautiful. It's meandering. It's a real grind except when it's amaze balls. The first contortion kill is crazy and good and crazy good. It is visually aggressive and artful. It's new and everything I want from this movie. It's also the best the movie ever gets. There are some good moments after that but they don't exceed it. I can see how some may like the arthouse horror aspect but I suspect that more will not like the slow grind. It's two and a half hours and I wouldn't mind cutting out a good half hour out.,Suspiria
2,Horst_In_Translation,Only working at times,4,11 December 2018,"Here we have ""Suspiria"", perhaps the biggest dancing-themed film of the year 2018. The director is Luca Guadagnino and while his collaboration with James Ivory turned out a very big Oscar-winning success recently, here he takes on an old movie by Italian legendary filmmaker Dario Argento, so maybe working a bit with/on his personal heroes now. It's not really an appraoch I would have expected by Guadagnino. Anyway, the script this time is by David Kajganich and it's not his first collaboration with Guadagnino and same can surely be said about Tilda Swinton as well, who plays one of the central characters here. It is a very female-centered movie with the big names all being women. In the middle of it is Dakota Johnson and add to that Swinton, Moretz, Testud, Goth and also old German actresses like Fassbinder regular Caven and Winkler. Especially the latter's inclusion surprised me quite a bit. This film is set several decades back, actually during the years of left-wing terrorism by Baader Meinhof and these political references are thrown in on several occasions during the film. But honestly, they made zero impact to be honest. There is not a single moment when this is a political movie and there was no point in making these inclusions. The heart and soul of the film is at the ballet school as we get to witness Johnson's character's rise to fame and success in the light of previous students who stand up against Swinton and the school as a whole. They have to face serious consequences as indeed the school is a coven and everybody working in it is witches. This is the major plot twist, although it becomes pretty obvious quickly that there are supernatural forces at work when some of the unpleasant students are brutally tortured. I assume these scenes take place in a similar manner in the Argento film? I am not sure, but they are among the better moments overall really.Then there also is the story of the old man investigating what happens there and if there is really evil included, the one who meets Moretz early on. A bit of a pity really, CGM has so little screen time only. Would have loved to see her more often, but yeah there is a topless scene for the fans I suppose. I mean she clearly has lost her bait Lolita image by now as an actress and I like her and hope she can become a successful grown-up actress. The talent is there. Now back to this film we got here. One main reason why I am giving it only 2 out of 5 and a negative recommendation is the ending really. The story with the old man was already mediocre from the start, but him meeting his sweetheart again through the witches' magic tricking him is not half as effective or emotional as I wanted it to be. And then honestly, the Marcos revelation well, yes it is fairly gross, no denying, but it does not feel real. I mean she takes out a powerful witch like Swinton's character and then basically loses easily to Johnson's? Hard for me to believe really, even if the trick to beating Marcos is not through pure power, but through tricking her I suppose. Still, it did not feel right to witness the main character's rise to power this way. She did not depict the ruthlessness throughout the film that I wanted to see in her to make such an ending seem realistic. Well, as realistic as it can be in a fantasy horror film. Visually, the movie is good I suppose. Costumes, music and also sets were fairly impressive most of the time and I would not be surprised if the film sccores one or two Oscar nominations in these departments, especially given the love they handed to Guadagnino's previous project. But I am disappointed still. As a Berlin citizen and the film taking place in my town, I hoped for more to be honest. It is a bit of style over substance and also way too long. Could have been a more convincing watch at 100 minutes or so, 120 minutes max with better focus of course. But the way it actually turned out, I would not want to watch it again. Perhaps give it a go if you really care about ballet-themed films or professional dancing in movies. Even liking the main actors won't be enough otherwise because I do like Johnson and Swinton for example and still it did very little for me, so my overall suggestion is to watch something else instead. It's a miss and could have been in theory a far superior film than it actually turned out to be.",Suspiria
3,nogodnomasters,Lies that tell the truth,6,13 February 2019,"Susie (Dakota Johnson ) leaves her humble Mennonite farm to travel to 1977 Berlin to join Madame Blanc's (Tilda Swinton) dance group. Susie very quickly assimulates into the group. Issues arise with dancers who go missing and die. The show goes on.This is a different type of film. I thought the performances were extremely well done. Dakota Johnson nailed the role. The genre was presented a little artsy with too many slow scenes. Might take a second viewing. Salomé + ""The Craft?Guide: F-word. Nudity.",Suspiria
4,kosmasp,How to remake,9,6 May 2019,"While I really liked the weirdness of the Original (you can't really put your finger on it and what it tried to tell us), this really steps up to the task. I know that just writing this or just the rating will have some fans of the Original riled up. Now I'm not trying to take anything away from your memories or your taste, so if you are reading on, I thank you for being open minded.For anyone unaware of the original, you do not have to have seen it, to enjoy this. But you can watch both, because they differ on enough levels to make them both enticing and interesting to watch. Even a double will would be something that made sense. And whichever order you want to watch them. Though I think it would make sense to watch Argentos Suspiria first. We have different characters here, we have an amount violence and depicted visual explicit pain enducing scenes, that this is not for the faint of hearted. If you are squeamish, do not - I repeat: do NOT watch this! But if you stomach the visceral and painful moments (there are not that many and they are mixed well with the story), you will love the rest too.Great storytelling and a weirdness that can hold up to that of the original. And really great acting to go along with everything.",Suspiria
5,BA_Harrison,Makes me appreciate the original a bit more.,3,15 January 2019,"The original Suspiria (1977) is considered by many to be the best film from Italian director Dario Argento. I don't agree. The garish colours, the cacophonous soundtrack, the silly premise (a renowned dance school is a front for a coven of witches): apart from a couple of inventive kills, it just didn't work for me (I prefer Tenebrae and Phenomena).I had hoped that the remake would address these problems, but it's actually even worse.In contrast to Argento's colourful movie, Suspiria 2018 is a drab arthouse affair, set in a bleak cold war Berlin and made all the more dull by lots of pretentious waffle, pointless political subtext and an excess of interpretive dance. If watching a roomful of girls writhe and jerk awkwardly in the name of art for the best part of two and a half hours is your idea of fun, then have at it, but I found the majority of the film mind numbingly boring, with the exception of one scene: one of the girls is horribly twisted and bent out of shape, limbs snapping and popping as she is bent into a human pretzel. I wished the same fate on all involved.Amazingly, I hung in there for the duration - surely it would all make sense in the end - but the finale is even more incomprehensible than all that has gone before, with people inexplicably exploding while naked witches gyrate. All that and a horrible soundtrack with whiny vocals from Thom Yorke. Makes me long for Goblin's Satanic prog-rock racket.2.5 out of 10, rounded up to 3 for pretzel girl.",Suspiria
6,BandSAboutMovies,The pain is more off screen for the viewer...,3,17 January 2019,"You may -- or may not -- have noticed that for all the Argento films I've reviewed, I've never spoken about 1977's Suspiria. This supernatural horror -- not giallo -- movie is hard for me to write about because it's above reproach. It is, as I've mentioned about other films, an absolute movie, one whose kaleidoscopic and sonic assault -- courtesy of Goblin -- blast you from the moment the film begins. I can't really say anything new or add anything that hasn't been said and I doubt anyone wants to read me gushing about the colors or murders in the film ad nauseam. If you haven't seen it, do so. Please watch it instead of this movie.That's the hardest part of this article. I am predisposed to hate this movie. And I've tried to be objective and open minded, because in the past, I've hated movies before I even had the chance to watch them. I didn't want this to be the case. I wanted to not be taken in by the hype or other reviews and watch this on its own merits. But I'll be honest: it really has none. If it were a movie by any other name, no one would care about it.Life is short and there isn't enough time to tell people how much you love them or to enjoy all the magical art and fun there is in the world, so wasting two hours and thirty-two minutes on this meandering slop has me a little peeved. And that's when I remember the indulgent reviews and the top movies of the year list that this topped. Have the standards for what makes a great movie really slipped so much in the last decade or two? Of course, they have. That's a rhetorical question.Now, I could raise issues like the fact that at no time did I know or care about the characters and their motivations, but in truth, the original has the same problems. It's kind of patently ridiculous to complain about narrative structure when you're discussing a film inspired by Argento.Maybe I never danced. Maybe I don't speak enough German. Or French. Maybe I don't appreciate winter colors. These are the questions that, well, pirouetted through my head as I endured this movie. It had that dreaded moment where I paused the film, sure that this had to be the conclusion of the proceedings, only to discover I still had fifty-one minutes of pain left, minutes that would feel like the hand on the stove versus the time spent with a beautiful woman.Let me see if I can summarize this: Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson, who has darkened my screen way too many times recently and yet I give her chance after chance, perhaps because her dad was the voice of Chuckles in GI Joe: The Movie and her mom was both Cherry 2000 and Holly Body) is a Mennonite from Ohio who gets into the Markos Dance Academy in West Berlin. The school is still recovering from the loss of another student, Patricia (Chloë Grace Moretz) who disappeared after she told her therapist Josef Klemperer that all of her teachers are witches.Just a moment here to let you know that Tilda Swinton as Madame Blanc, Mother Helena Markos and Dr. Josef Klemperer (which she is credited for as Lutz Ebersdorf, with Eber meaning boar/swine and dorf meaning town, hence the last name is Swinton). You won't be snowed by this stunt casting. In fact, you'll notice it and keep wondering about it and it will make you escape the flimsy plot and wonder when you can put another movie in your blu ray player. It's amazing to see Swinton in what manages to be an Eddie Murphy role, ala Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, where you keep saying, ""Look, there she is. She's in a man costume. Now she's herself. Now she's an old woman! Wow!"" Except you don't really say wow. There's no moment that I uttered those three letters and I had plenty of running time to get them out of my mouth.The truth is that the Three Mothers -- Mater Tenebrarum, Mater Lachrymarum, and Mother Suspiriorum -- are running things. Susie will be their instrument of taking out others, like Olga, who is basically turned inside out by dance. Supposedly this scene upset people so badly that they left. I have no idea why. I mean, it's certainly gross, but nothing that blew my mind as was promised.Also: why is there so much pee in this movie?The witches all have an argument about who is in charge and decide that Mother Markos, an ancient crone who has controlled the coven for as long as anyone can remember, will remain in control and get a new body. All of the witches taunt a cop who comes to investigate and also have knives that look like rib bones.All sorts of exploration -- by another student named Sara -- leads to her leg being broken and her switching eyes with Susie, then they all dance this performance called Volk. Sara dances robotically, controlled by the slowly giving in to evil person who we've been led to believe is our heroine. The dancing nearly kills everyone, because like fashion, dance is danger. As Klemperer escapes the performance, he meets up with his wife (original star Jessica Harper) who he thought long dead. In truth, she leads him back to the school.I have no idea how to put together the end of all this, but damn, I'm gonna try. Susie renounces her mother, who dies somewhere in Ohio, just as that old woman -- who has been on her deathbed for the entire movie -- mentions that her daughter is the stain that she let loose on the world. That's because everyone else is a false mother and Susie really is Mother Suspiriorum. Nearly everyone dies by being danced to death. There's also so much red light in this scene that it becomes difficult to watch. This aspires to high art, one assumes. I could also be totally off and there's some intricate meaning that I haven't grasp, but I also compared this movie to an Eddie Murphy fart movie a few paragraphs ago.Somehow, Blanc and Klemperer survive. Then, Susie comes to his bedside and explains how his wife died in a concentration camp before erasing his memories. Actually, I had no idea that that was what happened and Wikipedia was my friend, so there you go.After the credits, Susie breaks the wall of reality and erases the audience's memories, which is an awesome idea, because then they can forget the sheer boring snail race that they just crawled through. Sadly, I shut the movie off before this happened so I will have to always live with the Bataan Death March-like pain of this inept piece of offal.Other than that, Mr. Lincoln, did you enjoy the play?Thanks for asking.Before Luca Guadagnino directed this, David Gordon Green was attached, in his bid to ruin every auteur horror film that I have ever loved. He had to settle for last year's Halloween, another movie I hope I never have to see ever again. Then again, seeing as how my wife just bought the DVD, all hope is gone.I also have no idea what the Red Army Faction and Lufthansa Flight 181 subplot had to do with any of this. Maybe I'm on the side of Richard Brody from the New Yorker, who said that this movie ""...has nothing to say about women's history, feminist politics, civil violence, the Holocaust, the Cold War, or German culture. Instead, Guadagnino thrusts some thusly labeled trinkets at viewers and suggests that they try to assemble them. The result is sordid, flimsy Holocaust kitsch, fanatical chic, with all the actual political substance of a designer Che T-shirt.""Suspiria desperately wants to be about something, anything, to appear to be a movie that matters. It is, to use that hoary old chestnut, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. As much as I like Radiohead, that sound here is blah. As much as I like drone, it doesn't work here, as the soundtrack is bleats and blips against a grey canvas that does not inspire.It might be about women. It might be about 1977. It might be about witches. But ultimately, it is a film about nothing. It has convinced some of the filmgoing public that it has deep and meaningful things to say. I've always seen the original as a haunted house on film -- a bewildering odyssey into colors, noise and terror. It ends just like a real-life scarehouse -- Jessica Harper's Suzy is running away from the burning school, a smile on her face, breathlessly alive despite all she has witnessed. It's the exhilarating thrill of someone working as hard as they can to scare you and the release that comes from that. None of those feelings were conjured here. The only one I received was relief that I could finally turn this off as the credits ran.Plus, there's also the issue of the film being sued for copyright infringement by the estate of artist Ana Mendieta, with a total of ten images being mentioned as direct lifts of the artist's work. A settlement has been reached, but I guess true art still steals?Guadagnino has mentioned making prequels and sequels to this film. There are no films I look forward to watching less, unless someone forces me to watch this again.",Suspiria
7,preppy-3,Horrendous remake.,1,12 November 2018,"Redo of Dario Argento's masterpiece. Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) goes from the US to Germany to attend a dance academy. She soon finds out it's run by witches and they want her to join them. The original was only 98 minutes long, done in super bright color, moved like lightning and had a terrifying score. This one goes OVER 150 minutes, looks drab and dreary, has terrible acting, ugly gore, gratuitous female nudity and ends up not making a lot of sense. There are pointless sequences involving politics and dull dance lessons. Also way too many dance sequences which are just laughably bad. My audience sat through it all quietly until the ending. At that point it got so stupid and OTT people started laughing! Dull, pointless and insulting. Skip it.",Suspiria
8,george.schmidt,All of them riches; decent remake to a horror classic,9,17 August 2020,"SUSPIRIA (2018) ***1/2 Dakota Johnson, Tilda Swinton, Chloe Grace Moretz, Angela Winkler, Alek Wek, Elena Fokina, Mia Goth, Malgorzata Bela, Ingrid Caven, Sylvie Testud (cameo: Jessica Harper) Filmmaker Luca Guadagnino's Herculean task of re-imagining Dario Argento's contemporary horror classic is in many ways better than its predecessor in some ways - namely the plot where a new dance student (Johnson) auditions for a prestigious German dance school for girls run by mysterious Swinton (in her prime having a field day in three roles) who is indeed a witch fronting a sinister coven. Eerie, shocking and at times beautiful (largely thanks to the cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom) with sprinkles of graphic violence for gorehounds to rejoice in. David Kajganich's screenplay - shrewdly incorporating the original's setting circa 1977 and amidst the war torn nation's history of regret - keeps things at an even keel with a few turns of the screw nicely. Personal note: had no idea Harper was involved and was so glad for her sweet presence again.",Suspiria
9,ferguson-6,has everything but not enough,5,26 October 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It makes perfect sense when you think about it. After three artsy prestige projects (CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, A BIGGER SPLASH, I AM LOVE), Oscar nominated Italian filmmaker Luca Guadagnino decides to let his freak flag fly. And what better way than to pay homage to his fellow countryman Dario Argento's 1977 surreal cult classic that featured a blinding color palette, obtuse camera angles, and enough schlock-horror (in a good way) to remain a midnight movie favorite for more than 40 years? While both movies are B**S**T crazy, we can't help but think a filmmaker of Mr. Guadagnino's caliber should have done better.Dakota Johnson (FIFTY SHADES OF GREY) stars as Susie, a Bambi-eyed self-trained dancer raised in Ohio by her Mennonite parents. Following her dream, she shows up for an audition at the world renowned Markos Dance Company in Berlin. The film is set in 1977 (the same year as the original was released) and Susie sufficiently impresses the company director Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton) to be invited to join.A title card informs us that we are about to undertake ""Six Acts and an Epilogue set in divided Berlin"". It should have added the run time of two-and-a-half hours (it seemed longer). For those of us who would pay to watch Tilda Swinton in any role, this one does deliver bonus value. The enormously talented actress who has disappeared into numerous characters over the years, plays two other roles here - disguised by heavy make-up in both. The trade-off is that Ms. Johnson is the lead, so not only are we subjected to the limitations of her acting, but also camera-trickery when it comes to her dance scenes. A bushy bushy red hairdo conceals her face during the most physically demanding dance sequences ... think Cousin It from ""The Addams Family"".An almost entirely female cast features some interesting choices from across generational and geographical boundaries. Angela Winkler and Ingrid Caven have long been familiar faces on the big screen, and Mia Goth and Chloe Grace Moretz are fine choices for the younger company members. As an added bonus, Jessica Harper appears in one segment towards the end. Ms. Harper played the lead role of Suzy in the original. Other fun comparisons between the two films are the original score by Goblin compared to the updated (and more serene) score by Thom Yorke of Radiohead, and the muted color palette chosen by Guadagnino and cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom for this updated version.The reason there is an open spot in the company for Susie is that Patricia (Chloe Grace Moretz) has disappeared after unloading her 'coven of witches' theory on an aged psychiatrist Dr. Josef Klemperer. Dr. Klemperer initially thinks the hysterical Patricia is delusional, and would prefer to wallow in his grief over his beloved wife Anke - missing since WWII. When Susie gets her shot at the lead in what is to be the company's final performance of its most famous dance piece Volk, we get the film's best sequence and one of a few WTF moments. A mirrored dance studio is the site of unexplained violence, and some terrific editing shoots us back and forth between art and mayhem. It's difficult to watch but exceedingly well done.Unfortunately, the truly bizarre and horrific moments are much too rare. In fact, some of the segments come off as unintentionally funny, which is not a good thing for a horror flick. The primal dancing never seems sensual, the bloodbath finale is too far over the top, and the political subtext with the Baader-Meinhof terrorist group just never seems to fit. While watching this, a few films came to mind: BLACK SWAN, THE WICKER MAN, MOTHER!, and ROSEMARY'S BABY, though this one doesn't reach the level of any of those. Sometimes a movie just doesn't lend itself to analysis or review, and it comes down to whether this is your cup of tea.",Suspiria
10,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Solid and enjoyable if slightly flawed effort,9,23 January 2019,"Leaving New York for Berlin, an American dancer enrolls in a prestigious, world-renowned dance academy and begins to study there, but the more she continues her studies the actions of those around her convince her that something sinister is lurking within the shadows of the studio's walls.This was quite an impressive and remarkable remake. One of the strongest elements of the film is the stellar work accomplished towards building up the threat of the witches' cult. The opening scene depicting the dancer retelling her belief in the cult coming for her starts this on a strong note that gets better throughout here. The initial scenes of her with the students at the academy are spectacular, dealing with the idea of the backstabbing dancers as well as those who aren't and trying to legitimately get by in the studio who start to plant the early idea of something wrong with the teachers with the domineering manner in which they push everyone or handle the students. That leads to the film's most celebrated aspect of the witchcraft angle involved. With the setup rather well-handled, this one moves into a wholly original concept of utilizing their dance routines at the studio as the ritual that are to be performed. That causes a large part of the sequences here with the way each of the dancers are shown to becomes physically ill or attacked almost immediately after engaging in a class, even sometimes the very one who was shown to be heavily involved in the tutorials during that time really actually makes the dancing a rather fearful idea where it shows each of the coven-members to positively react to their performances and giving this a really enjoyable tone overall here. That in turns manages to set up a series of celebrated and exceptionally creepy witchcraft-based scares. The first attack of the girl in the room of mirrors being manipulated, distorted and bent into a variety of excruciating positions due to the dance routine she's performing offers a chilling opening mark on what's being accomplished, while the shorter scenes of the dancers being overcome after a recital offer up some decent attacks. However, the main sequence in the underground chamber housing the witches and their coven members is a truly outstanding sequence offering all the fun gore and haunting imagery this could've asked for. These here are what hold this up overall. There are a few problems to be had here. The main issue here is the exceptionally overlong running time that goes on far longer than it really should. This one has an extreme inability to recognize the fact that many scenes here aren't needed at all, ranging from the scenes of the doctor back in New York doing his studies that don't provide anything of any real importance in the story all tending to make this run on longer than necessary. Likewise, the setup with the missing dancer who supposedly died in the city-wide bombing raids is a full-on cheat with no real purpose other than to give us several scenes of them trying to suppose their city-wide influence but not much else which simply eats up the running time. Some might have an issue with the lameness of the dancing but otherwise, there isn't much else really wrong here.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Full Graphic Nudity and Language.",Suspiria
11,trashgang,not for every horror buff but some parts do deliver,7,26 March 2019,"So many opinions about this flick.I have seen people writing about ugly choreography and stuff like that. Can't agree, the cinematheography and choreography are a pure thrown back to the original Suspiria (1977).This one is more gory then the original but the use of oversaturated colours like the 1977 are here agian. So if you haven't seen the original it will be hard to understand.And even after seen the original one you still be left with alot of questions. Not every horror geek will love this. There's a lot of ballet going on and a lot of talking. But when the creeps come in it's awkward or gory.But for some it's all too late and way too long 2h30 minutes. Did I like it, have seen the original a few times maybe this one with the new effects is harder to watch but still, a difficult one to review and to watch, reasons known.

12,namashi_1,A Delicious Remake Of A Legendary Film!,9,10 March 2019,"Dario Argento's 1977 Campy Horror film SUSPIRIA left an unending impression on filmmakers and film-buffs alike. I, myself, loved that film and hold it high to this day. And so is the case for Director Luca Guadagnino, who has passionately remade the classic with a frightening new vision. And Luca, a fine director, delivers a highly impressive remake of a much-loved classic. The brand new version may not surprise the buffs of the original, and may not appeal to all, but its distinctive vision is hard to ignore. This is deliciously twisted storytelling!'Suspiria' Synopsis: A darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the artistic director, an ambitious young dancer, and a grieving psychotherapist. Some will succumb to the nightmare. Others will finally wake up.'Suspiria' is horror film that celebrates the art of dance and the twisted human psyche. Luca, along-with Writer David Kajganich, paints a film that is gorgeous in the most grotesque manner. The narrative is gruesome at times and is sure to put many off, by the bloodshed depicted here. But come on, this is a remake of a film originally made by Dario Argento, and he depicted gore with campiness. And Luca maintains the narrative with the same ideology, although this is a far more serious film than Argento's. Luca is here for the claps, so he colors every frame with a bruised beauty. Luca has done a superlative job here, as the director delivers a supernatural horror film about dance, death and witches, with a vision not many possess.Kajganich's Screenplay flows well and offers a highly shocking finale, that is sure to leave many surprised, in a good way. However, some of the dialogue here are flat and some scenes needed to be crisper, overall. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's Cinematography is extraordinary. The lens-man captures the madness with astounding success. Walter Fasano's Editing is sharp, although 'Suspiria' feels a little too long at a 151-minutes! Art and Costume Design are top-class. Thom Yorke's Score is superb.Performance-Wise: Tilda Swinton is spellbinding. Cast in three roles here, all diverse from one another, the Oscar-Winner is simply unforgettable here. Dakota Johnson, the film's leading-lady, does a stellar job. Mia Goth
is first-rate. Chloë Grace Moretz makes a brief appearance, but is splendid in her bit. Jessica Harper, the iconic star of the original, makes a fleeting appearance. The actresses who portray the witches, are outstanding.On the whole, 'Suspiria' works big time. I can't recommend it enough.",Suspiria

14,MOscarbradley,A horror movie for our times.,9,1 November 2019,"Sacrilege I know but I'm not a great fan of Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"". Yes, I know it's visually dazzling and a boldly executed piece of cinematic horror but its descent into madness feels to me too much like a descent into daftness so I confess I was somewhat surprised when I heard that someone with as distinguished a pedigree as Luca Guadagnino should want to remake it; I thought the territory might be closer to Rob Zombie. Of course, what Guadagnino serves up is nothing like the original. Yes, he keeps the basic plot; young American girl in Europe, (here, 1970's Berlin), enrolls at an upmarket dance academy which is really a front for a coven of witches, then adds another hour to the running time and casts Tilda Swinton in a triple role, including that of an aged male doctor then makes it even more extreme and violent than the original as he equates dance with body horror in all its forms.While Argento's film was Grand Guignol silly, this is genuinely disturbing. There's a real sense of evil here that transcends mere shock tactics. It's also got a terrific performance from Swinton that again transcends the mere novelty value of prosthetic make-up, particularly when she's playing the head of the dance academy and number one witch. It's also nice to see Angela Winkler in the meaty role of her opposite number. Indeed Guadagnino's handling of his mostly female cast is sublime.

15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Thankfully, it's more of a reimagining than a remake.",6,28 October 2019,"Even though 'Suspiria (2018)' is only a loose remake (basically only taking the original's premise and character names), comparisons to its predecessor are inevitable. So, I'll get mine out of the way: it's nowhere near as interesting or memorable as the colour-soaked flick it takes its name from. However, that doesn't mean that it isn't a decent, risk-taking horror that, essentially, nails exactly what it's going for. It's a much bleaker affair, both in its aesthetics and its narrative. It's never exactly scary, but a number of sequences are undeniably rather disturbing - an extended, genuinely horrible forced-contortion scene is clearly the highlight. Where it falters is in its length and pacing. It's quite a bit too long and it moves leisurely, at best. It's never boring, but it does feel somewhat artificially extended. It has its duller moments, too. These are usually offset by equally as engaging sequences, but the movie is never all that compelling. It's entertaining enough, don't get me wrong. It's well-made and distinct, crafting its own style within mere seconds. The choice to purposefully break certain 'rules', primarily when it comes to clarity of editing, doesn't pay off as well as it could have. When it's subtle, it throws things off just enough to achieve its desired effect; when it isn't, it's just grating. Thankfully, the most overt it gets is near the beginning. It settles into itself as it goes along, with its jarring edits making for some truly visceral nightmares sequences. The picture doesn't give you all the answer - at least, not obviously - and this helps with its fairly enigmatic nature. The choice to, essentially, tell the viewers the basics of what is going on makes for a less mysterious affair, though. The finale is straight-up silly, too. It works well enough, but sort of betrays the established tone. I mean, the whole story is a bit absurd but its straight-laced presentation usually smoothes this over; you can take the piece seriously throughout. The last set-piece comes incredibly close to losing this quality, though, working more as an unexpected ecstasy of taboo than a natural - or, rather, tonally cohesive - progression for the plot. Still, the experience isn't ruined by this. It's marvellously unique when compared to most of its peers and it works more than it doesn't. It's not great, but it's good enough. 6/10.",Suspiria

Admittedly, there are a few very impressive visual sequences that demand respect, but it's nowhere near enough to jsutify how downright strange and uncomfortable at times. It also never really attempts to answer certain questions or plot points that are brought up.

Meanwhile, some students within the school have started accusing the Three Mothers and their instructor (Tilda Swinton) of being in league with Satan.With elaborate dance routines, Swinton in multiple roles and a soundtrack supplied by Radiohead's Thom Yorke, this remake of Dario Argento's 1977 masterwork certainly shoots for the fences. Unfortunately, the muted tones, the lack of scares and lengthy run-time derail any hopes this update has of besting - or even matching - the original.However, witchcraft does explain why there are so many dance shows on television.

20,Bored_Dragon,"""Delusion is a lie that tells a truth""",7,28 July 2019,"Suspiria (2018) is based on the characters and the story of the eponymous film by Dario Argento from 1977, but I would not call it a remake. The original film relies on superb cinematography, striking photography, directing and sound, which in a specific way combine the beautiful and the eerie, while the story is poorly elaborated and much remains just in the hints. ""Remake"" takes over Argento's characters and story and thoroughly elaborates them. Here we have better scenario and characterization, but from the standpoint of cinematography, the film is far below the original. Genre approach also differs. While the original keeps us almost completely in ignorance and uncertainty, developing a psychological drama that transforms itself into a horror only in the end, ""remake"" is explicit and almost from the start can be classified as a horror. It is distinguished by attractive women and good acting, and effects and production are at a high level, but the film lacks that specific atmosphere that was given to the original by top-level directing and photography, and especially the use of colors. The sixth act is the only part of the film visually comparable with the original, but at the same time it is such a nonsense, which degrades the story to the level of parody or B horror of the eighties. In addition, it is unnecessarily stretched to two and a half hours, which in many segments makes it boring.If the original crew from 1977, led by Argento, made the film in the style of the original, but using the script of the ""remake"" and with today's technology, it would probably be a masterpiece.7/10",Suspiria

23,cruise01,Horrible and disturbing!!!,1,5 February 2019,"Suspiria (.5 out of 5 stars).Suspiria is one of a kind supernatural psychological horror film that will divide the audiences on liking or hating it. I have never seen the original 1977 Italian film. I will admit I could not get into the film at all. It was by far the worst I have seen this year. Right up there with The Witch film. What to start about the film? It is two and a half hours too long. Very slow moving with the pace. It lacks the suspense and thrills. It tries to be creepy but instead it is just one disturbing piece of a movie. The plot follows Susie (Dakota Johnson) arriving in Berlin to audition for a dance academy. Amongst her training, the staff and trainers are acting suspiciously strange. Such as witchcraft. I can not give any more details about the plot without giving spoilers.A lot of characters are flat and boring. You may not be able to tell them apart throughout the movie. Besides, Dakota Johnson and Mia Goth. Which both of their performances are flat. Tilda Swinton playing a couple of characters was also boring and flat.There are several disturbing moments in the film. Prepare yourself to witness a character getting their limps bend in ways were it is not suppose too. Or a climatic what the f*** scene which is trying to frighten you by being gross and disturbing. Lots of blood, graphic nudity, and gore. In the end, you will be asking yourself why are you watching this? And is it even worth seeing it? The answer is no.Overall, Suspira is one of the worst films ever. Acting was dull. The plot and direction was slow moving. It lacks the creepy and suspense. Substituting it with trying to disturb the audience that will make them feeling sick.",Suspiria
24,eddie_baggins,"A pretty to look at but forgettable ""cover version""",5,20 March 2019,"The prospect of reimagining Dario Argento's seminal and revered 1977 horror Suspiria is the type of unenviable task you wouldn't of imagined a lot of filmmakers would've been clamoring to undertake, yet after curious choice David Gordon Green departed the long mooted new take on the famed tale, in came Italian director Luca Guadagnino to breathe new life into the skin-crawling story of witches, dancers and unnerving occurrences.Fresh off the back of his critical and awards darling Call me by Your Name, Guadagnino is the type of in-demand director that this project needed, yet while this self-professed ""cover version"" of Argento's classic has its moments, you can't help but feel like in the big scheme of things, this modern Suspiria is a mostly pointless and disappointing affair.Firstly, far too long at over 2 and a half hours, Guadagnino's film which is likely to leave many die-hard fans of the original rather cold, is a film with some great moments of terror and suspense (a prolonged contortion dance scene and a bonkers finale) and some beautifully shot sequences but lacks any undeniably intriguing plot enhancements or true scares that make you feel like this does anything better than its forefather.Led by Dakota Johnson as new Berlin dance student Susie, whose come from a religiously focused upbringing in America and has formed a new friendship with Tilda Swinton's dance troupe manager Madame Blanc, as the two bond at the possibly ill-intentioned Markos Tanz Dance Academy, Guadagnino's film has the same air of dread that the original had but by signposting much of the goings on and allowing us to quickly learn about what goes on behind the scenes, much of the potential mystery of the film is gone, meaning we go through a very long middle patch in the film that feels rather laborsome and tiresome.Making matters much worse is the bizarre decision by Guadagnino and his screenwriter David Kajganich to include a screen hogging side plot of Tilda Swinton's elderly psychiatrist Dr. Klemperer, whose quest to unearth the disappearance of Chloe Grace Moretz's missing dance student Patricia takes up far too much of the films attention for very little payoff.It's an extremely odd choice, even distracting thanks to the choice to have Swinton play this male role under some terrible make-up effects and it's hard to know why this decision was made, especially when the films best elements are played out in the surrounds of the dance academy walls.This decision is a real game changer for the film and no matter the commitments of the performers, the moody score by Radiohead's Thom Yorke (which isn't as memorable as Goblin's original offering) or the wince inducing violence can make up for it at the end of the day.Final Say -An overly long and frequently odd new take on a classic horror fable with some seriously unnecessary sub-plots, Suspiria isn't without moments of merit but considering the talent involved behind and in front of the camera, this is a disappointing exercise that's curiously devoid of any real lasting scares or frights.2 ½ humiliated police officers out of 5",Suspiria
25,TheMovieDiorama,Suspiria gracefully dances atop the bloody supernatural roots that inspired it.,8,20 November 2018,"Now, I've seen some visually shocking films that have mentally scarred me. And then I've seen some films that have physically distressed me with its content, numbing my ability to speak whilst my jaw hits the floor. This remake of Argento's classic is both. What. The. Actual. Hell. Did I just watch? Having yet to see the original, I've heard it would be unfair to compare due to the vast amount of changes. Still, what a film! Not only do I need time to fully realise all the themes, but another five viewings atleast. A psychotherapist becomes embroiled with a dance academy that is controlled by a coven of witches, where a new student is slowly becoming the lead choreographer's protégée. After sleeping on this, I concluded that two themes were prominent throughout the intense tribal-like dance segments. The essence of falsifying motherhood was strong, particularly as the witches act motherly towards their students, only to then harness their power. The kinship between Madame Blanc and Susie almost felt real, with the former bonding very closely and gradually becoming protective of her. Them the psychotherapist's perspective conveyed national guilt, how witnessing the atrocities of the holocaust and not acting upon it represented shame for the country. The constant flashes of historical incidents caused by the Red Army Faction assist in personifying the violence that the coven utilise against the students. I also admired the link between spiritualism and the art of dance, propelling the idea that the physical activity is one that connects the body with one's soul. Instinctively, Suspiria is a contemporary arthouse horror, and its contemporaneous nature is imitated through the precise choreography in the dances, especially 'Volk' which is best described as staccato. The infliction of violence that occurs simultaneously conveys the hardship and effort that goes into these routines. Contorted bodies with bones snapping and jaws breaking is viscerally shocking, but strangely hypnotic at the same time.In fact, the whole film is an entrancing journey and that's thanks to Guadagnino's direction. It never feels like a remake, but more ""paying homage"" to a classic. It's grounded in the roots that made the original such a harrowing experience, yet injected with modern flavourings. The imitation of Argento's directing style, particularly panning and zooming simultaneously, resulted in a film that felt like it was from the 70s. Guadagnino was inspired, and that shows through the precise camera movement that frequently left me speechless. The cast embodied the physicality of the dance academy, and the emotional turmoil when certain discoveries were made. Goth was exceptional and stood out amongst her peers. Johnson was decent, although nothing extraordinary. But Swinton and her three performances were outstanding. Never needing to overact, never needing to raise her voice. She's just naturally commanding. Ominous, and yet captivating. It also highlights the perfect work of Coulier's makeup artistry, having fictitiously created an actor to play the psychotherapist. The runtime is quite extensive, and the narrative structure of separate acts does segregate the flow of the story. Pacing is sometimes inconsistent, particularly after an intense scene. However, it's act six that really tests your mentality. My eyes were bleeding. My jaw was on the floor. My senses were infiltrated. I collapsed. I died. Resurrection. I'm back. Honestly, I couldn't possibly describe the sheer absurdity that ensued. It was the stuff of nightmares. I was not physically prepared for it, it came out of nowhere and, as nightmarish as it was, unfortunately highlights the disjointed pacing. Yorke's score was often mesmerising, until vocals were introduced in certain songs that were unnecessary and distracting. Alas, Suspiria is quite the behemoth. I may never understand all of the intricacies that are beautifully displayed, but one thing is for sure. It's absolutely divisive, and deserves your attention.",Suspiria
26,Tweetienator,Failed to Bewitch Me,4,13 January 2019,"Well, one could argue to the favor of the director and writer that they tried to add something new to the given material by Dario Argento and not only make a remake but an own interpretation/vision.But there it is, the weakness of the new Suspiria: the additions and changes are mostly unnecessary and the true power of the rather simple plot of Argento's Suspiria are the outstanding visuals combined with the exccellent soundtrack by Goblin, making watching the movie an almost surreal experience - but in both fields (visuals and music) the new movie falls very short compared to the original.On top Suspira 2018 felt the whole time over-streched and rather boring to me, as I was not impressed by the visuals or the music most of the time, and also the blabla about the RAF (terrorist's in Germany around the time depicted) feels extremely unnecessary or unrelated and does not contribute in a positive way to the movie.All in all a wasted opportunity, despite the gory end and the boobs provided here and there.",Suspiria

After finally coming 'round to view this, I for one, was enthralled, but I found some boring drags in this original concept horror, a remake of the '77 Argento masterpiece which really must of been something at the time. This unintentional stylish pic, now rouses my interest, in seeing the original, which they had brought back some years ago, in the restored City Event Cinemas, now know as the GU Film House. Obviously the original would be more violent, as I expected much more gore from this near 2 and a half film. Ms Swinton seems to be typecast here, and again, she pulls off a great at the helm performance. She's a teacher of a special college for gifted ballet dancers, who with her colleagues, harvests a dark secret, and those that tell, well, you can guess the rest. These score of faculty, transmit nice soft menace, that steadily builds and were creepy, putting the suss in Susspiria. The music scores, used in this appreciated remake, are the better highlights here, and Johnson as the new hot shot dancing lead, has a hair style which is fifty shades of red stringy hair. She fares not bad in this, dominating the viewer in every scene she's in. There's something about her. Mia Goth as Johnson's new room mate/ confidant, is killer beautiful, one of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen. Suspiria has lots of style, and it's story does reel you in, but there are some bores, and much more blood that should of been shed, in this duration. But I'm just a sick puppy.

We then go to ""Act One: 1977"", as a seemingly deluded young woman arrives a a doctor's office/ The doctor notes that she is ""deranged"". Next we shift to the exit of the Suspira underground station, where we see another young lady trying to figure out a map of Berlin. She finally gets to where she wants to go, a dance company, to audition for a spot that just has opened up. Turns out the young lady is originally from Ohio. Soon it becomes clear that this is not your ordinary dance academy... At this point we'er 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Italian director Luca Guadagnino, whose recent films include ""A Bigger Splash"" and the Oscar-nominated ""Call Me By Your Name"". Here he tackles a remake of the 1977 Italian supernatural horror film of the same name. I have not seen the 1977 version, and hence cannot comment how close the 2018 remake remains to the original. I'm guessing a LOT has changed, for one thing the running time of the 2018 version is an entire HOUR longer than the 1977 version. There is considerable acting talent in the film, none more so than Tilda Swinton, who plays not one, not two, but three roles. The first two are easy to discern, the third one not so much (I was amazed when I saw the closing credits--can you find the third role without seeing the movie credits?). Dakota Johnson as the ""innocent"" Ohio girl is quite good too, as is Mia Goth as another dancer. Chloe Grace Moretz is completely unrecognizable as the ""deranged"" girl in the opening scene. The photography reflect the mood in Berlin era-1977: dark, gloomy, rainy. Last but not least, Radiohead's Thom Yorke provides the score, hist first film score. I love that guy (and check out the 2CD soundtrack, available here on Amazon). Beware: ""Suspiria"" is not for nothing billed as a ""supernatural horror"" film, and there are a number of scenes that I could barely watch (and I saw others in the theater covering there eyes)...""Suspiria"" premiered at this year's Venice Film Festival, and is now gradually expanding in US theaters. It opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very well, somewhat to my surprise. This movie likely will get a mixed reaction, and understandably so: its (overly) long running time, the rather gloomy feel of the entire film, and of course some of the horror scenes/ In the end I found it a bizarre but intriguing movie experience, and I'm glad i saw it, but this surely is not for everyone.

30,jtindahouse,A well paced and unique ride,6,7 July 2019,"I was a little bit skeptical prior to seeing 'Suspiria'. I had never seen the original, it looked interesting but not necessarily my type of film (these fantasy/horror types can go one way or the other I find) and it had a very long runtime. What convinced me to see it though was the cast. There are a lot of actresses in this film that I appreciate. So am I glad I made the decision to see it? I would say I am.While the runtime was very long, I never found my self bored or disinterested (at least if I did it was fleeting). It's a surprisingly well paced movie. The other thing you may notice is that if you're not familiar with the original or the story, things can get quite confusing at points. I feel like this is a film that would be a lot easier to appreciate on second viewing.The performances were, as I expected, terrific from pretty much the entire cast. I was blown away to read that Tilda Swinton had played the old man. I could have watched this movie a thousand times over and I don't think I would have picked up on that. I don't think this movie will be to everyone's liking, but if you're on the fence about it like I was I would suggest at least giving it a try. You might just get a pleasant surprise.",Suspiria

I thought I would absolutely love it. Sadly I found it decidedly underwhelming.Basically there is some amazing imagery in here and an absolutely bonkers Act Six. Unfortunately it feels like trudging through syrup to find the good stuff. I wish Act Six was just a stand alone short film.The constant switching between languages started to irritate me. I don't know if I missed important plot points because of this, but based on other reviews I'm guessing I didn't.Most of the film seems very drab and muted. I understand not wanting to emulate Argento's brilliant use of colour, but this went too far in the opposite direction.God help me if I had to actually explain the plot coherently. I think I'd be doomed. I can honestly say I didn't follow the logic of the story.I wish the whole subplot with the psychoanalyst was dropped. It doesn't add to the film for me, just overstuffs it. Who cares if Tilda plays a man? I'm not going to appreciate such a dull performance.The long run time was absolutely not justified here. It's very self indulgent and borderline arrogant to demand so much of an audience's time while providing so little. I was constantly bored and looking at the clock, hoping it would finish faster.I do appreciate that it stands alone as its own vision and artistic statement rather than attempting to replicate the feel and tone of the original.

33,parry_na,Interesting but far too long ...,5,6 December 2019,"Strange isn't it, that with all the advantages and advancements of make-up special effects, when it comes to disguising a female as a male, the human voice is what breaks the illusion. The male/female character in this updated, reimagined version of 'Suspiria' is no more convincing than dear old Elspeth Dudgeon as Sir Roderick Femm in 'The Old Dark House' nearly ninety years earlier.It reminded me in some of its many set-pieces, of the Japanese horrors that proved popular in the early 2000s, especially 'Audition' (unsurprising, really, given both films' focus on dance classes). Some of the Mephistophelian set-pieces full of writhing bodies in the finale are akin to many scenes depicting hell in silent Hollywood films. These images, together with the rich and evocative cinematography of Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and directorship of Luca Guadagnino create some memorable scenes.However, the moments in between are sadly dull - and there are many of them: there is absolutely no reason why this film has to be 2 hours and 32 minutes long. There is no reason why this story needs so much time to be told. And that proves to be 'Suspiria's' undoing. It boasts a truly wonderful cast, looks stunning and has some eventful moments, but contains so much that is a chore to sit through, and scenes that contain little to justify themselves. I'm not even sure why such vast swathes of the narrative have to be spoken in (often un-subtitled) German, other than to authenticate the setting, albeit inconsistently.I like slow burning films. I like films that look as impressive and European as this. I like stories that give the impression that they are written by people far cleverer than me. But this is far too much of all those ingredients without any great pay-off. It is a film that loves itself far more than the audience is given reason to. Watching it, I almost felt like a gooseberry at a mutual admiration party. This all sounds harsher than I want it to, but I don't feel that this new interpretation of 'Suspiria', which has received widespread acclaim and therefore deserves to be palatable to a large general audience, has to be such a personal, un-inclusive one.

35,drownnnsoda,A wild and wicked reimagining of a classic,9,1 November 2018,"Luca Guadagnino's reimagining of ""Suspiria"" follows the same core plot trajectory as Argento's original film, detailing an American dancer who finds herself a fish out of water at a German dance academy run by witches. Where Argento's film was an acid-trip fairytale erring on Disney-like horror, Guadagnino's rendition of this story is an ambitious period piece underpinned by the political tumult of 1977 Germany.I saw the original ""Suspiria"" at thirteen years old, and it has long been among my top-ten favorite horror films. A remake/ reimagining of Argento's film could have been disastrous in the wrong hands, and fortunately there is a thoughtful (albeit sometimes overwrought) screenplay here supported by masterful direction from Guadagnino. This ""Suspiria"" is not your average horror remake; far from it.It is a visually breathtaking film in an entirely different way than its predecessor--the color this time muted and pallid, but the attention to detail no less scrupulous. More importantly, it is far more narratively involved, perhaps sometimes too much so for its own good, but it still managed to entirely absorb me. The hefty 150-minute runtime honestly bypassed me in what felt like maybe two hours. The onscreen horrors here are sparse but pack a wallop, leaving the audience time to breathe before assaulting the senses again. The already-infamous first proper horror scene is nearly unspeakable.It is moments like these where Guadagnino truly strikes gold, entering a rare space between the visceral and the sublime. The proceedings are helped greatly by the performances, with Swinton portraying both the ominous Madame Blanc, as well as taking a gender-bending return to ""Orlando"" territory as the aging psychotherapist who stumbles into the world of the coven. Johnson turns in a weirdly (though appropriately) detached performance as Susie, while Goth and Moretz are both scene-stealers here as Sara and Patricia; this might be the best work they've done thus far. Elena Fokina, a newcomer, is also particularly strong as Olga.There has been a lot of discussion surrounding the historical socio-political backdrop of the film, and I do feel that screenwriter Kajganich is sometimes reaching for some correlation or metaphor that never quite coalesces. That being said, the real-world context lends a dour groundwork for the proceedings, and perhaps Kajganich's greatest stroke of genius is his anchoring of the witchcraft in the movements of the body. Where the witchcraft in Argento's film seemed wholly arbitrary, this version contextualizes the magic and ritual as part and parcel of the dances themselves (which are also expertly choreographed and punctuated by Yorke's spacey score).My single criticism of the film lay in the visual presentation of the finale, which exhibits some slow-motion effects that felt very made-for-TV-movie-ish and diametrically opposed to the artful visuals that precede it. This feels like a betrayal given the abundance of exquisite, stark compositions up to that point, some of which look like they've been lifted directly from Pasolini's ""Salo."" Despite this, the last hurrah is jaw-dropping in more ways than one, and truly revels in literal blood and guts. A denouement resolving the subplot regarding the psychotherapist follows, which is unexpectedly poignant and conversely chilling in presentation.All in all, I found very little not to like about Guadagnino's ""Suspiria."" While it does trip on its own feet in a few areas, it is thoughtfully-imagined, vividly realized, and undoubtedly the most beautiful film I've seen this year. I would also rank it among the best horror films I've seen this decade. If nothing else, it is a truly honorable exploration and worthy heir to its source material. 9/10.",Suspiria
36,kluseba,The horror slowly creeps in,8,2 October 2019,"Suspiria isn't only a remake of Dario Argento's movie but an expanded reimagination of the legendary Italian horror movie. The film is set in Berlin during the German Autumn and follows the story lines of a young American dancer who arrives at a dance school and an old psychotherapist who investigates the disappearance of one of his troubled patients. The two story lines intertwine in six chapters and an epilogue with a total length above two and a half hours and find their climax in the mysterious dance school.This movie convinces for numerous reasons. First of all, it doesn't blandly copy the original movie but adds more characters, new plots and haunting visual effects. It's very interesting to compare both movies and it's really just a matter of personal taste which version you prefer.Secondly, the characters in this movie are really interesting. The female lead character incarnates ambition, innocence and resilience but soon gets caught up with sinister events. The male lead character incarnates curiosity, guilt and shame and investigates both his own past and present events involving a missing dancer. The side characters in this film are also highly intriguing, especially head artistic director and choreographer Madame Blanc who is torn between supporting her colleagues and saving her protégée.Thirdly, the actresses in this movie are absolutely outstanding. Many of them play two or even three different roles. One simply has to point out Tilda Swinton who convincingly plays a male psychotherapist, a female choreographer and a mysterious physically disabled old woman. The movie features numerous excellent young actresses such as Mia Goth (''Everest''), Dakota Johnson (''Bad Times at the El Royale'') and Chloë Grace Moretz (''Carrie'').Fourthly, the movie has a truly gripping atmosphere that subtly intensifies throughout the movie. There are numerous red flags showing that something is amiss about the mysterious dance school. One student mysteriously disappears. Another one has a meltdown during a practice. The building includes numerous hidden rooms with sinister secrets. The more the film progresses, the more intense it gets until a stunning surreal finale.Fifthly, the cinematography of this movie is astonishing. This starts with the sinister locations along the Berlin Wall. It continues with the gloomy weather as it always rains or snows in Berlin. The numerous dance practices and performances in the movie are creative, emotional and intellectual. The use of blood, bones and urine makes the movie progressively more repulsive. The film's climax is visually stunning with outstanding light effects and visual components.In addition to all these elements, the movie cleverly connects the main plot to elements regarding Germany's sinister past during the Third Reich and contemporary political events throughout the German Autumn. All these events deal with guilt and shame and foreshadow or parallel the sinister events of the main plot. This movie deserves multiple views to uncover and understand its numerous references.There are two reasons why this movie didn't get an even higher rating. First of all, the first act of the film is quite confusing as we are introduced to numerous characters and multiple plot lines without any explanations and without any clear structure. This confusing potpourri disentangles during the second act and the movie then progresses coherently until the very end. Secondly and lastly, the movie slightly overstays its welcome with a challenging length of one hundred fifty-three minutes. The film could have been shortened by about twenty to thirty minutes without losing its essence. The filmmaker should also refrain from working on a potential prequel or sequel. This movie works very well on its own and doesn't need anything more.In the end, Suspiria should please to fans of moody horror movies that are willing to invest two and a half hours to discover fascinating atmospheres, characters and story lines developed with outstanding acting performances and creative cinematography. It doesn't matter whether you have watched the original movie or not since this isn't a remake but a reimagination that stands very well on its own. Original creator Dario Argento didn't appreciate this new version but his closed-mindedness shouldn't be categorized as anything more than a personal opinion among many others. Suspiria is one of the better horror movies in recent memory.",Suspiria
37,Pairic,Good rather than great,7,21 November 2018,"Suspiria: The original came in at 100 minutes, this remake runs for 152 minutes. Really overlong, could shed 20 minutes and be a tighter film. At times the sub-plots involving a Berlin psychiatrist and Susie's home in Ohio make the plot seem to lack coherence but it all comes together in the end. If anything the final act (of six) and the epilogue are too rushed and may further confuse some viewers.1977, Susie (Dakota Johnson) an ex-Mennonite from Ohio arrives in West Berlin hoping to join the Markos Dance Academy, Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton) the Academy's lead choreographer witnesses her triumphant audition. Susie joins the Troupe but learns that the dancer she has replaced, Patricia (Chloe Grace Moretz), has disappeared. We see Patricia meeting Dr Josef Klemper (Tilda Swinton), telling him that the Academy is controlled by witches who have a secret plan. However she also talks of being involved with the Red Army Faction and Klemper believes she is delusional.However the matrons (staff) of the Academy are indeed witches who confirm the aged and hidden Mother Makros (Tilda Swinton) as leader, defeating Blanc in a vote. A ritual is to be carried out to revitalise Makros and Susie is now chosen to be the victim. There are secrets about Susie though which the witches are unaware of but then these truths are also only later revealed to the dancer herself.In contrast to the original this version is filmed in dull colours, both parts of Berlin are grim and dark. Only snow and the red outfits of the dancers provide a bright contrast. There are scenes of horror and violence which will test your resolve and this is certainly not a film for the squeamish or fainthearted. Johnson and Moretz put in good performances but the real star is Tilda Swinton in her triple role. Director Luca Guadagnino is somewhat self indulgent with the extended running time making this a good rather than a great Horror Film. 7/10.",Suspiria
38,TdSmth5,Holy Hell!,9,27 April 2019,"It's Berlin in the 70s while terrorist attacks are taking place. Some girl (Patricia) goes to see her old psychiatrist, all paranoid babbling about witches. Then some old woman is about to die in the US.A girl arrives in Berlin. She auditions for some famous dance group and gets in right away, charming the lead choreographer (Madame Blanc). The dancer girls live on-site. Because Patricia disappeared there's an open slot and Susie gets in. There are about 20 old women called ""mothers"" coaching the group and also live there but separately from the dancers. They hold some election about who's going to be in charge and someone named Markos beats Blanc. Patricia was the lead of their new piece and now Susie gets also the lead part for their next performance after the would-be lead (Olga) storms off insulting Blanc. During Susie's test lead performance Olga ends up tortured and killed.The psychiatrist reports Patricia missing and indeed, there something going on with these old women coaches. They control the girls's dreams and can also control people's behavior as when 2 cops show up asking about the missing girl. But there is also something else residing in the building. The psychologist digs deeper into Patricia's diary and starts to believe her. He contacts Sara, a friend of Patricia's and Susie's who at first rejects the wild accusations of the diary, but when she actually discovers a hidden room, she's convinced and meets again the Dr. to explain how things are at the academy. During the first public performance of the new dance for some reason Sara goes back to the secret room and runs into what's left of Patricia and Olga but is caught on her way out. Her leg is broken in an original way, then healed so she can perform the dance, then it breaks again during the dance. The psychiatrist wanting to see things for himself attends the dance.At this point another performance takes place to resuscitate Markos, the founder and re-elected leader of the group whose body is a mess. Blanc who has been organizing things for some reason decides to put an end to the ceremony, which includes everybody: Patricia, Olga, Sara, the psychiatrist and Susie too, feeling very confident and sexy. The empowered Susie attacks Blanc, and reveals to Markos who she really is before killing her and making the heads explode of all those who voted for Markos with the help of some scary creature.We are told at the start that the movie takes place in 6 acts and an epilogue. After the first act, I was ready and willing to hate this movie. An all-female cast, about dancers, in a 2.5 hour-long movie. Give me a break. But during the second act, Suspiria started getting my attention and after the first death scene I was all in and I only started liking it more and more as the movie also gets better and better. I don't think I've seen the original, not that it matters to me when it comes to re-makes or re-envisionings. I'm fond of the 70s style, and Suspiria is a labor of love, a true tribute and won me over, despite the beginning which doesn't offer much of an access to the movie or the characters. There's the story of the lovely Susie and Johnson is always great as the likable girl with a plan and whose relationship with the strict but charmed Blanc evolves in interesting ways. There's the story of the psychiatrist's investigation but also we learn some things about his private life and his wife for no good reason really. It even makes it into the epilogue but it's so forced and unnecessary. All the while there's the political upheaval in Germany which is also apropos nothing at all. The business with the wife and the politics only make the movie unnecessarily longer than it needs to be. And this movie is long. But the mythology about the mothers is fascinating, so is the behavior of the old ladies, one of whom slits her throat out of the blue. But it's the horror that's great. From the contorting death of Olga to the wild climax ceremony. The sights here are amazing and outrageous making you wonder what the creators injected themselves with. At the same time the cinematography at the end doesn't help at all. It's like someone covered the camera in red ink. Interesting were the bits of philosophy of dance.Overall Suspiria is a wild, original, hypnotic ride of a movie that shouldn't be missed. It requires patience but it's well worth it...and then some.",Suspiria
39,truemythmedia,A Remake Done Right,10,25 July 2019,"The original ""Suspiria"" was, for a long time, my second favorite horror film (second only to ""The Shining""). Just to give you a glimpse of how much I love it: I watched it four times in 2018, including once on the big screen with Goblin (the band that wrote the score) accompanying the film live. I love that movie to death. So, as you might imagine, I looked forward to this film, but nervously. The things that gave me hope were the involvement of Luca Guadagnino (director of ""Call Me By Your Name""- one of my favorite films of 2017), veteran actress Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton) playing three separate roles, and the pulchritudinous Dakota Johnson (""Bad Times at the El Royale"")- (and as an added bonus it also a cameo from the original Susy- Jessica Harper). This film is a wonder of a remake. I won't call it perfect- there are a few scenes that keep me from saying that, but this movie... Wow.Let me start by saying that before I saw it for myself, I read that Argento didn't like this film, saying it 'betrayed the spirit of the original film.' Au contraire, Argento! Though I admit I love a great deal of your work, and I think some of your movies are true works of genius, you are 100% wrong about this movie betraying the spirit of the original.The film might follow a different path, but the story undoubtedly takes place in the same spiritual world Argento first imagined. Argento's film is smaller, more compact. It's brilliant, yes, but in its own way. Guadagnino's film is Argento's film evolved by forty years. The world has grown older, more complex, moodier, and undeniably darker. The film is far more epic. This new one has brought huge changes in terms of the intricacies of the worldbuilding, and that was something wholy unexpected. As we work through the complexities of the film, it feels like we've stumbled upon something archaic and rooted in darkness. There is a unspoken presence to the entire film that just exudes atmosphere. There are few horror films that truly feel this epic in scale, scope, theme and meaning, and also grotesque violence.I'm still reeling from it. I'm still processing it.And I already have plans to rewatch it in two days time.",Suspiria
40,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Different Take, Similiar Fear",9,11 December 2018,"This film was one I was intrigued to check out. The original Suspiria is one of my favorite horror films of all time. I thought it was interesting when I saw that this version was going to run 2 and half hours as the original was just an hour and half. The official synopsis for this film is a darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the artistic director, an ambitious young dancer, and a grieving psychotherapist. Some will succumb to the nightmare. Others will finally wake up.We start off with Patricia (Chloë Grace Moretz). She seems to be manic and goes to the psychotherapist from the synopsis, Dr. Josef Klemperer (Tilda Swinton). This film takes place in 1977 in Berlin, so it is interesting that the Berlin Wall is up. Building from that, there is a lot dealing with what happened in World War II as well. As this young woman goes through a manic episode, we see that Josef thinks she is delusional. We do learn that Patricia is possible working with the RAF around the terrorist event when they took over an airplane full of Jews is part of the backdrop.The film follows Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson). We get an image of a mother (Malgorzata Bela) as she is passing away and Susie has fled from her Mennonite farm to dance for this famous company. She meets with Miss Tanner (Angela Winkler) who needs her to audition. She is a natural and this draws Madame Blanc (Swinton) to it as well. She is accepted into the academy.There is a struggle of power over the coven and whether or not to continue on with their plot. Sara (Mia Goth) is the next best dancer since Patricia has disappeared. She becomes friends with Susie immediately. She also tries to figure out what has happened to her friend. They are trying to bring Susie along, but her natural abilities and feeling a prescence that helps her dance.As I stated above, I love the original film even though the story might be lacking a bit. When I saw that this one had a run time of an extra hour, I was intrigued that they would actually flesh of more of a story, which they did. The problem though was I thought there were some of flaws to the story still. I'm not going to spoil this film, but I will say some things that happen early on. The first issue I had was there is a division of power. There is a vote of who should leave this coven, Blanc or Helena Markos (Swinton). This changes something from the original film and I wasn't the biggest fan of them not trying to do the same thing for Mother Suspirium (Bela).Now something I really liked about this film was fleshing out Susie's character a lot more. We see her mother passing away, but through dreams this is fleshed out more. I love that she was raised as a Mennonite, which to those that don't know are very similar to Amish. They are allowed to use some machines, but it brings a level of corruption to the more devoutly religious. We also see that there is a perversion to Susie as well. Her coming to the school she is embracing it even more.The dance scenes in this film are captivating as well. I saw this film with my girlfriend, so I asked her about the dances done in the film. She stated that for a dance that was created in the 1940's, it is a bit too modern. It might even be a little too modern for the 1970's. What I took from this though, being that it is a coven, it has to be more vulgar and I actually really like the idea. I'm not normally into films about dance, but for whatever reason they were done amazing and it sucked me.Pacing for a film that is this long is something that is important. I do feel that this film is a bit lengthy. We get some things that I don't necessarily think are important. With that said though, I didn't find it boring. I was drawn in from the beginning and it held my attention throughout. There are some great intercuts of two different things happening the same time that are similar in building the story or in something happening. I really liked that. I also don't think the epilogue for the film was needed. I think I would have rather it ends at the insane climax. I do get now why the epilogue was there and why it decided to be included.Going along with this, the acting for the film I thought was amazing. Johnson surprised me at how well she played her role. She has such innocence when she arrives, but we see that there has been 'sin' in her past. She embraces the darkness that is within the academy and I think a lot of that is wanted to be like Blanc. She wants to be great. Swinton was phenomenal in this film. I thought the portrayal of three characters were unique and very well done. She is such a talented actress so I give her a lot of credit. Moretz was solid for the role that she plays, even though it is quite small. I wanted to comment on Goth, who is beautiful and great in the film as well. The rest of the cast round out for what the film needed. Shout out to Jessica Harper, who was Susie in the original.The effects for the film were great as well. This film did something that the original didn't, which was body horror. There was some CGI used there, but I didn't have an issue with it. There were two scenes in particularly that really had me cringe, so kudos to the effects team. I do think there were some practical effects in the film as well which I thought was also good. The film was shot beautifully so I do have to commend them for that as well. It is actually quite the opposite of the original visually, but still works.Score for the film was something that I thought was good, but unfortunately underutilized. I thought there were some times where the score was perfect. During the main dance scene and the climax, it fit beautifully. The film seemed to go with quiet scenes for a few stretches where I thought have a lower key score could have helped build the suspense. I don't think the score was bad, just not used as I would have liked.Now with that said, I took some time before writing this to let it process. There is a lot going on this film and they definitely added much to the story. I do feel like not everything worked with the film, but a lot of it did. I thought the acting, effects and how the film was shot was amazing. The editing for the most part was good, but I do think that the epilogue and a bit from the film could have been cut to tighten it up. The score was also underutilized in my opinion. I still think this is a really good film and I have it just a bit below the original. It is one that I will go back to check out again to gather more understanding of it though. It's not for everyone, but I really did enjoy it.",Suspiria
41,robertemerald,"Beautifully creative and original, though I haven't seen the original movie",10,25 February 2020,"One way you can rate a movie is to ask yourself how prepared you are to watch it again. There are a number of ways a movie can have return merit. As movies are pictorial art this is different to a book. One way is that the movie is such a visual splendour, and the various facets of filmmaking are so beautifully done, then it's no problem to watch it again, like having a second scoop of the same flavour ice-cream. Another way to impress is to have amazing special effects, which with cgi these days, incorporates many amazing movies. I call that a wow factor. For art-house movies, of which I consider Suspiria to be one, then one has to be so impressed by the story presentation, as through various key images, that you'd love to watch it again to gain more insight and further understand the story. This is Suspiria, with the added bonus that it also has some wow factor, particularly at moments of extreme violence. That violence is original and striking. To further explain, I recently read about captivity during WWII, and one way prisoners could record and tell their stories was by rushing off a quick sketch on a tiny sheet of paper what they had witnessed. That scrap of paper doesn't tell you the back story or specifically what lead to the scene described, nor necessarily give you exact details on the characters involved. Nevertheless it can be a powerful and magnetic image. You want to know more. That is how I see Suspiria. Suspiria is easily one of the most engaging witch coven stories ever told (that's not a spoiler, as there is a mention on the back of the dvd). I loved the way the filmmakers played with the notion that you never really know what people are really like just on their appearance. Suspiria is all about hiding in plain sight, and of unsuspecting characters being more, or less, than they let on, and of situations that are never black or white or exactly defined. There is a classy backdrop from repeated news casts that depict a hostage situation on the news, which is wonderful parallel symbolism. There's a lot of detail in this movie, in the motivations, the powers, and the dark history. Even if you don't agree with me, Suspiria must have something going for it, or 542 user reviews here at IMDb wouldn't have been written already, only two years after its release.",Suspiria
42,jadepietro,Bewitched and Bewildered...Don't Bother!,3,12 December 2018,"Text: GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Dance 3, Looks 10JIM'S REVIEW: Let me first state that Mr. Guadagnino is a talented director and he knows how to artfully hide flaws with his stylish flourishes. Let me second that by mentioning that he has created a film with strong images and crafted a well-made film for your moviegoing pleasure. But...perhaps, I must interject...for your moviegoing displeasure. That would be a more accurate term when experiencing his artsy-fartsy remake, Suspiria (2018). The film trades real tension and scares for freakish thrills and a smattering of blood.This version basically follows the slender threads of the 1977 film of which it is based. We meet Susie (Dakota Johnson), a Mennonite girl with dancing in her soon-to-be possessed soul. She travels afar to become part of a German dance troupe led by Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton). However, her journey may have led her to a coven of witches. Much macabre mayhem ensues as dancers become victims in gross and twisted close-ups.Where this film differs from the original source is in its treatment of taking its low-brow horror subject origins and trying to make high-brow art. No silk purse here, but a sow's ear and other ugly accoutrements are certainly thrown into the bubbling cauldron of evil. Mr. Guadagnino's vision celebrates the hideous (entrails, urine, rotting flesh, disfigured bodies, etc.) and he becomes a cinematic Hieronymus Bosch master with his unrelenting onslaught of gross imagery. Whereas Mr. Argento's psychedelic low budget blood-fest had some suspense and scares, this has none. Zero.Suspiria (2018) still takes place in 1977 Berlin but it takes a truly different approach from that point. Mr. Argento's vivid use of color is toned down to bleak muddy browns and dingy grays. Grey is the new red. Dance (or dramatic gyrations set to music) becomes pivotal in the storyline in David Kajganich's misguided screenplay. The dialog is filled with German angst at its worst. Yes, there are many (many) missteps afoot in both words and movement (pardon the pun).Still there are a few saving graces: Mr. Guadagnino's visual technique is quite keen. Thomas Yorke's dissonant score provides some needed atmosphere. Sayombhu Mukdeeprom has some stunning compositions using light and shadows that are quite memorable. Ms, Johnson finally acquits herself in a lead role that has some depth and requires her to act. Mia Goth as Sara, one of Susie's friends, brings some nuance to her sketchy supporting role. Ms. Swinton plays three roles, one of which is a male psychiatrist. The actress is again under tons of realistic prothetic make-up and creates a credible character.The director does try to bring some gravitas to his remake by adding political and historical background to his period film (the Berlin Wall, terrorist hijacking, the Holocaust, etc.), yet it doesn't advance any plot points...it just lengthens the screen time and bores the audience with unnecessary details. Mr. Guadagnino's Suspiria makes a plethora of serious statements about the state of the world then and now when it should be all genuine scares and suspense. He completely misses the real aim of any good horror film: to scare the bejesus out of the audience.Suspiria (2018) is one of the most unpleasant moviegoing experiences of this or any year. Avoid.",Suspiria
43,justin-fencsak,Stick with the original...even the director of the classic hated this remake!!!,1,30 January 2019,"After watching around 20 minutes of the movie, i thought it moved a bit slower than the original 98 minute italian classic that became Dario Argento's most popular film in the USA and the highest grossing horror film that Fox released one year after The Omen came out and a year before Damien: Omen II a year before Alien came out. Rent this junk of a movie, then watch the original film.",Suspiria
44,udar55,Welcome to the short list of good horror remakes,10,7 November 2018,"When a remake of SUSPIRIA (1977) was first announced in the mid-2000s, I bristled at the thought. You can't remake one of the singularly standout artistic visions of the horror genre. You can't run with Dario Argento's style, Luciano Tovoli's cinematography or Goblin's iconic score. It would be as idiotic as someone saying, I don't know, they want to do a shot-for-shot remake PSYCHO (1960). Haha. When David Gordon Green was on as director, I had little faith (apparently the new HALLOWEEN he made proves that). When he left and Luca Guadagnino came on, my interest was piqued because all the stuff he was saying about where he wanted to take it sounded interesting. He knew he couldn't simply remake the film so instead he did his own thing. And, honestly, the end result is stunning. When the film ended I just sat there in kind of awe, amazed at how two filmmakers could have the same material and deliver two wildly different and both excellent takes. What Guadagnino and screenwriter David Kajganich are able to pull from the source material is incredible. There are themes that I don't think even Argento and co-writer Daria Nicolodi even knew they had in there, such as the idea of motherhood's path in life, the duality of man (or woman here), or what an artist (here dancers) does when they are performing the work of another artist. Fitting theme for a remake. Guadagnino wisely decided to walk next to Argento rather than try to fill his shoes and created a companion piece. Full of stunningly beautiful and surreal moments, this goes on the short list of great horror remakes. Anyway, that wraps up 2018 for me as I won't see a better film this year.",Suspiria
45,Abdulxoxo,Admirable but not very likable,7,25 July 2021,"From a technical perspective the biggest positive for the film was the cinematography. Outside the school was drab and grey, usually seen through rain or snow; but that was contrasted by the inside of the school which was often bight and colourful. The lighting used was impressive, particularly during the dance scenes. Also the camera techniques adopted sometimes gave the impression that you were watching a horror film made in the 70's or 80's. I also thought the score was eerie, which was perfect for the tone the movie was going for. The costume design was also noteworthy. In particular there was one costume the girls wore during the main dance sequence which was very memorable. As far as the performances; Mia Goth plays Sara, one of the other dancers and Susie's closest friend at the school. It's not the most in your face role, but I liked her character and think of all the performances hers was the most consistent. The likes of Johnson and Swinton (in 3 different roles) had moments when they were good, but also moments when they weren't so good. Final positive I'd like to say how much I enjoyed the first of the gory sequences, which involved one of the dancers having their body brutally contorted as a result of some kind of supernatural forces. Moving on to the negatives; firstly I did not fully understand what was happening in this movie. The basic premise of the plot I could follow, but there was so much other stuff surrounding that plot that you truly struggled to keep up. Many of the supernatural elements didn't fully make sense. The movie rarely explain certain things were happening. Throughout the film much of the dialogue related to German politics of the 1970's. The vast majority of it was just white noise that went over my head. Unfortunately this political dialogue took up a lot of screen time unnecessarily. It added nothing to the plot. All it did was highlight that the film was set in 1977 Berlin, which we were told at the beginning anyway. At least 30 to 45 minutes could have been cut from the film if you took away all the stuff that wasn't to do with the main plot. That could potentially have made it a much more enjoyable film, as opposed to the self-important slog that at times it felt to be. Overall, From a technical perspective I can appreciate that the film did some impressive things; but simply as a whole the movie missed the point. The bottom line is that it's admirable, but barely likable.",Suspiria

47,gianmarcoronconi,Good,6,24 September 2021,"Generally acceptable film and very slow. This film does not manage to have the same standards as the film it should be the remake of, it does not give the same emotions and not even the same tension.

It looks like an almost completely different story because it doesn't reinvent/honor the original movie essence.",Suspiria
49,aciessi,Spellbinding,9,13 September 2020,"Suspiria 1977 was a technicolor, bloody, psychedelic cult classic of a horror film by Dario Argento. It doesn't beg to be remade. But I dare to say that Suspiria 2018 is not a remake. Though it bares the same title, this is a wholly original, art-house horror film inspired by Suspiria 1977. A new interpretation, if you will. It still centers around a dancing school in Berlin that is run by a coven of witches. It captures the same sense of reality bending horror that resembles a nightmare. But what it brings to the table is a hyper-realistic, gloomy backdrop that accurately depicts the civil unrest occurring in Berlin at that time. There is a political undercurrent that Guadagnino is trying to examine here and though it doesn't advance the story in any way, I still found it interesting. I admired how far this film was willing to go creativity to capture is terrifying vision. As with most art-house pictures, you either dig it or you don't. Everyone who's seen this film has a difference of opinion and emotion on it all. But striking the biggest core of all for me was Tilda Swinton's performance as three different, unique characters. She is stunning. Her transformation into Dr. Josef Klemperer will leave you speechless and moved. It's an absolute thrill to watch.",Suspiria
50,rockman182,Suspiria (2018),6,27 October 2018,"I absolutely love Dario Argento's Suspiria. I have that film and Phenomena on special collector's edition Blu-Ray discs and visit them every year. Re-watched the original Suspiria recently and it absolutely still holds up. The score, the atmosphere, the vivid colors, and the horror, its just superb. Was very into Luca Guadagnino's version of it and it quickly became one of my most hyped films of the year. A Bigger Splash sold me on him and Call Me By Your Name was absolutely stellar. It just felt like the film was meant to be re-imagined in the hands of a director so capable of creating art. After watching the film, I have to say I'm still digesting it and wanted to like it way more than I do.The film has a political backdrop in Germany of 1977, and follows a young ballet hopeful named Susie Bannion (same name as the protagonist in the original) as she quickly becomes the lead in an esteemed ballet director's play. She enters an academy of other hopeful dancers but all is definitely not as it seems. Strange occurrences are common at the school and it becomes a tale of unfolding the witchcraft and monstrosity present at the quarters. The film stars Dakota Johnson, Tilda Swinton (in multiple roles), Mia Goth, and even the original Suzie, Jessica Harper.Let's touch on what I liked first. The dance scenes and the choreography and aura it brings is amazing. Its heart pounding and vicious. The absolute body curling horror that accompanies it is madness. Its all great. I actually loved one of the insane sequences near the end of the film. I think Guadagnino did a wonderful job creating a visual and nightmarish atmosphere when he wanted to. The film is well acted of course, and Thom Yorke's score works well in many scenes. The muted colors, or lack of primary colors gives the film the dark and foreboding mood, a complete departure from Argento's original bright and vivid picture.I feel like the plot needed to be presented in a more direct format. I love the arts and appreciate non linear story telling as much as the next guy (I'm the biggest David Lynch fan ever) but this film could have been condensed to focus on the madness in the school halls. The whole side plot with the doctor ruins the flow of the film and takes back from a film that could have been better with a different style of presentation. Just when you feel like the film starts kicking into life it meanders into something that you don't care as much about.Luckily, Guadagnino was able to present his own vision. The links to the original are fairly minimal and this film is mostly him presenting the madness he had. I just wish it was presented better. With retouching, this film could have been great (though still not as good as the original, although I guess a comparison is unfair as both feel like two different entities). The f'ed up nature of some of the sequences is what breathes Suspiria into live, and unfortunately it needed to focus on that more to avoid is relatively uneven nature. Side note, its hard to tell if that final twisted dance sequence is meant to be comedic or not but the tone was definitely ambiguous, because it was hilarious.6.5/10",Suspiria
51,bob998,Listless,6,23 October 2020,"The key to this review revealed itself fairly early on, when Dakota Johnson tells Tilda Swinton (who looks divine here, as usual) that she went to three performances the company gave in New York, and she had to hitchhike twice. That tells you the depth of commitment that a dancer has to have if she's to progress in her art, and Johnson never shows us one scrap of that commitment from first scene to last. Her performance is listless, as is the movie.",Suspiria

53,kuarinofu,Amateur film-making (in a bad way),4,23 February 2019,"I've seen the original Suspiria and I enjoyed it in a special way.
This one I did not enjoy at all. The story was very basic and it could've been done in about 90 mins. I mean, this would've been a passable movie about witches, not good, but watchable.
Instead they call it Suspiria, tie it with the original in many ways (even having the original lead play a different role in this one only to confuse you) and crank the run time up to 2 hours and 30 minutes.
At first I thought it was just a way of atmosphere building, but no. There are so many scenes of people walking, waiting, rehearsing, flashbacking, indistinguishable nightmares that lead nowhere and mean nothing and all of these are stretched fourfold. Lots of pointless scenes, forced dialogue and characters, unnecessary symbolism that provides for childish-level social commentary and even a post-credit scene (a very stupid one) to bait sequels and to troll you. So much wrong...
Let's get this straight, a movie is a form of art, especially a movie of a specific genre for a specific audience. Some things work and some don't, and if you manage to get something to work in your movie where everyone else fail - you are a talented filmmaker.
But just piling up scenes of whatever comes to your mind when you're drunk or high does not qualify for art. I'm sorry I have to say this. If something happens in a movie, this means that you have something to tell, to show us. The perspective and the tone is important to project your view of the thing you're showing us. Let us think of what you're showing, plant a seed in a viewer's mind, a thought, an idea, a question.
It really feels like someone approached the director and said - put everything in this, we don't care, here's the money. Just show us how much random stuff you can put it. I mean, at some point after the very obvious and disappointing resolution with Jedi decapitations (hi, Nearly Headless Nick) I wasn't sure if the movie is really going to at all. Why didn't the director just look at a mirror (embracing the movie's symbolism) and said - ""It's time to stop""?
This was very bad, and the saddest part is that the movie thinks it's smart or artistically enriched. (I mean, it doesn't even qualify for a style over substance movie, I love some of style over substance movies, like A cure for wellness).
While watching this I wanted to say that I liked some things it had, but when I finished it - I took back my decision. I mean, the style elements worked great at first, the color grading, the film grain, the overall atmosphere of the time period, the lighting. But after enduring 2 more hours of barely lit senseless scenes...I can't. (And the overall 1.85 : 1 aspect ratio gimmick didn't work for me, especially watching this on a 21:9 display).",Suspiria
54,Neptune165,really really great film,7,9 May 2019,"There were scenes where I literally couldn't breathe, and I was just staring at the screen.

Great performances, the cast was perfect, specially Tilda Swinton. The music score Is beautiful, the cinematography is very creepy and sad at the same time. The art design is totally perfect. Luca Guadagnino work is simple a masterpiece. Argento film is amazing and this remake-adaptation is amazing too, two art films.",Suspiria
56,Alexander_Blanchett,Dark and twisted,8,17 November 2018,"After Call Me By Your Name not only ended up as my favorite film of 2017 but also as one of my all time favorites I was utterly curious about the follow up project of Luca Guadagmino who as expected as totally different.
Its a horror mystery thriller with a lot of gore and suspicion. Its a twisted films that first reminds you as a follow up project to ""Black Swan"" but soon developes its very own identity... and of course it is a remake to the famous Dario Argento film, yet very much new interpreted.
The film is full of metaphors and hidden signs and clues and thus not always easy to follow, also because of some really gruesome scenes.
The acting is great. Dakota Johnson finally gets the chance to finally act and boy she did so well. The innocent but sexy and insecure yet still very self-confident character she plays is done excellently. Especially considering that its a character with many shades. Great performance and I hope she follows that path in the future. The true star of time film is Tilda Swinton, who actually plays three characters in the film. Two of them are very prominent in the film and include the male leading character. In that role Swinton is absolutely brilliant and delivers a moving and sad performance of the grieving old man who tries to find out the secrets of the dance company. The other prominent role is the tone of the leader of the company, very cold at first but soon she developes a kindness that confuses the audiences well as you never know if she is serious or manipulative.. at least until the end. A great turn for one of the most versatile actresses out there.
Another perofmrnce that is worth to mention is b Mia Goth who is really great as well. The only weak part was Chole Grace Moretz who really got annoying with her yet short but terribly theatric performance.
The visuals and atmosphere is great. Its very mysterious, grousome and twisted. Maybe a little overlong but at least they took time to develope characters and story.",Suspiria
57,CANpatbuck3664,There's Great Cinematography and Solid Acting... With a Frustrating and Incomprehensible Plot and Payoff,5,7 April 2019,"Far and away the best part of Suspiria is how well it was shot. When you mention great cinematography, you're more often than not talking about movies that use rich environments to display tons of colour to help bring you into the world that they've created. The 2018 version of Suspiria does almost the exact opposite. The environment here is dingy and is dripping with a sense of neglect and conveying a harsh reality. The colour is intentionally muted and it helps show how problematic things were in this time period (which is true to the story, according to the exposition, Madame Blanc had to fight tooth and nail to keep her company open during the most trying of times). The movie manages to create more than a few scenes with a lot of tension and its done through obscuring enough of a character in shadow to make you question what's going on or using an unconventional angle to throw you off the scent of what's really happening. It reminded of someone putting their good arm behind their back and still beating you in an arm wrestling match. It's what kept my attention throughout and all the credit should go to cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom and the team for creating so much under tough circumstances.As much as the 50 shades franchise is awful, this is another good step for Dakota Johnson to help put that behind her. I wouldn't describe her as magnetic but her dancing was impressive and I think she did a solid job at the centre of Suspiria. I'm not sure how good of an actress she is but she's rebounding well and hopefully bigger things are in her future. Tilda Swinton was good in her dual roles, there's a lot of mystery surrounding both of her parts and while she's appropriately cast in one, I think it was a nice wink and a nod to put her in the other part under heavy makeup. Mia Goth did her part as Sara, her character's gradual realization of what was really going on in the studio was the easiest part of the plot to attach myself to. I thought Chloe Grace Moretz did what she could but she was let down by her part, they introduce her so quickly and she's disappears just as fast. There are plenty of other actors and actresses in this movie but they weren't in it enough to comment on their individual performances. Some were better than others but I didn't find any awful ones to point out. It also may please fans of the original that original protagonist Jessica Harper shows up in a small role.With the great cinematography and the largely good acting across the board, I was willing to spot Suspiria points despite the fact that the plot isn't just hard to figure out. It gets to the point that if you haven't seen the original, I don't know how you would get what's going on at all. I HATE movies that are deliberately confusing and keep the audience in the dark without providing a satisfying explanation or payoff in the end. When there's no attempt to extend an olive branch even a little, it p!$$e$ me off. If you're going to play by those rules, you better give me something good in the end and Suspiria's ending is just insane. You don't get an explanation, you get a twist or two, a bloodbath with unimportant characters you spend little to no time with and then it just stumbles to the end of its runtime. My reaction wasn't surprise or shock, it was simple WTF is going on? I understand that this is a mystery but the movie shows who the bad people are fairly quickly but doesn't give any hint at what the plan is until the climax comes about. There's a difference between cultivating a mystique and being too challenging for people to figure out. The climax also doesn't solve the problem, it just brings up as many questions as it answers and hearing professional critics fall all over themselves trying to explain away the issue just makes me want to bang my head against the wall. Just because you've seen the original or love the previous works of the director (I haven't seen Call Me By Your Name, if its good, that's great. It wouldn't change my mind about how badly this finishes up), it doesn't make this a quality product. This movie goes beyond being arty for art's sake and I'm not going to let it off the hook just because I'm not the target audience.I keep trying to expand my horizons and check out more artistic work and films that are described as art house projects. But more often than not, I just end up either frustrated, disappointed or bored. I was all 3 in Suspiria despite the fact it features some inspired work in some areas. This is a film buff's need only apply type of picture, I think the dance torture scene is horrifying enough to recommend but I can't tell you to watch the entire movie just for that scene. If this is your kind of movie, you go ahead and enjoy it but I don't think the general audience is going to feel the same way and judging by the reviews I've seen on this site, I'm confident that I'm not in the minority. I'm giving Suspiria a 5/10 but I'm actually somewhere between a 4 and a 5.",Suspiria
58,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,28 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...An American girl arrives at a dance academy in Berlin, just thankful for the opportunity to audition. But, she quickly wins over the approval of Madame Blanc and is accepted to the company of dancers. The academy, however, is a front for a coven of witches - posing as dance instructors, but with very evil ambitions and bloody rituals. There is a lot more that is hidden from us until the film's final, unforgettable scene.""Suspiria"" isn't a movie to understand. It is a movie to experience. On this level, it scores. The visuals, if you can hang in there long enough, are gut wrenching and visceral. The movie, however, tests your patience between these pieces of eye candy with very bleak, dreary and depressing scenes - devoid of most color. I am only guessing they felt the need for stark contrast to make the final scenes really stand out. The matrons, or collective coven of witches sit around most of the time cackling like hens. The movie moves along at a snail's pace and at certain points, you have to force yourself to pay attention.This is a true horror film. It is unsettling, haunting, and its images will stay in your mind for days. But, it is also fairly boring ... drawn out unnecessarily long at 2 hours and 26 minutes with some rather flat characters. Even Tilda Swinton wasn't really strong enough to carry this film. The strength of the movie is the final act and what happens at the witches' sabbath. I just wish the entire 2 1/2 hours were as entertaining. A recommend, but not a high one.",Suspiria

60,garethcrook,Good... but not really necessary.,7,24 December 2019,"I was expecting slick. Slicker than the 70s original. The trailer suggested slick. There's a good level of grit here though and it's more of a reimagining than a remake. Yes there are dancers and demons, but where Argento's story was simple, this fleshes things out with a little more depth. With that depth though I feel much of the style is lost, certainly in the opening act. Guadagnino's Susperia takes more time, even though the premise is set immediately, it leisurely slow burns and it's really half an hour before anything substantial hits the screen, but when it does... it really hits the spot. Camera, colour, vivid passion it's all there. It's all used more sparingly though, touches of homage, but far from copying its source. The menace before suggested is real here, with inventive scenes of vivid horror. Yes we're 40 years on and yes modern film techniques help a lot, but there's still a rawness present, which gets pretty gory in places. What there's not however is that ever present score. Thom Yorke's work is fantastic, but it doesn't set the tone in the way Goblin did. The biggest issue for me though is the lack of jeopardy. Suzy in the original has an innocence and although here Chloë Grace Moretz plays her with much more confidence, she's never helpless, as ultimately proves to be the case. Her character's given much more purpose, but is it necessary? Arguably not. Is this new version even necessary? No probably not, but it is good. If you're gonna watch one, stick to the original.",Suspiria

62,statuskuo,An Exercise in Futility,4,24 November 2018,"To be fair, I attempted to watch the original Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" twice in high school and never got the appeal. Here, I now attempt Luca Guadagnino's ""Suspiria"" or more accurately ""Vagina Dentata: Wicca"" You can smell the academy's body odor and sour feet. And, quite frankly, if you weren't homosexual going in, you may coming out.Yes, I powered through this film with as much patience as his much praised efforts of ""Call Me By Your Name"" which belabors a similar stylized raw reality. The quick story is a young girl joins a dance academy in Berlin and discovers the place is evil. Simple enough. Then we get into a bunch of witchcraft"" or is is black magic or...voodoo? Who knows? This story certainly doesn't. And it's frustrating since all the elements are there NOT to be a pretentious operatic bore. But it rolls downhill in capturing mood and less tangible substance. For instance, a psychiatrist who investigates the school seems to have a mission due to a patient who is the missing girl the academy is missing. Why is it we spend so much time with him and know so very little (aside from what is told)? He seems to be a convenient mouthpiece to which asks the questions the audience wants to know, or to plug up poorly developed logic problems. One being why do these mind bending witches not seem to bend his investigation away from them (until the end anyway). Furthermore, these all knowing witches seem to turn off their radar when it's convenient for the plot.I do want to revisit Argento's version again to see what it was referencing. I read there wasn't much, since that's how he could present this as ""Luca Guadagnino's 'Suspiria'."" I will say this much...the cinematography keeps you engaged. There is a specific shot that has dual reflections, on one angle the reflection is in focus but the actor is not, on the other reflection, the actor is in focus and the reflection is not.

The film features some dance sequences and special effects that are entertaining, but the story itself made no sense to me. I have no idea what the old doctor had to do with anything or what the coven was even trying to do. And the titles of the 'acts' made no sense to me either. I guess I'm just not smart enough to get this sort of filmmaking. I do wonder why Dakota Johnson would have gone through 2 years of ballet training for this role. The dancing was much more of the 'modern dance' genre than ballet. In fact, I think they could have cast a dancer in the role and put her through a few months of acting school and probably gotten a better result. Anyway, not a film I would recommend.",Suspiria

This is one of the most disturbing, brutal, fascinating, alarming, complex movies I've seen in a long time. I suspect much more will be revealed upon repeated viewing, and indeed it is already on my Must Watch Again Soon List.Highly recommended for fans of thought-provoking horror, provided they can take some thematic brutality, gore, and nudity.

That's where the similarity ends.This film is cold, austere, disjointed and doesn't make a lot of sense. It can be confusing at times. I didn't understand all of it. However, despite it's strong flaws it is engrossing and somewhat intoxicating. It's hard to look away from.The ending to me seemed like a mess. I couldn't tell you what was going on. Three mothers, a fight within the coven? I don't think that part of the story is well told. But, is it interesting? Yes, but just not very fun.

70,TwistedContent,You either love it or hate it,8,26 November 2018,"I'm no Dario Argento expert, but two years ago I saw the original ""Suspiria"" & liked it very, very much. I loved this remake just the same.
I had my doubts while going to the cinema - I had viewed all the negative ratings & the runtime was worrying me a bit, but no doubts of mine were justified.What did I get? A gloomy, bleak drama with an incredible set design, masterfully depicting the 60's in Berlin, an amazing cinematography, editing & sound design, all accompanied with an accomplished score by Radiohead's Tom Yorke. The gloomy, bleak drama at times changed into a tense, graphic, and, to put bluntly - a trippy horror epic. The performances were as tense and gloomy as the atmosphere - really great job by Dakota, Tilda and everyone else involved. While, compared to the original, the remake, rightly so, has many differences, it felt like it has kept everything of value and essence & added some more, mostly fitting things. The only thing that really annoyed me a bit was the stuttey slow-motion gimmick, used a few times towards the end. To be objective, pacing totally might be an issue for a lot of people, but strap-in, sit tight & you will receive an amazing cult horror with a unique feeling all over it.I love movies like ""The Witch"", ""The Neon Demon"" & ""Mandy"", so this was a real treat for me, I was totally engaged with what was going on screen for 95% of the time. I thought that the movie would be generally better received by those, who haven't seen or heard about Argento's original, guess I was wrong. Still, I'm not exactly sure, why there are so many bad reviews, usually I see more sense in different opinions about movies. My honest rating: 9/10.",Suspiria
71,mwilson1976,Director Luca Guadagnino turns into Gaspar Noé and Darren Aronofsky in gut-wrenching new take on the Italian horror classic,6,12 May 2019,"A remake of Dario Argento's 1977 horror masterpiece was always going to be controversial, and whilst this isn't an atrocity on the level of Rob Zombie's Halloween, it is a horror designed to test your patience rather than your nerves. Running a full hour longer than Argento's original it eventually loses its way, but it also has powerful, unsettling imagery that's hard to dismiss. Young American dancer Susie Bannion arrives in 1970s Berlin to audition for the world-renowned Helena Markos Dance Co, and discovers that the company's female directors are a coven of witches. Tilda Swinton has a duel role as dance teacher Madame Blanc, and also (in heavy make up) Dr Klemperer, a Holocaust survivor mourning his wife who starts to investigate the strange goings on at the school. Set in 1977, the movie tacks on many sociopolitical asides, such as frequent radio broadcasts about the Baader-Meinhof Group, and the Berlin Wall is a spooky presence in itself, looming ominously outside the doors of the school. All of this along with a strong message about female empowerment help give the movie an identity of its own, but the nightmare imagery can be confusing most of the time, and it's certainly far too serious to be fun.",Suspiria
72,twelve-house-books,Perverted,1,3 August 2019,This is a completely perverted version of the original story as shown in the first version where a coven of witches is destroyed by a righteous young woman. Skip this one. And the original was a lot scarier as well.,Suspiria
73,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Not sure I have ever felt so conflicted over a film,7,23 October 2018,"Let me preface this by saying that Argento's Suspiria is one of my favorite films of all time, and Goblin is one of my favorite bands of all time. I thought a Suspiria remake was a bad idea to begin with, but when I saw the first trailer for Guadagnino's version, I was floored. Chills ran through me - it was awe-striking. The corpse-like anti-color palette, the beautiful held out shots, the styling of the very tasteful cast, and the spine-tingling sound editing... I was anticipating it all year. Then, I made a point to see Call Me By Your Name a month or so before Suspiria's release. Though I found the first hour of that film to be quite lackluster, the third act gave it all an explosive sense of heartbreaking purpose and twisted it into some kind of strange melancholy classic. This had me feeling even more sure that Luca would do something truly special with Suspiria.Then, I saw it. For the first 45 minutes, I was mostly thrilled. The environments were grimly beautiful, the cast was fantastic, and the cinematography was to die for. There was one truly disturbing sequence through the first chunk, impressively performed and chill-inducing. Then, the movie carried on for a long time, and I had to face the dreaded realization that I was bored. The plot progression seemed to have come to a standstill less than an hour into the 2.5 hour runtime and really went nowhere until the ending. In the original, the lack of plot was part of the magic - a sense of dread builded effectively through the nightmarish atmosphere as you continued to wonder what was really going on in this academy - this mystery was the magic. In this new film, we receive the thematic spoilers in the very first scene, ""They're witches!"", immediately stomping out that element of mystery. The dread really fails to remain throughout. The entire second hour of the film primarily consists of meandering dialogue about German history and an old German psychiatrist's ex-wife and their past together, but even after the film was over, I found myself thinking, why are we supposed to care about this old man? And what relevance does his story have to do with the rest of the characters and the supernatural things happening at the academy? I felt there was far too much time spent with his character, which failed to add anything to the element of horror, nor to the element of emotive resonance. The fact that it's clearly someone wearing prosthetics (Tilda Swinton) doesn't help the cause, either - it was a distraction from any moment of heartfelt possibility, at least for me. This, along with the fact that not much interesting is really happening with any of the women at the academy for an entire hour of the film (unless you're really into dancing - I feel that nearly half of the movie takes place on the dance floor, with almost no elements of horror surrounding most of the sequences), really decimated the flow of what I thought Suspiria would have and should have been.Let me also add that Thom Yorke's score was, in my opinion, the weakest part of the whole thing. Not only did the majority of his music lack an arching sense of general creepiness, but it also lacked innovation. It mostly just sounded like drab, phoned-in piano-based songs that sit somewhere in the middle-ground realm of emotional numbness. This was the biggest letdown about the whole project. It really, really just did not fit the tone of all the gorgeously eerie imagery on the screen.Now that I've spilled the beans about what I didn't like, let me finish by adding what else I loved about it. The last half hour was quite breathtaking. The final dance sequence manages to build the tension immensely through performance and editing alone. It was quite astonishing. Though the finale did nothing for me in a thematic sense, it was an absolute visual feast and it is one of the only segments in the film that will satisfy the majority of traditional horror fans. It becomes such art-horror in the end, that I could only think of one thing... Aronofsky's ""mother!"" from last year... which I actually thought was an utter masterpiece. I really did take quite a liking to this film's ending, but it wasn't quite enough to make up for the lull that was the majority of the film's expansive center. Let me also add that both Mia Goth and Dakota Johnson looked stunning throughout, in their various dresses and outfits. Mia's performance was highly effective and the long red hair on Dakota worked wonders.In the end, Suspiria is an extremely unique film. The one thing I can almost guarantee is that it will be a much different monster than what almost everyone could expect. It's worth seeing for it's strengths: intimidating environments, tasteful cinematography, a very effective cast, and a couple very memorable over-the-top horror sequences....... but I think one would be better off going in prepared for the lull that makes up the meat of it: a whole lot of dance rehearsal, aimless dialogue, and very little scares.",Suspiria
74,markgorman,In my opinion significantly superior to the original,8,22 November 2018,"I was thrilled to see the original of this movie by Dario Argento at Summerhall in Edinburgh during this year's Fringe with the original score performed by Goblin, live on stage.It was a great experience but, in my view, it's an overhyped movie with little to recommend other than the astonishing score and the remarkable cinematography in its vivid, over-saturated colour.The film itself is pretty unremarkable.,But it was enough to tempt me into seeing the remake which is, in my view, much more remarkable.It's an incredibly odd follow on from director Luca Gaudanino's ""Call Me By Your Name' - a touching and sentimental coming of age gay romance set in Italy and starring the incredible Timothy Chalomet.This leaps genres like I've rarely seen a director do.Gaudanino's remake has none of the zing of the original, indeed the colour palette is quite muted. It's also dull throughout as a result of the endless rain (then snow).It's set in 1977 West Berlin with the Baader-Meinhoff (RAF) gang in full flow and providing a sinister backdrop to what is already a sinister movie.Guadanino casts Dakota Johnson (50 Shades of Grey) and a malevolent Tilda Swinton brilliantly, but I also liked the performance of Mia Goth as Johnson's best friend in a crazy dance school.The award winning dance school that Johnson seeks and gains entrance too after a remarkable audition is actually a witches coven and Johnson appears to be the next sacrificial lamb to the God the witches worship.But it's not that straightforward.It's a long, slow, considered movie with an inevitable Sixth Act (yes it's presented in six acts) denouement that's a fantastic gore-fest.The movie is getting mixed reviews and I understand that. It's really slow. It's arthouse not shock mall theatre. If you want Halloween forget it.But it's great.Really well directed and acted and Thom Yorke's score is great although less intrusive than Goblin's.Recommended.",Suspiria
75,fil-nik09,Interesting,6,6 July 2019,"Interesting film, but that is it. It is too confusing and many things are not clear in the end.
It does kinda want to put many things together, but they fail to click and make sense (at least to me).Susie and Madame Blanc were great! Other actresses too. But too bad that characters do not add up to the film's understanding.Music is interesting too.",Suspiria
76,henrycoles9,A distasteful waste of time,3,18 January 2020,"The ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" trilogy swept me off my feet so much so all I wanted to see is more and more of Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. Sadly ""Suspiria"" was one of her movies that were available in the Amazon Prime channels I got, and it was so awful I am grateful there wasn't even much of Dakota in the movie in the first place, so she is not to blame for this fiasco. There was nothing to tell me it was a grubby, dreary, stone-cold fantasy horror movie, mind you. And the fact that the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" movies have a lower rating goes well over my head.",Suspiria
77,flicklover,Really? I should have stayed away!!!,2,11 May 2019,"I really love the original Suspiria. It is my favorite Argento film. Its visual style and music are great. It really introduced me to Italian horror. When I heard of this remake I was reluctant as I always am about remakes. The truth is that it is a complete reimagining, not really a remake. But it is way too long, pretentious and slow for me to recommend it. I admire that something different was tried with this film, but on the other hand why call it Suspiria?I will not go into any plot details but needless to say it is a mess of a movie. It is supposed to be a horror film but has no real suspense. In fact it is so over the top that it is actually funny.The last 30 minutes are especially unintentionally funny.Stay away. Go see the original masterpiece.",Suspiria
78,themadmovieman,Ruthlessly unsettling,8,3 November 2018,"This has to be one of the boldest films ever made. Remaking an absolute classic of cult cinema in Dario Argento's Suspiria, Luca Guadagnino goes all out to tell the same story from the complete opposite perspective, crafting a deeply unsettling and bleak piece combined with ruthless and terrifying horror, all of which comes together to make a truly startling watch.We're often too easily critical of remakes for the simple fact of being remakes, however Guadagnino's Suspiria is the quintessential remake, perfectly summing up why it's a technique that can be used to everyone's benefit. While Argento's 1977 film was a rapid-paced and over-the-top thriller complete with a kaleidoscope of colours, Guadagnino does the exact opposite with his film, turning the same story into something deeply morbid and bleak, but in doing so breathing a completely new life into something that you may think you've already seen.So, while it's fair to compare the two films on a surface level, the fact of the matter is that the two Suspirias couldn't be more different, and while the original is a hugely entertaining nightmare, this remake is something far darker and disturbing.First off, I'm not even going to pretend to understand everything that happened in this film, because it's such an immensely long and deeply layered piece. As a result, it's the sort of movie that will likely become more intelligible and revealing with numerous rewatches, but on first viewing, it proves a fascinating enigma that's just as riveting to watch as it is difficult to unlock.Playing out over six acts, the story's main focus sees the girls and teachers at a prestigious dance academy find themselves at the centre of bizarre and disturbing dark forces. However, there is a whole lot more to Suspiria than that, and unlike the original's role as more of a haunted house thriller, this remake is far more focused on the core psychological trauma that goes on as things become ever darker and more menacing.In that, there is some stunning emotional power here, and in keeping with the film's desperately bleak atmosphere, pretty much all of it is ruthless and devastating to experience. You may not exactly understand what's happening or why, but the genius of Guadagnino's film is that it's still hugely affecting regardless, a testament to the brilliance of so much of the work put in here.It's not an easy-going film by any means, and if you're looking for a more run-of-the-mill drama, then I'm afraid you're going to be rather horrified by Suspiria. However, with its combination of terrifying psychological and physical horror, the movie is a startling watch throughout, and one that takes what was once a rather ridiculous premise, and turn it into something very real and truly unsettling.Of course, it's not just the screenplay that achieves this, as Guadagnino's bold direction, in tandem with some exceptional cinematography, creates one of the eeriest and most unnerving atmospheres I've ever felt in a film, lending further tension and drama to the story.At over two and a half hours long, Suspiria is a rather exhausting watch, something that's compounded by its excruciatingly slow pacing, as well as an emphasis on atmospheric and diegetic sounds over more orthodox dialogue.However, with the stunningly unsettling slow pans and zooms of the camera, the bleak, washed-out colour palette, and the incredible use of natural sounds, the film suddenly becomes a cauldron of all that is disturbing, and as the tension and horror builds and builds in excrutiating and ruthless fashion over the course of the immense runtime, you feel more and more paranoid that something really strange is going on, even to the point that you feel like there's something outside the film's parameters always watching, which really unnerved me.Suspiria is somewhat of a technical masterpiece, and it makes for a hugely striking watch throughout, both on a superficial level, as well as its role in fostering further darkness and tension deeper within.Finally, a word has to go to some of the performances here, because although there isn't anything anywhere near as spectacular as the original film, so much of the acting is integral to the film's depth and atmosphere.Tilda Swinton's presence is stunning on screen, and particularly in her role as a leading ballet instructor, she commands both a terrifying and reassuring aura, something that I can't say I've ever seen before. Meanwhile, Dakota Johnson puts in what is surely the best performance of her career so far, engrossing you deeply in her character without ever going out of her way to stand out, to the point that she's such a magnetic and still enigmatic presence, where absolutely anything could happen and turn the entire story on its head.Overall, then, Suspiria is a pretty masterful film. Deeply disturbing and immensely unnerving at every moment, furthered by exceptional visuals and directing, as well as a whole host of stunning performances, it's one of the most boldly atmospheric films you'll ever see. Its story is full of depth and emotion, and although it is a rather incomprehensible enigma on first viewing, I'm sure it's something that will evolve and open up as the years go by. It's certainly not a film for everyone, but it is without doubt a film that pushes boundaries to the limit.",Suspiria
79,SamJamie,"Pretentious, gross & boring.",2,19 February 2021,"Susie Bannion arrives in 1970s Berlin to audition for the world-renowned Helena Markos Dance Co. When she vaults to the role of lead dancer, she uncovers dark and sinister secrets as they probe the depths of the studio's hidden underground chambers.I found this film to be a convoluted mess that is confusing, slow, and a true chore to sit through. The film is glacially slow whilst presenting very little substance and lacking interesting character development. With muddled plot lines and aggressively grotesque violence, this is a very hard film to like. The film started rather intriguing, to the point of becoming interesting, with Chloë Grace Moretz delivering a noteworthy performance as usual, until the film descends into utter farce as Johnson's character is introduced.Overall, Suspiria is too long, too empty with false fullness - too keen on being visually and viscerally delinquent at every opportunity.",Suspiria
80,coconutkungfu-30704,Garbage,1,20 February 2020,"This one is so awful it almost tarnishes the brilliant original. Even taken on its own merits as a standalone film it just isn't any good. Dakota Johnson's performance is terrible, the interpretation of the Suspiria story is bad and the film does not interest me on a visual level and the music is dull.See the original instead!",Suspiria
81,Aly200,A Passable Remake,6,8 April 2019,"Any giallo fan knows Dario Argento and his classically gory features especially ""Suspiria"". Like numerous other foreign language features, an English remake was inevitable and on the success of 2017's ""Call Me by Your Name"", its director Luca Guadagnino took up the difficult task to redo this Italian classic. Now there has been much division about whether the film is good or just bloated silliness is well earned as the remake has some features that work in its favor, but enough that is detrimental.The plot is mostly the same as the original with American dancer wannabe Susie Bannon coming to Berlin to attend the Markos Dance Academy. Of course the Academy holds dark secrets and soon sets their sights on our heroine. However the climax turns the original's conclusion on its head and isn't really gratifying or that great despite the creative team's best effort to differ from Argento's version.The cast is mostly passe here as opposed to the original film's international cast (with the likes of Jessica Harper as Susie and the late Joan Bennett as Madame Blanc). Dakota Johnson takes the reins from Jessica Harper as Susie, but is as usual quite lifeless in the part. Looking like she is sleepwalking, whispering her lines like her '50 Shades' tenure and hardly bringing anything new to the table (except for the climax's twist). Her dance skills are relatively decent, but not quite in the same league as Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan"". Mia Goth is equally not so impressive as Susie's classmate and friend, Sara though she does try. She does understand the bond that develops between the girls, but never quite gets there like the original film. The obvious standout of the film is Tilda Swinton taking on three roles as Madame Blanc (the head dance-mistress), Dr. Klemperer (a psychiatrist) and Mother Markos (the head of the Academy). Swinton flawlessly bounces between her characters giving each one their own personality that is haunting, tragic and enigmatic. If only the other lead characters could've had such depth.In contrast to the original film's neon-like color palette, the remake takes on a more drab and muted palette with mostly gray and white mixed with red in certain sets. While it's nicer to have a more subtle coloring, the muteness doesn't give much personality to the environment or exciting. The direction is solid as Guadagnino brings his best game to the film, but it doesn't hold up too well to the director's previous success. As mentioned the film's climax has been the turning point as most haven't liked the new twist. I admire the writer's intention to differ from the original end, but changing Susie's place within the narrative wasn't satisfying or even fit how she's behaved through the film. She is meant to be a pawn, but is somehow not? It doesn't work for this type of story.",Suspiria
82,amgee-89551,WTF!,4,24 February 2019,Major let down film. Very slow & confusing. The acting was great especially from Tilda Swinton & Dakota Johnson. It was well directed by Luca Guadagnino but he can't match up to Dario Argento for cinematography & lighting. One Time Watch unfortunately. It's alot different from the original which will tick off die hard fans of Argento original. 3/10,Suspiria
83,brunovanael,Inbetweener,6,9 May 2020,"I was surprised to see quite a few 1 or 10 reviews here. The 1 star reviews I cannot understand. Ok, it's not your cup of tea, but at least the solid acting or passionate dancing is good for some appreciation. The film is pretty arty, so if that is not your thing, just skip it. For me it was pretty compelling, different with a nice cinematography, directing and story. An arthouse B-horror movie with a budget. Quite distinct from any other movie, but certainly not for everyone. Totally worth a view but for me... not a mind blowing revolutionary 10 star movie.",Suspiria
84,FelipeCarrillo,"Bordering on brilliance, Guadagnino turns into Gaspar Noé and Darren Aronofsky in gut-wrenching new take on the giallo classic",9,12 April 2019,"Italian maestro Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" is a slice of art, visually speaking. Released in 1977, the most renowned, expressive work of the ""Deep Red"" cineasta is a feast for the eye and ear, with a score, cinematography, and mise-en-scène as bold as fascinating that conjured a horror film that curdled the blood through images, not words. At the time, a remake of such a theatrical, personal work sounded insane and unhealthy. Then, the response exacerbated as the names of who'd be in front of and behind the camera quickly came up. Don't hold your breath anymore, this new ""Suspiria"" is sheer atmosphere, austerity, and shock. Even if Argento himself considers it ""betrayed the spirit of the original,"" it is one of the few rare slices of slow-burning horror as gorgeously gruesome as coldly visceral, as life-threatening and powerful as to set up itself as a polarizing modern masterpiece.Italian filmmaker Luca Guadagnino takes the biggest and oddest step-up of his career. In the wake of his pitch-perfect Oscar-winning drama ""Call Me by Your Name,"" Amazon Studios came to the aid of his new movie, a horror film, namely an unheard-of version of a grandiose piece considered by many as a giallo classic. Guadagnino gets a truly personal connection with his most risky production yet, a deeper involvement that makes sense by breaking down this radical new take the filmmaker executes on the primary story. David Kajganich keeps the backbones almost untouched, at least until the beginning of the second act, where director and screenwriter opt for speeding up in terms of visual, storytelling complexity. This new vision ends up delivering a nearly independent film that employs a brand only as a base, and then building up a viciously dark, stressful and enigmatic fortress.Anyone who buys- aware -a movie ticket to be buried alive in a 152-minute oppressive fiction that feels like a mid-budget film experiment that will test you since the first and most painful great sequence is really a brave person.It owns you, you try to get used to it and you're in; you fight back and I assure you that you will suffer even more than this savagely beautiful nightmare's ill-fated ""innocents"".Set in the German capital, the same year of the original film's release, Chloë Grace Moretz and Lutz Ebersdorf- huge surprise here hidden under facial and genital prosthetics and an Oscar-worthy makeup -introduce the essentials to re-immerse us in the plot with a cold, pessimistic background. Enter Dakota Johnson, playing Jessica Harper's character - she comes back in a quite small role, - Susie Bannion, an American ballet dancer who is transferred to Berlin, where performs an audacious, perfectly edited audition sequence to enter hell. Avoiding spoilers, if you're one of the few who have seen the 1977 film and expect a by-the-numbers adaptation, you are going to be flatly disappointed by the 40-minute mark. From the very first minutes, it advises us it won't be an easy journey- 7 walkouts, in my case -as this is a re-imagination that guarantees you shocking surprises that make up for your loyalty and patience; ""Suspiria"" belongs, on its own, to that controversial new term: ""elevated horror"".The script of American David Kajganich - who re-teams with the director after ""A Bigger Splash"" - is like firewalking, every footstep is a new challenge that pushes you to move forward. The core premise itself is already more than appealing: prestigious dance company, omens, sacrifices, hierarchies, secrets and a glorious, over-the-top witches' Sabbath. Kajganich creates, however, more complex situations, leaves open some metaphorical sequences and, even though he doesn't turn characters into true humans, makes them more assertive to keep the viewer hooked. Of the six chapters and the epilogue the film is divided into- with such precise title cards that ridiculously mean each 20-minute division, -three are still in my mind brighter than ever, and even if the ending section hurts its modern masterpiece status, each chapter is maximized by a magnanimous Tilda Swinton and a resurgent Dakota Johnson.As of today, it's already a tradition that from any of the film festivals comes a film that means an unforgettable experience, whatever the reason may be. Generally, they employ and/or deal with similar subjects: explicit violence operating in at least one sequence that makes the audience so uncomfortable that many leave the theater; uber-sensitive matters treated openly; to turn the viewer into a masochist or a voyeuristic, -that, and get one of the lowest grades on CinemaScore®. Darren Aronofsky owned that position with ""mother!"" two years ago, a multi-layered masterpiece of biblical and environmental metaphors. 2018 was an interestingly competitive year, with ""Annihilation"" and ""' The House That Jack Built ' vying for the label. All the signs were that ""Hereditary"" was going to be the champion, but Amazon shot at Venice last September, obtaining statim the trophy.Poeticized by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's glorious cinematography- Academy, cruel snub, -the imagery unfolded here is indelible, hair-tossingly fearless, and primitively spine-tingling. Within the walls of the Markos Dance Academy, life is given for art, dancers hiding out from the strong political and social storm out there, willing to spiral down into this infernal place; do anything for the sake of dance! Oppressively toning down from brown to gray, the film keeps its tone until the ending nightmare comes in, which replaces visions, dance sequences, rehearsals and upsetting developments with a slow-burn scarlet revelation. Occultism, witchcraft and awakening become flesh and blood in about twenty minutes, which also means sure sleepless nights. Walter Fasano's editing work is equally commendable, adapting to its profuse narrative and taking your breath away.There's no room for doubt: what Guadagnino and all his talented crew have made is an achievement in capital letters. Cinematographically, it gives a perfect demonstration on how to present innovatively a point of view/original idea, no matter how insane it is. To exemplify one of the many pitch-perfect mixed moments between excellent sound editing, Thom Yorke's virtuoso score, cinematography, production design, performances and choreography itself is the most visceral, diabolically cruel dance sequence, if you already had the pleasure to see it, you know what I'm talking about; the masochistic initiation seance this new arty classic delivers is simply brutal, definitely not one for everyone. As odd and unnatural as intimate and predatory, the camera movements, angles and framing, particularly in the raw rehearsals, are brilliantly clever, passive or aggressive according to need, orchestrating an increasingly compelling whole. Leave skepticism and apathy behind, warm up and let's dance.""Suspiria"" by Luca Guadagnino conjures up an unexpectedly political, obsessively disturbing and blistering chiller. Clearly, the most personal movie for the author yet, this standalone interpretation of Dario Argento's giallo classic is a blend of ""Black Swan"" and ""mother!"" starring a coven of witches. This unforgettable, masterful new take within the Markos dance academy values and respects its legacy, while at the same time, pushes the original to more terrifying, darker places, rising an experience like no other.",Suspiria
85,bastos,That's how you do it,8,26 January 2021,"Now, for me, this is exactly how you do a remake! I'm extremely picky when it comes to remakes and I usually end up hating them, even more widely liked ones like The Ring or The Departed, I usually loathe them. I find them lazy and unoriginal and more often than not they end up being soulless copies of the originals. Luca Guadagnino managed to do the impossible, make me like a remake of a classic. Maybe Suspiria was the perfect subject for a remake and even though I can understand what many people find appealing, Argento's original is not a favorite of mine. I love it's colors but everything else I find underwhelming, even the celebrated Goblin score. Maybe my low expectations worked favorably, but I always walk in with low expectations to a remake and it usually doesn't make a difference. Luca Guadagnino managed to take a beloved classic and make it his own by totally changing the atmosphere and look of the movie without totally disrespecting the original, which is a very tight rope to walk on, but he pulled it off flawlessly. Every aspect of this movie has been methodically put together to create a hellish experience, the cinematography, music and choreography, all very good. If the original was a summer dream this is an autumn nightmare. It isn't to say that it doesn't have its problems, mainly concerning the plot, as at its core it's just another witch movie, with all the expected tropes. But what I find exceptional is the execution both technically and aesthetically. All the performances are really good, with an amazing and very eclectic cast. Even Dakota Johnson who I find kind of limited as an actress comes out remarkably well in this. But I haven't yet mentioned the elephant in the room and what I find as the most bizarre decision regarding this adaptation. Tilda Swinton is an exceptional actress that I usually like very much, but what the hell were they thinking?!? I don't even know whose decision it was to make her play those two roles, and I'll even go as far as to admit I didn't recognize her, but what was the point of that?!? Was it an ego trip for both director and actress or just a strange experiment? Who knows... It's very bizarre and if you know beforehand it's just distracting. Other than that, as I said, perfect remake.",Suspiria
86,Gresh854,It's About Time 2018,9,30 October 2018,"In a year full of disastrously diseheartenting movies, and only a handful of truly marvelous feature flicks, you can infer that I had forfeited my hopes of receiving anymore apical cinematic entries for the rest of the following two months we have left till this year's official cease. Then, I saw Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria and now, I don't even care.2018 is done folks. It has been terminated, no más, concluded, end of story. Suspiria has demolished it. DEMOLISHED IT. I am solemnly satisfied. This was all I had desired.For those who will find a deep-seated, affectionative infatuation for this movie-like I, myself, had-will have to lay the groundwork for the ebullient forthcoming of ""the others"". People will hate and I mean, freaking HATE this movie. I can already picture the headlines of triggered, ferocious IMDb users:""This Movie Makes No Sense!""""I Don't Get It??? Bad Film!!!""""Why Old Man Sound Like Lady?""""Where Jump Scares At?""""Left Theater Immediately After First Hour!""""Stop Remaking Movies! I'm A Hip And Relevant Cinema-Geek!""""If I Don't 100% Get Story Than I Don't Like Movie Cause Thinking Is For Dweebs!!!""""Ugh...It's Just Nonsensical Arthouse Stupidity...Again...""As much as I'm despondent by this marginally bloated assumption I have devised, I can ""de facto"" and whole-heartedly, completely get behind it. If you don't favor obscure, unduly eerie, and furthermore, well vulgar, gory, violence, you will discover a rooted, animosity for Suspiria.Guadagnino inherently perhaps, simply said, ""Screw it. I'm fatigued of consulting preachy love tales. Let's make the darkest, most diabolical, 'Mephistophelian' movie of the decade!"" In my case, I quite fathom the kind of freako stuff that he has beared to this renewed imprint of Suspiria, so, alast.There's this special, little-okay, not necessarily little-collossal movie, that means so dear and darling to me, called Rosemary's Baby, which is an undeniable mystery, thriller classic that was released back in '68. Scant to no films have for some odd reason, tried to replicate Roman Polanski's pragmatic yet, introspective verisimilitude (besides, maybe, The Exorcist). One reason Suspiria works like this, insidious charm, is because it reckons back to that design of atmospherical filmmaking-even more so than harkening back to the habits of the original Suspiria. This is a horror film that lustfully dances about every slender play of superlative routines it has to offer. Not only that, the flourish and extravaganzaness of its obsurdity is what makes its more capacious moments feel everlasting. It's ""guarenteed"" to leave an impact on each audience member who witnesses it, each coming out with different pleasures and perspectives of its direction. This, effect, is what I consider to be a pure token of exquisite, extricating filmmaking. Make the audience conflicted, but conflicted with utter terror of what they had just endured with such philosophical ahh.
Suspiria features some of the, if not, maybe, the best editing for a thriller, tension-filled feature ever conceived. At first, it is arduous to get worn to, but once you've hustled into it-remember we have nearly more than two-and-a-half hours to establish it-you're painstakingly locked in. The potency of filler-layers, brisk-cuts, and incisions between numerous of sequences replayed all within unison ensures this movie with an edging occupancy. Sir, Walter Fasano exlemplifies tension at heights never before scrutinized. And the SOUND DESIGN. YES!I've dearly MISSED the broken, shaggy, camera zooming technique old movies used to utilize, and this movie benevolently delivers it back! The ruggidness and defilement of these camera methods all the more adds to the uncanny apprehension, but additionally, adds to the apparent 70s style of golden horror movie premonition Suspiria overtures.Guadagnino directed his freaking life and soul out onto this project, and visually, it shows. Not only, just, in terms of supervising the cinematographers, editors, and cameraman on how certain components will be borne about, but also, with his guidance among the many talented actresses and choreographers. The dancing choreography is Academy-Award-Winning worthy in its own rights. The actresses bleed their summit amounts of expertise into every waltz, every set of dialogue, and every moment of exemplary dread.Sidenote, but the costumes and set pieces are PULCHRITUDINOUS.Can someone band together and manufacture a group with me that worships Thom Yorke please? He's actually the BEST. It's hard to live up to the original, perfect Goblin score from the '77 Suspiria, but he was damn close to resonating an almost as emblematic theme for Suspiria. Suspirium and Volk deserve Oscar nominations immediately.The third act is something I like to refer to as the ""ultimate climax."" After the amplifications have occurred, receiving such an excessively overcooked finale as the ""desert"" to such a tragic episode is what we horror fanatics invoke to as the finale deemed rewarding to us. This is a serial killer's dream times one-hundred.No joke, I wanted to hurl my guts out while witnessing Suspiria's finale. Similar to how I felt about this year's Mandy, Suspiria serves as an embodiment of the absolute peak filmmaking etiquette finesse can whop. I have to give points to Guadagnino. He's crafted a legitiment, visible representation of a nightmare. So, would I claim it to be the brightest, most upmost horror finale of the century? Certainly, right next to Cabin in the Wood's finale though, of course.Guadagnino Suspiria is a whole other beast from Dario Argento's Suspiria, and, honestly, I think I favor it ever so slightly more than Argento's, in a twisted, sort-of besmirched fashion.Additionally, this is how a remake SHOULD be done. You keep the basic premise vibrant, but you don't pursue the story beat by beat. In fact, you make it EXCEEDINGLY offbeat from the original.Like I said before, this movie is just shy of being two hours and fourty minutes and instantaneously, after the credits roled, I immediately had the desire to glimpse at it once more. I couldn't care less how lengthy it was, it was ""that"" bewitching.I cannot stress this enough, but, Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria is REAL horror. Arcane, and slightly pretentious horror? Yes. But sometimes the esoteric and pretentiousness is the very element that can make a film hair-raising. The unknown is what makes us, as humans, anxious. This movie relies on your confusion, your quaking unwillingness to understand the abnormality of realms nevermore delineated in this human world of witchcraft Guadagnino has birthed. As grotesque as that may sound, that's frankly, a personal idiosyncrasy that sets me off during a horror movie.The deft fuse of Guadagnino's A-1 directing and the fervidly fueled fear that believe it or not, does contain an imposing message, is what makes me want to immediately see Suspiria after the film had halted. A fair warning to all: You will cringe, you will dismay, and you will awe during your viewing of this bloodful glorification of cinematic virtuosity whether you like it or not. Guaranteed.

87,Bertaut,"Politically juvenile, with a troubling approach to the Feminine, but it's certainly convinced of its own profundity",4,2 December 2018,"Released in 1977, Dario Argento's giallo classic Suspiria (1977) has a plot you could fit on a stamp - a young American dancer goes to a famous Dance Academy in Germany, only to find it's a front for a witches coven. By no means is it a good film, with terrible acting, a dire script, and laughable effects, but it's immensely enjoyable, mainly because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Luca Guadagnino's remake is the polar opposite - it has an intricate plot covering all manner of themes and topics, featuring several new characters, and setting everything against a complex socio-political background; the acting and effects are excellent; it takes itself very, very seriously; and it continually tries to prove to the viewer that it is much more than a piece of kitsch horror. The real question, however, is not how similar or dissimilar it is to Argento. The real question is whether the film is a beautifully mounted insightful exploration of female sexuality, a celebration of a self-contained matriarchy set against the destructive chaos of a failing patriarchy, and a psychoanalytical investigation of national trauma and World War II guilt, or is it an overlong, dull, self-important, incoherent mess, that in trying to be both feminist and feminine somehow ends up being both misogynist and misandrist?Set in ""Divided Berlin"", the film begins with Patricia Hingle (Chloë Grace Moretz, who appears to be cornering the market in rubbish Hollywood remakes), a student at the prestigious Helena Markos Dance Academy arriving at the home of her psychoanalyst, Dr. Josef Klemperer (Tilda Swinton, credited as Lutz Ebersdorf). Terrified and not making much sense, Hingle tells Klemperer she has discovered something sinister about the Academy and is now in fear for her life. Meanwhile, Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson), a Mennonite from Ohio, arrives at the Academy hoping to audition. Impressed with her abilities, lead choreographer Madame Blanc (also Tilda Swinton, channelling Pina Bausch), admits her to the Academy, and Susie quickly finds herself dancing the lead in the Academy's upcoming piece, Volk. Elsewhere, Klemperer is trying to find out what happened to his wife, Anke (Jessica Harper, who played Susie in the original), who disappeared in 1944, whilst also investigating the Academy, enlisting the aid of Susie's roommate, Sara Simms (Mia Goth). Meanwhile, the coven holds a fractious election for leader.Set in October 1977, the events of the German Autumn are constantly on the fringes of the narrative; Ulrike Meinhof's death in police custody in May 1976, the imprisonment of Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, the activities of the far-left, anti-imperialist terrorist group Red Army Faction, the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181, and the kidnapping of Hanns Martin Schleyer. And it is in relation to politics where we encounter the first, and certainly not the last, of the film's problems. Guadagnino, working with screenwriter David Kajganich, employs a pseudo-Jungian approach to show that the country's political turmoil runs parallel to the struggle for control of the coven. The once harmonious group has now devolved, just like Germany, into factionalism, backroom political manoeuvring, subterfuge, and animosity. But to what end does he make this parallel? What is he trying to say? Rarely have I encountered a narrative which employs such blatant yet inconclusive and vague political contextualisation. Take the Berlin Wall as an example, which is literally right outside the Academy's door. Why is it there? Why are there so many shots of it? What purpose does it serve in the narrative? None of the political symbols amount to much; they certainly don't inform any grand thematic statement or political thesis. Guadagnino bombards the viewer with empty historical and political themes which do nothing for the central storyline, functioning instead as decoration, trivialising and disconnected.Also important in relation to the film's politics is Vergangenheitsbewältigung (""Overcoming the past"") - essentially, Germany's attempt to come to terms with World War II and the Holocaust. This is primarily seen in Klemperer's search for his wife, which throws up another problem. Klemperer, who is not in Argento's original, is a surrogate for the audience. Nothing wrong with that, it's a standard screenwriting technique used to facilitate more organic exposition. However, he is a distracting and painfully on-the-nose device to afford Guadagnino a vehicle for a political subplot, which is superfluous to what is happening in the coven. Every reference to Anke could be removed from the film, and it would work just as well. In fact, it would work better. In a story ostensibly about the Feminine, it's rather troubling that the emotional core is male. The film's preferred point of view is his, with even the epilogue focusing on him. Klemperer is quite literally a man in a woman's world, but exactly why Guadagnino felt the need to shoehorn a man into a story about women is anybody's guess.Which brings us to another theme; femininity (if not necessarily feminism). Susie is told by head matron Tanner (Angela Winkler) that the academy ensures the ""financial autonomy of our girls""; speaking of Nazi Germany, Blanc says the regime wanted women to ""close their minds and keep their uteruses open""; Susie is reminded that ""before the war, Germany had the strongest women"". As Klemperer is played by Swinton, the film effectively has an all-female cast (apart from two cops whose main scene involves the witches hypnotising them and mocking the size of their genitalia). However, the film isn't interested in idealising female empowerment. Instead, it depicts a matriarchy beset by disruption and the chaos of a struggle for power; Guadagnino tells Jezebel, ""if we talk about the Great Mother, we cannot deny the terrible mother. True feminism is something that doesn't shy away from the complexity of the female identity.""But does the film imply that a powerful group of women is something to be inherently feared? Partly. There's a very thin line between condemning the male gaze and recreating it, and it's a line which Suspiria frequently crosses. Maybe the problem here is simply that a story inherently about matriarchy, female empowerment, and the importance of motherhood, is a story a man can't tell very well. I'm reminded of Sofia Coppola's remake of The Beguiled (2017), of which she argued, ""this story had to be directed by a woman. The essence of it is feminine, it's seen from a female point of view."" Suspiria also has a feminine essence, but it doesn't have a female point of view, and one can't help but wonder what a talented female director like Coppola, Mary Harron, Patty Jenkins, or the genius that is Lynne Ramsay would have made of this material.However, even aside from these problems, there are a plethora of other issues. The character of Blanc is poorly written, and is stripped of agency towards the end of the film. As for the matrons, apart from Tanner, none receive an iota of characterisation; they are simply a jumble of non-individualised extras. The same is true of the dancers. Additionally, there's a cliché-riddled scene showing Blanc telepathically channelling nightmares to Susie, full of images of skulls, worms, rotting flesh, etc. Nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before. Finally, the film is immensely silly in places. For example, the much-talked-about climax is presided over by what can only be described as a female Jabba the Hut wearing sunglasses.From an aesthetic point of view, there's a great deal to admire, as one would expect from Guadagnino. Walter Fasano's editing is wonderfully disjointed and cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's compositions are fascinating, often putting the camera in such a position as to purposely give a less than perfect view of a particular space. Combined, these two techniques are disorientating and frequently defamiliarising, rendering mundane geographical spaces as foreboding and unknowable, almost protean, never allowing the viewer to forget that something is not quite right in this milieu. Contributing to this sense is the blocking, particularly the recurring motif of staging conversations so that one character is off-screen, only visible to the audience via reflection. Especially noticeable is the film's colour, or lack thereof. Whereas Argento's original was awash in garish and exaggerated reds, purples, blues, greens, and yellows, Guadagnino's remake was conceived as ""winterish"", with as limited a use of primary colours as possible; grey, beige, and brown predominate.Self-indulgent like little else I can think of, Suspiria is absolutely convinced of its own profundity. Far, far too long and far too self-serious, its themes and messages are poorly iterated, it's insanely dull for long periods, and it's badly unfocused. It's almost an hour longer than the original, and, honestly, it uses that hour to say precisely nothing of interest. The simple fact is that the slight story at the film's core (a coven of witches using a dance academy as a front) is unable to bear the massive weight of themes and narrative diversions heaped upon it; the vehicle just can't carry the message. Its politics are no more insightful than tabloid headlines, and serve only to detract from what is supposed to be the narrative's focus. Ultimately, it has little to say about femininity, feminism, political protest, the Holocaust, Cold War Germany, or World War II guilt, but it sure works hard to convince us it has a great deal to say about such topics. As cold as the Berlin winter it depicts, Suspiria is equal parts emotionless, mechanical, and dull.",Suspiria
88,anthonyjlangford,Merit but not emotion,5,28 April 2019,"For all its inventiveness and artistic flair, it remains aloof, unconnected and tedious. Building a connection with a character initially, like the original, would provide us an emotional anchor to all the mayhem. But its just not there. Neither are the scares or a steady plot. It's too chaotic, especially given how much is revealed early.As disturbing as some scenes are, there's not enough reason for us to care. Its running time only serves to prolong the monotony, sadly, as its rich style has much to admire.",Suspiria
89,TuesdayThe17th,"Hideous, grotesque, weird. But a truly AMAZING piece of art",10,31 January 2019,"This is top shelf cinema at its finest. This is not a direct remake of Suspiria 1977, but more of a reimagining. It is a very artful horror film and it stands strong as a masterpiece among all genres. It was cool how this movie kind of crept through the indie horror circuit the way of did. You would think for what it is, you would've heard more about it.. Dario Argento is adored by many and it was refreshing to see a remake of a classic horror film that wasn't one of Stephen King's stories. The original is only about 90 minutes and the new one is almost twice as long. This is because the new one is an intricately well made film from the heart.. The passion is palpable. It IS truly a masterpiece. You can really tell that Luca Guadagnino, director of ""Call Me By Your Name""(which floors me that he went from making that movie to this movie) put his all into this movie. It was a work of art for him and it shows. This film blew my mind on multiple levels. Many reviewers have said it is boring. That is a joke to me as I felt that this was one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. It felt lile every scene was important to the story and the deep and darkly increasing feeling of dread through out really keeps the viewer glued to the screen. This film was very disturbing and gross and really only for fans of very dark and raw horror films. The characters are well cast and the dancing is phenomenal. It is a very impressive movie overall. It stands alongside films like ""the VVitch"", ""Hereditary"", and ""Mother"" . I am pleased to own the blu ray and look forward to Luca's next film. I highly recommend this movie, but only if ur brave enough...",Suspiria

The emptiness and loneliness produced with the 8 mm lenses generate an antithesis with the motto of ""family"" or ""sisterhood"" that they preach in the dance school, giving a sensation in the spectator that everything is wrong all the time but without even having to mark it in the script, an intelligent script with a direction and edition of the same level.

What drives me mad is the run time. 2 hours 31 minutes for a story that could be easily told in 1 hour 45 minutes. So I lost a lot of time for a mediocre story. I would have given even a worse rating, if it wouldn't get so gory shocking scenes at the end. That's the only point it can really score with - as a horror movie.

95,PotassiumMan,"Provocative, haunting, jumbled, extremely polarizing remake",7,11 November 2018,"Large groups of people seem to either be awed by this film or utterly revile it. I, however, am willing to go against the grain and take the middle ground. This is neither a masterpiece, nor is it a disaster.It's a highly ambitious remake that attempts to weave political and artistic themes together into one cornucopia of fantasy-horror-historical expression, and unfortunately it only succeeds some of the time. Does this film bite off more than it can chew? One could argue that, but sometimes I'd rather a film try to do too much and partially fail than play it safe and thereby come out less memorable.What tends to give this film more bite is its ferocious dance sequences. I can only imagine how much work went into that aspect of the filmmaking. There is also a wonderful recreation of the sterile bleakness of late 1970s Berlin back when the city was still divided during the Cold War. As far as performances go, there isn't a false note. Dakota Johnson gives a nuanced turn as an aspiring American dancer who comes to Berlin in 1977 to join a world-renowned dance company, which just might be dominated by a host of witches. Tilda Swinton gives an equally disquieting turn as one of the dance instructors. Chloe Moretz Grace turns out to be under-utilized.Although some scenes don't feel as artistic as they could have been, this is still an arresting cinematic experience overall. Putting its inconsistency in execution aside as well as a seemingly winding conclusion, I recommend this film for those looking for something ambitious and off-the-wall.",Suspiria

Dakota Johnson does it great, the special effects are good, it has good photography, the disturbing scenes are well done and look great. What I didn't like was that the story unfolds so slowly, that the ending is so weird, and instead of being disturbing, it's funny. Personally, I feel that I should better understand these types of horror films, that the development of the story is slow but attractive, in the aspect of generating disturbance, in general it does not cause me such feeling during certain parts of the film and not only with this one but also with other films of this type since in my opinion they do not focus on situations related to reality to generate fear in the general public. It has a far-fetched terror but I feel that the story is slow and not very attractive, becoming boring and generating a lack of interest in the film.",Suspiria

It is a horror film, partly by way of Don't Look Now and The Blair Witch Project.The Baader-Meinhof terror in Berlin initially seems like a strange backdrop for an Amish girl to find herself in, but the film is simply using them as a 'vessel', much like the coven use the dancers. Her start as the ingenue can't hide that our Amish hero is a little too well directed to her fate.I thought the running time was fine, but others didn't. Once you appreciate what this film is, it is completely captivating and entertaining.Where the film begins to waiver is when we finally get to see the ritual sacrifice, and the direction of the film slips into Hollywood mode. In todays world, we have no new insights into this genre, so maybe that was inevitable. The symbolism is not laid out any more than you would expect - and you would expect a lot. This is, after all, a Girl Power film with actual Girl Power. But made by a man. In addition we get Freud too - and the inevitable sex/death imagery.Because the film doesn't quite own its own destiny, leaning heavily on the performances and the camera work, it will not be remembered as a classic, but I still think it does not disappoint.",Suspiria

101,babyjaguar,SUSPIRIA SIGHS AGAIN: AN ARGENTO-FAN HEADACHE!,6,4 November 2018,"I was not expecting any high standards to be met, like Argento, Guadagnino is another artist in a different era using the ""art house"" style to make the ""same"" story, forty years later. The only visual elements and story devices that caught my interest were the reappearance of actress, Jessica Harper (not playing the role of ""Susie Bannion"") and the first 40 minutes of this adaptation (the first murder scene was truly sinister).The backstory of Germany's political history was used for this version, which was interesting. Many forget that when Argento, back in the 70s was partly filming the original production amidst a very ""real"" political unrest for Germany. The rest of viewing time was truly hard, everything came off as pretentious, including Johnson's acting (yes, she is beautiful, liked her strong performance in the film, ""Bad Times at Hotel Royale"").In this retelling, Johnson's talent direction was off, staged with ""red hair"" did not seem natural as much as her dancing, came off abit artificial. And in the ""Volke"" dance scene, the background dancers made Johnson looked ""interesting"" and ""hipster-like"" (complete with eye make-up, a minimal variation-like of Daryl Hannah's look from that 80's ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" film). But this version, her acting kept dragging, and some point for me... Mia Goth's performance of ""Sara"" is what kept the narrative steady.I think that Goth could have helmed the role of ""Susie Bannion"" wonderfully and then Johnson for ""Sara"". But for ""true"" (and not ""posers"") Argento diehard fans, I feel for them, must have been like drinking sawdust for two hours and half! Now for Argento film connections (since I done my share of Fantastic cinema and Euro-Horror viewing) just ""maybe"" possible ""nods"" to Argento's ""Mater"" and ""Giallo"" films.In this film's ""Suspirorium"" chapter, it looks like a slight reference to the gore orgy scene of 2007 Argento's ""Mother of Tears"". Then there are the ""mater"" references to sighs, tears, etc. like with the character of ""Olga"" (helmed with great humility by Russian dancer, Elena Fokina), her constant crying scenes to the point of depicting massive-sized teardrops on her cheeks! Like Argento's climax of ""Mother of Tears"", a few witches in this version's climax also have crazy eye makeup looks!Also, Argento had Adrian Brody played two roles in his 2009 ""Giallo"" film, in this ""Suspiria"" retelling, Tilda Swinton helms more than one character. Last thing, this version reference to Occult or Alchemist-like symbols with dance scenes, Argento had explored this with the interior/exterior settings in his 1980's ""Inferno"".And this 2018 version proves that Goblin's original score can never be replaced, the new score is ok (but it's like hearing couple of Grizzly album tracks... do get me wrong, I am fan of Grizzly). This retelling uses less color than the original and the usage of the cold winter setting adds to the sinister behaviour of the dance school activities.The rest of the film derived on Swinton's acting talents (it looked she had a great time helming and gendering multitude characters). Except for one scene in particular was unbearably funny... Swinton's playing two characters (""Helena Markos""/""Madame Blanc"") was ferociously dramatic. I guess, if Piper Laurie could gender roles under the art house direction of David Lynch in his 1980s ""Twin Peaks"" series why not in this ""art house"" cinematic retelling of the most celebrated Euro-Horror film!",Suspiria
102,thedarkhorizon,"Not a remake, but a remix: Dark, depressive, haunting, hypnotic! One likes it or one hates it. I LOVED it.",9,7 January 2020,"This remake isn't just a re-done 70s flick. Actually, they took a lot of foreign elements and applied it to the original story.
This one is darker, heavier, less fairy-tale and more nightmare you can't wake up from. The acting is sublime, the costumes are BRILLIANT, the narrative pace is sometimes very slow and the visuals (set, color, cinematography) show the post war depression filled with a deeper, horrifying truth looming in the dark.The first time I saw it, I walked out of the cinema stumbling, drifting and still sucked into this world. The last part is more a ritual than a movie, the overall film becomes a journey and an experience.This SUSPIRIA hasn't to do a lot with the 77 original and that is good. The tone is rather muted than colorful and the story itself is differently narrated: it's still about a young dancer getting sucked into the dark witchcraft world, but this time dance itself is explored more as a medium to connect with... the subconscious, the rituals, the supernatural? (you chose). This time, more side plots develop and the world itself is set in the post-war dark, cold, wet Berlin (with quite a politic background or even, if you chose to interpret it like that, a political message). The pace is slow and sucks you slowly into the labyrinth. You'll get haunted by modern CGI body-horror instead of rather innocent looking 70s tricks.The acting if sublime for me and Swinton, playing THREE roles... that's just mindblowing. I found out after the film and well, I am a big fan of her and could NOT recognize her. it is just WOW! Also I liked that this film gave Dakota Johnson finally a chance to escape the Fifty-Shades image and for me she did a brilliant job.Sure, this film is NOT for everyone. There is a big chance you expect something else (if you saw the 77s suspiria for example) and/or you don't like the specific mood or the dark, hypnotic, gore-like last part of the film. It can happen.The best way to enjoy is if you don't know anything about it in the first place (like I did).This film haunts you.It still does and I watched it 3 times now... and it still does not lose it's magic.",Suspiria

104,EasternZZ,"Watch this for the ""art of filming,"" the dances, and the acting",8,1 November 2018,"I was really impress by the way the director filmed this movie. At first I thought it looked kinda blurry, but then I realized that the director wanted to capture that ""70's"" horror look that movies like ""Don't look now,"" and ""Exorcist"" had. This is not a bright looking movie. It is very dark, once again reminding me of movies from the 70's and even 80's. The colors are washed out, and there is always a sense of dread. He also does these really cool camera tricks, such as quick close ups, weird camera angles, quick inserts, and blurring the camera Hitchcock style.Besides the filming, the best thing about this are the dances. At first I thought it was rather weird and strange how Dakota just kinda flails her arms around and move like a snake, but then I understood that this movie is supposed to be surreal. There are some really cool dances in this movie, one happens during the 5th act, which is a mixture of tribal dancing and sexual dancing. The stuff that Dakota can do with her body, such as bending her joints in weird ways, crawling on the ground, or even facial expressions, are pretty mesmerising. She is famous for 50 Shades of Grey trilogy, but this is actually the first movie I have seen her in. She was good in this.All the actors and actresses are good, but I do not know why they couldn't cast an old guy to play an old actor. They had Tilda played an old guy. Tilda plays 3 roles I believe. Towards the end you really start to see the rubber, and it was just a weird weird decision. There is a scene where he (she) has to cry, and it just looks so weird and distracting. Other than that, another standout is Mia Goth. She is also really good in this. She has always had that weird, strange, but attractive look about her. Actually all the women dancers do a good job (even when some don't talk, they still perform the dances). Majority of them all happen to be drop dead beautiful too. Chloe Grace Moretz is advertised as being a star in this movie, but honestly she is only in the very first scene, and then shows up at the tail end of the movie. If you are going in expecting to see a lot of her, don't. She is in 3 scenes in this movie, and a total or maybe 5 minutes.This movie is not perfect though. The length is a little bit too long. I think 2 hours are fine, but 2 hours and 30 minutes (6 acts + Epilogue) is a little bit too long. There are some flashback scenes that could have been cut, there is a scene in the beginning with an old lady in bed gasping and dying, and it goes on for at least 2-3 minutes. It could have been cut shorter.Characters also talk very slow, or just stand and stare, which takes up time. There are also scenes showing news footage that could have been cut as it proved no purpose. We already know it takes place in the 70's, we don't need to constantly be reminded every 30 minute by showing us news footage from that time. These things don't seem like a big deal, but when cut down you could have taken at least 15 - 20 minutes off, and still have a good movie.Another issue is the final 15 minutes of the movie. For some reason, it becomes a huge cgi mess. There is literally so much CGI, I actually forgot that the movie took place in the 70's. Imagine the exorcist, but then towards the last 20 minutes it suddenly becomes something like ""Constantine,"" or ""Mortal Kombat."" Also they bring in a very cheap looking rubber suit character, and it looks so bad I actually shook my head and held back laughter. It looked really bad and cheesy this person.Still I will give this movie an 8/10 because it kept me intrigue. I wanted to know what was really happening, and even though the movie starts off really slow, it really picks up after 30 minutes or so. The dances are great, actors and actresses are good too, and even though this movie is not really scary, it has a lot of thrills and great imagery. The length, and the out of place CGI mess towards the end just left a bad taste in my mouth.Still worth a watch, and it reminded me of something awesome like ""The Exorcist,"" where it is slow, not a lot is happening on screen, but a lot are happening with the story. There are a lot of great things about this movie. Pay attention to characters reaction and their dialogue (which might have a double meaning). Good movie, worth your time, give it a watch.",Suspiria

Maybe it'll come out that Amazon took control of the project and ruined it ... It better do ... Because if thats the way Guardagnino wanted it to be then he's lost it ...

Tilda Swinton continues to prove why she is one of the best actors ever by undergoing a complete transformation in this film. Dakota Johnson is the perfect protagonist for this film and I don't think anyone else can replace her, her career has reached a new level this year with this film and Bad Times at El Royale. Luca deserves a massive applause for making an uncompromising film and a bold remake which will be spoken for ages. Thom Yorke's score is probably the best thing you will ever here this year and the cinematography & choreography were absolutely stunning. The Colour pallet was perfect. This film won't win a lot of awards but it's destined to be a cult classic and a prime example for a ground breaking horror movie.",Suspiria
114,Equalizer16,This really Got Under my Skin,10,15 November 2018,"Luca Guadagnino re-invents Dario Argento's 1977 cult horror, set in a divided Berlin, with hypnotically ominous dancing.Susi Bannion (Dakota Johnson) arrives in Berlin 1977 to join the Markos Dance Academy, where she joins a group of female students under the direction of Madam Blanc (Tilda Swinton). After rumours of one student: Patricia (Chloe Grace Moretz) disappearing due to suspicions of witchcraft within the Academy, Bannion and the girls become subject to strange and supernatural behaviour.According to Guadagnino, this has been a film the director has wanted to make his own version of since he was 14, after seeing Argento's original film. The film demonstrates his love and homage to the original, but takes its core subject and ideas to greater depth. Coming out of Suspira, you can't quite recount everything that you've just witnessed but it plays your mind, waiting for you to go back and see it again. It is very much its own film, with a broaden narrative structure, significant to its cold war setting.Although without a shocking opening unlike Argento's film, Suspira is packed with fresh jaw dropping set pieces of its own, especially one which has already been established online as ""that scene"". Furthermore through its invigorating, but menacing dance sequences, exquisitely choreographed by Damien Jalet. Guadagnino has said that his retelling of the story is meant to express his feelings of watching the original film and communicate this experience to the audience. Suspira is very much crafted in its majestic cinematic language, emotions conveyed through visuals and music.What of course what made Argento's film so distinguishing was its outstanding art direction and colour palette, which Guadagnino has not reprised, but still there is a faint echo of the evocative architecture, which becomes absorbing in the sight of cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom.With all its disturbing moments, Suspira to me is a dark artwork of ecstatic beauty, especially when we reach its climax. A 2hr 32min journey that keeps us on edge but is patient as it unravels its layers. You can very much feel Guadagnino's passion coming through, which becomes overwhelmingly infectious.Our journey into this curious fantasy is much seen from the character of Dr Joseph Klemperer who is meeting a guilt over his lost love. Through his eyes we undergo a sceptical surreal experience as he attempts to unravel the mystery of the academy. Illusion and psychological fantasy are still very rooted in the film as well with more focused angle. ""A delusion is a lie that tells a truth."" utters Klemperer. There's a real story of sadness under the skin of the film, a thick layer of melancholy. Like Call Me By Your Name (2017), it's a film that breathes sentimentality, if you look close enough.Suspira is a confusing, and unsettling experience, but it truly gets under your skin with its metamorphic and nightmarish imagery, set against Thom Yoke's score and soundtrack leaves you with something more emotionally engaging than you may have expected. Clearly Guadagnino's version will divide people, from my perspective it's a film that I got its claws in me and I very much look forward to a second viewing.",Suspiria
115,trnjamesbond,Soy Boy Artsy Mess,1,3 February 2019,"Suspiria Remake 2018 is a Soy Boy Hipster film, where every valley girl and soy boy is jumping on the band wagon for promoting this slop.
Sorry but I don't do CGI blood, the original Suspiria was fantastic, a bit strange at times none the less, but fantastic.The original you knew who all the characters were by the end of the film. It also was filmed in Technicolor, which gave it an ""Alice in Wonderland"" feel to it.But Suspiria 2018 production decided to suck the life out of the original, no color, terrible score, and no character introduction or development, it left the audience to wonder who is who, all the while using William Friedkin style camera zoom's(director of The Exorcist). Also the film made us think right from the start that the people in the dance academy were bad, just by subtle insinuations, unlike it's predecessor which hid the truth from it's audience as much as possible until the big reveal at the end.This new inception gave away characters motives way too early on in the film. Also all the political reference's of the era were highly annoying, the original film had absolutely no political bias in it. It was just a good ol' gory Italian horror story and that's it. Why films today have to reference current or past politics are beyond my logic.Also the run time was way beyond overboard and a bit cocky in my opinion, almost an hour beyond the original, they filled this film with bleak and boring shots, it's almost as if the editing team were asleep while doing their jobs.
Tilda Swinton I could never like as an actress, she is a very bleak looking human with no likable features, her acting is bland in everything I have watched her in.ConclusionThis film is boring, nothing we haven't seen before(even though the fake critics will tell you otherwise on imdb). This film has nothing to offer that is inventive, it's lack of color and sub standard score leaves the audience asking ""Was this good or bad?""The answer is, it's bad, it's far beyond bad, I find this style of directing to be to artsy for me. It's more for a niche snob viewer, who was never a fan of actual Italian horror films. It's all about being a hipster I guess.Do yourself a favor and watch the original!",Suspiria
116,The_Swedish_Reviewer,Horror movie for high cultural people,1,3 August 2020,"Wow! This was a boring film. But I managed to watch all of it and as someone else wrote, I deserve that ""I watched ALL of Suspiria"" T-shirt. It is really not that bad, it is just so slow, unnecessary complicated and gray/brownish so I quickly lost my interest for the characters. I guess high cultural viewers with an interest in ballet will appreciate it as most of the plot take place in a dance rehearsal room. When the ""horror"" happened I couldn't care less. In addition, it's a looong movie that feels it never ends.Are you looking for a scary dance movie or a cult movie, watch ""The Black Swan"" or ""Midsommar"" but combining those in a gray/brownish Berlin-movie wasn't a good idea. You have been warned.",Suspiria
117,shweta-51657,Stands its own if you can forget about the original,7,10 February 2019,"When I recall the 1977 original, what stands out most in my memory are the vivid and beautiful colours depicted with the backdrop of one of the most eerie haunting soundtracks to grace a film.In stark contrast, almost rebelling from the original, this movie has taken great pains to be almost entirely devoid of colours. However when they do use any colour, you guessed it, its red and oh my gosh, does it get everywhere.This recycled movie might not stand the test of time as it is heavily based on the original and depicts in a not so subtle manner the witches and the coven's going ons, whereas the original was subtlety and left it up to the viewer to imagine the worst. It does however explore the folklore around the Three Mothers and creates an eerie atmosphere that leaves the viewer distinctly uncomfortable.If this was to be considered a standalone film, it would be mediocre. Give me honest new witch movies like the VVitch (2015) over remakes of old movies any day",Suspiria

119,ernesti,Fusion of Harry Potter and Suspiria which just sucks,1,27 November 2018,"The director Guadagnino took the challenge after the other attemps by other directors failed to come to fruition. Let's face it, it'd be very difficult to top the original Suspiria. I see remaking a classic film very unnecessary and as a way to get fame just by its notorious name. I could also think of Dario Argento not liking the use of his name on the credits. However I don't even think that he cares about watching this film.To make it short, this film is a fusion of Harry Potter and Suspiria. One who has seen the original can then decide for oneself if that mess is going to work. Some may see it as a work of art which is open for interpretation and any feeling that arise makes it an experience in itself. In my opinion it's a movie seriosly lacking on every aspect. It's not stylish, it's not scary, it has zero respect for the audience and their expectations and it's a movie that the director just made for himself alone and not for the audience. It could have profited from not having the burden of the notorious name ""Suspiria"" and high expectations. It should have been titled ""Mysteria"" or something similar.It appears that many movie critics on the mainstream media are liking this film just because they see it as a mysterious art movie. I think of a conspiracy that these days movie reviews are just extentions of advertising. Cinema is struggling to get the crowds because these days hardly anything is worth watching on the silver screen. After seeing this film I'm just going to trust my instincs more than any reviews. Any movie receiving five stars and oscar nomination probably are the ones to avoid and any film directed by Luca Guadagnino.Of course one could just enjoy the experience, because it is said to be art and have zero expectations of anything and have nothing better to do for two and half hours.",Suspiria
120,antoniokowatsch,A movie for the sophisticated viewer,8,25 January 2019,"This movie is very special in the sense that it's so polarizing. You either love it, like I did, or you hate it. And I totally get it. I've been a huge fan of the original motion picture. As a matter of fact, I'd dare to say that it was one of the best horror movies ever made. With its unforgettable film score and the odd but artistic neon colored lighting. So, where does this movie fit in?, you might ask.
Well, it is very different from the original and that's a good thing. It's different in all the right ways, so to speak. It is based on the original story but takes a different angle as the story progresses.
This movie is much more ""sexually charged"" and grotesque. Some of the scenes are completely bizarre to the point where I was just thinking: ""What the hell?!""
And that's exactly why I liked the movie. It lingered in my mind long after I've watched it. Very few movies manage to do that.As much as I liked it, I have to say that the film score was not very impressive. I'm a huge fan of Thom Yorke and his music but it wasn't the right fit for this type of movie. Especially toward the end, in the great ""bloodbath"" scene it just seemed completely odd that a slow and sorrowful score was accompanying it. Something more explosive would've suited the scene better. And overall I got the sense that the score was more or less hum-drum forgettable if compared to the score of the original movie, which was unique and weird ergo unforgettable. This movie's score was always lush and subdued even though this movie is, unlike the original, quite brutal and visceral.Another minor critique that I have is aimed at the beginning of the movie. It just gave me a wrong first impression. The first thing that I thought when the movie started rolling was: ""is this the right movie?""
I was quite perplexed because the setting was that of a village in the first act. I don't know, it just felt odd. It makes more sense in the greater scheme of things but I don't think it was a necessary segue.I can honestly say that it's one of my favorite movies now. That's how much I liked it. But it is super-weird. I'm self-aware enough to admit that. There will be a lot of eyebrow-raising panting, sexually suggestive dancing, satanic imagery, torture scenes, and gore. If this particular mix of odd elements is not your cup of tea you should probably give this movie a pass.",Suspiria
121,gacsogergely,I don't care about the holocaust,4,20 January 2019,"At least for this movie.
I came to watch a movie about witches-led dancing school, not Schindler's List. I had no issue with the start where they shouted release this, release that, and finaly we got a graffity telling ""free everyone"". But then it got obvious they'll abandone the plot for the sake of unrelated propaganda.Other issue is the length. The original was at least compressed, a fast dance if you want. This just drags on, and on, even has THREE starting sequence. That's at least one too many.
I also question the necessity of the multilanguagity. It fell back to subtitles, and I didn't even see why this was necessary.The trailer was good. The movie is crap.",Suspiria

Or was it? Who knows. Art is subjective, but this is a hard one to pin down.Argento's quasi-classic is probably one of his most overrated, but also retains its own place in international horror.This gets weighty and boring within the first three ""chapters"" and realizing I had over 90+ minutes left, it quickly turned into a ""survival of the fittest"" watch. The directors reinterpretation is a tough watch on so many fronts...where to begin?As a fan of both horror and avant film making, this one falls into the ""bargain bin of Walmart"" realm.

123,moonmonday,Don't call it Suspiria. Don't even call it a movie.,1,28 May 2019,"Lord love a duck, but this is a bad movie all on its own. To call it Suspiria just makes it worse.The writing and direction come off as both never having seen Suspiria and not at all understanding the story...which is laughably sad, since Suspiria's story is written in the manner of a fairy tale. It's simple as can be.This film, however, manages to completely mess it up in every way possible. Changes are made, arbitrarily and needlessly, to the point where it's absolutely unidentifiable as Suspiria; no part of it has anything to do with the real thing, aside from some similar names. It's also remarkably misogynistic, as well as being misanthropic, which the original, despite being made forty years ago, was not.It obsesses with dance and yet doesn't do dance at all remotely well. Yet we as the audience are supposed to recognize the things they do as graceful and authentic, even that the lead Dakota Johnson -- who was terrible, and an even worse dancer than she is an actress -- trained over a year to achieve just the right look and understanding of dance...when she doesn't even do correct spotting, a fundamental aspect of dance, within the first half-hour.And the choreography is so bad. It's embarrassing, laughable, and just execrable. It's not artistic, it's not graceful at all, and it looks like something a group of teenagers threw together to celebrate something they clearly don't understand but vehemently insist they do.Everything about this film is wrong. It's the definition of ""tryhard"", like a little brother who lives in his older sibling's shadow and tries to change things to their diametric opposite extreme in order to distinguish himself. The acting is shockingly bad, though that may be due to poor direction. The photography is also pretty and atrocious, in turns. You'll see a shot and think ""that's pretty"", and within five minutes, there will be at least one shot that looks like someone shot it on their phone, complete with manual run-ups to zoom. Cheap and amateurish.The soundtrack, as much as I wanted to look forward to it, is also not good. But then, neither is the sound production. It's altogether too quiet most of the time, or it's so fuzzy that it becomes impossible to understand. Not that them having huge stretches in German, which they don't subtitle, helps the coherency of the film; the extent to which the viewer feels alienated and just plainly bored is made far worse by this tendency.The visuals are bland and boring as they are patently stupid.There is literally no reason to watch this film calling itself by the title of something it's not, when you could watch a shorter, less pretentious, better-acted, more visually entertaining, better-directed, more coherent film with far better music, made forty years ago. This movie is a chore, and it doesn't deserve the attention for half of its runtime. This is exactly the kind of ""reimagining"" or ""homage"" everyone fears for something they love: a hackjob made by a pretentious ass who doesn't even understand what they're doing or what they're supposedly paying homage to in the first place.It doesn't deserve the title, or the names of any of the characters...which are incidentally its only resemblance to Dario Argento's classic horror masterpiece.

I was so captivated by this film that I didn't even notice most of the techniques it used to visually clue me into the greater plot in motion, careful to avoid explaining it outright.Suspiria (2017) is difficult to compare to the 1977 original, except in plot.

126,azeemnavarro,A masterful remake,10,14 July 2019,"I feel wrong about calling this a remake. That's because this is the complete opposite of the original classic of Dario Argento: an overly long runtime, bleak colors, subtle music, a lot of dancing, chaotic camera movements, totally diferent acting. Most of the history is the same as the original, and the changes that it introduces fits so perfectly in this version.
The Argento '77 giallo masterpiece is an exercise of style over substance, you don't care that much about what's happening on screen, but rather than how it's presented to you. Some people will be disappointed finding out that there's no bombastic colors, just a heavy and slow narrative. I would agree that we didn't needed that much of the political background of the time, the relation of this and the witches meaning is clear right off the bat, how this struggle of power is in both sides of this.
One of the most memorable aspects of the original is the score by Goblin. I always finded the music very annoying, even if it fits with the movie, i just though it wasn't good. Here, Thom Yorke give us one of the greatest soundtracks in recent memory, ranging from electronic, to krautrock, to walts, to classical, to ambient, the score is beautiful and creppy, amazingly crafted, more if you considerer that it was written before the movie was shot.
The acting in the original wasn't goofy in purpose, the actress were supossed to be little girls, something that is kinda stupid, with all the gore that it has, of course Argento couldn't cast children for his movie. Even then, i really love Jessica Harper in the original, her performance is so cute and innocent that i really sympathised with her character. In this new version, Dakota Johnson redeems herself for the horrible 50 shades movies, and proves that she is actually a great actress. The Susie character is totally diferent here, and the twist in the end, wich I expected, it's amazing, it opens so many possibilities for take this history in different ways, and i'm happy Guadagnino was brave enough for make this change. The absolute star of the movie is Tilda Swinton, she does three roles, and it's some of the best acting of last year, especially the Dr. Klemperer character, the fact that she can deliver so much emotion behind all that make up, it's wordless. The rest of the cast does a great job too.
I actually don't know if this is better than the original, I keep thinking, but I can't reach a conclusion. But i'm sure about one thing: this is a masterpiece, and it's definitely one of the best movies of 2018. I don't care if you love or hate the original, you have to watch this.",Suspiria

I never really tired of Giallo films, because they bring almost the same thing, but still enjoyable. When I heard of Suspiria remake, I guess it will be just fine to watch it.Truthfully, I am not complaining at all for scenes and dialogues showing much the political nature of the setting, however, I am here for horror, and that's just the thing that maybe interpreted in scenes that too vague to be categorized as horror. Well, some scenes like bone breaking women are good on its own, but honestly, they trying too much to showcased the 'art' part of the dance school, until I just watch it just for the sake of the ending, they must be doing something at the ending right? Some climax or whatever?The awaited horror in the climax, turns out to be a total chaos in bad way. It's gruesome, but the previous scenes don't make it up. It's like we watch an art film who happen to inherit the same name and concept of the original one, and in the last scene the crews just remember that they are actually making a horror film.Nevertheless, I like the ambience of the film with dark tone throughout the film, a contrast to most Giallo films that usually use bright colors.

Many characters and subplots never amount to much of anything and at 2 1/2 hours, you do have to ask yourself if that much time was really what this story required to be told correctly. There's probably a leaner, meaner, and more effective version of this film buried within a lot of the more unnecessary elements.

135,TakeUpReel,"Good, but way too LOOOOOOOOOOOONG",7,27 February 2021,"First, I have never seen the 1977 movie (or the spin offs) or any source material leading up to the 2018 movie. I went into this movie cold.I wanted to watch it because I like Chloe Grace Moretz and Tilda Swinton. I can take or leave Dakota Johnson. CGM was barely in the movie and Tilda was in it too much.Ms. Swinton is a fine actress, but she should NOT have played the doctor or Helena Markus. When the doctor first appeared on screen, I thought that someone did a really bad job with the makeup on the guy. The makeup took me out of the story every time the doctor was in a scene. Then, at some point, I realized that the doctor was being played by a woman. Why? (I know IMDB trivia gave some explanation, but the choice was stupid). Then, I realized that the doctor was actually Tilda Swinton. Obviously I spent more time thinking about the crappy makeup Tilda was wearing than the role she was playing.The worse part of the movie was the unnecessary run time. (2 1/2 hours). There is a lot that could have been removed from the movie and still told the same story. (The political overtones could have been left out and still told the same story. The cops visiting the dance company was only useful to show the power that the witches had over ""normal"" people, but the scenes didn't serve any other point.).The excessive dance numbers were also too long. I understand that the dance company was important to the plot, but the rehearsals, etc. took too much screen time).There were characters that were barely introduced or explained, so devoting more time to them would have served the movie better. I don't mind a 2 1/2 hour movie, if all the scenes are necessary.It seems like I need to watch this movie a few times to truly understand it. I won't do that for awhile, because of the long drawn out scenes and the poor makeup used on the doctor.",Suspiria
136,alexqueens,Should have been so much better..,4,1 November 2019,"Gosh, I really really wanted to like this. I wanted to be blown away by it even. I hate it when I go in with high expectations, because it leaves me so vulnerable to overwhelming disappointment.My initial mistake was comparing this to the initial impression the original Suspiria had left on me. And despite the possibility of discovering to have a different view of the original if I were to re-watch it today, one thing will remain intact, and that's the original musical score by Goblin; which permeated throughout the movie in sinister fashion, like a wicked demon, its slithery reptilian tongue caressing the back of your neck and unnerving your senses. It was occultish in nature, satanic even; perfect for a tale about a witches' coven.Whereas the new Suspiria chooses to tread a more 'realistic' approach by keeping the musical score to a minimum, relying instead on developing tension by natural means. Except it doesn't quite pay off, because nothing here ever truly comes close to creepy or frightening.
And the running-time... sweet devils, there's no justification for this to clock in at two and a half hours.
If it had given us a more in-depth character development on the malevolent nature between the school's Madames, or focus more on deepening the relationship between the new girl (Dakota) and her friend Sara (Mia Goth), then maybe that would warrant a longer version. As is stands, it's a bit of a slog; and that's me being polite.Thing is, I love a good arthouse horror and I'm no stranger to lengthy quiet dramas where nothing much happens. But those types of movies rely on raw realism, a slice of life so real that when something does happen, it can be devastating or moving.
You'd think that taking that approach and adding the element of eerie mystery, witches and grisly content would elevate this above all else. But sadly, the elements were lost on me. Or rather, they never materialised in a manner that would instil any sense of excitement or make me care about any of it.I heard beforehand about the final act so I held off until then, expecting it to really amp the sheer horror of what this coven was all about. The infamous Sabbath. The awakening of Mother Suspiriorum.
Well, it turned out to be quite a spectacle. Unfortunately, it was a laughable one.
Am I alone in thinking how Mother Markos resembles Jabba the Hutt from 70's Star Wars? It's basically Jabba the Hutt's little sister - with sunglasses. And why does she need sunglasses? I understand if sunlight or bright lights would give her a migraine, but she's underground in poorly lit environments!Now I fully respect Tilda Swinton playing three different roles in the film. If you like a slice of Swinton, then you get a fair share of her in this. But it was totally unnecessary and not as good as it could have been. I knew there was something off with the Dr. Klemperer character the minute I laid eyes on him. The make-up was just too much, giving away the fact that someone else, much younger, was hiding beneath that mask. I was unable to immerse myself in the movie every time this character made an appearance.There's so much more I could add but I'm already boring myself going on about how disappointed I was with this.",Suspiria

138,influxtwo,90% Great 10% Awful,8,20 January 2019,"Spoilers Alert. Okay as a well-versed fan of the original (and Italian horror cinema to begin with) I had a lot of personal hype riding on this. After learning that the actors spent a long time preparing for their roles, and the interesting cast. I was hyped. The muted neutral tones to the cinematography and the spacey soundtrack by thom York I was all over. The Suspiria plot beat by beat hitting it's marks while also offering a ton of additional new information and sequences I thought was well-done for majority of the film, especially the first half. The cast was superb and the location and all the pieces were well done as a period piece. It added texture in the remake and a bit of world-building. The cast was all amazing in their roles and that leaves me to the film's one failure. The way the end was handled. They took a film with great confidence and took it a bit too far in to bad filmmaking when the climax happened it just lost me when everyone was naked and dancing uncontrollably in the basement with a red filter over everything trying to mask badly computer animated exploding heads. One step too far. I can see why Dario Argento himself felt this remake was a disgrace that missed the point of his original. Okay. we did not need to see all that. Dakota could've still been turned and had the scene been handled in a much more engaging way. I believe they accidentally butchered a great movie with that god awful scene and it tainted what could've otherwise been a great modern classic revisited. and it hurts. I felt mortified for those actors in the end. Mia Goth was amazing anyway though. I also did not like what they did to Chloe Grace Moretz's ""Patricia"". She was supposed to have an iconic opening death scene. This is Italian horror we're talking about. But no, let's keep her in the basement to decompose? Just why. They had a great opportunity to do something really edgy with her character and they squandered it for what? 20 seconds more of screen time? I just don't get those shortcomings in what could've otherwise been a great film. Tilda Swinton was so haunting and magnetic. Dakota Johnson was also awesome in this film however, and I truly feel sorry for her in a sense because you could tell her heart was in this film and the whole cast put their trust in to the writers and crew who kind of took the concept too far in to the realm of absurdism. I can see why this film had such a fleeting and obscured theater release, it wasn't even showing in theaters anywhere local to me. and for that budget they did not get their return either. Feel like the whole thing kind of fell apart in the end due to bad execution of the film's finale. 3/4ths of the film is really great. Really this remake had so much going for it and they kind of botched it with the editing and writing with the climax. So that is why I say 90% great 10% Awful. I was displeased with the ending.",Suspiria
139,ironcraftleague,A very arsty and unique horror film.,9,28 February 2019,"When I watched this movie I was very excited because of the premise. I wasn't disappointed. Everyone was great especially Tilda Swinton (I think that's her name). This movie also had really good cinematography. Notable scenes include the dance, the dream sequences, and a particular torture scene. Let's just say it's gorey and twisted, it will make you feel shaken. The mystery is very interesting and the detective is a very cool and complex character. Aside from everything that didn't stand out was still great. However, the story lacks some clarity and the ritual scene might of been WAY too much. I get it they're witches but the way they executed that scene made it over the top. However, I really enjoyed the movie. 9/10.",Suspiria

141,mc1382,Two Viewings Required,10,16 November 2018,"I just came back from my second viewing of Suspiria and it does actually work a lot better the second time. I noticed subtle plot hints and connections between the different sub plots I didn't notice the first time. It's also very evident how much of a human film this is. Even when the film is going into surreal territory the film always has a dash of emotion and tackles themes of the human struggle especially in the monstrous climax. The film flowed a lot better and it was cool to see how the cinematography is used as an extension of the supernatural forces within the academy.I still have problems with it, the film even though it is rich in themes and subtext does sometimes have trouble balancing some of these elements. Although the climax works a lot better on second viewing with Thom Yorke's score working well behind the climax. Some things I still don't know the meaning behind but maybe that's not the point. Sometimes it's good not to know all the answers but let your imagination run wild. I enjoyed myself a lot more on the second time and encourage people to see this film two times. I am deleting my previous review cause it doesn't really reflect how I feel now.Bopping this up to a8/10",Suspiria

I get the artsy farsty stuff of this flick but that's all it is. I'm truly ashamed by Hollywood and what they expect from actors both male and female.

As you can see I am not the kind of person to label every movie I dislike ""the worst movie I have ever seen"". For a movie to make me hate it so much it really has to try hard and boy, did this movie try. I'm not some huge fan of the original Suspiria but I enjoyed it well enough. For me the original was quite ridiculous and cheesy but where the plot didn't succeed the style, the score and the fun atmosphere did. The original is a very enjoyable slasher movie with some really neat cinematography. Now, as for the remake it is neither visually pleasing nor fun. It looks as bland as a raw turkey and it is about as much fun as watching two snails race. It is absolutely and totally pretentious and thinks it is oh-so much more important than it really is. It has the gall to be 2 and a half bloody hours long and really it mostly does nothing for the duration of that runtime. It throws in some pointless sub-lots and tries hard to have a deeper message which is about as deep as a shallow puddle. Sometimes it will try to imitate the original i.e.most of the side character dancers are hard to tell apart or it will do some camera movements and zooms reminiscent of the movies from the 70s. And it all amounts to a climax that is laughable, maybe even in a good way but at that point who cares as the movie just wasted almost 3 hours of your life. Those 3 hours could have been used to do something much more fun or productive like hoovering or washing the dishes, anything but watching this.",Suspiria

150,nightwishouge,A horror film that tries too hard to be important,5,25 January 2019,"I was really looking forward to Suspiria. Even when my horror-loving peers were complaining back when David Gordon Green was slated to helm the remake, I was excited. The original film (one of my favorites) has such a broad concept and leaves so much to explore that 10 different directors could reinterpret the subject matter and come up with 10 very different but equally fascinating films.But, this is the remake we got.I see some people like it. Some critics even call it a masterpiece. Maybe this is because Guadagnino infuses the story with the politically charged background of Berlin in 1977 (the same year the original film was released). I myself was intrigued at first to see where this was heading. Turns out it doesn't really go anywhere. Neither does the film.Okay, there's some vague thematic statement about human suffering, I guess. It all felt like an Oscar-nominated director waving his hands about and shouting, ""Wait, this isn't JUST a horror film! This is a movie that has something to say!"" If you like Chris Nolan movies maybe this does something for you. Maybe you feel guilty for enjoying genre. I just don't understand why a director would make a horror film if he's ashamed of horror?So. All in all it feels like a missed opportunity. There are one or two decent set pieces, but apart from a great dance number at the end it just never gets as atmospheric as you want it to. It never gets under your skin. Even the blood-soaked ending feels pretty tame if you've ever seen a horror movie before in your life, despite the buckets of gore. It feels tame emotionally, psychologically. There's no tension; nothing is being challenged or uncovered or represented. I found myself wishing I could have seen a film that wasn't afraid to have imagination.There are good things. Tilda Swinton is great (as always) but just doesn't have much of interest to do. Unless you watched the original and thought, ""Yes, but I want to see MORE of the squabbling and in-fighting within the witches' coven."" There is something interesting in exploring the political structure of a magical cult, but I'd like to see something more than a long scene of voting. Another one of the many ideas in Suspiria that never gets fully developed.But I was talking about good things. Well, the rest of the cast is good, speaking of Swinton. Chloe Grace Moretz is under-utilized. Dakota Johnson didn't leave much of an impression but that might be because her character is bland. At least she fits into the production design pretty well. Mia Goth was good and sympathetic as Sara, as far as I can recall. (I saw this four months ago.)I liked the fact that the dancing is more integral to the story. In the original, despite taking place in a ballet school, the dancing is pretty much incidental. I also liked the choice to make the female students look like students at a dance academy--unkempt, sweaty, in need of a shower. Usually in horror movies rule #1 for female characters is to keep them looking as beautiful as a makeup commercial; either the director wants to sleep with them or they are catering to a male fan base that (the director supposes) wants to sleep with them. In Suspiria the women are glamorous when performing and real human beings the rest of the time.So that's what I liked. In a movie that runs over two and a half hours I wish I had liked more. But as a whole it just faded out of my brain. I guess, if you're the sort of person who wants a horror movie on your Criterion-dominated DVD shelf that won't embarrass you, you're the target audiences. For me...well, I saw this at the Alamo Drafthouse, so at least the popcorn was really good.",Suspiria
151,Call-Me-Mr-Smith,Atmospheric,7,4 May 2019,"I am pretty sure that this late review would be of no use to anyone, but, here goes...
Firstly, I understand the frustration of some of the viewers s this is not an easy movie to follow. It essentially presents a refinement of the older and somewhat different Argento's version, and not a reinvention of the genre, such is, for example, the Rob Zombie's opus. As a refinement, it relies heavily on a meticulous process of carefully crafting the atmosphere, so the manner and the form are at the essence. And it does so with no rush, hence the frustration of some of the viewers. One cannot deny the craftsmanship, although not every scene has the equal merit. The sets are outrageously good, to the point that it looks more ""70's"" than the original seventies looked. The horror is refined 70's horror, not the vulgar contemporary one. There are nods to 70's icons and then common places, not easily recognisable to the modern audience. The camerawork is also derivative of that period. The flirting with psychoanalysis does not end with the involvement of the psychiatrist character, but, at the same time, it does not overwhelm the viewer either.
It feels that Guadagnino is consistently non-apologetic for any misunderstanding or dislike. In other words, tough luck, the honey-badger don't care. He doesn't want to flirt with the viewer, he is paying an homage. And, yes, there is Tilda Swinton. I was also expecting to see Udo Kier, perhaps in the role of one of the commissars, but, alas... Of the things I didn't like, aside from the excess 30 minutes or so, I must say that I didn't entirely enjoy the music score.
At the end, after completely opening and investing due effort, I liked it. 7/10.",Suspiria

(Beware, there will be little spoilers ahead)If Argento wanted that the lead actress looks like Snow White, you will find Red Riding HoodTilda is AWESOME and never disappoint, she is an ACTRESS with all the letters, she really playband perform. This time was not exception, she amazed me absolutely.Also I just must confess that I wasn't expecting good acting from Dakota Johnson, because I really hate ""50 shades"" (mysoginous-if that is the word, sorry for my English- trash, if you ask me about the books and movies of that fanfiction) but here she surprised me for good and I applaud her for that.Story and pacing are greats and the screenplay was terrifying and cool.The dancing scene in which a dancer is completely torn was so disturbing and well done.I loved the ending, unexpected and pleasant (is what I kinda wanted for the original) with Susie being the real Mother.And also loved the historic context, because is a way to explain what excuses the witches used for their students' disappearance.I recommend this movie totally.The bad: maybe a little too longThe good: context and storyThe best: Tilda8.5/10 for me (but 9/10 because ofof Tilda)Watch at your own risk",Suspiria

On its own, it starts with mere perfection: captivating cinematography and a score that will likely get stuck in your head. The tone of the film changes so many times that I was trying to figure out what kind of film the Suspiria remake was trying to be. It was a serious drama, then a body horror, then a period-piece, then a satanic oddball hypnosis bloodbath. Kinda weird, even a bit too weird for an oddball like me.

155,joelherro,I respect they weren't trying to copy the original movie,7,6 November 2020,"Some would say, if that's the case, what's the point in a remake? Of that, I can understand, and having seen and loved the original, I was skeptical about a remake. However, I feel rather than make a lame remake, they have opted to make a new horror movie, based on similar concepts, but hoping to stand on its own merits. Thinking in those terms, I'd say it succeeds.I'm not going to bother outlining the plot, if you're reading this, you're sufficiently interested already. Where the original basks in garish colour, this movie is almost entirely filmed in washed out sepia tones. One beef I do have is that a lot of modern horror movies go for the video clip style scares, where they show rapid cuts of nightmarish horror and scary/crazy images, reminiscent of video clips by death metal bands like Cradle of Filth and Behemoth, instead of subtle and/or real scares. This movies abounds in that kind of stuff. The ending is an interesting twist I won't give away.My advice is, if you love the original movie, then keep an open mind and try and think of this as something altogether different, and if you haven't seen the original, then watch this, take from it what you will and then try getting the original movie to compare against.",Suspiria
156,urbanspider,Occult masterpiece that needs defending,9,18 November 2018,"Many will hate this movie for being different than the original, but I think that's one of its strengths. After all, is there any point in watching an identical modern version of a movie? I remember watching the Omen remake hoping for a different interpretation, then leaving so disappointed that I'd just watched the same film again with nothing new. Suspiria is not like that, and that's a blessing.This is a complex movie with many hidden meanings that will take others, with more analytical eyes time to deconstruct. The camera work is similar to the original in the way it 'moves', and there's resemblances in the decor, which does relate back to the original movie. This is welcomed. But this version is far more complex. For instance, did anyone notice the Masonic book in the psychologists office and the chequer board flooring in the school offer a Masonic link between the two. . . . Esoteric masonry thus has meaning in here somewhere, and that's just the start. Again, dancing is used in many occult groups to generate energy, magik, power, hence the nature of vigorous dancing and a dancing school setting. I think in time people will analyse it just like they did for 'Eyes wide shut', with many hidden meanings being revealed. And just like in E.W.S, one viewing doesn't reveal its secrets, you have to watch it many times to understand the clues to unlock its deeper secrets.I don't think it's overly violent or scary at all, but I do think it has a very occultish vibe to it, very much like 'Witch', it's a serious occult type movie, not your average horror 'fantasy'. Those looking for a hack n slash horror will not appreciate its intelligence.Finally, I left the movie with many questions about it, not because it was poor, but because I didn't understand all the clues, and this is why I will watch it again and seek answers to them. Any film that deserves further investigation and thought is a great movie in my book, particularly given its theme.An intelligent thought provoking clue hidden occult gem !",Suspiria

159,Oggz,Arse-numbingly flat,3,16 January 2019,"Ten minutes into the film I'm left with three main impressions: firstly, the booming Goblin soundtrack of the original film might have been annoying and silly, but here we get Thom Yorke sounding like Sinead O' Connor wailing ""I Am Stretched On Your Grave"" with similar effect but with no drum loops to at least tap your foot to. The music will continue throughout in this moribund minimalist piano arpeggiato fashion that was already dated 20 years ago. Secondly, where Argento oversaturated his colours beyond all measure (with memorable effects to his film), here the producers decide to suck all life out of photography, so we get a good glimpse at a depressing Berlin Cold War winter twilight rather until we're grey in the face ourselves, the overall feeling akin to watching everything through an aquarium of dishwater and just as exciting. Thirdly, Alida Valli is sadly missing - instead we get Tilda Swinton looking rather bored and artificial as she prattles on about dance and movement. I'm sure she could play King Kong convincingly if she chose to but that's beside the point. The point is - the film is incredibly slow and drab with vast sections of unsubtitled German dialogue (tough crap apparently if you're not a speaker), and more than once you wish for Argento to burst in and inject some much needed fun and style into the witchy proceedings. Instead, his whimsical script, which suited the original film as he envisaged it, here gets whipped up into an insipid soufflé of baroque proportions, killing all else in the process. You can safely give this one a miss, nothing much to see here, the three stars earned are for the correct look of the period and not much else.",Suspiria
160,Floki_Thorfinn,Must be watched twice,8,27 February 2019,"Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria is not meant to be liked by all, after I watched it for the first time, I didn't liked it not because is a bad film, but tends to be really confusing. Also this is a review from a person who has never seen the original version from Dario Argento, so I don't know how loyal this script is to it's predecesor.As it is known, Luca Guadagnino is taking over this modern movie era along with other directors like Villeneuve, PTA, Lanthimos, Cuarón, Iñárritu, to mention a few of them, and that's why I was attached to his remake, since the trailer was great and with the cast and the backgrounds of the director, was a must watch in my list.Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton are the main characters in a divided Berlin in the 70's, and the plot develops in a dancing academy run by Madame Blanc (Swinton) in which Suzy Bannion (Jonhson) is admited to enter.At first sight it doesn't sound like a complicated story, yet, as the movie advance, you get more questions than answers in an awkward way, which left you wondering wtf did I just watch and probably unsatisfied after 2 1/2 hours long.Even after I felt that way, I got a really unusual feeling to watch it again, because I'm not used to watch films twice, at least in a row; so I did gave it one more chance, I even could say it felt like an obssesion to watch it one more time.As read in my 8 star rate, I absolutely enjoyed three times more than the first, I realised how beautiful the score was, the musicalization from Radiohead lead singer Thom Yorke, the sets, the locations, the retro cinematography, the colours, the actings! Most of my answers were answered, and the few that weren't, meh, doesn't matter that much; even found it more disturbing and creepy the 2nd time, and I mean it in a good way because I really like that kind of movies.Here's a note to men: Dakota Johnson is so sensual and hot in this one, well, for me was, the Grey trilogy in which she is spanked by Jamie Dornan and all that nude scenes of her was nothing compared to the sensuality of her character in Suspiria, also discovered this odd feeling in the second view, ended up so horny 😂.If you watched it and didn't liked it or even hated it, watch it one more time, it so worth your time.P.S.: My Guadagnino top so far, from best to worst:1.

161,Deathstryke,Beautifully terrifying,7,28 January 2019,"Suspiria was a real head-scrambler at first. Walking out of the cinema I had so many mixed emotions and unanswered questions, I wasn't able to process whether I even liked it. However, having had time to reflect and piece together the subtext, I take my hat off to Luca Guadagnino.The basic premise of the film is the same as the original; An illustrious all female dance school in Cold War Berlin acts as a front for a coven of witches plotting to bring about some cataclysmic event (no spoilers for what that is). A young aspiring dancer named Susie travels to the school from America, where she catches the attention of Madame Blanc, head choreographer and matron of the school, who senses something 'special' about the new arrival...Suspiria is an uncompromisingly dark and powerful film, thematically and visually. It had a similar affect on me as Darren Aronofsky's nightmarish ""Mother!"", worming its way into my subconscious and disturbing my dreams with its lurid, haunting imagery. Using the parallel of a guilt-ridden post War Germany amidst rising political unrest, Guadagnino elevates this version from the cheap schlock horror of the original with a profound socio-political metaphor that, once fully understood, imbues the schemes of the coven and the grotesque, mesmerizing finale with a tragic significance.The atmosphere is reflected through the limited, but nonetheless hypnotic soundtrack created by Thom Yorke. 'Volk', the piece that plays through some of most intense and macabre scenes, is an ominous 5/8 series of warped, gurgling synths that sounds like rifts tearing through space and time, while the dreamy piano waltz of 'Suspirium', which plays through the start and end credits weaves a melancholic mood that suggests the core emotion beneath this film is not fear, but sadness and regret.The cinematography is gloomy-beautiful, with bold composition choices and a wonderful use of light and reflective surfaces, filling the academy's mirrored halls and shadowy corridors with a foreboding reminiscent of The Shining's Overlook Hotel. Fans of Argento's vibrantly coloured version criticized Guadagnino's choice to film mostly in muted secondary colours, however I feel this palette grounds the film with a gritty realism that matches the depressing time period. It also contrasts strongly with a key sequence where the screen is bathed in a furious blood red.The performances are solid. Tilda Swinton in her main role as head witch, Madame Blanc, exudes a regal menace that gives way to a motherly affection for the newcomer, Susie, played with wistful intensity by Dakota Johnson. I was particularly drawn to Mia Goth's sympathetic portrayal of Sara, a friend to Susie who becomes suspicious after two girls at the dance school go missing. Her plucky determination to unlock the truth makes her a target -we are shown in an earlier scene the terrifying capabilities of the witches and how they punish dissent- so her character carries much of the film's emotional weight. The other coven members are played by a cast of European actresses with whom I am not familiar, but they are all excellent, showcasing distinct, eccentric personalities yet all bearing a sinister aloofness that makes them feel instantly dangerous.Suspiria is not without its flaws. At 2 hours 40 mins, it feels overly long and some scenes do drag. The camera work is mostly exemplary, however there are a few weird jump cuts, angle shifts and frenetic, wobbly crash zooms that whilst sometimes done purposefully to unsteady the viewer, are other times an unwelcome, pointless distraction from what's actually happening on screen. There is also the character of Dr. Joseph Klemperer and the unusual decision to have him played by Tilda Swinton in layers of prosthesis. While Swinton undoubtedly gives a fantastic physical performance as the elderly psychiatrist investigating the weird goings on at the school, her voice is just not convincing and sounds comically high-pitched in parts, her diction muffled by dentures. The makeup, while good, is not quite good enough and when Klemperer is shot in full daylight closeup, it's quite obvious that his face is a mask. It makes it difficult to engage with his character fully.At its worst Suspiria feels convoluted, sluggish and pretentious, at its best, such as during the Volk dance scene, it is a visual feast, a hellish ballet that commands the senses with majestic ferocity. The languid pace, subtitle heavy dialogue (much of the film is in German) and tangled subtext do not make for an easy watch. I can understand people hating it, particularly if they are expecting a straightforward horror narrative, but for those who can appreciate slow burn, atmospheric films with a unique vision, they will find greatness here.",Suspiria

166,davesawesomeinbox,Bored,4,21 December 2019,"2/5 starsNo spoilers.
I've never seen the old original movie.
They clearly put a lot of work into the movie so I'm giving them some stars out of respect. Also I have seen worse. Also my disliking it might be in part to my usually not liking horror films and especially watching people being tortured.Now I didn't hate the movie...but...if I had watched it in the theater I think I might've hated it. Especially if I had to sit through the whole thing in a theater. Most likely I would have walked out if that was an option. At home I was able to focus on some other things during boring the many boring scenes of which i was just waiting to be over. To clarify what I mean by hate...I hated Wolf Creek and I hated Devil's Rejects. So if you liked either of those then you might like this movie.One of its only redemptions for me was the inclusion of a Radiohead song. Some of the acting was quite good too. I must also applaud it for what was, to me at least, an original and interesting concept. Granted I was quite bored by it, but I did find it a little interesting due to its originality. Without spoiling it I will say that during a minute in the last chapter of the film, when the screen is red tinted, was one of the most artistic moments I have seen in a film of recent years...granted what I mean by artistic...I am not a professional artist, so all I mean is simply that it felt like a painting in motion with a soundtrack in that scene. Kind of delightful.Recommended? No. Unless you liked Wolf Creek and Devil's Rejects. That sort. Then maybe it is your cup of tea. Ever tasted straight yerba mate? Well....some people like it for some reason beyond my understanding so...yeah.",Suspiria

168,PubHound,"Ambitious and unconventional, but way too overstuffed",7,3 January 2019,"7-Suspiria is definitely not your typical horror movie. While tension isn't really its thing, it manages really well to unsettle and disgust with its strong imagery, editing and sound design, all three top notch in my opinion. The main problem with it is probably due to the fact that it intends to tackle so many themes and thoughts and suggestions, that the ending result is a little too much to bear, and my only wish was for it no to be that way, too focused on giving a magniloquent message and not too much on giving its characters a richer and more compelling characterization.
I still enjoyed the ride overall, and feel like praising it for its wild execution and ambition.",Suspiria
169,AGood,Far too long...,4,22 February 2021,This would have been a fantastic 1hr 45 minute film. The problem is this film runs for a whopping 2hrs 30mins.This is a film that needed an editor to cut back scenes. They run too long and there are many irrelevent to the plot scenes dragging this movie down considerably.If this had of been cut back this would have been an 8/10 film. As it stands now I gave this 4/10.See the Daria Argento original instead.,Suspiria
170,Kolobos51,"Slower than slow burn, but a wild finale that actually lives up to the original.",6,4 November 2018,"Suspiria is the shockingly long remake of Dario Argento's expressionistic masterpiece of surreal, supernatural horror. This version stays fairly close to the plot of the original, but it removes much of the horror and replaces it with... Well, not a lot. The first 90 mins or so of this thing are just brutal. But then the movie just goes nuts and despite having a completely different third act than Argento's film, it actually starts to feel like a remake of that deranged master's class in terror.This movie hits the beats you would expect for the first part. Special guest star Chloe Grace Moretz is panicking, half crazed with fear that her prestigious dance academy is run by witches. She runs for her life and something bad happens to her. Presumably. Like I said, a great deal of the horror has been removed here, perhaps unsurprising given this is the director of last year's homosexual coming-of-age romance Call Me By Your Name. So, instead of overt, gory terror, we get repeated cuts to an ancient psychiatrists suspicious of the academy while the women that run the place (led by the always fantastic Tilda Swinton) endlessly argue about the direction the academy should move in under its mysterious matriarch, the Mother.In the meantime, as in the original, an American student recently arrived (Dakota Johnson) is indoctrinated into the school's weirdness while her suspicious friend and fellow student (Mia Goth of A Cure for Wellness) snoops around.There are direct call backs and specific plot points taken straight from the first movie and a solid, if somewhat less memorable soundtrack provided by a member of alt rock band Radiohead. The acting is strong also but my lord does the pacing need work. This movie should be AT LEAST 30 mins shorter than it is. If you recall the brilliant horror film Hereditary from earlier this year, you may also know that great, 2 hour film originally ran 3 hours and was wisely cut down for a leaner run time. This movie would have seriously benefited from the same disciplined editing.Suspense is not consistently sustained and the characters are too thin to warrant such a bloated run time. On top of that the absolutely excessive, and largely unnecessary amount of time given to the psychiatrist character just goes nowhere and simply did not need to be there.Suspiria 2018 is an interesting but very flawed horror remake that is worth watching but you should probably wait for the home release where you have the option of pausing or even fast forwarding.",Suspiria
171,jwcstorage,Skip if you have no attention span,9,28 June 2019,"This movie REQUIRES you to:
1) Pay attention to the story
2) Connect dots in the story
3) Pay attention to the movieIf you want to give this movie a chance, strap in for its LONG run time, shut your phone off, and actually WATCH THE MOVIE.
Some say that there is no sense of dread or foreboding in a movie where a large portion of it is spend with rain absolutely beating down the ambiance and set literally across the street from the Berlin Wall while there are terrorist events going on in the background of the story. If you feel that the above sentence isnt dreadful and foreboding but you got the scared chills during Paranormal Activity, then dont waste your time.There is one thing that a lot of people who clearly ""saw"" the movie but didnt actually WATCH the movie get confused by.
Throughout the movie the audience is constantly having certain pieces of information thrown at them but people seem to be confused that there are witches in this movie. This is not a spoiler, it would be like saying ""there are superheroes"" in The Avengers. This is a movie about *WITCHES* as they are trying to survive in the ""modern"" world (""modern"" as in the time this movie was set).
If you can understand that this movie is about witches and all that it entails, such as magic, rituals, symbolism, female-centric, etc. it would behoove you to have an understanding of that before the movie begins. You dont need to prepare your brain for this as the movie does a great job of exploring these aspects as everything builds towards the finale but it helps a lot, but only if you're paying attention with an open mind.Not a perfect movie and not for everyone but if you give it a chance it might surprise you.",Suspiria
172,benedictmichael-03235,On a Plate without the Plate,1,15 July 2021,"Never much cared for the 1977 Argento original. Never saw its appeal though I watched it several times to prove myself wrong.This film, a remake and re-imagining I suppose, goes on and on and on. And. On. You get to feel the full weight of its two and a half hours. It doesn't have an end because its story is confused and has no clear resolution.To me it wanted to magisterially unify cultural, social, artistic, and political trends in the manner of Thomas Mann's 'Doctor Faustus.' Alas, film is not the best medium for that type of venture. More successfully its mood hearkens back to Zulawski's 'Possession' (1981) with which it shares a locale and its era, the latter simulated of course.Of the dance: Dance is notoriously difficult to film well. And it isn't filmed well here. The director might have looked at films of Michael Clark's ballets for inspiration, some of which are mind-blowingly excellent.Of the music: When not having a bad case of the bowies, Yorke succumbs to tubular bells. Then, sort of nothing.What's the opposite of synergy?",Suspiria
173,DylansFearFiles,An Extraordinary Update of Argento's Classic,10,2 April 2020,"As a big fan of Dario Argento's 1977 classic, I approached this new look at this story of witches and murder with a mix of apprehension and excitement (but mostly excitement). The reviews got me even more intrigued since the reaction was so polarized. Fortunately, I was not disappointed at all with Luca Guadagnino's re-imagining of Suspiria.Like the original, this movie follows Susie Bannion (played here by Dakota Johnson) as she leaves her home to go to a prestigious dance academy in Germany ran by the mysterious Helena Markos and her vice directress Madam Blanc (both played here by Tilda Swinton). Little does she know that this school is being ran by a coven of witches who will do anything to keep their dark workings secret. This film adds more complexity to the simple premise of the original film by adding the character Dr. Jozef Klemperer (also portrayed by Tilda Swinton), who is searching for a missing patient of his who was a student of the Markos Dance Academy.First off, the story of the movie is a great update of the original. The general structure of the story is mostly the same but the details and execution are almost completely original. Argento's Suspiria takes a more simplistic approach to storytelling, mimicking the style of fairy tales. This one is more complex, with multiple interconnected storylines which converge in the climax. The movie moves the action from Frieburg to Berlin in 1977, which is shown as a politically turbulent time. I know very little about the Baader-Meinhoff incident in the film, so I can't comment on how it relates to the story aside from adding more flavor to the setting.As a 2.5 hour movie, it would be easy to assume that this film would be boring to watch at times. While this is a slow burn and could probably turn off other viewers, I was completely enthralled by the events unfolding onscreen. The characters are interesting and Dr. Klemperer is especially easy to empathize with, so they keep you engaged through the strange events in the film. While violence is used sparingly in the narrative up until the shocking climax, what little violence you see throughout is quite disturbing.The acting is another very strong point in this movie. Dakota Johnson might get a few boos from the gallery due to her role in the 50 Shades trilogy but here she portrays Susie Bannion with subtlety and innocence that makes her character very endearing. Tilda Swinton especially amazes in this due to her seemingly effortless portrayal of three very different characters in Madam Blanc, Jozef Klemperer, and Helena Markos.Madam Blanc was a falsely affable villain with no dimension in the original, but the writing and Tilda Swinton's performance here add depth and conflict that make her possibly the most interesting character in the film. Her performance as Dr. Klemperer is very believable as an old man who has spent years being weathered by grief and guilt, especially with the absolutely astounding makeup effects. While she appears only briefly as Helena Markos, Swinton also makes a delightfully disturbing impression as this disgusting and frightening witch.While Guadagnino's Suspiria lacks the distinctive color palette of the original, the remake uses wintry colors and more subdued cinematography. This all gives is a very different tone from the original and makes everything just feel more cold and ominous. It's really interesting that the climax makes use of more Argento-like to further convey the supernatural ramifications of what is happening onscreen.I'd be remiss not to make note of Thom York's (of Radiohead fame) beautiful score. Suspirium and Unmade particularly stick out as favorites of mine from this movie. I couldn't stop listening to Suspirium for a few days after watching this and I still listen to it regularly. The style of his score is again very different from the original Goblin Score, which helps this movie stand on its own even further.Overall, this 2018 re-imagining of Suspiria is a simply astounding film and I believe over time it will be viewed as a classic alongside the original. After I watched it, I was absolutely blown away and spent several minutes pacing around my room just saying ""Wow!"" over and over again. That isn't something I've experienced with a movie in a very, very long time. I wholeheartedly recommend you check out this masterpiece if you can handle some slow-burn horror cinema.",Suspiria
174,teekieteekybirdie,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!,1,23 March 2019,"This film made NO sense at all, just random scenes of gore and blood, with weird dancing scenes and partly german speaking most of the time, useless if you don't understand german, the whole film was completely confusing and had no storyline and no point to it, it made NO sense whatsoever, I have no idea what I even just watched, all I know is it was two and a half hours and complete rubbish! Stupidest film I've ever seen in my life! Waste of time.",Suspiria
175,StevenFlyboy,Great remake!,10,30 January 2019,"In order to adequately express my feeling about this movie, I will have to reveal spoilers, so if you are offended by them, I strongly suggest you don't read any more of this.Most of the reviews I've read about this movie are negative. People are saying it's no good and it's a waste of time, etc. After watching the movie several times, I would have to disagree. The makers of this movie have invested $30 million dollars into it, and you can easily see the hard work and thought that went into producing it. It was a much better written and better made movie than the original, which makes it more believable; however, I would say that both the original Suspiria and the remake have pros and cons about them. For one thing, the original Suspiria was only an hour and a half long and the story was simpler and easier to understand. This new Suspiria is way too long and the story is very intricate. It's more like an ""art house"" type of movie. There are many things that happen that have multiple deep meanings, which serve to confuse the viewer in having to figure everything out and make sense of it all. Generally, I don't like movies like this, but seeing that this is ""Suspiria"", I'm willing to overlook this detail. I might add, if you haven't seen this movie yet, it would help to watch the original first, if you haven't already done so. It will help you understand things a little better. Another thing about the original versus the remake is that in the original, the special effects were ""cheesy,"" the blood was orange, and the acting was bad. I assume this can be blamed on budget restraints, but the writing also suffers. There are a lot of ""stupid"" things that happen in the original that are totally NOT believable, not to mention all the annoying nerve-grating background noise that Dario Argento used in his movie. Also, in the original movie, the dance studio really has nothing to do with the witches that run it. It's almost a coincidence. During the day, the studio was like any other studio. The dancers practiced their dancing and everything pretty much was like any other dance academy, but at night, after the girls went to bed, the witches would meet in their secret room and carry out witchcraft. There was very little, if any, connection between the dance academy and the witchcraft and to the witches motivations and actions. In this new remake, the dancers dancing actually PROPELLED the witch's spells onto their victims, and I really like this concept. It makes better sense. The dancers were not aware of this, but nevertheless, as they danced, the victims would be thrown against the wall and literally every bone in their bodies would end up broken. These scenes are very graphic and hard to watch. One thing about this remake that I don't approve of is that the movie sends the wrong message to the viewer. It portrays evil as something ""glamorous"". It tells us that evil is good. That it's something we should desire. It tries to make us ""envious"" of Susie. In the original Suspiria, Susie Bannion, the ""good girl"", narrowly escapes the dance academy with her life. She kills Helena Markos, the place blows up, catches fire, and burns all the witches up. Susie survives and the good prevails over the evil. In this new remake, Susie actually ""embraces"" the evil. In the end, she becomes the ""third mother"" - the ""queen witch"", if you will. Not all of the bad guys DIE. Susie has made it to the top. Evil prevails over the good and they all live happily ever after. This is NOT a good thing, folks. There are thousands of people in the world today who have a problem distinguishing fantasy from reality, as it IS. Not long ago, two 12-year old girls brutally stabbed one of their classmates because they believed that if they hadn't, ""Slender man"" would have killed their families. If you aren't familiar with Slender man, he's a fictional creature found online in creepypasta. You can google it for more info. So in my opinion, if the wrong people watch movies that glamorize evil, these people, who already are unstable, could be compelled even MORE SO into causing another ""Slender man"" type of situation.What puzzles me the most about this new movie is the fact that so many reviewers here claim ""this is NOT a remake of the original Suspiria."" There are too many similarities between the two movies to claim it's not a remake. BOTH MOVIES are called ""Suspiria""...BOTH MOVIES have the same characters. BOTH MOVIES are about a German dance academy run by witches. The movie even credits Dario Argento. To say this new movie is not a remake is ridiculous. It's true that the new movie contains new elements to the story and is far more detailed than the original but basically it's the same story. If this movie is not to be considered a remake, then WHAT WOULD BE????Having said all this, the ""remake"" of Suspiria is very professionally written and thought out. Dakota Johnson is beautiful and her performance is even MORE beautiful. Even though the movie is too long, it's never boring. It held my attention throughout, which, to me, kind of makes up for it's length. At the very end, during the end credits, we see a last glimpse of Susie, casting a spell. On WHOM and for what reason, we don't know. Possibly to set up a sequel I guess. (By the way, what kind of dancing are these girls doing? It's not like any ballet I've ever been familiar with. It's more like cheerleading routines or some kind of aerobics or something. Not like the usual dance-on-tippy-toes ballet dancing that I'm used to).",Suspiria

Although I truly enjoyed the beginning and thought the visuals and dancing and acting were really spectacular. The film fails to pull it all together at the end. It tries to grab all those story strings but unfortunately it falls apart.Many viewers mention the movie trying to say something about feminism and women in power but that is simply circumstantial. It just happens to be a coven of witches that are female end of story people.I don't know who green lighted that awful ending and decided to go for schock value gore instead of fixing the damned script. Disappointed here, but I still enjoyed the majority of the film. Also the music... I don't know who picked radio head but it was a horrible mistake and didn't match the film.

This new interpretation lacks everything that made the original a classic. Gone are the vibrant color and memorable soundtrack. Instead we get a film that gets tedious over time. I had to check my clock to see how much more time i have to waste on this. At least the last half an hour is well worth it.

To make an effective 152 minute horror film would require a strong screenplay and a great director/editor and Suspiria is sadly lacking in these areas. Nearly every recent film could do with removing about thirty minutes and Suspiria does not have the content for more than 90 minutes but here we have film-makers suffering from the delusion that they are Stanley Kubrick but are closer to Ed Wood jr with a large budget.

The director has no sense of creating and sustaining fear as a storyteller. There's enough cheap weirdness and quirkiness here to satisfy cult film fans (who love to honor weirdness and quirk) but the whole thing comes off as an unnecessarily extended and arty version of a storyline made more simple and effective in American Horror Story: Coven.

186,HorrorFan6969,Poor reimagination of a classic 70s giallo film. 152 minutes that feel it never end!,1,3 September 2018,"It was impossible not to have high expectations for Luca Guadagnino's remake of ""Suspiria."" Dario Argento's original is, after all, a one-of-a-kind horror freak-out, the kind of mesmerizingly bizarre cinematic experience so sui generis that any remake would have to represent an aggressive reimagining.And who better to take on this seemingly impossible assignment than Guadagnino, coming off the impressive troika of ""I Am Love,"" ""A Bigger Splash"" and ""Call Me By Your Name""? The cinema's greatest sensualist wasn't going to make us smell the rosemary or taste the apricot juice this time; the idea of his gifts being applied to blood-drenched horror promised a uniquely terrifying experience.So what does Guadagnino's version convey? Boredom, mostly, with confusion and a dollop of disappointment and irritation.The original was set at a creepy dance academy in 1977 Berlin, so Guadagnino and writer David Kajganich (""A Bigger Splash"") have decided to lean into that time and place: There is constant discussion on TV about terrorism and the Baader-Meinhof group, and one of the plot points revolves around lingering survivor's guilt in the post-Nazi era. What do either of these ideas have to do with a dance academy that's a front for a coven of witches? The new ""Suspiria"" doesn't seem to know.(It's not unlike Jonathan Demme's decision to remake the early-'60s classic ""Charade"" as the nouvelle vague-influenced ""The Truth About Charlie,"" since the French New Wave was happening in Paris as Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn strolled by the Seine. An interesting idea on paper, perhaps, but historical context only works in a remake if there's an actual point to it.)The 1977 setting also allows the filmmaker (and cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, ""Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives,"" ""Call Me By Your Name"") to go hard on the Fassbinder kitchen-sink miserabilism, which certainly could, in other circumstances, make a great, grim backdrop to an atmospheric horror movie. But the result here is to put an unappealing visual sheen on an already dreary film.Dakota Johnson stars as Susie, a young woman raised by Mennonites but longing to dance with Berlin's Helena Markos Dance Company. She travels to Berlin, and her first audition blows away choreographer and former lead dancer Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton), who accepts her on the spot.There's an open room in the dormitory due to the disappearance of another dancer, Patricia (Chloë Grace Moretz). Some whisper that she has run off to join the terrorists, but the film opens with her in a ranting panic, telling her psychiatrist Dr. Klemperer (Lutz Ebersdorf) that the Markos instructors are witches who plan to destroy her.Klemperer at first dismisses her fears as a delusion, but after Patricia disappears, he begins to investigate more closely, even though he's got his own problems; years after the end of the war, he still holds out hope that his wife, from whom he was separated as they tried to flee Berlin, will return to him safe and sound. Meanwhile, Susie quickly climbs the ranks, and Madame Blanc selects her to take the lead role in the company's most famous dance piece, ""Volk.""The actual performance of ""Volk"" immediately ranks alongside ""Goddess"" in ""Showgirls"" and the fertility dance from ""Lost Horizon"" as one of the screen's most unintentionally hilarious pieces of choreography. The ludicrous terpsichorean display isn't helped by the costuming; the dancers all wear bright-red ropes tied in what appear to be Japanese Shibari bondage knots, a provocative choice undercut by the big white granny panties that they sport underneath.To be fair, there's at least one legitimate scare to be found here; as Susie learns the new dance steps, her motions are mirrored in the basement of the studio, where an unseen force pillories a young woman to near-death using the exact same moves. But by the time ""Suspiria"" reaches its blood-soaked, all-of-them-witches climax, I was suppressing church giggles. The frights aren't frightening, the political subtext never connects with the rest of the movie, and even Guadagnino's generally unfailing visual sense isn't enough to put this over.Swinton (playing more than one role, for no apparent reason) and Johnson give the material more than it deserves, but even they can't put helium into a lead balloon. The other ballet instructors are played by a fascinating ensemble of performers (including 1970s Euro-stars like Fassbinder's wife Ingrid Caven, German New Wave icon Angela Winkler, and onetime Paul Verhoeven leading lady Renée Soutendijk, as well as Sudanese supermodel Alek Wek), but they're given very little to do.It's tempting to say that Guadagnino treats them like furniture, but in one of his better movies, he would actually shoot the furniture in a meaningful way.As for Thom Yorke's score, it's decidedly unobtrusive, which for some is the mark of good film music. Apart from a song under the opening credits and another under the closing credits, very little of it announces its presence. Given how little subtlety ""Suspiria"" otherwise displays, that's an admirable sign of restraint. - Alonso Duralde",Suspiria

Germany, Berlin in the 70s, very successfully recreated here, mixing all the layers of German history, the Nazis, the communist DDR, the wall, the RAF terrorism of that time as a reaction to a very repressive society of the post-war 50s and 60s, with all the demons still alive, waiting in the cellar for to be called up into the light again. And well, looking at how the german, the italian, the european societies seem to struggle again with the darker sides of humanity and populist politics, he gives us a strong impression of this political development in the metaphorical artwork of his movie.
Strong influence of Fassbinder felt through out, quite interesting, even Ingrid Caven, his former wife shows up, and not by accident.
And by the way: it's not a remake, it's much more than that, it's an extension.",Suspiria

202,alvesmarceloalves-73751,Dancing with the devil,5,7 December 2018,"It is inevitable to get caught up in the ways of comparison when you see the remake of a movie from the past. Italian director Luca Guadagnino set himself a challenge by plunging into the darkness of ""Suspiria,"" but without making a frame-by-frame copy of the 1977 work of the Italian Dario Argento. Guadagnino preferred to rephrase the original story and recreate the trajectory of dancer Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson today and Jessica Harper in the original film) from other premises and with a different outcome for its protagonist. What was a classic, normal ending in the 70s, turned into a turnaround in the hands of Guadagnino.However, the result of the work as a whole left something to be desired. If the original work grew in layers under psychological terror until its end culminated by a revelation, in the remake of the Italian director, the premise of the horror is established from the beginning, but so many cards are thrown on the table, right up to the reflections on the politics and Germany of the 70's, that the film is lost in a tangle of concepts without delving into anything.Guadagnino's ""Suspiria"" also decided to relinquish the benefit of the initial doubt by revealing right away that there was something about witchcraft and the presence of a Helena Marko, that original witch whose story is told in the first film and in this one one never incurs its origins. On the contrary, new elements emerge, such as the presence of a sort of five upper mothers around Marko, entitled to Madame Blanc, played by Tilda Swinton, who feeds a rivalry with the original witch on the macabre or not school dance.Marko is the witch who demands sacrifices, Blanc is the one who understands magic as an extension of art. Not that they do not sail through the waters of horror, but the art of dance taught at the academy still seems to speak louder to Blanc, who nurtures a sympathy, to an empathy for the voracity, shocking savagery and surrender that Suzy imposes upon herself when she dances.And in that the film is lost. Even the setting of the story does not seem to have any connection. What Berlin divided by the wall in 1977 has in relation to the events of the witches? What parallels is it possible to draw from the policy and the Baader-Menhoff attacks? Is Germany at that time a time when horror was seen on every corner while witches fed on the fear of who they captured? It did not seem to me to make any sense to exchange the original Freiburg for this dark, icy Berlin.And there is the question of messages. The irreplaceable mother, the word of freedom on the wall in front of the dance school. Everything seems to have some connection, but the links are fragile. Just as the role of the psychologist Josef Klemperer (also lived by Tilda Swinton) seems almost useless.Faced with the holes and pallor of the film, ""Suspiria"" holds only three really good scenes. The first one is Suzy's dance that reflects on the horror lived by Olga (Elena Fokina) in the mirror room. It's brutal, it's terrifying, and the ending is worthy of the best exorcism / witchcraft films. The second is the scene of the presentation of the musical ""Volks"", a choreography almost perfect, but at the same time so tense, breathtaking and deep terror that perhaps is the best moment of the film. The third is the final turn of the film, its macabre and enduring ritual.It is praiseworthy that Guadagnino ventured into a completely different genre immediately after the resounding success of ""Call Me by Your Name"" (2017), which won an Academy Award for Adapted Screenplay. But the result fell short. ""Suspiria"" delivers the weapons early on, does not perfectly fulfill the function of imposing the horror, gets lost in history and appears very pale for a film that had much potential taking into account what the technology of 2018 could compared to that of 1977.In the end, what is most beautiful is the soundtrack composed by Thom Yorke, Radiohead.

This is what Gordon Willis called 'dump truck directing'. When this dump-truck of shots and cuts is done with a budget by professionals, it's more of an abomination than when it's done by amateurs who can't help themselves. It creates an impression of 'quality'- we see the production values on screen. But no amount of money in the world can make this scene, as is, come off as anything but the worst of what comes out of the ""prestige cable"" mill.

Both are fantastic in their own ways; Word to the Wise: There really IS room for two things to be magnificent. Why people turn everything into a competition, I'll never understand.Anyway, I enjoyed this movie, simply adored the Score/Soundtrack, and I needed to see it twice to catch everything. The music made all the difference in this movie (much like Sinister, for example). I didn't consider this to be a horror; perhaps that is what some folks are missing. I saw this as a power struggle--inside the dance academy and out--lots and lots of layers of history, dynamics and unspoken subtext with nearly every situation. I don't know, I really enjoyed it.I also like that they used women who were not the same cookie cutter plastic bimbettes that most movies use when it comes to dance or nudity. Refreshing in that regard.The main problems I had with this movie was the lack of backstory. I would love to see a sequel of the main characters' lives prior to the arrival of Bannion. I would love to see the development of the dance company/coven...Blanc and Markos as younger women; Patrizia, did she drown or something?

It has happened before and will happen later. We have Psychosis (1998, Gus Van Sant), oldboy (2013, Spike Lee), ber hur (2016, Timur Bekmambetov) or even Rebecca (2020, Ben Wheatley). This list is not intended to state that any attempt to touch a work is considered sacrilege. The Ben hur of 1959, considered one of the great films in the history of cinema, was also a remake- So there is talk of ambition and artistic proposal when reinterpreting them.Suspiria (2018) by Luca Guadagnino manages to completely move away from the original from 1977, being its best virtue. Dario Argento made an enigmatic film that he confused with his chromatic aesthetics. Its exaggerated form was superior to the background of a story that was read between the lines. The new suspiria is the opposite, its background wants to match the shape that also changes at the same time.This roll in ambition is noticeable in the duration, from 1h 40 min to 2 hr 30 min. Time is used to develop new subplots within a much more present space-time context. In practice it is noticeable that the rhythm suffers, noting that there is plenty of content because whoever covers a lot does little.The form changes to a historical realism that works quite well with the broad historical context that they tell of Germany. The change that occurs is also dance, one of the pillars of both films. Now it is modern dance and therefore the choreography takes a leading role. It manages to perfectly transmit the necessary esotericism, eroticism and terror. In one scene the dance in parallel montage shows the terrifying consequences. This will be carried to the last consequences at the end of the movie. At this point, it surpasses the original, giving dance the importance it deserves.The background is clearer, losing the mystique of the original. On the one hand, I understand that hiding what is happening does not make much sense being a remake of a cult, but on the other there are explanatory conversations and replies that feel forced. The game is then on, knowing how things are, what and how they will happen. For this, the interpretations are essential. Tilda Swinton and Dakota Johnson are the interpretive axes of the film. There are many secondary characters that are irrelevant in the end, but Johnson stands out for being the vehicular protagonist and Swinton for playing two different characters of great relevance. This, added to the aesthetics of Luca Guadagnino, make the gears work until the end.
As a separate note to the narrative, there is a subplot that is gaining strength, where more than terror, what leads in a melodramatic romanticism. It is perhaps the most artificial of the film, because it tries at all times to give it a main importance that does not get married despite the effort.The music directed by Thom Yorke is, like the movie, very different. Without understanding anything about music analytically, it is electric in contrast to the aesthetic and narrative classicism of the proposal. I like to see a contrast with such a good result. As the film as a whole is irregular, in some moments it is brilliant but in others I want and cannot. I applaud the author's proposal, own and non-transferable. It is not on this list of remakes without its own soul and for that reason at least it is worth it.",Suspiria
212,indiana1981,"Ignore the 1 star ratings, this is a decent movie",8,8 September 2020,"*MINIMAL SPOILER INCLUDED*Ignore the 1 star raters - they probably watched the original and disappointed, or expected a modern day horror type movie.This movie is a remake of a 70s horror, so it's vibe and style is of a psychological horror, full of suspense the whole way throughout the film. (Which is sometimes more refreshing than seeing a ghoul terrorising a family).The acting is also quite decent - particularly from Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swanson, (who actually plays 3 roles - 2 in disguise - the dance teacher, a head witch and an old man). Chloe Grace Moretz is a little wasted, but I think that's more down to her role and I think she had a lot more to give as an actress.I would say this movie moves at a slow pace, so don't expect a horror adrenaline rush. Ultimately it is about a ""cult"" of women.The end/climax of the movie, has a very different tone, where all is unveiled to the watcher. To me this part was a little ridiculous, mainly down to prosthetics. But given the theme of the movie, it still worked.I think some viewers maybe disappointed with the ""visuals"" of the climatic scene too, (which is perhaps where the 1 star ratings also come from). Which is why I've given this movie an 8 / 10 - the rest of the movie was really well made, acted, full of mystery, tension and suspense - and I think deserved that rating.A few questions still unanswered for me - for example - what happened to Dakota Johnson's mum? Why was she ill? And did she know of her fate?But overall, this is a relatively easy going horror to watch, compared to some of the stuff which has come out in recent years.

So I'll stick to my impression and give a recommendation.People often complain that movies today are too stream-lined or just more of the same. Well, Suspiria is definetely unique, whether you love or hate the movie for it.It is divided into 6 acts and an epilogue. The run-time is 152 minutes. What movie loosely connected to the horror-genre dares to be so bold?There are long passages where nothing really important happens but the overall feeling, if you remain open towards the movie, is always eerie, unsettling, sometimes frightening. But to me it was always at least interesting.The visual quality and sound of Suspiria is staggering. The dance scenes are filmed exquisitely and I loved that you could hear the dancers breathe, sigh, grunt... These dances were not beautiful but almost violent and I think the sound design captured that beautifully.
And of course there's Thom Yorke's haunting and sometimes hypnotic soundtrack which adds to all that.I wouldn't recommend Suspiria to fans of The Conjuring and the likes. This is no traditional horror film.
When I watched it, I was much more reminded of movies like Midsommar, David Lynch-movies or maybe even classics like 'Don't look now' or 'Rosemarie's Baby'. All those films also have the same unsettling and disquieting mood of foreboding evil that Suspiria also possesses.

222,ahsawesa,A Remake That Outdoes The Original,7,21 January 2019,"I don't usually start my reviews like this because it doesn't sound so professional but this movie blew my damn mind. I loved it.To call it a remake would be discrediting it because this film does so much more than just remake and use the elements from the original, it expands upon the original and it outdoes it!I can't spoil exactly what Suspiria (both remake and the original) is about because even though this film treats the spoilers of the original Suspiria as an open secret with the viewers, it's better if you don't know beforehand. Also, this film introduces more perspectives. The original was just about the American dancer uncovering mystery behind the nature of the academy teachers but this time, the story is also being told from the perspective of the head mistresses and teachers as well.Dr Josef is a new major addition. His presence adds an outside world aspect into the story because while the original was simply about what's happening inside the academy, this one has some political commentary on war and terrorism as the back drop. I don't know exactly why that is present in this movie but it does contribute to the arc of Dr. Josef who barely has an arc but is somehow a very sympathetic character.It broke the rules of the film making because it's missing some basic elements of storytelling. There's no character arcs here. This film consists of six acts and an epilogue which is rare because most contain only three acts or five acts. Then why does it work? I'm still trying to think why it works so well (at least for me) and I found one major reason that kept me glued to the screenIt treats it's antagonist(s) as really powerful which makes the struggle for our protagonists hard. You are constantly hoping for the safety of your favorite characters but the sense of impending doom is always there and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also does a great job of maintaining intrigue. The mythology this film presents is so fascinating and interesting to uncover. Also, there are a lot more themes/subjects than the original. It explores leadership, gender, art, motherhood, the concept of evil but it doesn't preach. These themes are very subtle but they are there.This is an incredibly complex film with so much going on that it may require multiple viewings to fully digest and even though I understood the core of it, I will definitely re-watch this as soon as possible. Also, pay attention when you watch the film because it's the kind of movie that requires you to think.Tilda Swinton plays two entirely different characters in this movie and she nails both of them! She killed it! She fully gave herself to these roles, to the extent that she became those characters. I did not see Tilda Swinton, instead I saw Madam Blanc and Dr Josef. Dakota Johnson surprised me too. I didn't know she had this kind of performance in her because she was so bland in 50 shades of grey. She also did a really good job with the dance sequences. All other actors and dancers did a fantastic job as well.The dance sequences also make this film stand out in contrast to the original which didn't focus as much on the dance. It is true that certain dance moves looked as if actors were having a seizure but the dance scenes in this movie have that strange pull. They are so enchanting and spellbinding. But at the same time, they feel unholy and evil, which is one of the main elements of the film.This is definitely more of a supernatural horror film than a giallo or a slasher like the original. The scary scenes work because this film does a good job of keeping restraint and showing you exactly how much you need to see to be scared instead of showing you everything (which takes away from the scare factor)The visual aesthetic is bleak, gritty and completely goes opposite to the colorful visuals that you would expect from Suspiria's remake. However, There are questionable editing choices though because it tries to be surreal at times and utilizes this strange editing technique with a lot of fast cuts. Also, at times it just cuts to another scene, entering very late so it's hard to tell how the characters got there in the first place and you are left scratching your head.When I reached the final act, I began to doubt it a little. I thought it is gonna go completely off the rails and for a second it did and I got worried that the ending might disappoint, that it will be something pretentious and it will be very ambiguous. But then the rest of the last act happened and wow, there were things I did not see coming. If you have seen the original and you think you know where it's going, you ain't seen nothing yet my friend.Certain things happened and while I didn't grasp them right away, it eventually started to make sense as the film ended and I felt like kicking myself for doubting the film. Everything came to a full circle magnificently and there was that ""Aha!"" moment when I grasped what the entire thing was about. A lot of people say that the final act makes or breaks a film and I don't necessarily believe that but I do think the final act has a major impact on the overall quality so I'm glad this film ended on a really good note. I went to bed thinking about this movie and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.The score and the soundtrack by Thom Yorke is oscar worthy. Nominate that man right now. The score is so beautiful. This entire movie is a piece of art. Every single aspect of it went together so well. I can't stop listening to the song ""SUSPIRIUM"" which is one of the main tracks.Final Rating 7.8/10. It is a work of art that may be missing some essential elements like characters arcs and etc that would've made it a solid 8 or above but I was just into this movie throughout the entire run time. Some may call it too long, some may call my review too long lol and well that's understandable but I was awestruck by this film. It had so much to offer (and as a result, I had so much to discuss) and it could have been a mess but it tied up everything so well. This is easily one of my favorite films of 2018. It's better if you see the original first in order to truly appreciate what this film achieves as a remake because remakes are hard but this film does an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the original while also bringing a lot of new stuff to the table. This is a rare instance of remaking outdoing the original",Suspiria

By disturbing I mean that I do think that if this was released to people that like theatre and plays then it would have been a hit. But as a movie all i could think of was ''WTF!!!''. Dakota Johnson has a bland face. She has the same damn expression for everything. Unless she says ''i'm crying'' and tears fall down her face then you'll never know what is going on. Fortunately, this movie was so dull it will probably quickly fade from my memory.",Suspiria

225,slammerhard,SUSPIRIA is a film that pulls it's punches!,6,25 December 2018,"Double whammy for Amazon after the massive flop of Neon Demon, another neo-horror film about a coven of witches, this time in the fashion industry.
Now that I think about it, the director of Neon Demon would have been a better choice for the remake of Suspiria. At least he has proven with Neon Demon and Only God Forgives that he can provide an updated version of Argento's hyperstylized elements.
You can't say that Suspiria 2018 is a bad film. There are many things that I like about it, but its very clear right from the start that the makers of the film failed to understand why the original is so much loved.
The key horror sequences of the remake-the dream sequences and the twisted ballerina-seem to have been lifted out of a third grade Ju-On imitation.
What the makers of this movie have done is to remove the elements that made the original such a unique experience and replace them with common cliques found in most modern horror films.
In Suspiria there are bits and pieces lifted from The Witch, Black Swan, J-Horror, Fifty Shades of Gray, and to add a dose of legitimacy, they gave it a 70's Fassbinder look.
But the worst of all is when they use those red filters at the end IN ORDER TO DILUTE THE IMPACT OF THE FINAL GORY ACT! Very disappointing, especially if you're an Argento fan.
As a fan of Argento, I take this as an act of betrayal.
The music from the new version can't compare with the original score by Goblin. There is also a stupid song at the end credits which it totally out of place. What were those guys thinking?
Trying to cater to the needs of the modern day audience is certainly not the best way to remake a classic!",Suspiria

227,amandagellar-31077,Wild Reinvention of a Horror Classic,6,10 May 2019,"If you're expecting something like Dario Argento's Suspiria, you might want to put on your brakes and go find somewhere else to hang out for 2 1/2 hours, because this new Suspiria is about as far removed as you can get from the original source material. That said, the basic story of an American dancer attending a German dance academy that's run by witches is still the same, but it takes a few different side roads along the way.Gone are the lush colors and baroque set design of Argento's film and in its place are cold, drab rain-soaked cinematography and slow zooms. It feels much more Fulci than Argento (and one score cue even sounds like something from The Beyond). There's less stabbings and razor wire and more body horror along the lines of David Cronenberg. One scene in particular might go on to become one of the most memorable horror set pieces of the past 20 years.This new Suspiria isn't without its faults. For the kind of story it's try to tell, its run time is absurdly long, adding to a feeling of pretentiousness - almost as if the filmmakers were ashamed to be making a simple horror film. They add in subplots that don't amount to much to try and give the film some gravitas, but they feel so disconnected to the main story that it ends up being more distracting than anything else.This new Suspiria might be an aqquired taste, but it has more than enough to make it worthy of a recommendation.",Suspiria
228,jonnathanchavezz,one of the best horrors films of the decade,10,20 September 2020,"This film provides one of the most unique horror experiences ive ever had. a lot of the horror aspects come from the tone the film conveys in its very cold color pallete and lighting, the subtext of the civil war setting and production design, the melancholy music, and the slow, droning tension that builds up all throughout the film, over all the presentation is what really brings it home. even small details like the sound design that accompanies the more gory sequences really make you cringe and disgust at whats happening on screen (in a good way). dance sequences have this chilling aura to them and i love how the choreography and the editing put an emphasis to that and go hand in hand. but the aspect that left the biggest impression on me were the costumes and make up which are all just super impressive and at times evoke so many emotions from me ranging from dread, fear, disgust, theres even one character that can honestly be nightmare fueling. my only personal criticism that i have for the film is that it is very slow even for taste but once i get to the climax of the film i very much feel that it pays off because the sheer horror i feel towards what happens on screen and how its presented is one that ive never experienced in any other horror film before which i absolutely love. suspiria 2018 is one of the best horror films of the decade. if you liked call me by your name youll like this, they have the same director.",Suspiria
229,vinylvanilla,Special FX makeup does not a good movie make.,1,5 February 2019,"Suspiria is too pretentious to be considered a good movie. What is supposed to be inspired by the rise of Fascism and Nazism in Germany and the horrors of post war Berlin, becomes a bloody mess with too much pointless gore.Although Tilda Swinton is impeccable - as usual - playing both the roles of a man and a woman, and Dakota Johnson and Mia Goth do a good job as well - the cast doesn't save this movie. Not even the great cinematography exempts this movie from being harshly criticized.Luca Guadagnino still has a long way ahead - he needs to learn horror is much greater and chilling when it's only suggested in a movie - a good example is Polanski's Rosemary Baby, which didn't turn to bloody gore or cheap special effects makeup to have meaning.That being said, I suspect the explicit bloody scenes are only there to create a shock factor and buzz, because they add nothing new to the plot. If this movie intended to be horrifying and scary, it didn't accomplish its mission. if this movie intended to be an artistic, abstract depiction of post-war Germany, it's way too laughable to be taken that seriously.The plot, by the way, is as simple as it gets. Supposedly there was a trinity of ancient mothers who needed to survive. One of them, represented by Madame Markos, is facing complete physical decay and needs to perform a ritual with all the dancers of the studio so that the dancer Suzy Bannion (played by Dakota Johnson) gives her the youth and power she needs. And that's it. Expect lots of cheap pagan and even Masonic references and lots of fake blood, too. Yawn.Guadagnino fails to create a good horror movie, and fails to create a good movie that criticizes Nazism and post-War Berlin as well. Which is a pity, because the movie had potential, and he could have ceased the opportunity of shooting a remake to actually make something more interesting.",Suspiria
230,bettybenzone,A bit too meandering,5,3 April 2019,"Suspiria has a great pedigree. It's adapted from a film by Dario Argento, it's directed by art house darling Luca Guadagnino, and it stars Tilda Swinton. Not too bad, right? And there's a lot about Suspiria that is excellent. The cinematography is colorless but moody, the acting is uniformly terrific, Thom Yoke's score unnerves, the sound design is genius, and there are some sequences that will be pretty hard to forget after you've seen them. So, why isn't Suspiria a slam dunk?This Suspiria tries to distance itself from the original every step of the way - a smart choice, but sometimes, it doesn't just forget it's a remake of a classic horror film...it forgets it's a horror film at all.We're treated to several sequences away from the main action of the story where we follow a lonely old psychiatrist whose wife was lost in the war. The character is clearly played (quite well) by Tilda Swinton in old man drag and the scenes themselves are well written and performed (even a little moving), but they feel like they belong in a completely different film. There's an effort to try to tie this side plot into the finale of the film, but it comes across as clumsy and you wonder why no one ever spoke up and said ""you know what, guys? This is great, but I think it might be slowing down the film and we don't need it.""Little side plots like this don't really offer anything that blends seamlessly with the main story about witches in charge of a ballet school. If anything, they distract and make you groan every time the action cuts away from the school and the main characters.Still, there's a lot to love about this new take on Suspiria and it's easily worth a watch.",Suspiria

232,kshirad,An uncompromising vision of beauty and terror,10,19 November 2018,"As stated above (emphasis on 'uncompromising'), this is a movie not everyone can appreciate. It's very rare to find such picture that would go to the lengths of telling a story full of risk and originality (despite being a remake). The events on display are meant to elicit some type of emotion from its' audience, whether it be terror, awe, disgust, or even sadness. Nevertheless, it's never uninteresting or boring, well to me at least.The main plot uses some elements of the 1977 version; a young girl from the US named Susie goes to a dance academy in Berlin, where a coven of witches resides. And the comparisons to the original stops there. This time, a psychiatrist who has a past of his own is involved with the investigation when things go awry in the academy.Describing the story as pretentious is one thing, but this is one hell of a movie to analyze. There are so many symbolisms shown and hidden throughout the entire whopping runtime of 152 minutes, which is rare for a horror movie. What makes it keep on going is the layered storytelling. One of them uses the parable of political events (which is no wonder why it's set in 1977), including themes of guilt and shame as its' main emotional through line. Another thing is the use of dance as a key element of the film and an art form, from the thrilling first audition of Susie, her evolution as a dancer to the horrifying climax that's bound to turn off many people for its' disturbing weirdness (me excluded).I'd have to praise the actors for their astounding job in this movie, particularly Tilda Swinton, who embodies Madame Blanc like a beast of a mother trying to protect her kin and imbues emotion as well as gusto into the role (she's also done different roles in this movie which everyone may have already known but I'll just keep it shut). Dakota Johnson, best known for the ""Fifty Shades"" trilogy, is a revelation. In a very physical role, she manages to hypnotize the viewers with her captivating dance moves and subtle expressions without seeming bland in a not very showy role. Another honorable mention is Mia Goth as Susie's friend, Sara. She's the most relatable character out of the whole cast and she excels in it by giving a very raw and human performance.The camerawork is nothing short of immaculate. Luca Guadagnino has given a distinct style that feels very lived in and retro with its' grainy 70's look and grey palette while also being surreal, dreamy and terrifying with flashbacks, dream sequences and the final act giving way to hallucinatory and nightmarish visuals steeped in red and blood. The off-kilter camera movements generally fascinates and gives the movie a sense of dread and unpredictable disturbance.It's something to admire when a movie operates on multiple levels. There's a lot more to say about this movie that could fit into a book essay. I can already see this to have a cult following from how different and ambitious it is (not to mention violent in the most wicked and best way possible). I could not recommend it more just because it challenges the viewers. There is no doubt that it is highly divisive, just like the Berlin Wall.",Suspiria
233,crom-dubh,"Disappointing, no visual style, bloated narrative",5,5 May 2019,"I'll keep this brief. While I love the original, I was absolutely willing to give this one a chance. The initial previews suggested this would be very much its own film and significantly re-imagine the story. I was down for that.While early on the film does have some interesting imagery and seems to have a different story to tell, it ultimately doesn't really feel like it goes anywhere. The final act is mostly incomprehensible and badly directed. There are a lot of elements to the story that don't contribute to the film at all.And as a horror movie, it mostly fails. There is one fairly grisly scene early in the film but after that there is very little leading up to the climactic scene (which is *horribly* directed) aside from some horrifying dream imagery.The best thing I can say about this is that it's mostly very well acted, with Tilda Swinton being the clear standout here and Dakota Johnson also being quite good. In terms of direction and writing it is quite mediocre, and there is very little visual or musical style to speak of.",Suspiria

The avant garde original Suspiria looks like a cohesive piece of hollywood horror-by-numbers compared to this pretentious, overblown and grandiose jerk-off fest; like if Lars Van Trier decided to remake Fame while masturbating at his own reflection dressed like a ballerina for 2.5 hours. Argento's version is a pure classic that will stand the test of time. This is an atrocity.On the upside, Tilda Swinton is fantastic as always in multiple roles and the cinematography is gorgeous. The sets are pretty nice as well, but that's not even remotely compensatory enough to salvage 2.5 hours of meaningless masturbatory filmmaking. I mean, did this thing even have an editor?This film is 2.5 hours of runtime, yet somehow never seems to supply anything resembling a story, nor does it ever arrive at a point to justify its existence. There is no plot, no scares, no thrills, and a weak one dimensional protagonist (played by the range-less and underwhelming, Dakota Johnson) with no goals or motivations, and who never once rises above the scenery or clutter of the supporting characters.

The camera work is excellent with many uneasy zooms and abstract movements and shots. The acting is of quality. There is some wonderfully done body horror sprinkled in.Now the negatives. Suspiria could use an editing and compacting of about 45 minutes. It feels like it just goes on and on. I have nothing against a long movie, as some of my favorites are well over 2 hours. But when you are presenting me dryness on this level there is going to be a problem. Suspiria comes across as a film that wants to be deep cutting high brow cinema, but falls flat every step of the way. The final act (before the snoozer of an epilogue) offers unsettling imagery and is nice to look at, but left me scratching my head and unsatisfied.People are calling this work polarizing, however I feel the ones who are calling this a masterwork are so far off base they're either new to cinema or just fall in love with anything obtuse and artsy.

The beauty try to compensate for the lack of substance. We find master strokes from Guadagnino and a nano-thin plot that is an excuse to throw sumptuous visuals at the viewer. Argento was right. Remaking Suspiria was a bad idea to begin with. The movie by Dario Argento was maybe a child of its own times. It's very delicate; almost childish.

241,francescobrosolo,Boring and empty,1,14 January 2019,"I saw this movie in Venezia and I don't know why anyone will say it is good unless they are paid to say it. Which makes me think that is really what could be happening here (some of the reviews seem laughable and totally contrived and prewritten by someone working for the production) and perhaps this director seems to be living in his own make-believe illusion of himself. Luca Guadagnino is no auteur, but someone who just seemed to have hired a good cinematographer to get some beauty shots, while he was doing something else, but who knows what. The mise en scene is good, but that's about it, but there's more to enjoying a movie than how they set up the shot. I found no elegance to the actual direction, only some flourishes, some sizzle but no steak. It's really unfortunate because movies are magical and evocative, but this director doesn't offer anything new to cinema at all. I've watched three of his movies and this will be the last. They all feel like film school projects, not multimillion dollar pieces of cinema.The acting is melodramatic and unconvincing (that he tries to persuade us that the Psychiatrist is a man and not Tilda Swinton is such a middle finger to his audience, and thereby insults himself as a director. It's such a lame marketing attempt and makes me weep for the future of cinema if such a childish gimmick is what we can now expect to be where cinema is headed.)Auteurs have depth and know how to direct the story itself, invite audience respect, and are able to capture a theme, to pull from actors and crew something more than what they can give themselves alone. I didn't see that at all here. The movie seems lazy and without purpose, flawed - and it was so boring my friend fell asleep in it.There's a lot of jumbled ideas, faux symbolism and seems stolen from artists who were far better at original ideas.It was cool to see Thom York score a film, but it's unfortunate that it was for this movie instead of something that has actual artistic merit instead of a movie trying too hard to convince us that it has that merit.There were parts of this movie that took itself so seriously, and no one was behind the scenes saying ""its not coming across as artistic, it's coming across as funny and if you do that, the audience will laugh at you.""Which is exactly what my friends and I did when we left the cinema. Sad that movies are now being made this way. At least the original is known to be or meant to be trashy. This one seems to think it's high art, when it's more of a mockery of other great art, and somehow had no idea how messy and boring it actually is. Alighieri has a great quote: ""you were not made to live as brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge.""

The actresses do a good job but some confusing decisions were made (casting Tilda Swinton in two different roles) that detract from the film.
The movie jumps around plot wise and has some unintentionally hilarious dancing that once again distracts from the story.

The film is in serious need of editing, it was painfully slow in places and quite boring. The original had more horrific deaths although the dancing death was very clever. It also didn't have the same dream qualities of the original. Although I loved the camerawork I didn't like the blurred slow motion. I found the entire ending weak. Should it have had such an extreme carnage scene or been more subtle ...... I think the latter.
The ending crescendo was botched with that music and voice over.

252,sierrakilobravo,"Weird, but in a good way or not?",6,22 November 2019,"Suspiria is a 2018 movie starring Dakota Johnson, Mia Goth, and Tilda Swinton. It is a remake of a 1977 movie of the same name. If you've seen the original, or seen the trailer for this 2018 version, you'll know that its all a little weird.So what exactly is it about?""A darkness swirls at the centre of a world renowned dance company, one that will engulf the artistic director, an ambitious young dancer, and a grieving psychotherapist. Some will succumb to the nightmare. Others will finally wake up.""So yeah, this is a weird movie and while I really enjoyed aspects of it, I came away from it with mixed feelings. As a re-enactment of avant-garde surrealist cinema of the 1970s, it absolutely succeeds. The film and editing style, and even the set design nails the 1970s film aesthetic. It also mimics the type of camera movements you used to see in films like this from the past, things like when there is a zoom, it is done by physically moving the camera towards a subject rather than through the lens. It is quite a feat of production to make it look and feel like this modern movie was made in a previous era. But this also might have an effect on viewers - if you are not familiar with that old school style, it will all be very jarring.I think that what gave me mixed feelings about it was that while I enjoyed the visual aspect of it, it's kind of a mess. As an art piece it works very well. As a horror movie it's nowhere near scary enough, as a drama it's not well explained enough, and as a thriller it's not thrilling.The performances are all strong, with the interactions between Johnson and Swinton being standouts. Goth is convincing as she becomes more aware of what goes on at the dance studio, and the leaders of the studio are all suitably creepy. It's the rest of the package that left me wanting something. I guess it was odd choices like having Swinton play the part of both the dance studio madam and the old male psychoanalyst, or the many plots that go nowhere that made me scratch my head rather than nod along with the outstanding choices made when putting the film together.If you go into this looking for an arty weird surrealistic rabbit hole dive then you'll certainly have a good time. If you're looking for a logically developing out of the box horror-drama, then I think you'll struggle to make it through the two and a half hour runtime.",Suspiria

There is a character who never utters a word, no one really interacts with her, and then she dies a sudden and gruesome death. Other than the fact she lives at the dance academy we have no idea who she was or why this happened. By the time we get to the final, climatic scene with a big reveal, we see a character who is very important, but we weren't set up with enough information to grasp the meaning of all that was going on. Just a confusing jumble of over the top visual gore. It really could have been a more effective story if things were streamlined and the focus was on building the tension. At the very end there is a set up for a continuation of the story, but based on the numbers, it's unlkely that will happen.",Suspiria

256,tylerwoodrownichols,"The More I Think About It, The Less I Like It",4,26 November 2018,"I love the original Suspiria, and ""Call Me By Your Name"" was my favorite film of last year, so when I heard that Luca Guadagnino was directing this remake I was intrigued where I otherwise would have just written it off. After seeing it in cinema last week, all I can say is wow... what a bloated disappointment that was. I think the worse part is that there was the potential for a good film buried under this long-winded mess. It's about 45 minutes longer than it has any right to be. The plot doesn't really make any sense, which wasn't immediately obvious to me but upon further reading and reflection I've come to that realization. The best part of the movie, when we finally see the witches at their most evil, is marred by an inappropriate choice of music (so tonally dissonant that it pulled me out of what otherwise could have been a very engrossing scene) and terrible editing. Was it really necessary to show every single witch, in flashbacks, accepting the wrong witch as their leader before having their head blown off? I certainly didn't think so. Most of that was somewhat forgivable though, and if that was all that's wrong with this movie I may have been willing to look past those flaws. No, what really ruins this movie for me is the stupid political ""commentary"" (for lack of a better word) that they awkwardly tried to shoehorn into the plot. It all just felt so heavy-handed and pretentious. When they tell us that the previous student, murdered by the witches, was also involved in ""political groups"" I just didn't care and didn't see how that tied back into literally any part of the plot. So while most horror remakes are guilty of dumbing down their source material for a quick cash grab, this is basically the opposite scenario: it tries to turn what could have and should have been a fun movie about evil witches into half-baked attempt at political allegory that falls flat on its face.",Suspiria

I do have to say I love both films, they're so different but have a couple similarities between the two. Luca Guadagnino brought I felt a way more disturbing and dark twist to the euphoric dreamy original. Now that being said, I praise the original for at its time being so groundbreaking with the powerful colors and sound as well as cinematography. Everyone in this new version was flawless, especially Mia Goth she surprised me how powerful her role was compared to her other work. The only problem with the 1977 id say is that there really isn't a story, it's kind of bland.

265,yayamafiya-55211,This movie is so bad.,1,7 November 2018,"People talk about visuals of this movie but I am surprised about this. The shots are what they should be, like any movie.But why do people say this is lush photography? I can find 5 minutes of any ridley scott movie and it would be more lush than 50 best shots this director has. I don't get it. I think it's maybe because very little else is good in his movies and the photography is the best only choice this director has to seem good.That's a bad sign. Hire a good cameraman and you always will have that. Great films has great stories, great direction (of actors, not just camera), great sense of pace in editing (if this director can learn to edit it in two hours it would have been something, bravo!), AND good looking photography. But only it has photography.
I was thinking about this movie a lot, but not because I want to understand it.I was thinking how it's possible this movie was made and can be so bad? This movie just plain is BORING. The end is FUNNY. The tone is not oppressive in a good way, like Pixote or Schindler's List, it is oppressive like it is if you looking at a blank white wall for two hours and half.Nothing happens in this story so the boring of the colors only makes it seem like a very long journey into mediocre and petty boring boring boring.Please don't go see this movie.

266,HorrorMovieManiacMan,Fine but Confused Movie,6,12 October 2019,The first 2/3 of this movie were actually pretty good. I enjoyed the concept and the acting was fairly good. I think this movie falls flat on the delivery of those concepts. The cinematography was great and the characters were great.One of the things I thought this movie was missing that the original had was a memorable score. In one of the final scenes of the movie Dakota Johnson is a part of this cult like sacrifice. That whole scene was in my opinion was the worst scene of the movie. It felt like a crappy music video and it was kind of disappointing to see the whole movie build up to this final scene and it turned out to be a CGI mess.Now what did I think of the rest of the movie? I thought the tone was really well done. It hit you at the edge of your seat and kept me engaged. I enjoyed the cinematography and it was very visually pleasing. What I didn't care for was the editing. I found myself confused weather it was a stylistic choice or just bad editing. Either way I found it distracting.If you were a fan of horror then I would recommend the first 2/3 of this movie. If not I would give this one a pass.,Suspiria
267,deenariley-49870,Interesting Take on a Classic Horror Story,8,19 October 2021,"While this creative team seems like a strange choice to remake Dario Argento's Suspiria, they more than prove their worth by taking the story in a fresh, original direction that gives you different feelings and emotions than the original.While the original film had it's unique mood and color scheme to entertain you, this one has a stronger script involving the interior politics of the dance academy and all its teachers. Sometimes, you do catch yourself wondering if all these different characters and plot threads will come together in the end, but it mostly ends up being a satisfactory experience with some great performances, a dread-filled mood, and excellent performances.There are moments of body horror here that rival anything you've seen in a David Cronenberg movie. Those who are easily squeamish might want to have the fast-forward button handy.",Suspiria
268,NeverBeTheOneToBlindlyFollow,Loved it!,9,17 February 2019,Just like the original it's a very story based movie. But the viciousness of the harder scenes makes up for it in my opinion. I enjoyed it more than the original. Even though I know a lot of people might disagree with me I thought it was better. You just got to pay attention to the story and the puzzle pieces. It's not a movie that gives everything away easily. You have to pay attention and be able to read subtitles at the same time as you take it in. There is a decent amount of subtitles so if that's not your thing be aware. I think it is a masterpiece of horror and I am very sad that it didn't earn what it deserved at the box office. The gore was great and entertaining but I don't find it to be overly gory even tho it has a lot. Gore lovers like myself will be happy. You will cringe and feel the pain during certain scenes of the movie and with that alone I feel it's effective. Watch it!,Suspiria
269,pasanjayasinghe,An okay suspense movie,6,15 February 2019,"For a horror movie it works. Not with your typical jumpscares no. Instead it dips the movie in the thrill factor along with a fair amount of the ""wtf"" factor. A movie for a patient viewer for sure.
For a mystery, not so much. Because the above mentioned ""thrill"" pretty much leads up to nowhere. Most likely you'll end up being left with a heap of confusion unless you're some kind of a dude/gal who's in to all those satanism and witchcraft stuff. I'm not sure if the original 1977 movie connects with this one in some way which'll make things easier but I don't think it does. I'm planning to watch it next anyway. To my knowledge this is just a remake of it.
Excellent score coupled with the brilliant portrayal of late 70s Germany easily made it above 3 stars. For the movie itself though I'd give a total of 6/10.
An okay suspense movie.",Suspiria
270,genderarm,I don't understand...,8,17 September 2019,"What people didn't understand about this movie. The plot was not convoluted. The historical period is inline with the narrative. The characters have depth, and the story behind the dance school becomes clear in the telling.While the original starts off running, like someone jumping into a taxi in the middle of a storm, arriving both unwelcome and menaced. The re-imagining arrives unwelcome, screaming, and incoherent. And yet we know immediately that behind this insanity lies the truth.Suspiria 2018 is bleak. The colors are muted, and I can understand a level of disappointment here. But, their is purpose in this. There is context in the time and place in which the movie is set (for more you can read below). The flourishes of color play only in darkness, and more importantly in the dance.For me, the biggest disappointment in the original movie was the absence of dance. Ironically, the style of the original Suspiria was an inspiration for the choreographer of Suspira 2018, who took the expressionist and interpretive dance that was current in the 70s and made it the central to the new film.Dance becomes and goes beyond a metaphorical abstract and a visceral reality of ritual and persecution, method and passion, life and death, maiden and mother. The movie is a dance. But ""there are two things that dance can never be again: beautiful and cheerful.""The movie isn't beautiful, but it isn't ugly either. It doesn't share the sense of luxury that the original does. It breaks the nose of what is beautiful. It doesn't bring joy, but neither does it bring sorrow. It brings characters in a dance, tugged upon like marionettes. The central theme is abuse of power, and characters often compelled or coerced by events beyond their control are hallmarks of the genre, but theu aren't always obvious, and could be confused with lack of direction.The original Suspiria was an excellent horror film. Note, I said horror and not giallo, because it isn't a giallo. It shares some stylistic elements with the gialli because it's directed by Argento, and is a product of it's place and time, but Suspiria is a supernatural horror film.The re-imagining was exceptionally well-crafted, but it doesn't pretend the throne of the original. It doesn't try to be something it isn't, can't, or shouldn't. It's clearly to be taken as a work in its own right.
Notes on Post-War Germany in the 70s and Why Susie is MennoniteHistorical context might help going into the movie, but it isn't necessary. You can check out some small amount of the historical perspective at the bottom if you care to know. This is a movie with a rich history, much like the dance academy in which the movie takes place.Some people may feel that the environment outside the walls, a city divided for 30 years, detract from the main plot, for my part it provides perspectives. Some people may feel the Susie's back story is uncompelling or out of place. I felt that it was the driving force of the movie, and the characters motivation for being where she is.Knowing somethng about post-war Berlin,and the historical events that drove the decision to place the movie at the exact moment may confuse some American audiences. That's understandable.Very few Americans under the age of fifty are going to remember this part of the history of the Cold War. This is German history-a major audience for which this movie was intended.The historical event that drives what's going on outside the walls is the hijacking of a plane by the RAF (Red Army Faction), a radical communist group centered in West Berlin, though they often retreated back into East Berlin. Both the division of city by the Berlin Wall and the revolutionary actions of the RAF taking place mirror the narrative of the film in ways better understood after watching iy.Similarly, most people outside the mid-west of the US or, to a certain degree, German speaking countries will know little about the history of the Amish and Mennonite churches, in particular those in the US. Note that Pennsylvania Dutch is a misnomer, as it is a dialect of German. This may confuse people not aware of the fact.Amish and conservative Mennonites communities, just like many other ""foreigners"" in the US became insular. To this day, Amish and most Mennonites speak German as their first language. This marks them as alien when surrounded by people who neither speak German, nor share any common community grounds.Few know of the Amish flight from religious persecution, which runs parallels the history of the early English colonists. Or the fact that everyone outside these community in the US are referred to as the English. They have never given up being German.The connection to Germany is strong, Susie's character isn't incidentally and incomprehensibly Mennonite. She might feel more at home in Germany than anywhere except in the confines of the community in which she grew up.The desires of the character are more easily understood when you have a better understanding of how difficult it would be to leave this type of community and any sense of belonging along with it-or the shame and guilt which it places on the shoulders of those who leave the church-or just a chance at doing what you love.Susie is a woman of passion who is stifled in a strict, insular, religious community. Themes of religious persecution-whether it be the Jews, the Amish, or the Hexen-work heavily behind the scenes in this movie.If all of this leads to confusion or disorientation on the part of some viewers, I understand. Personally, I feel that confusion and disorientation may have been intentional.",Suspiria
271,SkylessWing,Messy,4,27 October 2020,"Dunno what the hell I just watched. Avoided reviews to set my own expectation of this re-imagining of a classic. But after watching it I felt empty and confused.It wasn't really an homage, it took the source material in a new direction, that I agree but at the end of the day it was convoluted and meaningless.Argento took this script, this concept and made it a movie that messed with u, u didn't know what to expect amongst the confusion, but it was intriguing and full of imagery that was so psychedelic it warranted multiple viewings so that u made sure u didn't miss anything.This adaption however had neither psychedelic confusing pieces or give the viewer an appetite to understand more about the dubious actions of the protagonists.It was slow, not that slow burners r bad, but they must build up the tension and keep the viewer intrigued to find out more.This was just slow for the sake of being slow. Some nice long shots and cinematography but that didn't add any joy to the dullness of this movie.",Suspiria
272,recklesscow,"A director's project, once again.",5,3 November 2018,"Despite the dearth of plot, the original ""Suspiria"" is in my top 5 list of horror films simply for the extravaganza of color, sound, and visuals that make it so unique. But far from considering a remake some sort of sacrilege, I was more than ready to accept a modern take on the tale, knowing full well no remake ever ""ruins"" an original (and to suggest such is a silly concept). I feel stating this is important because my view of the remake was not tainted by some type of devotion to the original. If the remake was better than the original, I was prepared to concede that point.""Suspiria"" 2018 is an odd bird. Seemingly cognizant of the fact the original film had a shoestring plot strung together by various set pieces, the writer(s) confoundingly expand on new themes only to stubbornly refuse to make them dramatically satisfying or relevant. When a film begins with a title card announcing an odyssey of ""Six acts and an epilogue set in divided Berlin"", one would expect something in the way of heavy lifting to uphold the act structure. Indeed, there was plenty of material to mine--an aging psychiatrist's search for his missing wife, Susie's rapid rise in the company and her strange relationship with Madame Blanc, fellow student Sara and her growing suspicions--but, by film's end, none of it has much consequence. Oh, there are plot progressions, but ""Suspiria"" straddles the line between character-driven horror and having too much ""fat"" in the plot, with the end result proving lackluster on both fronts.In terms of production technicalities, for all the original's beautiful colors and careful framing, ""Suspiria"" 2018 makes some tradeoffs in exchange for improved acting and better effects, but as to which film has the better cinematography and editing, it's more than a toss up. While succumbing to hokeyness at times, the original is certainly not a poorly-made production. One can hardly claim Guadagnino's direction here is in any way superior to what was already a directorial tour de force of a film to begin with. Instead, Guadagnino focuses on a decidedly more muted tone, both in color palette and mood, which tampers down the more psychedelic aspects of the original and brings more attention to the subtleties of acting and the minutiae of directorial mood-enhancers via seemingly constant rain only to be replaced by snow. The result is a very bleak film that does put one in a rather subdued state throughout. This is miles from a shock-a-minute film, and, indeed, the thrill of constant stimulation may be what most find so lacking in the film, for in the first 120 minutes of its nearly three-hour runtime we are treated to one (albeit gruesome) death. A slasher film it is not. One has to sit quietly and mine ""Suspiria"" for its supposed depths and revel in its atmosphere, even if it is often lacking in any real sense of foreboding that one would expect from what is, after all, a horror film. I found myself thinking that the film would be decidedly more suitable to watch on a cold, rainy day...or perhaps after a few tranquilizers to set the tone.Guadagnino's effort is commendable for his use of restraint, however; so at odds with Argento's instincts in the original that I wonder how he even got the job (and that's not a complaint). For every bombastic moment in the '77 film, there's a quietly subdued scene of dialogue in the '18 version to match. And it's precisely this reason why, I imagine, most mainstream horror fans, used to a barrage of jump scares and carnage, won't enjoy it.""Suspiria"" languidly ambles along until the finale, which is so gonzo that I couldn't quite grasp how to feel about it. Revelations are made, blood is spilled, and we get treated to some delightful lighting and dancing, but the lack of coherent exposition can leave one scratching their heads as to what, exactly, is going on. That's not to say there aren't answers, but whether intentionally or not, the narrative feels obfuscated. In quite the treat, however, we do get some lovely blood-red filters that come the closest in the entire film to being an homage to the original.Should you see it? Definitely. It's reluctance to conform to the standards of other mainstream horror films earns it points alone. Whether a success or a failure, I feel originality should always be commended. We need more films like ""Suspiria."" Let's just pray they have a better script.",Suspiria

It's too long, especially the Berlin Wall subplot that doesn't add much to the film at all. A certain sequence with tons of CG violence is bad enough to ruin all immersion. The setting is there, but seems to insist a degree of historical significance that just isn't communicated that well at all.However, this remake of Suspiria is not only a fresh take on Suspiria; it is a standout among its genre. Gone are the cringe-worthy film score jump scares and the unbelievably idiotic character decisions that are a staple of the horror genre.

278,MrJustRight,The Witch Hunter,6,21 June 2020,"The first time I saw this film was at the theater. At the time I found it a breath of fresh air. By chance I had just watched Argento's original from 1977 & was excited to see this remake. Very satisfied I was. Stunning visuals, captivating audio, entrancing acting. Though am I alone here, or does anyone else find the lead's performance underwhelming? There is a certain feigned enthusiasm emanating from her, and I much prefer the lead from the original film.I refer to this film as ""The Witch Hunter"" because, for those who watched the first film, imagine the male witch expert suddenly becoming the star of the show. Here that male witch expert is modified to be a pseudo-psychologist and doctor. Throughout the film, even upon a second viewing, I'm sitting there wondering why in the world I should care about this man and his lost wife when I should be watching the witches and dancers, after all the title ""Suspiria"" refers to, in this remake, Mother Suspiriorum, one of the Three Mothers.The worst part of this film is its denouement, wherein Suzy Bannion is revealed to be Mother Suspiriorum, or something like that. It was hard to take her seriously when comparing her with the haggard hag with sunglasses and an uncanny sonority. ""I am she,"" says Suzy... Yeah, I'm not buying it, thinks I. The absolute worst part of the film, now viewing it more from a detached and therefore critical position, is when Mother Suspiriorum sits at the doctor's bedside and explains to him how his wife died. Who cares? What are we watching here, a film about witches or a doctor who lost his wife in the war?Most of the music is great, but the reoccurring theme with a male lead singer is cringeworthy and does not match the onscreen action or theme.",Suspiria

Definitely hits that sweet spot for me,10,15 April 2021,Finally a horror remake that isn't afraid to go outside of the box a little. It's so full of little nuances and dichotomies. Equal parts murky and gorgeous. Terrifying and heartfelt. Exquisite and revolting. Builds a world that is both straightforwardly exposited and coherent and still filled with hidden secrets. The dance choreography is incredible. Dakota Johnson is incendiary. The witchy stuff is also presented fairly straightforwardly but it never feels cheesy. It always seems like there's things brewing beneath the surface even as elements are revealed. Tilda Swinton nails everything here. The cinematography and editing are world class. Computerized effects are used sparingly and effectively. The music by Thom Yorke is fantastic. The whole thing pulls you into this occult world without any pretensions. Even thematically I think it's poignant. I can't compare it to the also great original as they're two completely different animals but the feeling captured by this film messes with my brain in a way that few films can. Give it a chance.,Suspiria

285,christianrmaxwell,A Nightmare Shown on Film,10,27 January 2019,"Nightmarish is the perfect word to describe this movie. Reviewing this the day after I watched it, it feels like watching it was part of a fever dream I had or something. It has this unique dreamlike quality to it that is just absolutely mesmerizing. This movie, in short, blew me away. I had read several reviews and heard how amazing this movie was, so I went into watching this with extremely high expectations. Oh boy, it surpassed my expectations by a landslide. This movie, with a run time of two and a half hours, flies by, and I was uncomfortable for every second of it. Every single aspect of this movie aims to make you squirm or shiver with a sense of unease. It does this through the absolutely stunning cinematography, the excellent prosthetic effects, the unique score from Thom Yorke, the excellent acting across the board, and the breathtaking violence. Something that I thought was excellent about this film was the fact that it did not rely on shock factor to reel you in. Keep in mind, I am not saying there is no shock factor, there is PLENTY of that. But to get you engaged in the film and what is happening, the environment of the movie is enough. I would not use the shock factor as a point to tell people to watch this movie, I highly recommend this movie because it is so intoxicating in its atmosphere. While watching this movie, I had experienced something that no other film has ever done to me, which is make me feel like I am going through a living nightmare, and the director was daring me to keep watching. This movie will not be for everyone, it is definitely odd, heavily artsy and influenced by 70s and 80s horror (which I loved), and some people may find that it dragged along in pace. However, I was completely engaged for the entire runtime, I thought every single part of this piece of art was done exceptionally well. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie and now will have to go back and put this near the top of my favorites of 2018 list. I give Suspiria a 10/10 for sure.",Suspiria
286,pjtrekker,Ignore the haters!,10,20 January 2019,"I felt compelled to respond to the haters out there. This is a modern classic. One of the best horror movies ever made. If you do not like to think then this movie is not for you. If you liked the Shining then this movie is for you. It's not as scary as say Hereditary but it is more inventive, more compelling and will haunt you. Every adult should see this movie. If you're sick of the Hollywood typical tripe like the Conjuring, Halloween or terrible found footage films, then see something the likes of which you'll never see again.",Suspiria

Cause Suspiria is just such an excellent horror movie and like nothing I've ever seen before in modern day horror movies. Probably the greatest thing about this movie is the fact that it's not a complete copy of the original Suspiria from 1977, which is what a lot of horror movies, and movies in general do a lot and utterly fail at and completely fall flat on their face, this is a movie that is totally doing its own thing. It's an abstract, horrifying, and impactful horror movie, while I enjoyed the original Suspiria more than this, I love them both for their own reasons. I guess a 10/10 is a proper score in conclusion.",Suspiria

293,juliamacon,Don't Expect the Original,7,30 July 2020,"Though it has essentially the exact same set up as Dario Argento's original masterpiece, this remake wisely opts for a different approach when it comes to all the details. We still have an American dancer coming to Germany in the late 70's to study ballet in a dance school that's a front for a coven of bloodthirsty witches, but everything else from the style, the performances, the gory set pieces, the tone, and the message are completely different.The political backstory is entirely unnecessary and leads to nothing and a subplot involving a psychiatrist whose wife was killed in World War II adds a lot of heart, but can feel meandering at times and like an unwelcome houseguest every time it cuts to him when we'd much rather be learning about the shady underbelly of the dance academy and the relationships between the students and teachers.Besides this, Suspiria is a brave and compelling re-imagining of a horror classic that takes big risks and delivers for more patient viewers expecting more than a simple retread of the original.",Suspiria

Instead, 150 minutes of boredom, anxiety, and attempting to figure out what the heck anyone was saying is what I ended up with.It didn't help that the version I watched on Amazon Prime Video (this is an Amazon Studios production!) didn't properly show subtitles for the German or French spoken after about 10 minutes.

I feel like this movie tries so hard to have some deep meaning to it, but it's just pretentious artsy garbage that hipsters will be into. I was never tense or excited, and in the last half hour the film goes over the top and not in a good way. I would recommend anyone to watch the classic from the 70's and not waste 150 minutes on this bore.

297,danielatala8,Totally enchanting,10,3 February 2019,"Okay so I have seen both movies, and I just think that the hate this movie gets is just so unfair... some people pointing out really dumb flaws calling this piece very unfeministic but I think it's a very powerful and feminist movie in its own right!First things off I think you should watch the original first just to get a feel of the movie, it's a real treat for the senses! And then you go to this movie with new eyes.
What I think this movie triumphs in is the story, where in the original the story is more abstract where we almost get no feel of how the characters in the dance company are (except for Susie of course, however this is the original movie's own point, you're not supposed to know everything) but in this movie everyone is fleshed out, we get a sense of the characters of Pat Hingle (played amazingly by Chloë Grace Moretz), Madame Blanc and all the other residents of the dance company. It even expands on the whole internal struggles of the dance company and the whole mythology of ""The three mothers"" I thought it was brilliant and captivating, I really hope they make a sequel that is amazing, apparently Dario Argento couldn't make good movies out of the whole ""three mothers concept"" after the original Suspiria so I really think they could make it better, if they put the same amount of love and detail to those movies too. Oh and also they put the movie in a Cold War narrative using WWII as one of the background stories, it was great that they explored it. I wasn't a fan of Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name mainly because it was so empty and vapid but here everything just oozes with character and narrative - the length of the movie is totally understandable, I didn't feel bored at all... in fact I thought that it was gonna be very boring because of the colours etc...I think the whole colour swap to more ""earthen"" tones is brilliant, not only does it give the movie a new look but also a new style... and hey, it looks so vibrant too in its own way. In fact the movie does give a homage to the original's very very beautiful colours in its dream sequences.The music... oh the music is something special, just as classic as the Goblins score in the original in my opinion- it uses synthy ambience and drones, lonely piano ballads and more!The horror... well it's scary, it's very ""body horror"" and I think it's more impacting than the original which had like 4 scary scenes? I wouldn't recommend this to someone who gets scared easily or someone who just hates seeing the human body getting contorted and rotted etc.What I also love about this movie is the sheer internationality of it all, people talk everything from German to French and English... which feels so amazing, it was nice to see that English is not the dominant language- in fact it was great to see Tilda Swinton speak like a native German speaker and French, so cool!The acting is on point, goddamn the performances are amazing! I was surprised to see Dakota Johnson doing so well, also Mia Goth, Tilda Swinton who's as radiant as ever, shame she didn't get an Oscar nomination for this movie. Was nice to see Sylvie Testud as well, she's great!The only criticism I have of this film is that the blood effects are kind of cheap looking? They just look very digital and cgi, I wish they would have done something else technically with the blood effects... I think it kind of ruined the art of the movie as well which was so high quality overall.Anyways, my recommendation is that you watch this one with open eyes and just try to get yourself immersed in this intoxicating and scary world. You'll see what a work of art it is, horror is high art!",Suspiria

No masterpiece but so wasn't the original Suspiria. Those who dwell in sweet memories I recommend to watched that again. The original strongly lacked in actors, story telling and logic but was strong in atmosphere, light composition and sound.
This movie here reproduce the atmosphere well. Actors, story and logic is more on the average side but definitely an improvement to the old and beside of this to all movies by Argento...well, he had other strong points.

300,Showho,Educating Splatter Lovers Can Be Fun!,8,19 January 2019,"Given Dario Argento's abysmal track record to produce anything of merit in the last 25 years or more, it's sad he seems so willing to go to the mat against director Luca Guadagnino's EPIC retelling of Suspiria. If that's actually how Argento feels I'll wager he may be insecure now because someone took his films threadbare plot, and visually opulent gore-fest and put some REAL meat on its bones. It's laughable how the word 'pretentious' keeps getting thrown around here. Is it because the remake sports a phenomenally gifted arsenal of female Thespians, admirably elevating an intelligent, meticulously crafted script that actually EXPLORES the world of dance, as well as other cultural/societal/oppressive ills in a way the other never attempted to do? Then SO BE IT. Well written scripts are not by definition pretentious. They can however challenge AN INTELLIGENT viewer to stretch their mental boundaries a bit. Argento didn't need to do that because that's not where his passions were, the fact someone now has is a credit to the subject matter, and the legacy of the original - even if they appeal to a markedly different type of audience.

There was also some really squirm-inducing, grisly action - different from the original film, but serving the same purpose.But then this all went nowhere. I suspect that the writer didn't really know how to wrap things up, so they simply tried to overpower the viewer with visuals. But sometimes more is less.

309,scarredpariah,An uneven movement with some delicious morsels,7,2 March 2019,"Suspiria, like Black Swan, paints another warning about the apparently extreme dangers that face anyone attending an acclaimed dance school. But while Black Swan focused on the dancers and built layers of tension from this, Suspiria opts for a broader view, sacrificing some impact in the process.Like the much-maligned Mother! this film attempts to deliver a strong message, with heavy comparisons between the dance school and the external politics of 1977 Berlin. However, in doing so, it further splits its time between the dancers, their teachers, citizens outside the school, and the city itself. Rather than reinforcing the dance drama, this can distract from it, especially when some sequences have to be explained through exposition rather than being inferred. But while Mother! began with a slow pace, then quickened into a glorious, feverish nightmare, Suspiria has an uneven pace throughout, often dropping back to a meandering totter instead of pulling forward.The film hooks in the viewer with the feel of an investigative mystery, but as the focus splits, characters are left trudging about for clues long after the audience has already been made aware of them. All the time devoted to uncovering a mystery that has already been revealed feels rather redundant, and doesn't do the pace any favors.The tone of the film also feels uneven. There are several strong horror scenes but the connecting drama lacks sufficient tension and foreboding necessary to build an effective horror atmosphere, so despite some captivating visuals, it doesn't deliver in the way that films like Hereditary and The Witch do. Looking further back, Possession (1981) demonstrated far more effectively how to meld horror with politics in a divided Berlin.Despite its flaws, Suspiria delivers its own evocative witch lore, hinting at some curious ideas about magic, and melds an engaging supernatural element with the art of dance. While not altogether successful in its attempt to take a more challenging direction than the original, the cinematography, mise-en-scene, and some of the performances are strong, even if the structure is not.",Suspiria

311,bardavidi,Not a remake and not a horror film,6,30 October 2018,"As an original dance film it is beautiful.
As a remake to Argento's film, it adds where it needs no adding (Susie's back story) and fails to create a solid and consistant visual througout and instead jumps between dream sequence and long tracking shots of walking in east Berlin.Acting-wise Johnson has to share most of her scenes which is unusual for a lead. Tilda Swinton doesn't have bad roles but ironically she is not used enough (she IS playing 3 roles) and her 'mothering' scenes of Susie could have been a great theme for a movie that attempts to explore the idea of motherhood on so many levels - but they are too disjointed in the narrative to form a statement that the movie is trying to convey.There is enough terror in being a women in this world both in Berlin's 1977 and today, why the director felt he had to transfer the weight of the lead to the story of an old male character losing his wife in WWII is perhaps what's truely bizzare here.",Suspiria
312,raforehand,I wanted to like it more,5,17 January 2021,"I really wanted to give it a fair try. Unfortunately for me, it wasn't particularly scary. Outside perhaps two scenes, there wasn't much really making this feel weird or creepy. I get that the original didn't necessarily flesh out many of the characters, but from a certain point of view, that wasn't necessary. The original had a pervasive atmosphere of dread, terror, and truly horrifying moments built to a crescendo off the phenomenal soundtrack from Goblin.This new interpretation, while having amazing artistic design, sets, and some great performances from Tilda Swinton, didn't really feel like it was building up atmosphere. Much of the unknown factors of the dance school are presented obliquely from the beginning, robbing the audience of that wonderful fear of the unknown. Admittedly, I personally am not a fan of Thom Yorke, so his work on the soundtrack for this felt out of place for me and really never built up the tension and dread throughout the film.As I mentioned, the film does flesh out the characters more, but it also adds in some additional storylines and side stories that felt somewhat disconnected from the overall narrative and seemed somewhat unnecessary (not to say they were bad, just they felt out of place and almost like a separate film within the film).Being honest, I tried to separate myself from the original before watching, because I knew if I clung too much to that I wouldn't give this a fair shake, but even then I found myself mostly just sort of forcing myself to finish watching it just so I could say I watched it.I really wish I could say I enjoyed it more, but I just can't.

314,chazthegamr,"Suspiria kinetically glimmers, but unfortunately trips and clumsily falls in its climax. Still that kinetic energy has cast a spell which I am still under.",8,9 October 2018,"My Full Review is on Letterboxd account 'CharlesJimenez'.Suspiria has been a film I've been looking forward to for a while, and it wasn't until today (4th October) at the Sitges Film Festival that I watched one of my most anticipated films of the year.The trailer was wonderful, the reception was intriguing, and the reported intentions of the film seemed fantastic - an arthouse slowburner film was definitely up my alley. I was especially excited for this film for my thoughts on the original. For me, the original Suspiria was enjoyable, although only due to its visuals and audio. Because those two aspects weren't at the forefront of the films' focus, I couldn't forgive the film for its comparably weak story, acting, and dialogue. It's a problem I have with every Giallo film I've seen, so I had expectations for something completely different, and hoped that it would deliver. Those three aspects could easily be expanded upon from a director like this.And I thought that for the most part, I may have liked this more than the original. As the film opened with its spine-chilling synth music and its stylized titles my excitement grew. It seemed as if the people involved knew what they were doing and seemingly propelled in that factor. That was until the films' climax. Although before I express my shock at the level of quality presented in that climax, I would like to explore what I enjoyed, as well as some thoughts on many notable aspects.I really liked this film visually, it may have not been the iconic fairytale-like beauty presented in the original, but this film does a fine job of covering that up with a polished 70's film look; everything looked very polished, there was an emphasis on dim reds and browns, and they all evoked a sense of being trapped in the past. Being one who has seen many tributes to the past with a faux film-look, it was nice to see another addition that perfectly replicated the style of its era. In-correspondence with these polished visuals are the meticulous and effective uses of cinematography. This film has many panning shots and zooms that feel like they're an ode to the pans and zooms in The Shining. Although this film more effectively uses them to reflect its emotion. It had a sort of Wes Anderson feel to them, in that they all worked to benefit the style.My only problem with the visuals is that this style of cinematography doesn't take reign of most scenes as it did for some. Most of the shots are very standard, but those angels and pans stood out whenever they were used.In terms of the dialogue and acting, I found that everyone did a fine job with the material they were given. The few that really stood out were Dakota Johnson, Mia Goth and Tilda Swindon.I was a little concerned when reading that Dakota Johnson would be playing Susie, but for the most part she was very solid. In-fact, I thought that she was very good. She wasn't so much of a concerned and vulnerable audience character as she was in the original. In this film she's an ambiguous and committed character. She seems quite devoted to her role as a dancer, but you feel as if she could be evil.In my opinion It wasn't until there was a different direction in her character that the sound of her voice did not work to the films' advantage - more on that once I dive into the climax.In terms of Johnson's presence as a whole there were moments were you could sense unintentional goofs. One of them being the receding hairline which was randomly present in one shot.I would quickly like to address Tilda Swindon as the old man and Madame Blanc. No, there is not a reveal that these two characters are the same as some reviews may imply. I feel that it's important to note this, as I frequently had an expectation that this dumb reveal would occur, and so I was too distracted by that to look at the character from the intended perspective.Aside from that, Tilda Swindon was fantastic as usual. Despite it being very apparent that Dr. Jacob was played by Tilda Swindon, at times the character was so well-acted that I actually found it quite debatable as to whether Dr. Jacob was played by Tilda Swindon.Mia Goth really stood out to me as someone who manifests very subtle idiosyncratic features. She almost reminds me of Shelley Duvall from 3 Women. In most of the films she's in, her performance is very lowered. So it was surprising to see her reflect the grim situations she's put in.I was excited to read that Thom Yorke would be involved in making the films' soundtrack, mainly due to what I heard in the trailer. And despite loving how the soundtrack complimented the atmosphere of the film, there were a couple of tracks which didn't match the tone of the film at all. One of them being the track used when Susie jumps in the air, it sounded a lot like the buildup to a dubstep track. And being a film set in the 70's it just felt very jarring.Despite that, none of the track placements were as detrimental to the tone as much as the inappropriate track used in the final act of the film.It was almost laughable at how inappropriate the tone of the song felt with the mood of the scene. From memory, it is a song about becoming born. It's a soft song with lyrics about transgressing, obviously being a needle drop for the scene. It would be fine if this song was used in the credits, but the film clearly wants you to be scared by what you're seeing, so a soft lyrical song just ruins that tone, as it is simply two separate tones which don't merge. Considering that juxtaposing a light from a dark tone is such a staple in Horror, you'd expect this to be the intention, but surprisingly it didn't feel that way at all. It was almost as inappropriate as the soundtrack in the Amazing Spider-Man 2.And this inappropriately placed song is only the first problem with what I saw as the films' breaking point. Suspiria has perhaps the most detrimental final act I've seen in a film this year.Throughout Suspiria, the film deliberately established a very grounded yet ambiguous tone, you never knew if there was something about to spring up, and when it did, it was more shocking than anything you would've expected. This small but effective atmosphere helped evoke a sense of unease and mystery, as from the beginning you weren't even sure if this film was even going to be a Horror film. That was until its disturbingly macabre dance scene (which everyone applauded at in my screening, which made me laugh due to how disturbing the scene was) but this scene and its other horrific scenes worked due to the aforementioned grounded tone, as it juxtaposed what we were expecting.Really, the final act should've been the cherry ontop for that tone, it took the exact same approach, it again chooses to shock the audience with another scene which juxtaposes the style.However, instead of being grounded, the act chooses to go completely insane. And I usually love films which do this, Possession, mother!, and even Climax are fine instances of a deliberately absurd ending which evokes both fear and amusement. Although what worked about the absurdist tones of those films were that their inevitable climax felt like a natural progression.For some reason this film just fails so hard at trying to execute that absurdity, because it doesn't seem to understand how to pursue its insanity within a way which works within the establishments. Unfortunately, t was difficult to take the film seriously after that scene. As everything just became so unintentionally incredibly silly and poorly executed, in a previously well-executed and serious film.The climax wants to be a horrific bloodbath, but the gore is so unintentionally comical that it only made the scene baffling and funny. The hyperbolic and bombastic sound effects used and the amount of blood just made it seem as if I was watching black comedy. We're literally seeing heads blow up, Tilda Swinton's neck blows up, and one of the witches attempts to put her head back together, but then clumsily drops it. It was so silly that it made me and the audience laugh. Which is never a good sign, especially for a film that takes itself seriously.To my surprise, the film starts using CGI gore which has always proved to be troublesome with most films, and with this film it was no different. As Swinton's neck blows open, out pours fake digital paint. Those really impressive practical effects which were present before, are now gone. And this artificiality along with the cheesy tone and gore made it seem as if the film was trying to be like an action film with a frame rate similar to that of the telephone scene from Hausu. Meanwhile, some of the most pretentiously funny dialogue is being shouted, one of the lines from the film is seriously 'It's not vanity, it's Art!'. I felt as if I was watching a joke.So, Susie is now an incarnation of darkness, but she seems to act as if she doesn't reign over anyone. Making her transformation very in-convincing to me. She then gains the ability to kiss people to death, and it's shown in a similar vain to the hilariously absurd ending of Zardoz. People just die without any weight, and it's all the more comical due to this. Back to the heads exploding, there's also poorly spliced in footage of each character repeating 'Markus' after the film cuts back to show their heads comically blowing up with poor CGI gore.This film also decides to place a blood tinted filter ontop of the footage, which seems like a good idea. But this overlay was so dark that you could barely make out some of the details. It felt as if this climax was made by a student. And I'm honestly surprised that not many have spoken about this ending yet. Although I am certain that many will be just as confused as I am. But hey, if this climax works for you, all the more to you.In-fact, on paper this climax sounds absolutely fantastic. And the way that the climax was executed honestly felt like a nightmare you'd actually have..",Suspiria

Victims are killed through the magical power of dance/music, rather than by a satanic 'serial-killer' (like in the original). No attempt is made to update Dario Argento's extraordinary use of colour and expressionist soundtrack for the digital age (this remake employs a muted palette and Thom Yorke's discreet score instead). 'Suzy' is no longer a clear moral centre for the story - which was, originally, a kind-of adult fairy-tale. This leads to a collapse, in the last third of the picture, into incoherence, with a risible ending. Very flawed.",Suspiria
317,pcytoman,"Arthouse horror that delivers creepy visuals, but overburdened with subplots",6,6 November 2018,"Suspiria is an arthouse horror movie that will definitely divide audiences. The film does have creepy visuals and a few scenes of body horror. The pace of the film is rather slow at times. I felt they could have edited out some subplots/scenes that didn't add to the story and trimmed the run time of the movie. The subplot of the psychotherapist looking for his wife didn't add anything to the movie. One of the matrons commits suicide without explanation. The film kept showing news clips of a hijacking of a Lufthansa flight and left wing terrorist bombings. These details don't add to the central story of witchcraft at the Markos dance academy. Is the screenwriter trying to go for a metaphor between external events and what is happening inside the dance school? If so, it didn't really gel for me.However, I can appreciate the fact the director and producers made a film that stands on its own from the original Suspiria. Kudos to that!",Suspiria

I would not be surprised if the shinning would get the same amount of naysayers had IMDb been around back then. The truth is this film will grow stronger with time and eventually be seen by many as what it is a Horror Masterpiece.
Easily one of the best horror remakes I have ever seen. I really didnt know what to think when I heard the classic psychedelic horror film Suspira was being remade. I just remembering hoping they wouldn't mess it up... and yeah They definitely didnt. The look and feel and directing was masterfully done. Very reminiscent of Dario argento's style and aesthetic. You could definitely tell the director was respectfully paying homage to the master Italian horror directors biggest achievement.It was mysterious, creepy, sexy, and yes horrific. That climax whoo baby. Yes Please!Love what they did to the story kept true to the original by holding onto the mystery card. But did something different and refreshing. Right amount of blood and horrific imagery and great cast. This is how horror should be done folks, giving us something we haven't seen a hundred times over.",Suspiria
319,phillipbrowning,"Strange, Brooding Horror Epic",9,7 February 2019,"Let's face it, remakes almost always work people up into a tizzy. I mean look at all the low scores attached with angry super-fan rants, condemning this picture for the audacity to even try to remake such a beloved cult classic... and only strengthening their outrage and argument, Dario Argento himself blasted the remake ( even before production got underway) after the film was shown. To that I say please take note of Stephen king's dismay over Stanely Kubrick's film adaptation of the Shinning. Creative people/ artists are very protective of their creations so using Dario's dismissal of the movie as a main talking point in the argument as to why the remake wasn't good doesn't convince me. I will admit however, that I felt a little queasy at the news of someone remaking the film. I just wasn't sure how it would go or even live up to the original, but then I saw it.Wow, this movie knocked me flat. The weird strangeness of this film just kept building and building until the grand horrifying finale, to which I wont give away here. The movie aside from the ambiguous opening scene of an older woman on her death bed, begins with a shy but excited beautiful young woman making it to Cold war era Berlin (1977) to attend an exclusive world renown dance company. From the moment she walks in she has a feeling she cant quite explain and the eerieness ensues from that moment on. The older Women who run the place we soon see are up to no good and become completely menacing as time goes by. A doctor elsewhere in Berlin becomes aware of some strange goings on over at the dance studio by his visits with a young woman named Patricia who formerly attended the group along with many other young ladies. She seems frantic, paranoid and maybe delusional. She talks of some conspiracy over there and claims the older women running the company are witches! When she goes missing the Doctor informs the police but when no one seems to take it as seriously as him he starts poking around himself and the strange mystery slowly starts to unfold. All the while our young main charecter starts to fall under some kind of insidious influence.Big marks for the actors. Dakota Johnson as the lead role is really spectacular. Tilda Swinton as Miss Blanc and another double role I wont get into here is just so much fun to watch, she really is a master. Last but not least the supporting cast was great and that's not an understatement, no one felt out of place everyone elevated the experience, most especially the older witches ahem I mean women. They were so freaking creepy, funny, and down right treacherous.Overall I cant stop thinking about this movie after watching it, I know I mentioned Kubrick above earlier but I just love it when talented visionary directors throw their hat in the horror arena. It gives the viewer something different and fresh in a genre that's oversaturated with redundancies; jump scares, screaming co-ed's, blood, guts, rinse and repeat. Watching this movie brought back feelings of watching rare 70s horror movie gems, they totally got the period right the sets were amazing. It's a weird moody picture that I know not everyone will love and maybe I'm just a sucker for movies that deal in the occult ( which btw this movie dealt with the subject subperbly) but I felt that this movie did its job not only did it intrigue and entertain it left me wanting more in a good way like I wanna watch it another 2 or 3 times to catch things I might of missed.In closing I'll say yes I know this movie was different from the original and strayed away from the source material but so what? Did everyone who loved the classic want to see a paint by numbers horror remake? No offense Gus Van Zandt( see psycho remake) They didnt go with the original mystery from the 77 version in this film- they created another, which I thoroughly appreciated, who wants to see the same thing twice?Overall, time will tell, and I suggest to anyone curious to see for themselves and dont listen to the naysayers cuz this lil horror freak loved it. Big thumbs up for freaky psycho sexual supernatural horror!",Suspiria

After one single viewing, my jaw was dropped, my senses had been destroyed and assaulted and I was in awe. Make no mistake, this film is a true assault and is brutal and abrasive, but despite the harshness of the film, it brings you back, letting you digest and take in what you have seen. This film's cinematography is similar to true 1970s horror; (think the exorcist meets the original planet of the apes). dizzy zoom-ins, focusing from image to the next, grasping the storyline, and processing the imagery was exciting. This is a new brand of horror that the public didn't know they needed. This will not be the acclaimed horror film of the yr, but it will be a diamond in the rough, a rough thrilling ride, this is a shake to the previously nulled, lazy horror films of the modern age. The actresses excelled in this film, each adding their own to this beautiful nightmare.

Ended up with loads of disconnected threads not being drawn together and an all-pervading whiff of pretentiousness.

326,martinejohanna,visual and symbolic feast,9,25 April 2019,"I'm never too much into remakes, however this film stands on its own quite well and can be considered as an art house film. Luca Guadagnino and David Kajganich did a great job, they extended the original storyline with more context and added another parallel storyline that gave the whole a bit more body. Allthough this sometimes feels forced and makes the film a bit thick like overstuffed soup. So is this a film for everyone? No, it will be quite a slow-burner for those who are into simple strong plots, quick gratification and action. It is layered, theatrical and heavy with symbolism, female mystique, motherhood and drama. Besides that the art direction is stunning and a visual feast, camerawork and composition are both very strong. Casting is surprising but works, impressive role by Dakota Johnsson who studied modern dance a year for this role, Tilda Swinton as Dr. Josef is less convincing but as Madame Blanc and Mother Helena Markos excels. Choreography by Damien Jalet is over-all strong but not spectacular. The musical score composed by Radiohead singer Thom Yorke feels often somewhat misplaced and counterintuitive to the scenes, but as a record by itself a must-have. So if you are into all of the above go and see it.",Suspiria
327,marshalsea-547-992254,"Not A Perfect Remake, But A Good Film",8,2 August 2021,"There's a lot of people complaining about how this isn't Argento's ""Suspiria"", well er... no it's not... and no it shouldn't be. It's based on it and it has the same story and overall structure. Ignore these naysayers they are the one's with the problem with their silly malformed expectations, and they have annoyed me enough that I felt compelled to write this.So, for all the people disrespecting a genuinely good piece of work, done here by Luca Guadagnino and the various team members have done here I simply do not understand what they expected? A scene by scene refilming? Go away you fools! You've already got the original, and this gives you something else - a more cohesive narrative.The Top Review on here is written by someone young and in a state of fanatasism only the young can have for old things they don't actually understand, caught up in others beliefs. It's all hyperbole, shouting, with no actual critical analysis... groan, grow up. This is not someone who has grown with Suspiria over the years and recognises its flaws: it's not the perfect horror film some think it is - it's a clunky 70s horror film with some brilliant set pieces, it stands up because so many of the other horror films were so weak. There's also a cry of this isn't Giallo... well, ticks all the major boxes: investigator, mystery, slasher, horror but visceral and pyschological... so how is this not giallo? What did you want, more nakedness? Well... hate to inform you but we've moved on somewhat in the last 40 years. It's ok, it's just an ill-informed, wrong, and stompy stompy stompy spoilt child review. Anyway, enough of correcting the poor review.This remake/reimagining follows the same structure/story of the original - there's some absolutely brilliant set pieces, and it follows the same basic story: a dancer joins a Berlin school and oh it turns out that all isn't what it seems behind the scenes... how far away is this from Suspiria? Well... if you listen to some of the raging horde on here you'd think it was an entirely different story - it's not: it's the same story, told by someone different and I believe very well told. There's tension, release, misdirection, and yes - character development, and also one of the stand out moments of 2010's horror - I defy anyone not to cringe (apart from the sadists grinning like idiots).The acting sets and designs are great - the acting top notch. To think that's Dakota Johnson from the abysmal 50 Shades series - someone many of us had written off - her portrayal here is great, bearing in mind she's on screen with some of the greats Tilda Swinton (supreme!) and Angela Winkler amongst many other established actors. Dakota's dancing stands up whilst on screen with professional dancers. Good on her!Elsewhere, during the mystery parts there's genuinely creepy moments in the film, and there's a lot more cohesion to the plot here - and the so called ""dream state"" of the original gone (largely having watched all Argento films including the latter awful and decidedly questionable ones (Stendhal I'm looking at you) I suspect either the responsibilty of the Editor, or just a total mistake), and replaced with an attempt at actual realistic dream state. This is researched stuff.Thom Yorke's OST is brilliant and thankfully none of the ""lah lah lah lah scary children"" things gone, but hey each to their own. Some people like gauche tack, some of us prefer art.Go into this with a brain, without wanting the same film rehashed and you'll enjoy it.",Suspiria
328,christophe_vdh,Not a remake...,6,24 February 2019,"The original is a silly horror full of atmospheric suspense and bright colouring. This film is just boring gore with no atmospheric suspense and mostly grey and bleak colouring.
The original had some poor acting and scripting and never took itself seriously. This one takes itself very seriously and tries to tackle themes such as Cold War and WW 2 trauma, none make any useful contribution to the film. There is no need for this contrast.
I think the people involved (director, to name one) shouldn't attempt to make a horror film, especially not an Argento remake.

At this point I won't bother figuring that out.Witches running a dance academy seems to be the only thing the 1977 and 2018 version have in common. Maybe there's more things they have in common but I would catch myself nodding off. Some people are saying if you enjoyed ""The Shining"" you will enjoy this movie. I'm sorry, but NO.

330,elliot-75668,Non-remake remake is too long,6,3 December 2018,"Dario Argento's Suspiria is a gory classic with the most incredible colour palettes to ever grace a horror film. It's brisk running time, corny script and iconic score only adds to the film's everlasting legacy. So, when it was announced that the 1977 classic would be remade there were murmurings of discontent among horror aficionados who wondered if anything sacred was safe from the evils of a remake? Then Luca Guadagnino announced himself as director and, following the success of A Bigger Splash and Call Me By Your Name, people were curious.
You can call the 2018 film a remake but in truth the film's similarities start and end at the characters and basic plot, therefore making it an entirely different beast. Clocking in at 155 minutes the film is almost an entire hour longer than the 1977 original and it does suffer from its bloated running time. The film's bloated running time is in part due to the pollical subtext. The film is set in 1977 (the year the original was released) and deals with themes of national guilt in a divided Berlin (the dance school is situated right next to the Berlin Wall).This is all sounds very interesting, and does create an interesting back drop, but it doesn't really say anything new about the era. The film hints that blame should be laid at those in power rather than those who witnessed what happened but did nothing. This is hardly a new way of thinking, so it ends up being rather pointless and unnecessarily distraction from the tense story of witches harvesting young dancers for consumption by the mother witch.What is also is a major drawback with the national guilt theme is that it's incredibly distracting watching the film with the knowledge that Dr. Josef Klemperer is Tilda Swinton dressed up in old man prosthetics. It's distracting because it feels like a superficial piece of stunt casting. Swinton said this was ""only a little bit of fun"" but this ""little bit of fun"" was nothing more than a vanity project that completely derailed a potentially interesting subplot. This all is just because I couldn't take Tilda Swinton parading around in poor prosthetics equipped with a heavy German accent seriously. On the plus side, Swinton is superb as Madame Blanc and Dakota Johnson's performance has tremendous physicality (her dancing showed great dedication to the role), but the slow delivery of her lines becomes grating.What's most different about the 1977 Suspiria and the 2018 Suspiria is that the latter isn't a horror in the same way the 1977 film is, but the 2018 film still mostly fails on the basics of the genre. The film's length hampers the tension because the film's bagginess does not allow the tension to be sustained throughout. That said, there are a few scenes that are deeply horrifying, most notably the dancing sequence where a spell is cast upon Susie which contorts a fellow dancer's body to mirror Susie's dance moves. Criminally, despite all the weirdness on show and a climax that resembles something from the movie Climax, the film forgets to be scary but maybe it wasnt trying to be (in the traditional sense at least).Despite being long, baggy and bizarrely paced the film isn't boring, visually it's too well made and enticing to be boring. It's certainly luxurious and beautifully made (even if the colour palette is the opposite of the 1977 original). The dance scenes are edited with an intoxicating excitement, almost as though a spell is cast upon you. The makeup effects are beautifully disgusting and the film appealingly gory, but the film is too long and too baggy to sustain the tension.",Suspiria

I expected more of a suspense horror movie but until the end there are some really gruesome and even splatter-like scenes. (Two people next to us left the Cinema and I was glad i didnt go alone to the cinema) thought it just wanted to shock towards the end. This put me off quite a bit. Staccato-like pictures in red didn't fit to the other scenes. I appreciate though the retro feel and colors of the cinematography throughout the rest of the movie. Architecture costumes where also good. And the music was great. Some figures might have been created rather with prosthetics than CGI and sometimes that made them seem almost ridiculous.
The Story:
Starts out intresting but seems to go nowhere. It feels like there are too many elements and topics mixed together like too many ingredients in a magic potion - so alltogether not really digestable and no resolution. Sometimes it felt like mixed together tableau vivants one after another and maybe there were too many characters.
I felt there was some romantic element missing and there would have been space for some (at least light) homoerotic scenes in an all female dancing ensemble.
The Acting:
I liked Ms. Swintons and really liked Mia Goth. Her face with that Make-up was perfect retro-chic and she could really transmit her anxiety.
I expected more from Ms. Johnson because I like her but I feel her figure was drawn very one-sided and didn't develop too much. Also her hair looked like a wig.",Suspiria
334,7DeadlyThings,7 Deadly Responses on Seeing the new Suspiria,8,2 September 2018,"1. Suspiria is gonna be divisiveLike last year's mother! by Darren Aronofsky, Suspiria has already divided audiences at this year's Venice Film Festival. Whilst I clapped my palms off once the credits rolled an irate audience member beside me booed furiously (we exchanged disapproving glances). The Guardian has reported that ""it fails to bewitch,"" but I beg to differ.2. Some scenes in Suspiria are spectacularly scaryLucky for us the talented directer Luca Guadagnino (Call Me By Your Name, A Bigger Splash) and smart screenwriter David Kajganich have taken this spooky subject matter very seriously. The result is some prima orrore assoluta - particularly the shocking sequence where some ubiquitous evil forces choreograph an ill-fated dance student into a très grave finale.3. This Suspiria is not a remakeYou don't need to have seen the original to enjoy this movie (although I'd highly recommend that you do). It's much more of a reimagining of Argento's dream-tale than a remake. Guadagnino intertwines German politics and terrorism - the film is set in 1977 (the year the original was unleashed) Berlin. Plus lead character Susie gets a much meatier backstory. And dancing, there's a lot more dancing.4. Original Suspiria star Jessica Harper pops upHaving deliberately avoided any media about the movie to go in knowing nothing it was a pleasant surprise to see Jessica Harper make an appearance. Harper played the title role of Susie in Argento's version and with Guadagnino being Argento's biggest fan, and good pal, this cameo was a nice nod to the original and the fans.5. The performances in Suspiria are spellbindingDakota Johnson is enchanting as the elite ballet dancer; Tilda Swinton is captivating, of course, as the mysterious headmistress; yet it was rising star Mia Goth's performance that did it for me. Chloë Grace Moretz along with the other fellow students are very good, as are the teachers (or coven of witches) at Tanz Dance School.6. Swindled by Swinton?An IMDb profile of Lutz Ebersdorf cites Suspiria as his only acting credit. However, there is growing speculation that it is in fact Tilda Swinton playing the role of psychoanalyst Josef Klemperer. During the press conference when Swinton was asked what it was like playing the two roles she replied, ""what two roles?"" followed by a wink. She even read out a letter from Klemperer excusing his absence from the panel.7. Thom Yorke scores with the Suspiria soundtrackThe soundtrack to the original Suspiria is legendary. Italian band Goblin composed it working closely with Argento through production. This time, Guadagnino called upon Radiohead's Thom Yorke to bring the magic, and he doesn't disappoint. The music is definitely more mellow than it's predecessor but suits the autumnal tone of the film.",Suspiria

We know. You don't get it. You don't get most things in life and that's why you're always angry and slightly drunk. Maybe let the adults talk for a while ok champ? This is NOT a remake in a beat the dead horse sense of the word. It truly is a reimagining.

The Argento original is an amazing film and one of my personal favorites and I honestly may like this as much if not more. I don't won't to give away spoilers, just know that seeing the original in no way prepares you for this. As I said they are quite different flims but both fantastic in their own right.

336,byzantineiconoclast,Neither worse or better than the original-just different,8,21 September 2019,"In all the film remakes I have watched, I've tried to keep an open mind, and think of the remake as a completely irrelevant movie from the original. This tactic certainly paid off in Suspiria (2018). I belong among the very few-judging from the reviews here- that thoroughly enjoyed it. It helped that I am not the greatest fan of the original- I found it loud, chaotic and overwhelming-and not in a good way. Certainly I recognize its genius, but it is not a movie I can look forward to watching often.
So, is the remake better? No. Is it worse? No. It is just different. Where the original choked you (and shocked you) with the loud, sinister music and the garish colors, the remake, with its bland palette ,the gloomy Berlin atmosphere and the almost constant rain or snow, is like a creeping terror, lurking just outside of your view, until it strikes.
I liked this new atmosphere better. And, feel free to bash me for this, but I liked the new story better too. It didn't make much sense, but then neither did the original story.
It all boils down to a matter of preference, whether you like this movie or not. people who prefer Argento's brilliant, but sometimes over-extravagant style, will probably not like the remake. People like me, who like a more subdued, quiet style will probably like it. As I said in the beginning, if you manage to regard it as a completely different story, the movie stands very well on its own.
A quick final note: the atmosphere, clothing, behaviors etc. were spot on for the '70s- I was glad watching people smoke freely in a dance class no less! Nowadays, they would probably end up in jail for this. The acting, while being solid, is nothing exceptional, except of course of Mrs. Swindon, who continues to amaze me in every role. She was very-very good.
Overall, I am glad I watched it, and I will certainly watch it again. Please give it a try.",Suspiria
337,ssrw-34960,Not what you expect,10,25 February 2020,"A lot of bad reviews on here probably from those expecting a copy of the original. I personally didn't want a copy (what's the point in that?), the original had a chilling score and beautiful visuals but wasn't all that scary. They say this movie is an art scene but in my opinion, the original focuses more on art as it does actual horror. This Suspiria delves more into the coven of witches and the substance you would want from a so called horror movie. I am a massive horror fan but I pick what I watch wisely as the horror genre as a whole is only 25% good. If you want substance then watch this film, if you want cheap jump scares, lack of story and crappy Hollywood types then look elsewhere.",Suspiria
338,AlexPechlivanidis,Uncompromising Vision,8,10 March 2019,It goes on a different direction than the original while also respecting it. The dancing is exceptional and the film is visually stunning. Tilda Swinton is delightful but it's Dakota Johnson who steals the show. Great acting and dancing. Didn't expect that from the Fifty Shades of Grey actress. The film can get slow at times or confuse you if you don't pay attention because It's more interested in evoking emotions. If you like gory mysterious films about the occult and powerful witches definitely see it. Also make sure you're not eating when watching it.,Suspiria

If you expect a classic horror movie ""american style"" you will be disappointed, but if you are looking for an adult horror movie then this one is for you.
Everyone talking about the last 20 minutes.... well, last 20 minuts must be considered and evaluated in the totality of the work of Guadagnino, as his own personal touch.

I laughed, I cringed, I was surprised that no one on the set stopped during the filming of the last 30 minutes and say, ""Maybe this is a little too much""... the choreography was primal and intense... I also laughed out loud through it. The performances are sexual and fierce and also remind me of the wives in Manos The Hands of Fate. Vanity oozes off the screen, and so do the great practical special effects.",Suspiria

344,agexien,"Deep, mysterious and mesmerizing",10,14 January 2019,"The film is so mesmerizing that it can literally put you in a state of ecstatic trance. To me, it's a rare case of a pure audio-visual drug with multiple layers of subtle subplots, deep meanings and unexpected twists. However, it must be noted that this movie can be appreciated only by aesthetically developed viewers with fondness and understanding of European culture. If you're a lover of cheap, basic and derivative American gore horrors with zero substance (like those who left so many negative reviews), you'll be probably dissapointed by this chef-d'oeuvre.DISCLAIMER: I can't be completely objective though because the movie ticked too many boxes for me as if it were created with me in mind. Specifically, I have a great affection for the following things: Tilda Swinton, Berlin, this particular historic period of Germany, English-German-French language mix in movies (you won't find many movies where leads speak long lines in perfect foreign language), occultism, secret societies, alchemist symbolism, trippy music, elaborate cinematography, exquisite atmosphere and strong leading female characters.",Suspiria

Not today... while watching this boring piece of crap for 2 1/2 hours I felt like time wasn't moving. Several plot elements including a holocaust survivor and terrorism go nowhere and lengthen the movie by over an hour. The dance sequences reminded me of Staying Alive in the way that the director doesn't really understand the art form. The plot? Who knows and who cares. Near the end, I was just happy it was finally over.On the plus side, the film has lots of atmosphere taking place in 1977 Germany, but that's about it on the positives. A film needs to be a lot more than great cinematography, it needs to tell a engaging and compelling story.",Suspiria

Did they really think a filmmaker as interest as Guadagnino would be content to just do a remake?Dakota Johnson is stunning. Choreography downright disturbing. Gorgeous, creepy score by Thom Yorke. Genuinely repulsive, dream-like imagery. Cool setting in Cold War Berlin. Great friendship chemistry between the two female leads. Overall a stomach-turning feast for the senses. I didnt find it to be as confusing as the reviews made it seem. The plot may be a bit predictable, but this is a film about a creeping sense of dread and the almost inevitability of sacrifice and the succession of power, not whether good or evil will win out.On the downside, even I have to admit the ending goes completely over the top, and the story of the old man and his wife either takes up too much time or isn't developed enough for us to really care like we do about the girls at the dance school.",Suspiria

He applies his flair for melodrama to the horror genre, which I rarely watch admittedly, with aplomb. It's really confident filmmaking, which has polarized fans of the original, which I have never seen, admittedly. But like all his films, it gives you a heightened vibe and tone and photography and editing style. And The 70s film vibe hasn't been so well-realised since...the 70s... or maybe The Love Witch. For Suspiria, the film craft is at a massively high level. The choreography is next-level. And Tilda Swinton's multi-performances are brilliant. I'll admit some of the digi felt out of place near the end of the film, but perhaps some of these 1-star hater-reviewers should try to make a film and see how easy it is...",Suspiria

If you enjoy slow paced atmospheric horror movies that completely subverts your expectations. This is a film for you, otherwise you are maybe better suited for Annabelle 5 or Saw 26...I think this movie is not a remake in the classical sense. It takes the general setting and does another take on the story.

So many horror remakes fall flat and are an unnecessary cash grab (Which i don't doubt this also is, but it's a good one) The original is known for it's use of colours and sound so when I heard that it was all being flipped around i was thought; ""Why? It's not going to add to anything"" But I was so happy to see that it brings a whole new attitude to the film that accents the original film perfectly. So different yet so the same.

For those looking for an average, dumb horror film to watch do not watch this because it's so out of ordinary which comes along with its charm.

I believe this movie is close to a modern day masterpiece which leaves me wondering what movie all the 1 star reviewers were watching.This is definitely a polarizing movie that will not end up being anything like what you were expecting going in. Yes, it's a little long and drawn out for my taste, there could have been some editing to tighten up the runtime and plot. Ultimately this is NOT a ""popcorn horror"" like what a lot of the 1 star reviewers were expecting. No jump scares, no creepy dolls, no monster in the closet; just an eerie, unsettling experience which is not for everyone.I don't want to give the story away, but do not go into this expecting to see a modern slasher/monster horror movie. I think this movie absolutely nails equal parts suspense, historical period piece, horror, drama. People will turn their noses up at this movie for not fitting perfectly into one of those boxes, but the stunning cinematography, creative drama, plot twists, eerie tone will definitely stick with you for a while after watching.",Suspiria

Enjoy this for what it is, much like the interpretive dance demonstrated in the movie, a reinterpretation of original art. Ever wonder why a coven of witches would hide and practice in a dance school? And accept students? This movie does an amazing job of presenting the idea of dance movements as a way of performing an incantation or casting spells rather than the hokey rhyming phrases and boiling some witches brew.
Tilda Swinton plays 2 rolls magically....lol.

I'm a huge fan of the original and I went a few months ago to see the HD remaster in theaters, and I strongly feel that it's a superior film to this.The problem is the doctor. Not only is his plot unnecessary, but even from the trailer the old age makeup was distracting and confusing. I remember when I first saw it I thought there must be a scene where they show him as a young man, otherwise why do this? When you do a makeup like that parts of the face don't move, and the actor has to move their shoulders to avoid turning their neck, it's just distracting. It reminded me of the old age makeup they put on Brent Spiner (Data) on TNG a few times.I will say I didn't realize it was Tilda until I saw it on the big screen, but again that begs the question, why? Having her play that character doesn't add anything to the film. It's just a gimmick.I think there is a need for a fan edit to this film that removes the doctor completely. His story has little impact on what's going on at the dance school and serves only to add run-time. You can just have the police show up due to a 'complaint' and it's fine. Tilda did a great job, but there was no point to it.",Suspiria

The war in the context of the film is a cold one, tense and always bristling beneath the surface, both in the real-world streets of 1977 Berlin and in the phantasmagoric world of the Markos dance company.

And, look, I understand this is supposed to be a complete reimagining of Argento's 1977 Suspiria, but for Christ's sake, if this is an example of what the full force of Guadagnino's imagination is capable of, then perhaps Guadagnino should consider submitting manuscripts for dime novels, instead.
I guess what's most shocking about this film is how unbelievably boring this film proves. Though the film begins with an interesting aesthetic and displays exactly one moment of incredibly surreal and disquieting horror, Guadagnino seems satisfied this brief moment of tension and bewilderment will carry the entirety of the film's remainder.
As a final complaint, I cannot understand why Guadagnino decided to film this in an unlit basement with a 2008 Flip Video camera- maybe I would have found this film more compelling if I could've actually seen what was going on. The majority of the film's second half takes place in dark, poorly lit rooms, which really means the majority of the second half of the film is spent trying to figure out whether there's a ghoul lurking behind one of those poor, unsuspecting dancers, or compression courtesy of your lousy bandwidth struggling to stream a three-hour-long movie.",Suspiria

First of all....it's a hard movie to hear.....and I have no hearing issues. Alot of the lines seem whispered or garbled when spoken. That's my first issue. My mom whose hearing loss is 70+% hardly heard any of this movie. I also think it was shot very drably.

I am a fan of the original Suspiria and I have to say THIS is how you remake a film! It is not suppose to be the same it's a re-reading of the film with new elements in. What is it that people found incomprehensive is beyond me.. It is quite straightforward in what it wants to say unless you are 12 years old.. The aesthetics are reminescent of Argento and I found the acting quite good with very nice music by Tom York. The dread and the gore are there in balance. Dramatically it's one the most moving horror movies out there.Bravo from me.,Suspiria

393,ludicroustrumpet,Incredible Horror Epic,9,21 November 2018,"This film is a true horror triumph. The acting, the cinematography, the writing, the sound design, the genuinely amazing horror set pieces, everything within the film is created so beautifully.The cinematography seems to have torn people and this I don't understand. Just because it isn't colourful doesn't mean it isn't well done. Cinematography doesn't have to be 'pretty' it just has to fit the narrative, themes and setting, which the cinematography does in the case of this film.The acting similarly is wonderfully layered and complex. Tilda Swinton's performance as the therapist is incredible and the same goes for her performance as Madame Blanc. Not one actress in the film did a bad job.The sound design for the film was incredible and enhanced many of the scenes, especially those including dance sequences such as the 'Volk' performance.There was seemingly an element of self-awareness and humour, especially towards the end. I think this helps to make the absurd situations seem more enjoyable, and overall felt it was worthwhile.The holocaust side-story was somewhat vague and I can see some people not fully understanding it, and I didn't until my second viewing of the film. It works, but it isn't completely defined enough for me to say it's perfect. However, I still enjoy its inclusion as it nicely mirrors the conflict within the main storyline.And by the way, it is NOTHING like the original, but that's okay. the fact that people are complaining because it doesn't do what the old one did are genuinely sad. It's a remake for a reason; it's a new fresh vision of the film that builds on the first in a way that is compelling and much tighter filmmaking wise. Would you rather the director copied the old one? What would you say then? That it's a pointless remake? All I'm saying is that the vision of the director is clearly his own. Don't be angry that he didn't take the easy route of copying what was already done before and actually tried to make into his interpretation of the story.Overall, if you hear someone complain that it isn't like the original, then their opinion is likely too covered in nostalgia for the original to be taken even slightly seriously.",Suspiria

395,michaelseanmcgowan,Dance of Sighs,9,4 November 2018,"Luca Guadagnino's Susperia is a twisted, beguiling epic. Born out of the fever dream that was Dario Argento's 1977 visually lavish supernatural slasher flick comes a 2 and a half hour ""remake"" that stretches the original in every conceivable way, and even turns parts of it on its head. It isn't the scariest movie of the year, but it is one of the best.The very basic set-up is still the same: Suzy Bannion (50 Shades of Grey's Dakota Johnson) arrives in West Berlin in 1977 at the invitation to be a member of an exclusive dance company, helmed by the creative and obtuse Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton). Opening with a gruesome murder in a colorful apartment building, the original wasted no time letting us know evil things were afoot- specifically, the dance company is being shepherded by a coven of witches seeking power and immortality, especially for their decrepit matriarch. Guadagnino's version, however, is set to a slower simmer. It doesn't open as violently, but we do know something is going on as one paranoid and frantic dancer (Chloe Grace Moretz) waxes manically conspiratorial to her therapist, an elderly Jewish man and Holocaust survivor (also played by Swinton in a chameleon-like role) before vanishing for good.From the opening, Susperia does a lot of things that are either quizzical to down-right counter-intuitive. The 1977 version was basically a haunted house movie, with most of the good-vs-evil showdown taking place within its ornate walls. Here Guadagnino expands the scope in terms of not just geography, giving us an opening credits sequence glimpse into Suzie's Mennonite upbringing, but temporally, morally, and theologically, as well. As well crafted as it was, Argento's movie didn't go beyond a general template of evil people and the good people who want to escape their machinations. When you watch the remake the first time, you sense that there are a few more engines at work here. Guadagnino brazenly tries to drain the coven of much of their mystique, revealing their intentions early, and as they discuss their plans for ritual sacrifice over newspapers and chain smoking cigarettes they come off as self-interested and occasionally petulant, probably not much unlike the dancers in their stable. Television news anchors exposit on the real-life Lufthansa Flight 181 hijacking, taking place concurrently with the story. Terrorist explosions go off in the Berlin skyline. The entire story is set in the context of a world that seems to leapfrog from one spate of madness to another. Perhaps Guadagnino's point here is that the coven is susceptible to same disastrous hubris (they are human, after all) as the RAF or the Third Reich. Or, perhaps more subversively, in a way their studio, even with the evil lurking under the floors, is a bit of a haven from it.For many these tangents are seem just that- excessive flourishes that add an hour to a concept that didn't exactly have a lot of meat on its bones to begin with. But if you pay attention, these threads do come together in Susperia's insane final 20 minutes, a climax which is, oddly, as sweet and redemptive as it is gory and flashy. It's safe to say that this movie was built with multiple viewings in mind, since the ending rewrites the context of everything we've just witnessed- the characters, the dynamics, even the role of good and evil in the world. The 1977 film ended with Suzy walking off into the night as the studio, that haven of unequivocal evil, burned to the ground. This film ends with a bittersweet story told at an old man's bedside. It's a much more hopeful conclusion, the coda to a movie that states that good is never is pure as you think, evil is never as stark as it sounds, and celebrates the humanness of trying to navigate the two.",Suspiria

It wasn't a film that I enjoyed and understood much, but I could still respect the cinematography, the art, the actors and the overall elegance to it. And it gets very dark and scary at times, even for the audience who cannot follow precisely what is going on. A lot of work and effort was put in the choreography and dance to say the least.

397,rochelleluck,Just really disappointing,2,6 April 2019,"There are other reviews that say it better than I can - some of the 1* reviews.
Was really looking forward to this movie. It was so disappointing, in so many ways.
1 - Just was not horror or scary or suspenseful. It was gory - lots of blood and guts and pee, but only towards the end. No scares. None. The only suspense was wondering where tf the story was going, and which one was what.
2 - too many different stories thrown together without a point or conclusion. We're told in the beginning that they're witches, so that's not even a surprise.
3 - Dakota Johnson does not show any emotion besides blandness. None of the characters are developed enough to care about.
4 - This movie is at least an hour too long. Needed an editor. Bad.
5 - The sound was horrible. Sound effects very loud but dialogue was all mumbled and too low. I was grateful when there was foreign language dialogue, for the subtitles.
6 - Bland bland bland cinematography. If it was meant to be a contrast to later bright colors as the tension builds, that would've been good. But nope.
7 - The big climactic scene is just a mess. Filmed like a very low-budget gore-fest. Blurry, jittery, lots of boobs and spewing blood, and long without payoff.Ok, so why did I give it 2*? Tilda Swinton is great but underutilized in her main role. The doctor she plays is for no apparent reason. There are other great performances but they are lost in this.
The soundtrack is really good, but doesn't quite fit in this mess of a movie.

403,sscott94,3 Stars For The Dancing And Supporting Cast. The Rest Is A Long Waste Of Time.,3,28 October 2018,"Wow, what a colossal mess this film is.I saw this at the Dome in Hollywood on opening weekend with some serious film lovers. Very few claps at the end for such a huge theater. To be honest, they sounded like pity claps because the cast was waiting in the wings to come out.The movie is 2.5 dreadfully long hours. I saw many people looking around and checking their watches. The pace is way too slow. There are scenes of Tilda Swinton (as the male psychiatrist) just walking and walking outside. There was no need to see any of that. But the director, Guadagnino, did that with many scenes in the film. They just draaaaaag.On the note of Tilda playing a man. Totally stupid decision. The makeup made it obvious this wasn't a real man playing the part and her voice... well imagine Johnny Cash trying to talk like a woman. You get the idea. It completely took me out of the picture.Here's the worse part. Her character didn't even need to be in the film at all. It added nothing to the story. At the end, I was like... ""That's it? That's the payoff for watching this character throughout the entire 2.5 hours?""The dancing is good (pretty obvious from the trailer). The music is eerie, which added suspense. However, I remember one scene at a table with no music and it became suddenly distracting to me, because of the drastic shift. That tells me the director relied to heavily on the music to draw suspense.The supporting female cast (not including Moretz) were all believable and added a fantastic level of creepiness. They were the best thing about the film.Tilda's main character, the dance choreographer, is performed well enough, though her character is not as creepy or fun as her supporting counterparts get to play. She also gets the short end of the stick at the end. What a letdown. Her character could have been so twisted.Dakota's performance is pretty much the same throughout the film, even after her character DRASTICALLY changes in the final act. You would think that would call for her taking a step into the sinister side, but she's still playing it as the doe-eyed character gently speaking, only this time she's killing everyone around her. Clearly that's the director's artistic decision. Nope. Didn't work for me.",Suspiria
404,kcmsterpce,I respect that it DID ITS OWN THING as a remake,7,11 March 2019,"Need another remake/reboot/reimagining of a classic horror movie that was effective because of the timing of its release... and deserves to keep its legendary status for the rest of time.""
Then I saw that it was 2.5 hours, and I was like ""OMG, what?!""
Then I watched it, and I was like ""OMG, what?!""
I think I'm going to watch it again, because I wasn't paying attention a lot of the time. However, this is one of those remakes/reboots/reimaginings that I respect. Why? Because it takes the CONCEPT of the original, and spins everything about, swirls and twirls it, then flips it up into itself, turning into a completely faithful representation of the term ""REIMAGINING"".
I respect SUSPIRIA 2018. Granted, some of the makeup effects were pretty bad (especially the ""old man"", which I don't really think was necessary; and the silly makeup for one of the ""old ladies"" in the final act, which was worse). It is a little long in the tooth. It tries perhaps a little too hard to be artsy-fartsy...
But it grabbed me. It pressed its filthy, dirty fingers on my windpipe in parts, and gently squeezed with wrathful intimacy. I felt dirty, yet couldn't help but feel enthralled in parts.I will say, though, that even if this movie was a complete FAILURE of a horror remake, I will gladly praise the fact that it tried to be its own thing. It wasn't a shameless ripoff. It really, truly IS a reimagining.

406,nickm3513,"""How did it feel? Like F%$&@ing an animal""",7,11 December 2019,"Let me start off by saying I consider the original Suspiria one of the all time classics of horror. This film is basically a complete reimagining. It's an hour longer than the original and completely different in plot points and narrative structure. The sound is much more subtle and the colors are bleak. It's lost most of the iconic Giallo/ Argento style, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think the film still works in its own right, however it's not without its own problems.I liked that much more attention was paid to the ballet parts of the ballet school. The choreography of the dances was beautiful and mesmerising. It's ties to the satanic rituals of the coven were also interesting and unsettling. The final sequence, of which i won't speak too much about, was like a sensory overload.But the story felt overlong. I really have no idea why the terrorist attack/hostage situation/ whatever was going on in the background in Berlin in the 1970s was included. It had no impact on the story. The cuts of the (biological) mother in Amish country I found confusing and not essential to conveying the story either. The twist regarding the (magical) Mother, revealed in the final sequence, also seemed to come out of left field. I was left wondering if I should have been rooting for Blanc all along- which I definitely wasn't. A change that was made, which I felt was at an expense to this film, was the exclusion of the slasher elements in the original Suspiria. Unfortunately, much of the terror of the film was lost along with it. This film instead focused much more heavily on the witchcraft, even revealing its existence very early on. This angle succeeded in consistently making me unsettled, but never really scared.Overall, I found the film visually stunning but overall hard to really get into.C+ Or 6/10",Suspiria

The cast is wonderful. And the end left me with my mouth hanging open. One reviewer called it a slow-burn, and I'd have to agree. I love horror films and am always open to one done differently. It can't be compared to the original, which, in 1977, was SCARY. Lol. The 2018 version is, well, creepy. Makes you ... uncomfortable, squirmy.

Suzy was also nice, kind of stereotypical, but whatever, she was the protagonist. But! Let's get something straight, for its time, it's just a standard film. I don't think it stands out compared to other horror films. They have that classic theatrical acting, suspense music at the right times, the signature close ups, it didn't had any wow factor or plot twists.
Now the 2018 version is way more raw. Poor background story, I know. They throw the story at you with different timings and you end up figuring all out by yourself. The scenarios are more realistic, considering the time the story took place. For me, the acting was superb. Suzy was arrogant from the beginning, which makes you feel kind of lost because you don't bond with any of the characters (maybe madame Blanc at the end?). It is still a horror film, but it stands out from the generic ones. It also have scenes which are uncomfortable to watch.

415,scrappybilly,"Starts off well, but after that....",4,1 November 2018,"Suspiria, as I'm sure anyone reading this is aware, is a remake of the 1977 Dario Argento film of the same name. This time around, it's directed by Luca Guadagnino (Call me by Your Name) and David Kajganich (who worked by Guadagnino on A Bigger Splash and created the AMC limited television show ""The Terror""), and expands upon the folklore of Agento's ""Three Mothers"" trilogy. 2018's Suspiria is less a remake and more of an expansion on the world of the Three Mothers, even boasting a post-credit sequence, like an entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Dakota Johnson plays Susie, an American ballet dancer who joins a world-renowned German dance company, that harbors a dark secret. It is, you see, run by a coven of witches. Anyone who discovers the secret, or goes looking too deep, disappears-usually in a violent dispatching. Their motives are unclear, but they feed off of the energy of the young dancers and when one goes missing, it's easy enough for them to find another to replace her.Tilda Swinton plays Madame Blanc, the face of the dance company, a dancer and a dark entity that takes Susie under her wing. The most interesting scenes in Suspiria deal with their relationship. They're at once predator and prey, mother and daughter, and two old souls who've known each other since before time. Their interactions, and the way they involve, showcase a much, much better movie than the one we ended up getting.The problem with Suspiria is that it's a mess-in every conceivable way, it's a mess. As a horror movie, it isn't scary; the scenes of suspense are taken to comical extremes. Whether these comical extremes are intended or not are up for debate, and in a better movie, that would be a subject of interesting conversation. Here, it's simply confusing. As a drama, it's incoherent. Twists in the plot occur without any real logic behind them. As a horror fan, I love movies that boast their own kind of self-contained logic, but that requires a certain suspension of disbelief that Suspiria just didn't earn.Suspiria is a unique paradox of having both too much and too little plot. It has too much plot dedicated toward dead-ends and too little dedicated to big reveals, where they wind up confusing and pointless. In a movie where about five notable things happen, to say its 2.5-hour-long run time is bloated would be a generous understatement. In what will surely become the film's most infamous scene, Susie dances, while her movements magically contort and mutilate another dancer. This scene goes on and on and on, and the thing is, it's not even particularly well-edited. Susie will do a pirouette, and the victim on the receiving end of it will... just sort of crash into a wall, or her jaw will unhinge. None of the movements match. It would have been interesting to see one movement darkly mirror another, or vice versa, but instead it looks like we're watching two unrelated occurrences take place. It's like watching someone eat cereal juxtaposed with a violent car wreck.I don't believe it's a spoiler to reveal that Tilda Swinton also plays the character of Dr. Josef Klemperer, because it's worth noting that her performance as him makes zero sense in the context of the movie. It's a distraction. She also has an annoying acting tic as the doctor in which she clacks her jaw or smacks her lips every three seconds or so. It's a bizarre choice that I think the filmmakers were proud of, but was a miscalculation from beginning to end. In an interview, David Kajganich said, ""Both Luca and I were adamant that the male gaze never intrude,"" and if that was their thinking here, it was a total failure.Some of the more head-scratching decisions in the film can best be summed up the the terrorism subplot, an event never directly witnessed, but terrorists have kidnapped a group of people and a days-long event unfolds surrounding the school. At first, it adds a certain ambiance to the film, and it works really well in establishing the unease of the world outside of the dance company, as though the coven of witches are affecting the world at large around them. A girl named Sara (Mia Goth) hears something and pokes her head outside and says it was a bomb, that she can smell it. This helps put us, the audience, in the world with these characters. And then, this plotline just sort of drags along and becomes, strangely, a series of news reports, as though the movie we're watching is being interrupted by an unrelated documentary. It never ties into the narrative as a whole, it's just a distraction that, like the Tilda-as-a-doctor story, should have been left on the cutting room floor.The film's finale, in which everything comes together, just sort of staggers into place. Usually, getting everyone together all at once for the finish requires events established earlier, where a character will do this or that and everything pays off. This is just a scene that sort of happens, doesn't have any real tension, and contains revelations that undo the entire plot that had preceded it. It's also an extravaganza of terrible-looking effects and smeary frame rate that looks like it was inspired by the German shot-on-video horror entry The Burning Moon, but The Burning Moon was made for maybe a few thousand dollars and is genuinely unnerving.To me, it feels like 1977's Suspiria is the remake. It feels like that film took the 2018 version, looked at all the plots that went nowhere, trimmed them out, boiled it down to its purest essence, and made a crack rock of horror. The problem, I suspect, was the director's desire to make this the first part of a trilogy, instead of a standalone movie. So, as a result, we're left with some threads that may pay off later, but sure as hell don't pay off here.Suspiria is going to be a love-it-or-hate-it type of movie. I could see loving it, it just had a certain divorce from reality I didn't think was earned; its surreal qualities weren't enough to afford its more outlandish aspects. Its grounded-in-the-real-world vibe clashed with the horror instead of holding up a mirror to it.",Suspiria

I gave this 3 stars because of Thom Yorkes beautiful soundtrack to an overrated film.I'm not bashing the film. I'm simply stating what many feel... why was this made at all?",Suspiria
417,thering-97827,"The tone and droning feel of the ""The Shining"" with the horror and disturbing imagery of ""The exorcist""",9,5 January 2020,"This movie is technically very well made. All of the special and visual effects look convincing, and are used to punctuate the story in a way I feel other horror movies forget or fail to utilize. Apparently, I'm like one of the three people that enjoyed the fact that this movie was so visually different than the original Dario Argento film from 1977. I don't see the point in remaking that movie if you're going to try and do the same things again. At that point, just go watch the original and don't make a remake. That's why I appreciate how different this movie is from the original.Some of the things I disliked about this movie were the very beginning where I can definitely see the tone they were going for even if the end product became a little corny. The acting from some of the characters leaves a lot to be desired which I think comes from an attempt on subtlety that were very unfortunately lost in the performances, but I still enjoyed it on the whole.Everything else I pretty much enjoyed. The plot is actually presented in an interesting way and in almost the exact opposite way from the original. Maybe it's just too different from the original and that's why some people (fans of the original) don't like the plot, but I don't really care, because the original does not dictate how good this movie is.I actually thought this movie was pretty disturbing, especially when compared to the original (which by today's standards is honestly cheesy). A specific sequence in the movie was such a creative and disturbing use of an in universe concept that I was just plain impressed and also surprised the original movie didn't utilize the concept at all. There were several sequences in this movie that left me genuinely unnerved which I just cannot say for the original. Don't get me wrong, the original is a fun movie that I entirely appreciate, but this is a movie that actually presented some creative and disturbing Ideas.The hardest thing in this movie to defend is some of the way information is told in an almost cryptic manner. It's best to watch the original first just to get a better Idea of some of the basic plot points. A few instances just happen and the movie seems to expect you to understand what is going on, which is not okay because this is intended to be a stand alone film. I understood everything in the film but I imagine new comers would not and it makes the plot feel bloated when it really isn't and it's more just a simple story presented in a needlessly complicated way.
But let's entertain the idea that this is probably more the fault of the original because the original didn't exactly present its story in an interesting or even clear way. Both movies are dependent on their emotion and feel, which this movie absolutely excels at.",Suspiria

419,lukecusters,German Expressionism from an Italian,7,22 August 2019,"Similar to the red threaded bondage used in the last bewitching dance scene, Suspiria is a spellbinding use of Berlin peaches and Smokey pinks; both thematically contrasted with the dreadful reds that further the carnal entanglement of morbid subtext. The perplexing profoundness (or lack there of) present in Suspiria is often at risk of Guadagnino's speculative intuition when it comes to his abnormal casting technique. This debatable technique either results in effectively surreal, raven-like performances - seen best in the role of Madame Blanc performed by the hauntingly macabre Tilda Swinton - as well as the many exquisitely coquettish frames of petite performers, which are expertly chosen to sensually hypnotize the vanity of the viewer, or (on the flip side of the coin) may result in drab spectacles of lackluster acting; making the meaning of Suspiria undesirable as, in effect, the vessels of profoundness prove inadequate in doing such a task. In some way this is present throughout the film, as the philosophical themes which demands one's ardent pursuit are both successfully furthered by Tarkovsky-like cinematography from the captivating Mukdeeprom though also prove ineffective as they're only tangible at face value; such is consequence because of many missed opportunities to further nurture the delicate themes of Suspiria. I would love to see another attempt from director Luca Guadagnino in hopes that the abundant potential present in Suspiria may find its way to a modern masterpiece, though - with the unprofitable landscape for this vein of projects in the vapid industry being Hollywood - such would be a foolish pursuit; only followed by few in cinematic history.~ 71.2%",Suspiria

421,angus4625,Really......How dare someone remake a classic like this!,2,3 July 2019,"First of all, to anyone who saw the original Suspiria directed by Argenta...what did you think?
It isn't that I have anything against remakes as a whole, IF the writer or director can make a better version or improve the original in ANY form or perhaps even bring it up to date.
In this situation, you have the original Suspiria movie, which let's face it, the plot isn't that great. However, as filmmakers and theater actors all know, a plot is only one part of the whole of the movie. The main value that the original Suspiria had going for it is called ""spectacle"", ""original sound"" and originality.
The beginning of the original Suspiria starts with showing scenes in extremely bright colors, strange situations and obnoxious and at times very unnerving music. You are literally stressed as soon as the movie begins and it's hard to explain why. That is it!! That is what made Suspiria a Classic! Period! So, I found it extremely unusual that anyone would find it necessary to recreate this movie for the plot alone and just try to ""refresh it""! Nice TRY!! Marvel comics wants you to write for them next time and to please stay away from the Horror genre and please stop butchering the classics that believe it or not, someone that was around before you and actually knew what they were doing has already done and did extremely well. Thanks!",Suspiria
422,luke-andersun,Different,9,11 November 2018,"I understand why this movie gets so much hate.I wonder ... is the film really trying to be ""smart"" which is why it comes off as pretentious? Or is it that some people come to their own conclusion that the film is trying to be ""smart""? I felt like the director was just trying to create something interesting and intriguing, not something smart or pretentious.I almost feel like people think it's pretentious because they find the plot stupid to begin with ... because this movie heavily focuses itself on the plot, which I really liked. But some other films out there may be crafted to use the plot as a backdrop for a family drama, or some character development, whereas Suspiria focuses itself almost entirely on its plot and the character development is secondary.For most of the movie, it is easy enough to follow along ... they don't overcomplicate the plot too much - which is that a young woman goes to a dance studio that is run by witches - but the director adds too much of the sideplot that felt like it detracted from the main plot of the movie.In the end, I ended up loving it. As someone who loves horror, I like when a horror movie tries to have quality acting, writing, and overall cinematography.The movie does tread into art house territory at a certain point, but that made little to no impression on me. I'm not really an art house person, but I did find it interesting, albeit too tacky and gaudy. But given that the entirety of the film before that and the epilogue after that it did not impact my viewing experience too much. Sure it was a bit weird, but that is the artistic license of the director. What would you rather? A film that dares to create, or a film that just repeats the same formula as every other movie out there? Sure, not everything that is creative automatically deserves instant validation ... but I think this movie should get a lot more credit than most people are giving it.I saw the movie twice in theaters. I'm not an art person, I'm not the smartest person in the world, I'm just an average person that likes well-crafter cinematography, especially well-crafted horror. So I loved this film despite its loopy bits here and there, because overall, it is a movie that is twisted, terrifying, and down-right exciting to watch. Is it for everyone? No. But if you love the craft of cinematography, I think you should watch the film and come to your own conclusion.Don't take yourself too seriously when you watch it. Allow yourself to suspend your disbelief, and just watch the movie for what it is instead of what you think it should be. And if you still end up hating it, well at least you gave the film an honest chance, which I think a film like this deserves at the very least.",Suspiria

The movie undergoes a difficult comparison with Dario Argento' masterpiece, someone couldn't appreciate it because of the original movie.
The director had the difficult task of respecting the masterpiece, in fact he decided to change the original main plot, but leaving the essence of the original movie.

Strong acting on swintons behalf and a chilling soundtrack. the film was definitely off to a great start. Moreover, The majority of the following chapters did hold themselves but overall it did need chopping down to at least 2 hours 10/ 2 hours. A select few scenes didn't do the stroy any justice. Especially the modern day scene at the end. The unneeded scenes made it a lot more confusing then it needed to be.The composition of each shot was intricately thought out, with a delicious colour palette and and rich camera tones. Especially the dream sequences. (My fav parts) not to mention Johnson's mesmerising dance sequences. She definitely put a lot of work in.

429,KidMacabre,Living With Dangerous People,8,16 January 2019,"Disclaimer: Similar to another user review, I have to confess that I am EXACTLY the audience for this movie. I love Tilda Swinton, genre films, dance, anti-fascism, and Gothic horror. So take what I say with a grain of salt, I suppose.""We need guilt, Doctor, and shame.""The scariest thing in the world (to me) is a person with no sense of shame. It's remarkably easy for some people to decide, 'I'm not responsible, I don't care if I hurt people or if people are hurt in my name, as long as I'm comfortable. As long as I don't see it. As long as I can justify in my head why those people deserved it. As long as I get to sit here, sip my tea, and not think about the bodies.'Such is the poison that consumes the Helena Markos Dance Academy, where the matrons who run the school prey upon their students. They put on a protective, motherly front to manipulate and destroy the young women who come through their doors. The youth believe the celebrated academy will help perfect their dancing capabilities. This lie masks a secret, nefarious plot - one the coven will gladly kill to protect.Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria has a lot on its mind - the German Autumn, modern dance, motherhood, witchcraft, psychotherapy - but everything comes back to a struggle with shame, especially as it applies to those with power. The witches at the academy were victims of the Third Reich, and have since devolved into their own form of fascistic groupthink. Fear of discovery drives the coven to commit atrocities. We are shown in grueling, bone-crunching detail the cruelty they are willing to inflict on dissenters, and then we see how shockingly happy and contented they are with what they've done. Evil is banal, and it does not occur to (most of) the matrons that they should feel even the slightest semblance of guilt.The only other authority figure in the film is Dr. Klemperer (played by the endearing ""Lutz Ebersdorf""), a psychologist who survived the Holocaust. While his intentions are more noble than those of the witches, he still fails to take action when it counts and pathetically denies the blood on his hands. The message may not be subtle, but that doesn't make it any less palpable: We are all culpable when we allow unjust regimes to flourish. Shame can help save humanity.Guadagnino is more concerned with character psychology than Dario Argento was in his 1977 original. Every character actively pursues an agenda, and their individual journeys interlock in interesting ways. It's difficult to say there is only one main protagonist; we closely follow the progress of so many people. Guadagnino also shows way more compassion for his characters than Argento did. The sisterhood that develops between Susie (Dakota Johnson) and Sara (Mia Goth) is genuinely touching. So is the intense, symbiotic bond between Susie and her instructor, Madam Blanc (the incomparable Tilda Swinton). And of course, there's Klemperer on a mission to find and rescue his missing patient, a dancer tormented by the academy (Chloe Grace Moretz). Because there is sincere, deeply felt love for each of these characters, the terror visited upon them is all the more distressing.Many of the film's stylistic choices can be quite jarring, particularly in the VFX and editing departments. It's also 2.5 hours long and slow paced in sections. It's not for everyone, but then again, neither is the 1977 original. Guadagnino pays tribute to the free, punk rock spirit of Argento in his own unique way. Thom Yorke's music is also very surprising; singing on a horror movie soundtrack is a bold move. Yet nothing here feels out of place. The world of this film follows a well-defined, if unorthodox and challenging, aesthetic logic - in that regard, it matches the success of the original, which critics described as ""A movie that makes sense only to the eye.""The new Suspiria makes sense on a deeper level. For all its intellectual obsessions, the movie is first and foremost an emotional experience. We watch, helpless, as characters we care for are neglected, lied to, and murdered by their elders. With age and trauma, the adults have lost touch with their humanity, and now they commit selfish crimes whilst hiding behind a wall.People who say this movie ""doesn't know what it wants to be"" couldn't be more wrong.",Suspiria

435,abhaddakedhabhra,Very promising first half that collapses into a frustrating mess,7,12 November 2018,"The Good:
-Stylistically radically different to the original (which is a classic!). This makes it easier to view free from comparisons (though some are inevitable). I am a firm believer in striving to judge remakes/sequels on their own merits as much as possible, and this version carved out its own niche, being virtually an entirely different genre of film that happened to have some vague plot similarities.-The dance and sympathetic magic aspects were brilliant. They were superbly executed, and brought a unique feel to the film. As someone who has an interest in those particular subjects, they were great food for contemplation and really reeled me in to the experience.-There were some great comical moments, a few nice shots, some compelling body-horror.OK:
-Acting and technical aspects. Tilda was strong, the others were ok, the directing style etc was great in parts and not-so-great in others.-Score. I am a Radiohead fan, and this is a decent score that kinda fits the film, but this is one arena its almost impossible not to compare to Goblin's original masterwork.The Bad:
-Bloated sidestory. The old psychologist was interesting for a short while but had far, far too much screentime, and his story was practically irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Besides the fact that he was silly enough to be almost-comic-relief, his screen-time and storyline should have been cut down by 80%.
Also the political Berlin stuff was helpful for creating an entirely new backdrop but did seem slightly overdone given how unnecessary it was to the story.-Messy/confused second half. After a strong and enticing first half, the story gradually loses its way and ends up a complete mess. Seemed it was trying to be too clever for its own good with the ""twist"" surrounding Suzie (which could have been fine if they executed it better over the 2.5 hr period).This film was so frustratingly close to being really great, but seriously drops the ball when it counts the most.
I feel a 45-minute-shorter fan edit could make for a something worth rewatching... but as it stands its a bit of a mess. but ultimately this is the most frustrating film of 2018... though is probably worth giving a shot if it intrigues you as it seems to have pleased a lot of people (unless you're one of the auto-hate-remake crowd in which case don't bother as you've already made up your mind).",Suspiria

438,matthew-87235,Horrible,1,5 November 2018,"Dario Argento's 1977 version of Susperia is one of the top 10 best films I have ever seen. Luca Guadagnino's 2018 version of Susperia is one of top 10 worst films I have ever seen. There are a few obvious things that made the original so influential; sound, color and horror. Guadagnino manages to disregard all of these important factors.Let's start with sound. One of the most important factors about Argento's Suspiria is its radical unfront use of the music scored by the Goblins. From the first second of the movie we are enveloped by an aggressive driving force of intense music while watching an electric door open and water running down the drain. Seriously, I have never been so scared of shadows on a tree but the music does it. Guadagnino's use of Thom Yorke's lack of sound is the opposite. There are actual dance scenes where there is NO music. It is absolutely absurd. Moreover, in the final climactic scene of the murderous dance, he basically uses something a Radiohead song.Another aspect of tension and effect was Argento's use of color where his pulled saturations created a mental dissonance and surreality. His use of Art Deco settings helped the environment become a key player in the 1977 film. This is expressed when Pat falls through the glass mosaic skylight or when Sara was trapped by a room filled with wire. The exterior of the dance hall and the blue iris painted walls all added to the character of the coven. You can't deny that Guadagnino literally ripped every aspect of color from this film making it horribly bland to even look at.Sidebar: this film had the worst sound/dialog recording ever! Every line is delivered with a mumbled inarticulation that drove me mad and forced me to eventually disengaged from listening. Moreover, the horrible master mixing only made it worse.Lastly, the violence in Argento's original had the critical aspect of camp that allowed the viewer room for disbelief. It is horrific, but also silly. This is also based on the period when it was made. Guadagnino's murder scenes incorporated the victim urinating on themselves and push the envelope to snuff movie levels, which is not what horror suspense is about. Conversely, The final ""dance of death"" was so ludicrous that I laughed out loud at the absurdity.Lastly, the need for Tilda Swinton to play two roles was interesting as an expression of her talent but completely distracting in the movie. First off the makeup was like watching a bad version of Dustin Hoffman's elderly character in Little Big Man. I was constantly distracted by the makeup artists inability to connect the prosthetic with the actual mouth. It was a continual obvious fake for the whole movie.I rarely ask for my money back during movies in theaters.

My love for it goes so deep, that I decided to make a profile on IMDB to review it, because I need to talk about it.This movie, in my opinion of course, is one of the best movies of 2018. In fact, I'm writing this whilst listening to the score, which, by the way, is absolutely amazing and provided by Thom Yorke, singer of Radiohead, one of my favorite bands.Let me get this out of the way first:
I wouldn't necessarily call Suspiria a remake. While it takes from the 1977 version in terms of general premise and character names, they are two completely different pieces, and it's important to note that. It drives me up the wall when people hate on the movie because it doesn't suit their own needs rather than seeing it and appreciating it for what it actually is.
Suspiria (2018) has been called a divisive film. It's true. This film is very artsy and makes you THINK. Some people don't enjoy that, some like to have a film that makes them think enough but enough to break their brains for the night or a film that doesn't make you want to think at all, and I can respect that. It's definitely not everyone's forte, but if you appreciate film, this film is perfect for that.The performances and so strong coming from every actor on screen. The cinematography had me in awe constantly, shot in 35mm, and the grain is to just die for. It really, truly feels as if it were ripped from the era with its style choices and palette. The story is clever is just shrouded with depth. I mean, you can just keep thinking and thinking about this thing. It's also been said that Suspiria isn't scary, and while this is completely subjective, what is scary and what isn't - Suspiria scared the h*ll out of me. The entire movie has an underlying tension, starting with a spectacular intro that tells you that you're in for a ride and lulling you into an uneasy stride for the rest of the movie. There's so many nuances to the film, little details that I'd catch that made my skin crawl as I anticipated what came next.I personally loved this film to bits and I think, if you're an enthusiast or interested, check it out. It's something that deserves recognition.",Suspiria

446,texraven-68908,People are misinterpreting this reinterpretation,7,15 May 2019,"So after reading a million 1 star reveiws that all say this movie is a piece of garbage because it wasn't EXACTLY what they were expecting (either a step by step, word for word, carbon copy of the original or a scary flick you can watch and then forget about a day later) and like 4 reviews giving actual decent critisism I've come to the conclusion that 99.9% of people who saw this movie either REALLY loved it or REALLY hated it... There's no in between for most people, or at least that's what I'm getting from these reviews.Anyway this is my first review so don't judge me if I sound like an idiot for some of the stuff I'm saying. As an art piece this movie is masterfully crafted. As a horror movie its fantastic. Now the storyline is really what dragged this experience down from a great score to a good score for me. Maybe this was just me not being able to follow along very well but the story left me feeling fairly bored at times. Keep in mind I've never seen the original.The only thing I was really put off by was the special effects in the ending. I loved all the special effects and makeup and everything of that matter throughout the film up until that point. It just felt like they weren't up to par with the first 2 hours of the movie.Everything else was amazing. The acting: amazing (by the way hadn't even seen Tilda swinton in anything besides Narnia up until this point 😂). Special effects/makeup: as I said outstanding. Choreography: some of the best I've seen. Camera work: actually astonishingI'm really not sure if people just love to hate this film because they Stan the original so hard that this movie actually offended them somehow or if they really didn't like it. Either way I thought it was a work of art (loved guadagnino's Call me by your name, one of my all time favorite films so no surprise I enjoyed this one too)",Suspiria

448,tiffanymattzela,Unique,8,11 May 2019,"I actually enjoyed this movie and not because it made sense but because it didn't. I liked the serious tone of this horror. Trust me I like a good campy horror as much as the next person but also love to see a well acted (not something I often see in this genre) uneasy, surreal dive into what it might look like if the supernatural was actually inserted into our reality. And I think this film delivered.I would like to state the obvious - this is a film. Not a blockbuster movie. If a blockbuster is what you're looking for you'll hate it, so skip it. But if you like exploring film as a medium this is good film to watch.As is stated in several reviews if you like Kubrick you'll at least be able to appreciate this movie.Watch if you liked: The Witch, Hereditary, The Shining",Suspiria
449,chasehec,A bizarre but expertly crafted horror film,8,14 May 2019,"Director Luca Guadagnino (""Call Me by Your Name"") has crafted a fascinating horror flick that explores the thematic dynamic of motherhood, corruption, and fear, all wrapped up in a story of witchcraft. Dakota Johnson (""Fifty Shades of Grey"") stars as Susie Bannion, a young ambitious American dancer who is vaulted to the role of lead dancer of the world-renowned Helena Markos Dance Co. in Berlin. Yet her excitement is short lived as suspicions of witchcraft in the company start to plague her psyche, as well as the suspicions of a local male psychiatrist placed by Tilda Swinton in heavy makeup.The film demonstrates some similarities to themes and plot devices explored in the recent horror film Hereditary. It is a gruesome film that aims to be different but also respectful to the original, with several nods and easter egg references to the old film. For the most part, Suspiria is well acted, and Tilda Swinton shines in two different lead roles, one as a male and one as a female. Swinton does this masterfully, and the makeup they use to transform her into Mr. Josef Klemperer was astounding.I admire Guadagnino's decision to make almost the entire cast female in a film that deals with the dynamic between a ""mother"" and her ""daughters,"" including having the lead male role played by Swinton. It is a disturbing film and as I was watching, I understood why this film is so polarizing to both critics and audiences. It is likely one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen (in a good way... I think?). Some scenes actually shocked me, and being a horror movie buff I have rarely been shocked by something in a film before. It is one hell of a strange film, that's for sure, even more so than the original. Of course, just being strange does not make a film good. What makes the film succeed in its disturbing nature is the captivating way these brutal scenes are shot.There are many shots in this film that had me go, ""Woah,"" in astonishment and marvel. The film is shot beautifully, with the choreography of the dancing scenes stunning and mesmerizing to watch. Guadagnino has compared his style of filmmaking in Suspiria to Rainer Werner Fassbinder, a pioneer of the New German Cinema movement. The visual style and entire female cast demonstrate clear influence from Fassbinder in this film.It is a masterful arthouse horror film but one that is surely not for everyone. Some critics and audience members have complained about the film dragging at times during its 153 minute duration. I did not feel a drag at all but felt that some scenes, in retrospect, were completely unnecessary with several scenes feeling out of place at times, as well as a few moments where some actors didn't deliver the performance they were probably hoping. Some have contended that Dakota Johnson (""Fifty Shades of Grey"") was miscast as the lead role of Susie. I disagree that she was miscast, but I definitely feel a dynamic at times in which she is being overshadowed by much better performances from her cast members. Other than that, Suspiria was a fascinating experience.",Suspiria
450,RealBlvck,Terrible ending...Yes. But still undeniably the best witch film I've ever seen.,7,3 June 2021,The ending of this film dissappointed me and theres quite a bit of irrelevant material...but i am still in awe of the first 2 hours. The best film about witches to date...hands down. Whoever played Mrs. Tanner understood the assignment. Most people who rated this a 1 saw the original and are critiquing that it's nothing like it when really its more. If you like A24 horrors...give this a chance.

452,sf-cinephile,Very disappointing,1,22 March 2019,"As a fan of Dario Argento's original, I was cautiously hopeful about this remake, but ended up feeling really let down. This remake doesn't have the pervasive sense of inevitable doom of the original, nor does it deliver on the scares. While it is punctuated with some good performances by some of the cast, it lacks the visual punch of the original, and replaces the original's sense of dread with occasional moments of uninspired gore.The ending is likewise dissatisfying, giving us a long sequence of ""wtf?"" moments that left me puzzled as to what the writers might have been thinking. The biggest change from the original is featured in the ending, and that change makes no sense whatsoever - there is zero story motivation for it and, in fact, it contradicts story elements established earlier.This remake is an hour longer than the original, but that extra hour is not used to expand the story in a compelling way, or even to treat the viewer to interesting visuals. It feels more like the director wanted to gloat over his own inflated sense of self-importance.Uninspired visuals, lackluster storytelling, a script that meanders all over the place and pulls in entirely unnecessary historical events in an attempt to infuse itself with deeper meaning, a bunch of unmotivated gross-outs, along with the dumbest ending I've seen in a long time make this movie one I won't add to my collection. Rent it if you must, but if you're a fan of the original, be warned that your expectations won't be met (no matter how good you are at *not* having expectations). You might like this movie if you never saw the original, but even then, I can't imagine you'd think it was especially good.",Suspiria

Honestly, as a horror fan I was not only disappointed, but absolutely bored out of my mind.Where the original has hypnotic music, memorable set pieces, vivid colours and an amazing pace, 2018 is two and half hours of needlessly long, uninteresting dialogue, with a forgettable soundtrack and no horror to speak of.An absolute insult.",Suspiria
454,matt_cole1,This is not Argento's Suspiria,10,26 May 2019,"So the vast majority of negative reviews of this film are complaining that it's not like the original.Well that's because it's not the original. I've not seen Argento's film and I'm sure it's very good but it is a futile exercise to slate a film because it's not another film.I loved this movie. It's not an easy watch, guess what you have to concentrate! God forbid. It's long but if you give yourself in to it you'll discover a beautiful, disturbing, intelligent, lyrical, very bloody and above all, entertaining film. It's a gothic horror with all the Histrionics and romance that goes with that. In some ways it's a partner piece to Mother, which I also loved but not as much as this.So this is not the 77 Suspiria, it's the 2018 Suspiria and if you like beautiful, challenging films that aren't trying to be a carbon copy of a previous incarnation then enjoy.",Suspiria
455,ethaskins,Suspiria (2018),9,18 November 2018,"When I watched the remake or what Luca Guadagnino likes to call a cover version of ""Suspiria,"" I must admit that at first I was disappointed that it was more of a slow burn and that I found the pace to be kind of slow. Don't get me wrong, I found the story to be very interesting, but this remake really takes its time to get things going. Luca Guadagnino did a great job at directing this movie. I love the original movie. In fact, the original ""Suspiria"" is one of my all time favorites. It's gory, dark and unrelenting; and the music by Goblin is amazing. So with that out of the way, the music from new movie by Thom York is also amazing, but a little more mellow than the Goblin's score. I actually bought the soundtrack before I even watched the movie, so it gave me a chance to check out the arrangement; yes, I really liked the arrangement. With my expectations at an all time high and my husband and I didn't know if we're going to be able to see Luca Guadagnino's ""Suspiria"" in the theaters where it's really meant to be seen, we were psyched that we were given a chance to see it in Boston AMC with only one run time remaining. I honestly expected a totally different kind of movie. The original was dark and very creepy and this version was bleak and kind of depressing, but not as creepy as the original. Also, the story took its time with all of the modern dance scenes which I thought took forever; but I did like what happened to Patricia and Olga in this version. In the original, the characters were just killed off right away; but what was done to these characters in the new version was far more disturbing. I don't want to give away too much about this movie and yes I definitely will not; but I thoroughly enjoyed Tilda Swinton's performance and I love how she played three different characters, one of which being an old male psychotherapist. At first, our reaction to this movie was extreme disappointment because we were comparing this to the original ""Suspiria"" and because this movie was so different and quite a bit longer from the original source we both thought we ""hated"" it. Then we realized after talking about the movie that we did like it but felt it could've been trimmed by an hour. Then we realized that scenes we thought were unnecessary were in fact very crucial to the story. Some movies take a little while to appreciate and for this movie I kept thinking about all of the disturbing scenes and the various choices made and both my husband and I realized that we actually liked this movie. The cinematography is quite amazing too. I really liked the setting where this new version of ""Suspiria"" takes place in a 1977 chaotic and divided Berlin in which we hear about these particular hostages throughout the movie. That setting makes the atmosphere so extremely bleak and hopeless. If you're expecting this ""Suspiria"" to be similar to the original you'll be let down. This is a totally different movie but it keeps the atmosphere and vibes from the original movie. I like how you got to see more of the coven of witches and how they were discussing the ritual, even though for the majority of the movie it felt like we were watching a foreign movie with all of the subtitles. Also, in this movie the dance scenes were very important because they were actually part of the ritual. All in all, the storytelling is topnotch. And the acting is also very good. I liked Dakota Johnson's portrayal of Susie Bannion; and I liked the fact that her character is very different from Jessica Harper's Susie. As I mentioned earlier, Tilda Swinton is beyond amazing as Madame Blanc and her other two characters. I am definitely looking forward to purchasing this movie on blue ray and checking it out again.",Suspiria

The remake has the better actors (Tilda Swinton is exceptional in all 3+ roles she acts in this movie), Dakota Johnson was never more beautiful than here with long red hair, the story is much fuller in this remake and told better.

463,willicatgirl,"80% of this film could be rated 10/10, the other 20% lets it down.",8,16 October 2018,"Contains minor spoilersJust to be clear I am a fan of the original, however it was a flawed film and had scope to be reimagined. With this in mind I approached this version with an open mind. On the whole this film looks fantastic, the score is great and the acting from Tilda Swinton and Dakota Johnson is wonderful. There is just enough of a nod to the original to show respect without being nostalgic. If anything there seems to be more of a homage to early David Cronenberg films, the grotesque characters of Shivers, the mind control body horrors of Scanners, and the bleak queasiness of Dead Ringers.However, like Dario's original film, its a victim of its own success, both films manage to convey such a build up of atmosphere and mystery that you expect a great pay-off at the end. Where the original film's climax didn't go far enough, this film's climax goes too far. Think Hammer Horror Film on acid. I half expected a CGI Christopher Lee in full Dracula garb to turn up and perform a ritual, and I actually had to stop myself from laughing in the cinema. The sad thing was that under all the madness the premise of the scene was actually a good one, but it was completely obscured by all the ridiculousness. I left the cinema thinking of what might have been if that scene had been filmed differently. Having said that there was enough in this version of Suspiria that would make me want to watch it again, as its undeniably spellbinding for most of its duration. It has not insulted the original, and stands on its own 2 feet thankfully, it could have been a lot worse.",Suspiria

Even if there's a questionable subplot, it just wasn't scary but it was so much more than a horror film. The movie does a great job of telling you exactly what's happening without spoiling. The political atmosphere was a nice touch in scenes. Therefore the color palate was literally muted and gloomy which was also nice touch. I really did like the film. Definitely, it's worth the wait and I found what I expected as a remake of Suspiria. The acting was solid, the direction was strong for all scenes. The score was haunting and successful which was reflecting the atmosphere and the story. There were also incredible visuals and make-up arts in some parts. The choreography, the grotesque horror scenes were amazing. As for acting, Tilda Swanson and Mia Goth were fantastic and Dakota Johnson was also good which I wasn't expected such a good Susie Bannion acting from her. Finally, I really loved the twist at the end. Suspiria (2018) had everything I wanted it to be and more. It was beautiful and horrific and disturbing and sad. As a horror movie, it's not for everyone, but I'm willing to see it again.",Suspiria
467,drjones2000,Style Over Substance,4,8 November 2018,"Ive read a load of these reviews on here and yes this film seems to polarise. To the person who scoffs that the negative reviews come from people who mustn't have seen the film is in denial .
I absolutely adore Argento Films , but I did go into this trying my hardest to take it as a 're imagining' of the original . So far to say that other than character names I don't think much else is lifted from the original film.
Part of me just thinks that classic films should just be left alone . Are we too devoid of culture to imagine something new? Imagine if someone butchered Tenebrae.
Anyway. This film is actually quite beautiful and I think Tilda Swinton definiately adds that ominous threat to the film whilst everyone else kind of reminds me of characters off the witches. The dream sequences are very effective in delivering the horror , and the scene with the chick getting mangled in the studio was kind of cool. But then it all turns into a metal video and becomes far far to literal . I just couldn't with the end . It got totally ruined . I've left the cinema asking more questions surrounding all the pointless sub plots, the lack of character development which make the sub plots seem a little confusing . Why did it need to have so much else going on ? I like love how in an Argento film there is always a build to a grotesque grande reveal with a twist to which there was NONE. In fact the 'twist' was just stupid and literal .Seriously still can't get over how the end was compared with the beauty of the dream sequences . I wish Marilyn Manson made a cameo ala spell on you . It was ridiculous . I also didn't like the way the film was spilt into acts, It took away from the suspense of the film.
I would go and see it again to try make sense of it but I don't think I could go through it all again. It's way to long .Don't get me started on the soundtrack. It was rubbish. That was an integeral part of the original . This just took away from the film. If a psychedelic rock group was hard to come by they would have been better suited using a coldwave / synth band to soundtrack or even someone like Arca . It was too chic to be believable 1970s anyway . In fact I think the outfits in the original Giallo films are far superiorIt was very good ... to look at .",Suspiria

Sorry if this review comes across as rant-ish, but I've never seen a movie so EMBARRASSED to be a remake. If Luca G-whatever his name is wanted to make a horror film, he should've created his own original property instead botching an already great movie!And I get it, the original Suspiria is NOT a masterpiece, but what it has that this version absolutely DOES NOT is visual style, fantasy, and a sense of wonder and mystery. Suspiria (2018) feels like a dull, drab, depression that the viewer can never escape.And MAN, how about that final 30 minutes or so? If you were scared at all during the film's first few acts, be prepared to be absolutely rolling on the floor laughing during the sacrifice scene. I was falling asleep up to this point so it was great to laugh at some Blumhouse demon making old people's heads blow up.Heres a quick controversial opinion: this films visuals suck. The colors are ugly, the production design and costumes are lazy, the camera work is shoddy (the quick zooms remind me of the office), and the use of high frame rates reminds me of a music video for a nu-metal song.oH BOY DO YOU HEAR THAT? IT'S TIME TO TAKE A HOT LOAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK!!I hate this movies soundtrack. I do! And maybe I'm biased because I think Thom Yorke is a cry baby, but I do love Radiohead so don't come at me virgins.If Goblin's horrifying prog-rock soundtrack is Beethoven, Thom Yorke's ""music"" is comparable to a five year old noodling on a piano when they're bored at a dinner party. And DON'T get me started on his ""singing"", which sounds like a teenage boy crying along to a sad alt song after his first break-up.I'd also like to quickly point and laugh at the dance choreography in the film. It's somewhat similar, but not quite exactly like when your friend invites you to her ballet performance at her liberal arts college and you're expecting it to be something cute like ""The Nutcracker"" or ""Sleeping Beauty"" but you get there and it's titled something French and all the dancers are stomping around out of rhythm while some girl monologues about female anatomy. If you can picture that, you've seen the dances from the film... which is disappointing.Geez I've gone off on a tangent. Well, you probably catch my drift. I really dislike this film, but I'm also just tired of seeing films in theaters that make me feel like total crap when I leave. Please tell me someone feels the same? What I'd really like to see in future horror movies is charisma, color, and character. The three C's. Which I've just made up.I give this dumpster fire a 3/10!

First off, let me say this film is not for everyone (the guy who I fist bumped when we started the film walked out). Frankly, if we are being honest this is a bit of a niche film. Howeverly it is a gorgeous piece of cinema worth give attention to.The cinematography is gorgeous in every shot, and at times will honestly make you questionin what era the film was made in. The socre is somber and a great match with the the bleak tone constructed by Guadagnino. The acting is very well done, and stands strong throughout the film. I personally don't want to give the plot away, or any more information beyond what I have said.I for the life of me can't understand why fans of the original dislike this piece!

The way that Suspiria (2018) interweaves reality with this nightmare that makes the context almost inescapable. The way the film tackles the division of Berlin into its main attraction was really seamless.Dakota Johnson's transformational performance was one of, if not the most in recent memory; the third act really pushed it over the edge for me. Mia Goth is, as always, absolutely brillant. I love her in this so much, she really adds so much to the film. Tilda Swinton is absolutely unbelievable, this is one of the best performances(s) of all time, she has such a broad range of emotions without needing to say a word. That element is what shocked and impressed me most about Luca Guadagnino's vision is it's nuance and the way it relies on emotional subtext.Suspiria (2018) is so soothingly paced and really takes its time immersing you into this sick world. The stunning and perfectly choreographed dancing paired with Thom Yorke's unique and fresh score really allows the film to breathe while keeping you incredibly involved.

There's a lot more people out there who dont like this movie than is allowed to say it, apparently. Be wary of the campaigning.A perfect 10? No way.I'd like it more if it didnt seem so pretentious, self important (rather than telling us a story), and arrogant.. Why couldnt it be like any good art form and just actually in any kind of service to the audience's enjoyment? ""Six acts and an epilogue?"" For 2.5 hours? REally? Ok. I will take the ticket, but I'm expecting to be really moved and really absorbed in the journey. Forget it. This movie is like watching paint dry. I was invited on a six act, plus epilogue, 2.5 hour journey and then forced to watch a mess. Irritated, I'd have given it more points for effort if it hadnt seemed so lazy and arrogant.Ok, 2.5 hours, very bold of you, so take me on that journey then, but in order to be that bold, indeed, it better be a masterpiece. A masterpiece has to be an actual master of form, master of storytelling, master of character direction, master of dealing with the team's talents, etc before you force others to watch whatever you dictate they should. This requires a level of meticulous detail and effort that goes far beyond ordinary thresholds. It requires much more care for the work that is being put into it and the people you invite to it. They dont have to like it, or want to go, you know. So you better care about them.This movie is NOT Dr. Zhivago. It is not an ""epic."" Publicity like that is also why the word ""genius"" doesnt mean a hill of beans anymore. Lawrence of Arabia is an ""epic,"" homies. This is just long. And it's long because it is lazy. Zhivago, Lawrence are epic weavings of tremendous character arcs.This is faux and shallow passing itself off as value; it's like Slavoj Zizek on celluloid, and just as incomprehensible as his blabbery tongue. Russell Brand type ""knowsomethingish"" superficial nothingness.It's wayyyy too lazy and self important to pull together a mastery of the creative team and medium. You get the sense of a tyrant yelling at the editor or the team: ""NO- it's my movie and it has to have all those pointless things in it, because i said so. Put more stuff in it or you're fired!""How is it mastery if it seems like no one was editing it? I'm sure there was someone saying we should edit more, but I cant help imagine it going like ""no, it's perfect, i am genius. "" :-D This suffers the same way a lot of Christopher Nolan's movies suffer from = a real lack of self editing or listening to what doesnt work.ugh.People putting this movie on a pedastal either aren't really expressing why it is even good. It seems like either they are paid to write good reviews for PR purposes, havent seen a lot of movies, or they just like something because it seems artsy fartsy. I'm the first to be thirsty for more independent cinema, less super hero stories, but this movie is not really helping us get there.This movie has no plot points or unifying structure - these are elements of mastery in storytelling. Even most of David Lynch's movies have an inner logic that runs like a thread through all the quirkiness, maintains tone, and sticks to a language that piques interest in the characters. This movie just borrows from other directors.Being able to direct and weave a story together requires an extraordinary amount of development and work, and this movie has no hint of that. i'm sure the writer had a good script at some time, but it seems like someone wanted to just throw anything and everything at it in hopes someone would like them. Cheesy 70s camera tricks and bad frame rate changes mix in strangely with bad cgi, poor costumes and ""avant garde dance theory"" choreograhy. It seems to want to make a point on feminism (spare us the politics please), be a horror movie, be an homage to other great filmmakers, and be an arty ""epic"" all in one. I do remember good cinema, and all of those movies knew what they wanted to be and say. Remember the nineties? Sigh...Subplots wander as aimlessly as tilda Swinton in a fake looking man costume, and just like the conundrum of why she is even in that costume instead of a man, also these subplots never get resolved or have any clearer of an aim. How is that mastery?I went home and binge watched some great movies just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.*I wrote 2 reviews here because my first one didnt seem to be published.",Suspiria
479,peter_the_great_scott,"Guardadingno Pretends a Pretentious Play, it's Pretty Pathetic",1,8 November 2018,"I had to find excuses to leave the cinema. Get a popcorn, go to the bathroom, make a phone call. This movie had me so fidgety with boredom and aggravation that the director's arrogance to force audiences to sit through 2.5 hours of drivel is apparent so much on every scene in this movie.Luca Guardadingno seems to want to be like other great directors, so he just borrows their look and their technique and throws a bunch of loosely connected ideas to the wall and hopes they stick. He brags a knowledge of cinema as if that will save his own messy undisciplined approach to storytelling.There's a very real kind of pretentiousness permeating everything in this movie. None of it seems to be for the audience enjoyment. Confident filmmaking would be something, and there's plenty of that in most movies, but you get the sense that the surefire vision of most filmmakers is backed up by some kind of discipline and mastery and a respect for the audience experience. Crack the whip, bring the best out of the story, the crew, drive your compulsion to a near perfectionism and you end up with something great. That would have been great.Because audiences tend to sense the passion within a project.This is something else entirely. One imagines Guardadingo cracking a whip at his crew while playing on his iphone.It's just a mess. A messy messy mess. A slow, painful mess. Expect to at least have some unintended laughs at the end. The ending is so so dumb, like a school play made by teenagers.",Suspiria
480,Quadruplex,German Autumn meets Italian horror,3,2 November 2018,"Set in the ""German Autumn"" of 1977 the movie tries to confront the supernatural horror of ""Suspira"" with the earthly horror of the RAF terror. But like the psychoanalyst Dr. Klemperer (Tilda Swindon) who is not able to help his patient Patricia the director fails to give some analytical insight in the nature of horror itself. We get some well composed pictures, a moody light and some good acting but the director missed his target. He has studied the history of the Italian cinema exploiting and dismembering the human body. But while those cheaply produced pictures often gave some insight in the nature of horror, terror and fascist politics this movie is just set in a gloomy Berlin struggling with its Nazi-past, the wall and a leftist terror group. It was not a happy time that message is delivered but unlike many delTorro movies it fails to mirror the horror of reality with the horror of the spiritual world - well unless you take mirror literally.",Suspiria

The socre is somber and a great match with the the bleak tone constructed by Guadagnino. The acting is very well done, and stands strong throughout the film. I personally don't want to give the plot away, or any more information beyond what I have said.I for the life of me can't understand why fans of the original dislike this piece!

Bummed to see so many poor ratings on a movie that has so much hard work put into it! The acting is amazing, cinematography is great, music is as elegant as the dancers but not too generic, dancing is fantastic, and the build (though can be a slow burn) pays off. This film is like wine, let it breathe and sip on it. Don't bro chug like a vodka redbull, it's not that kind of movie.

This new Suspiria 2018 version has nothing to do with what made the original a masterpiece. It's a total mess with hardly any music at all. A very cold and pretentious movie with laughable scenes (The 2 policemen visiting the dance school and the dance performances). It's like the producers, directors never cared or comprehended what made the original film so special. An insult to Dario Argento's original film and fans. He must not be happy about this chaotic disaster.",Suspiria

The original film wasn't as much about characters or story as it was about incredible visuals and cinematography. This movie instead takes plot points from the originals, fleshed them out and expanded upon them incredibly well.
All around great performances. Tilda Swinton, however stood out to me the most. She played three different characters and I didn't even realise until days later!
The soundtrack by Thom Yorke is beautiful and fits suprisingly well into a movie like this.
I loved this movie from beginning to end. Even though there's a lot of hate around this film, I can't recommend it enough. You'll very likely find a lot to enjoy about it once you get over the fact that it isn't the same movie as the original.",Suspiria

It deserves being seen several times; the acting is absolutely phenomenal (Tilda Swinton, as always, delivers), the soundtrack by Thom Yorke is one of the best soundtracks ever in my opinion, and Luca's directing is sublime. The disappointment I think comes from those who want everything spelled out in a movie for them, but some things (like this film) need a longer time to sink in and digest. It's a beautiful, haunting film which is a great contrast to the original technicolor nightmare. I love the direction Luca took this in, and it's eerily haunting and sad in a way.

This movie started off SO STRONG, but at the end of it everything just falls apart entirely. The story goes nowhere and the elements just never amount to anything substantial since the end seems like it has no connection to the rest of the movie.So many characters felt thrown in just for the heck of it like the old doctor which I'm even more confused why they made Tilda play his role instead of just... hiring an actual old man since she playing him made no difference to the story aside of giving us an old man with the voice of a 14 year old.The ending felt like it came out of nowhere. It didn't explain the purpose of any of the characters. What where they even doing, what they wanted. Why Suzy suddenly... What was Markos, what where the sisters or...Well, the movie looked good and had great inspirations. They nailed the aesthetic, actually, they made it way better while staying true to the old cinematography. Is it worth watching just for that if you are a fan of the original? Probably not.",Suspiria
489,tonyjohncooke,I really enjoyed this film. Strong style and presence belies complex story telling of a supernatural mystery with a twist.,10,30 July 2020,"FWIW my 3 favourite films are Alien, The Lion in Winter (1968 version) and also this.This film has such a strong style to it, it has a definite mood. It sounds beautiful and strong, it looks beautiful and strong. Thom Yorke's soundtrack, is well matched to the Berlin Art, costume and dance style of the movie, strong, ""modernist"" synthetic experimental and while it isn't my usual thing, I really like it here as it's done *so* well by people whose work I've liked in other things.But this film is more than style over substance. It also has had a lot of thought put into terms of not only it's story but the way it tells it. It's my opinion that this film has A LOT going on.It doesn't hold your hand and walk you through its back story, as it's heavy with the ""show don't tell"". Like the main character, you arrive in the middle of something already going on, and more so, in a different world where little is explained to her/you, and you have to pick things up as you go (could be a photo, an object placed somewhere, or a conversation in the background). Some things may not make much sense to start, but keep them in your mind as it *is* all there. Futher, like any good mystery its easy to make assumptions without having all the information.Like The Lion in Winter, it bares repeat viewing. With the second viewing, when you know what's *really* going on, not only does it give context and relevance to certain things leading to lots of ""Ah"" moments, but more importantly IMO, it also changes the meaning of key scenes making them read very differently.
As such, I think, the director was deliberately choosing to appear ambiguous at times to mislead. A bit like Fight-Club, the second time can be almost like watching a different movie.It's beautiful, it's dark, it's well acted and it's clever.Did I also mention I liked this movies style?",Suspiria

I found it to be an unnerving descent into madness, yet beautiful and poetic at the same time. I felt that the director was trying to make this film a love letter to the original film while still carving out his own original path. Admittedly, I do think the film is a tough watch. It's incredibly slow and there are some parts I would have cut down, but this isn't the kind of film you put on to have a good time. I appreciated the director's attention to detail and the incredible score. The last 20 minutes of the film are where things really take a turn and I think those final visuals were absolutely entrancing. If you're in the mood for something on the tedious side, then block out 3 hours of your evening to take in this project.Tilda Swinton gives a tour-de-force performance, Dakota Johnson carries a naive charm throughout, and Mia Goth really shines through with vulnerability in her character Sara.",Suspiria

The Plot was not bad, the ""witch"" thing was enjoyable and the dances were good but as a said before there was too much in the middle.
Also the movie was sold as an horror movie and was not, the only horror happens in the Olga scene and nothing more. The movie was more like a drama and a comedy.

I LOVE the original Suspiria directed by Dario Argento, and Call Me By Your Name was fantastic. All the talent involved (Thom Yorke, Tilda Swinton, etc.) made this seem like an instant classic before it came out. Then I watched it. All the elements that made Guadagnino's previous film amazing and all the elements that made the original film a giallo classic are nowhere to be seen here. Let's start off with the cinematography. The original film was gorgeous, stylish and impeccably shot, with colourful set design and beautiful wide angles. The remake is boring in terms of palette, with overwhelmingly blah browns and greys and very claustrophobic in terms of shots. This was a huge disappointment for me, as Call Me By Your Name was absolutely fantastic in terms of its cinematography and was one of the reasons I loved it so much. Second, this film is very unfocused narratively. Cryptic to the point of being alienating, the connections to the political turmoil in West Germany in the 1970s are annoyingly pointless and do not serve any purpose to the narrative. While this film features some great performances from its heavily-female cast (Swinton in particular KILLS it!), Dakota Johnson leaves a lot to be desired as the protagonist, with not much emotion being shown, and a very cardboard performance overall. Let's talk about the runtime for a second. This film DOES. NOT. NEED. TO. BE. TWO AND A HALF GOD DAMN HOURS LONG!! Considering how tight the original film and guadagnino's past films are edited, this is a huge disappointment and left me feeling exhausted after finishing my screening in the theater. Overall, Suspiria is possibly worth a watch out of curiosity, but i do not recommend it, even to fans of arthouse cinema like myself and definitely not to those who are looking for a modern retelling of Argento's finest. 5/10",Suspiria

I didn't find it confusing at all too, everything is really well explained in the film, you just have to pay some attention to it.
A second viewing of this film is a must I believe, to fully appreciate the plot, I've seen it once, but I know I'll watch it again in the near future. For me it was one of the best films of 2018, and let's all appreciate that 2018 was an amazing year for horror films. This one will be a cult movie in a few years, I don't doubt it, and everyone will be praising it then.That's my humble opinion, may be be right, may be wrong, but I really recommend it. I truly believe that all these low scores are underserved. A movie can't have so many great things and be considered a 1, 2, or 3 out of 10.",Suspiria
519,mijokuki,"Amazing film, but not enough explanation in the end",9,3 February 2021,"Amazing acting, amazing sound. Good story and a good variation of an ending.
It's different from the original. The ending was unexpected. The only thing missing from the film if you ask me is some kind of explanation why the caven had any powers if the real Mother suspirium wasn't among them at all.",Suspiria
520,justingonzo,A post-modern masterpiece that won't be appreciated,10,10 November 2018,"Suspiria is a post-modern masterpiece on par with The Shining (you could even argue is a femeinst retelling of The Shining), and much like Kubrik's masterpiece of perspective this movie simply won't be appreciated for the genius of its storytelling until many years after its release.
You can easily reduce Suspiria to an incredibly simple single plot line that uses shock value to cover some of its simplicities. But Suspiria is a film that does not rely on plot to tell its story. In reality Suspiria is a clever film that manages to tell several stories at once from a near infinite number of perspectives while constantly and intelligently ""showing, not telling"".
For the more simple moviegoer, who wants a movie to be just one thing and tell that thing straightforwardly, then Suspiria may seem like a pretentious and overloaded movie, while its move impressive details escape them.
Once you add the beautiful camera work, near-perfect acting, and the visceral and heavy horror onto the genius storytelling, it becomes clear why this movie is a masterpiece.
Strongly recommend a second viewing to grasp what this film is really doing.",Suspiria
521,justingonzo,It's not a genre movie. Get over it.,10,7 December 2018,"The remake of Suspiria is not a horror film. It's a post-moderist political drama hiding under the thin veil of ""horror"".
People saying the movies incoherent, or confusing, or illogical sound so much like the critics of The Shining when it first was released. And I'm sure it'll be awhile before this film is fully appreciated just like Kubrick's movie. (I'm not claiming Suspiria is quite on the level of The Shining, but its closest I've seen in years.)
Suspiria is a movie that truly requires at least 2 viewings for it's true treasures to be revealed.
Dont listen to all the angry genre fans. This movie was made by a genius.",Suspiria
522,brycebucher,A Masterpiece in Chaos and the Unseen,9,9 March 2019,"This movie perfectly creates an unrelenting sense of immense discomfort. A very (very) nontraditional editing style is employed along with haunting usage of sound, disorienting diegesis, and a web-like plot structure in order to invoke a sense of a radiation. That is, that there is some invisible physical force consistently plaguing every frame. Given the inherent supernatural flavor of the movie, it is impressive how grounded in humanity it is able to be. By utilizing imperfection, the worst of emotions all come together in order to form chaos, confusion, and an overall, never-ending uneasiness. Tonal shifts are abrupt, distasteful, and often beautiful throughout the movie. I would compare this film to that of Caché in that if a viewer is to stick to a traditionalist viewpoint of film-making, or is unwilling to pay attention, the intended psychological effects will be completely lost. In other words, the horror is mainly conveyed within the viewer's mind. It is because of this that I would recommend going into the movie looking for explicit intention before writing off any strange decision as a poor one, and I would try to neglect any expectations whatsoever. It is likely that the more you think about everything occurring within and outside each frame, the film will click with you in some way, and you will perhaps understand where i'm coming from.",Suspiria
523,alou-74964,"Fan of the original, and fan of this one",9,7 October 2019,"I am a huge fan of Argento's Suspiria, and I absolutely adore Guadagnino's version as well. Obviously it isn't for everyone, but I don't want other reviews to turn off fans of the original. It's a completely different movie-I would describe it as almost the complete opposite-but I enjoy both for what they are. Guadagnino's Suspiria is quite long (my only criticism), and illustrates the dark climate of Cold War Berlin. It also features a lot of fantastic choreography which, as a dancer myself, I felt the original lacked.
I wasn't even going to watch this movie at first, expecting it to be a terrible and trashy remake, but ended up loving it (possibly more than the original, though it's hard to say for sure as they are so different). Again, I understand that it isn't for everyone, but I suggest at least giving it a watch; if only for the incredible performances and haunting soundtrack. I also want to state that it is clear that this film was made with passion, effort and care behind it. Love it or hate it, it is definitely not one of those pointless cash-grab remakes.",Suspiria
524,arghoslent,Dour remake of campy classic,6,1 October 2019,"Dario Argento's Suspiria is a film that embraces camp and black humor, is full of vibrant color, and makes absolutely no pretense about having a greater meaning, or anything that could reasonably be called a plot for that matter.Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria is a film that revels in drabness, has no room for fun, and labors under an overwrought story concerning the backroom intrigues of a coven of witches, revolutionary politics, and the tolls of the Holocaust. It is, in short, completely and utterly dour and self-involved.It's the kind of movie that only big budgets and marquee talent could make and is so naked in its indifference toward its cult source material that reusing the names of its principal characters seems more like more of a jab than a nod. Its virtues are the virtues of most any lavishly funded middle-brow drama--competent acting and cinematography, a score that works well to underline the emotional tenor of its scenes (when Thom Yorke isn't warbling over them, anyway), but its charms are thin on the ground.",Suspiria

But Avengers Endgame has its 8.9 or something... Wich in my opinion was a terrible movie(even though I started watching MCU movies since Iron Man 2008. I don't usually get scared with horror movies but this really freaked me out. I remember some of the scenes in the film The Witch(2015) that coven at the end of the movie was perturbing, but this movie took it to another level and I just loved the whole Contemporary Ballet tematic along with the 70's Berlin wich was a caos back in the day.

I've seen much, much worse (Transformers, anyone?). It has an interesting use of dance and dance characters, make-up and some of the camera-work, and it says a lot about the kinds of places dancers inhabit, both mentally and socially. Tilda Swinton is great and even Dakota Fanning is right for this part - that is, as an empty shell who's used for nefarious purposes. In terms of the mid-70s vibe, it doesn't feel authentic, but it's an interesting film - give it a go if you're in the mood to watch dance. It's certainly no worse than Black Swan.",Suspiria

Boring.....iR",Suspiria
539,bluepulsar,Nice but slow,6,23 March 2019,"As a fan of Argento's movies (except the last ones), I was curios of the Suspiria remake, and finally I saw it.
I liked many ideas of Luca Guadagnino (the typical preambolo of a negative conclusion :-)).
The dark atmosphere and locations, the witches and their complicity are great. The scene of how the witches have fun of the policemen is great and disturbing. The eerie dancing at the movie's end is awesome.
I loved Madame Blanc and the performance of Tilda Swinton is the best thing of the movie.
But the story goes slowly and it often bores me.
However, the worst defect of movie is the end, which disappointed all my expectations (and my wait).
Indeed, my only reason to watch the entire movie was to see what happen to Madame Blanc and her relationship with Susie. I expected the movie's end was the rigth place for the best shot of Tilda.
For me there were many possible movie's ends, even trivial but acceptable:
A great speech of Madame Blanc like Al Pacino in ""Scent of woman""A sadistic and disturbing Madame Blanc kills Susie after a long torture (the latter deserved such end)Susie is the child Madame Blanc never had, so Madame Blanc starts a magnificent war against the others witches to save SusieDue to their lesbian relationship, Madame Blanc and Susie tries an escape like ""Thelma and Louise""Witches are all lesbians and the conclusion is a final awesome orgyMadame Blanc reveals to Susie ""I am your mother"", like Darth Vader in Star WarsInstead, after an exaggerated slowlyness of great part of the movie, Guadagnino shows a short ending, wasting the Tilda's performance and showing an embarrassing Jabba-the-Hut Mother Markos wearing ridiculous eyeglasses, and a Bruce-Lee-killer demon.
Anyway, after the disappointment, I had the strength to also drink the last boring bit of the ending.
Jokes aside, the movie is often slow and even if the ending made me feel really betrayed, worth seeing it.",Suspiria
540,Skalopinus,I was not disappointed,8,26 March 2019,"First off all, I loved the first film. I'm a big fan of Argento horror. Use of color, music, atmosphere, etc... I knew before watching this film that Argento's particular cinematic style was not going to be fully if at all represented. As was made evident by the trailers. This director went a different way, but I didn't find it offensive. It had its own darker, grittier atmosphere and focus. It also centered more on the dancing. Something the first film barely touched on, and I wanted to see more of. It had more depth of character and story than the first one as well. I was taken aback by all the negative reviews. reimaginings are always tricky, and messing with nostalgia invokes very strong emotions, but I wasn't offended.

545,Primarchi,Putting things in the right perspecitve,9,4 August 2019,"Alright, I am flabbergasted by the plethera of 1/2 Star reviews for this movie. I've just rewatched it yesterday and it is really great. All the bad reviews made me create an account on IMDB just to comment.
I am no movie critic, but I love movies so I feel obligated to help a good one out. Maybe I am not ""dissapointed"", because I have never watched the 1977 original. Ok. But as a movie it is just good. The pacing is good, the characters are well written and I certainly don't understand the critique that it lacks story, or progress. It's literally all there. Maybe people don't like the rather slow build up, maybe people just want Optimus Prime to kick some Decepticon ass, ok. But this just is another kind of movie.
I'll put it in anothe rway: one of my favourite all time movies is ""A Straight Story"" by David Lynch. I was moved and captivated by the whole movie pretty much from minute 1 onward. Suspiria might not have gotten that deep, but it still drew an understandable world with its own tragic turns and bizarre twists (pardon my pun at the dance scene where that one dancer gets mangled by suspiria). Picturing dance as the source of witchcraft is nice and poetic as old depictions often show witches dancing around fires and so on. I just didn't get the Baader Meinhof theme throughout the movie. I mean a single mentioning could have set the time-stage at being around the RAF Terror in germany. That was weird, but I don't want to nit pick here.
I honestly don't know how it's possible to ""hate"" that movie. The acting was great, the setting is just nice, the motifs are interesting and well developed. And it's not childishly stupid as many other movies that hint too much at something that might have a crucial part in the plot (e.g. the main character is established as being great at baking, thus he/she will bake her way out of a situation). Here the turning of the protagoinist at the end is hinted at, but could be interperted in a completely other way aswell. It might have been planted into her to be a vessel for Marcos and so on. It wasn't. She is Suspiria. The lore is just well enough explored aswell. No need for a know-it-all kid to go to a library in a montage and find old newspaper articles about some cult of three immortal witches and so on.OH well enough rambling. I really think this is a good movie. Maybe not worth the 9 stars I gave it here, but 8 definitely. I just felt obligated to give it a higher score because of all the bad reviews here.",Suspiria

For those who wanted to see a remake, this is not one; this is a gruesome and perverse artistic interpretation, and it blew me away. Thom Yorke's music is the icing on the cake.Most of the people who wrote these reviews didn't like it because 1) it was too long/boring, 2) wasn't anything like the original, 3) it was too pretentious, and/or 4) because it was perverse and satanic.Slow burners aren't everyone's thing, and that's ok! I however LOVE slow burners because I am a fan of cult films. If you liked Hereditary, you will love this.Go into this thinking it's an artistic interpretation and you won't really think of it as the same movie because it genuinely is a very different kind of film. Also, folks have deemed this to be too pretentious and hard to understand. I am on the autism spectrum, and watched this with zero context and completely understood it.Maybe it's just me, but horror is something that is supposed to shock and disturb me. I am not a fan of jump scares. I want to be scared by the dark, gory, and perverseness of a film, not a cheap scare.

I would say the only link to the original besides the character's names is that the core of the film is about a dance school run by witches. Aside from that, they are nothing alike.

Far too much voice-over (I guess as psychic conversations or maybe they are overheard, but whatever they are they sound like second year philosophy and English lit majors trying to impress each other but not knowing what they are talking about). Did it have its own dreamlike horror as the original film? No, not really at all. Any of the horror scenes were lesser versions of things we have already seen in other movies.If you want art house horror, check out Amer (2009), a much better tribute to the Italian genre, Starry Eyes (2014), or even Rob Zombie's Lords of Salem, where a much more engaging coven of witches played by strong, older actresses bring real scares and a feeling of a nightmare to the screen.

570,SnackaSkitHorunge,Another great film.,9,23 May 2020,"After twelve years on IMDB and I have never felt the need to write a review untill now. The reason I feel that this movie deserves one is because of the flood of blatant fake reviews that this movie have recieved, most of the 1 star ""reviews"" are just copy/pasted cries from people that cant think for themselves and gets offended by virtualy anything and fanboys of the original Suspiria, that are completly disregarding the fact that the only recemblence between the two movies are that they take place in the same universe.I understand that this movie is not for everyone. It's dark and beautiful, disturbing and wonderful, and those concepts dont mix for everyone.
I also think that a lot of people goes into this movie expecting a classic horror movie which would explain some of the more sincere of the negative reviews.This movie defies all genres. It's not a horror, thriller, drama or romance, but has an artistic blend of all of them, wraped up in a disturbing package that requires some afterthought and getting out of your comfort zone in order to process it.
I rarely give any movie this high a score and i honestly cant wait to see it again.I highly recomend that you watch the film with an open mind, try to analyze the scenes and the feelings it awakes in you, and not comparing it to a movie that is over 40 years old.",Suspiria

It did an excellent job captivating and keeping my attention, which is frankly not an easy task. The imagery and cinematography is beautiful as well.

It needs to be said, this is not a typical horror. It is more of a drama exploring various aspects of our lives, including political and historical contexts.
I am a huge fan of Dario Argentina. And I will go as far as to say that this movie is far better than the original. But to truly understand the plot you really need to watch his original Mother trilogy.
This is a long but very engaging movie. Every moment, every frame is beautiful and thought through.
Acting is excellent. Tilda Swinton is a star, but Dakota Johnson did a great job too, far better than in the movies that made her famous. The rest of cast was very talented as well.
Reviewers that have this movie 1 star probably expected something like Annabelle, but this is more like Pan's Labyrinth...",Suspiria
579,whovian1977,A masterful reweaving of a classic film,10,4 November 2018,"Dario Argento's Suspiria is a simple, scary fairy tale my parents told me when I was a child; Suspiria 2018 is the full-blown literary novel of that story. It is an incredibly intricate and thought-provoking vision that answers many questions the original story left behind.Don't get me wrong, Argento's Suspiria is still the best horror film ever made. Argento was at the top of his game when he made that particular masterpiece -- an assault on both video and audio senses that is both beautiful and disgusting. We'll probably never see anything like it again.Luca Guadagnino was wise enough to not imitate the original and instead take the bare-bones story and flesh it out into a solid landscape of love vs hatred, good vs evil, themes of sisterhood, motherhood, political anarchy, forgiveness and (best of all) the importance of dance -- balance. To say this story goes nowhere is absolutely absurd. Clearly lots of folks were too put off by the slowly paced development of the plot and themes of this film or annoyed by the frequent occurrences of German dialog accompanied by English subtitles (as well as occasional lines of English spoken in a German accent that are difficult to understand) to pay attention. This story has a clear beginning middle and end. There's a specific reason why this particular coven of witches is running a dance school for girls, and dance is unquestionably the central point of the story. There's no reason for Dario's original to be set in a dance school other than for visual aesthetics; that's why at one point a previous director for this ""remake"" was going to set it in a sorority house. Guadagnino's Suspiria carefully weaves Argento's fragile plot into a loving tapestry of solid story and themes for viewers to discuss. It's not trying to be better than the original; it's a loving embellishment answering fans' questions about the original, and this version's 2.5 hour length acknowledges Argento's vision isn't easily explained.The Seventies setting is appropriate, a time of darkness with seemingly no hope for a bright future; yes, that's also a theme and is a crucial aspect to the film's ending. Whereas the original's music is often frenzied, this one's more peaceful but still beautiful. The acting is stunning here, certainly better than the original. Tilda Swinton, Chloe Grace Moretz and Jessica Harper were obviously going to be fantastic, but I never would have dreamed Dakota Johnson would make a solid lead; she's much more serene as Suzy Bannion than Harper was in the original Suspiria, and there's an important reason why she plays it that way; you have to see the ending to understand why. I'm certainly not knocking the acting in Argento's incarnation which has a few standouts, but this one is terrific across the board, with Tilda Swinton leaving me thinking she may be the greatest actor of our time. Then there is the brief after-credits scene: another touch of genius, a significant moment unlike those of nearly every pointless Marvel movie. To call Guadagnino's Suspiria a remake or reboot is an insult to the masterpiece he has created; in fact, it is best called what he himself calls it -- an homage.If Suspiria weren't an homage it could possibly rival Citizen Kane and Donnie Darko as one of the best movies ever made but, sadly, it wouldn't exist if it hadn't been inspired by Argento's Suspiria, still the best horror film ever made. Nevertheless, this new Suspiria is a masterpiece of atmosphere and creepiness, storytelling, themes and performances. Its length, subtitles and full-on male and female nudity will prevent it from being anything more than art house fare for most people. Still it's a top ten horror film and at least a top fifty of all time film for this viewer.",Suspiria

583,mindblast-520-626693,Eyes wide open,8,3 November 2018,"Saw this piece of cinema at a local pre-screening in Sweden. Let's start this right of bat: this movie is BRUTAL. Let me put it this way - As we walked out to the cinema the two girls behind me both apologized to each other for seeing it. As a huge fan of Call Me by Your Name I was so excited to see what would be next for Luca Guadagnino, and it turns out it's a total 180 from the warm, wholesome and summery 2017 drama. I think it's safe to say now that Luca knows the tuning of our heartstrings, and this film has many moments where it feels like he's forcefully pulling on one of them right in front of our eyes and we don't know when or if it will snap. The bleak story of Susie and the dancing academy is being told with beautiful, creative cinematography that often pays homage to an era of more practical special effects. Both a joy and a scare to watch. Combine this with intriguing and very alive camerawork together with bold, in your face-editing and you have a film you can watch for the visuals alone. Audio is great equally creepy, a standout part to mention here is the soundtrack by Thom Yorke himself - it's fantastic, although I'm not entirely sold on it's kind of modern sound here. You'll find most discomfort of all in the violent and gory parts of the movie though. Without spoiling, there's a scene involving luring in a ballerina in a dancing room that has potential to be the most visceral and truly unsettling violence in a long time. Yes, even worse than the brick scene in Dogtooth. Right after that he entire audience went DEAD silent all around, it will be interesting to see if it will be remembered like a number of other notable violent scenes in cinema have been. All this wouldn't work though if it didn't have any good acting to spring from - But thankfully the acting is great all around. The dancer girls are suberb at acting out pain, despair, sadness and madness, and Tilda and her teacher crew creates an amazing set of solid authoritarian characters. This is a film leaning towards being driven by characters and the social aspect rather than plot, in fact it's quite hard to pick out a solid answer what the film is about after one watch. There's a lot to process here and it might be that every person will find different meanings. I simply think the film has a little too many ambitions story-and tonewise while not mastering all of them. For example, yes it's bleak and atmosperic but not on the highest level like The VVitch, and sure, we get an additional storyline via the psychotherapist but it's not too well implemented. I'd like to have seen the film commit harder, to fewer things, and showed it's themes on a deeper level (I suggest explaining Susie's background story further) to make it more cohesive and coherent which is this film's main flaw. I'm not sure if the inevitable second watch is happening anytime soon, but I do know that Suspiria makes for a fantastic hard hitting artistic Halloween horror title!",Suspiria

590,Jacobkolody,Luca Guadagnino puts his own spin on a classic,8,8 November 2018,"""Suspiria"" wasn't playing anywhere in Ottawa so a friend and I decided to make a day of it and drove to Montréal to see it. Let me start by saying I like the original film but I'm not a die hard fan the way some people are. That being said, I almost feel like I can't compare the two because they are such different movies.I had heard a lot of mixed things about this one but I ended up really enjoying it. I'd read so many positive things about Tilda Swinton & Dakota Johnson's performances so I sort of knew what to expect with them (I personally thought Dakota Johnson was so hauntingly sexy in this and did the best work she's ever done) but Mia Goth's performance really took me by surprise. I hadn't really heard anything about her performance in this and I thought she played her part more naturally than anyone else in the film. I was buying everything she was selling. It was so cool to see Jessica Harper back for this, too. Luca Guadagnino's direction was as good as ever and Thom Yorke's score was amazing as well.I found the dance sequences to be strangely hypnotic. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen any time Dakota Johnson was dancing and I could watch the academy perform ""Volk"" 100 times over. I can't wait to watch this movie again.The only thing I really took issue with was the ending. I sort of felt like Luca Guadagnino lost his vision in the big finale. I would have LOVED it had it been in another movie, but it felt a little out of place in this one. I liked that they went about the ending a different way, it just felt a little too campy for a movie that was so beautifully done for the first 2 hours. Nevertheless, I was very impressed. This is the type of film I'd love to see at the next Oscars but I doubt it will get any recognition. At the very least, I'd love to see a nomination for Best Film Editing because it was seriously blowing my mind at parts.OH! And that scene... you know the one everyone's talking about? BRUTAL.

595,dezkill,Something different,9,2 November 2018,"Just to preface I'm a fan of the original Suspiria and was somewhat apprehensive about the remake. Going into any remake always brings a certain level of expectations, especially when thinking back on the original work. I really did appreciate what director Luca Guadagnino was attempting, as it is less of remaking the story but instead spinning the story into a much different direction. Suspiria is very different film than it's original counterpart. While the original was a color heavy, supernatural horror ride the new goes in the direction of a psychological thriller similar to Rosemary's Baby or Black Swan.The Good: Thom Yorke's cerebral score; very smooth pacing that never drags (especially considering it's a 2.5hr feature); Tilda Swinton is great in her multi roles; the setting feels complementary to the color and mood of the film.The Bad: Hit or miss blood and gore effects (practical was great but a heavy overuse of digital in certain moments); strange edits and slow motion that felt like it was right out of a amateur YouTube expose.Overall I thought this was a solid remake and a really good film in it's own right. While many moments did feel like they were leaning a bit too hard into mimicking a classic Italian horror film (wandering camerawork) it is a unique take on a classic and should not be dismissed. Recomended!",Suspiria
596,choc-chip-08,Raw,9,28 November 2018,"I can understand why so many would dislike this movie. Like the original, it leaves a lot without explanation (although I would argue it does have more of a plot than the original). What stood out in the movie for me was the theme of power, and how they presented the power of feminine energy v how patriarchy is represented in the film.It's as if men are useless to them for most of the film, but the use of Jozef in the Suspiriorum sequence as a 'witness' was such a familiar necessity. The fact that he needed to see their power to believe it, like so many feminine issues that are only validated by the male population when there is a male supporting claims or who has witnessed certain events. Despite how men had previously been used as jokes in the movie there is still a reliance on them for validation of their own power.Every sequence showcased feminine energy in such a raw way. The girls in the academy are connected to each other in a powerful way. The monologue by Suzie towards the end about Anke's death and the women who made her feel safe more deeply explored female bonding, as if it is a connection more powerful than death. The use of dance was incredible and much more present than in the original. Dakota absolutely killed it in her role, such an impressive feat. It's definitely not a film I would recommend to just anyone, but it still tops my list for best films of 2018.",Suspiria

598,mariabergman-34389,Amazing re-imagination of a classic,9,27 November 2018,I didn't have high expectations about this but I was certainly proven wrong. The original is basically style over content. This one had both! The dancing became an important ritual and something very disturbing. The story and the acting was miles better than the previous film. The cinematography and hypnotic surreal pace was pure 1970's. It's rare to see such a bold film nowadays when every one are thinking of commercial blockbusters. I can see why some people didn't like it but I think it was a masterpiece. To set it in Berlin right next to the wall was pure genius and the subplot with the doctor was very moving. I still can't believe that was Tild Swinton in prosthetics. Just an incredible performance.,Suspiria
599,joefish-94141,Brilliantly misunderstood,8,30 June 2020,"Watch the 1977 version first is my advice. The film strays away quite drastically from its original portrayal from Argento, but the modern format is the better of the two.Firstly, interesting cinematography combined with a haunting score from Thom Yorke really helps the films overall creepy feel.The emphasis on the dancing and attention to detail is excellent. The first film fails to deliver on this which is surprising considering it focuses around a ballet company. Dakota Johnson and Mia Goth really did train hard to be able to pull off the intensity of the dances so full credit where credit is due.The ending wasn't my favourite, once again straying extremely far away from the original, and although I prefer this one, there are a couple of things I'd love to pick the directors brain over.My only other quarrel is sort of back handed considering she did a great job but Tilda Swindon's portrayal of the Doctor as well as Blanc was uneeded. Although the make up was excellent and the acting was good, it was almost like an uneeded power play. Told a is one of the rare few in Hollywood who can get away with this and she should be proud of her commitment, however it does seem just like an odd decision.Overall, it's well worth a watch, ignore the people slating the film.

As this films traverse in the oposite virtues of the original, fans doesn't recognize it, most of them hate it. And that's why they won't forge this one: it's not a cheap easy work, it rescues the original mitology of the Three Mothers, it doesn't dismiss the turmoil at that time, it connect's indirectly the covens internal conflict with it, it makes the original accidental heroe into a superheroe (or supervillain)... Nope, this was not for any Argento fanatic, whose have plagued all media with screams of disconfort and ridiculous complains.
Don't worry: The movie was a mess in the box office.There won't be any sequel, as it wasn't planned to be about Tenebrarum or Lachrymarum but origins of Markos.

But these films, which are not only a children of their time, but also influence it and become part of the public as works of art, still exist and Suspiria is one of them! Once you look back on 2018, you won't be able to get past Suspiria. This film is highly postmodern: it looks back (German division, RAF, Holocaust), deconstructs all elements (in story, aesthetics and montage), expresses its feelings in expressive dance with a lot of physical effort, including nudity, until everything ends in chaos. But Luca Guadagnino goes one step further in his remake of the Dario-Argento-Suspiria, he also deconstructs the chaos, he finds his way back to the ground of facts, to hard reality, he also finds love again. And so he finally finds his way back to cinema, to the power of cinema. In beautiful 35mm shots he shows human relationships, tragedies and sees in them, like Jonas Mekas, ""brief glimpses of beauty"".",Suspiria

It is a complete contrast from Dario Argento's movie and is best viewed as a separate piece of work. While Argento's masterpiece is rich in colour this is the opposite and very muted throughout.

604,paytonmichael,"A slow, disturbing descent into the jaws of Hell, interwoven with history and emotional themes",8,5 May 2019,"I cannot express my love for Suspiria (2018) enough. This film takes the horror format to new places, a film about so much more than its premise. While, yes, on the surface it is about a young prodigy (Dakota Johnson, in an awe-inspiring physical role) attending a mysteriously macabre ballet academy where the headmistresses (led by an astounding Tilda Swinton) are up to some supernatural stuff, director Luca Guadagnino (Call Me by Your Name) packs his film with poignance and grace as can ballet at its finest. This is also a historical fiction which uses the ballet academy as a metaphor for the conflict in East Berlin. It is a film about accepting death and processing grief. It is a meditation on sisterhood and sorority, and ultimately, a portrayal of motherhood in all its complexity and love, however hard to understand. Top it all off with amazing editing and sound design, camerawork evocative of 70s grindhouse horror, some seriously marvelous dancing and choreography, and a wildly inventive score by Thom Yorke of Radiohead (this score has LYRICS), and you have an atmospheric, artful thinkpiece that, when all is said and done, has its gut-wrenching body horror cake and eats it too. Don't walk in expecting The Conjuring or Saw. This is not popcorn horror, and it takes about 40 minutes to build to the real scares. It's uneasy from the get-go, and the suspense is sustained until it hits you. But oh boy. Does it hit you. Hard. This film is not the goriest I've seen, but it has some of the most disturbing imagery I've experienced onscreen. As it becomes more of an acid trip in a crescendo of intensity, it becomes clearer why all that buildup is warranted. It's a slow burn, but the big ""WTF IS HAPPENING"" finish is well worth it. Let Guadagnino's experimental filmmaking and the emotionally resonant performances pull you in, and marvel at the spectacle once you are successfully entranced.

It is so dry and boring and drags on and on. 30-45 minutes could be excised and this still wouldn't make much sense but would be easier for some poor soul to suffer though.Anybody remember Friday the 13th:The Series late 80's tv show? The dancing in this mess was taken from that (episode The Maestro)...TEXTBOOK. There's another scene towards the end that is eerily similar to the pig gut puking scene in Gates of Hell...it worked there, it's just completely out of place here.There is no horror in this mess, there is nothing remotely scary about it, where's the atmosphere I kept hearing about? There is none. What this is as as dull as a funeral. NO character development so you don't give a toss about any of them or what happens to them. There is no lush cinematography. Where Argento created a delightful and gorgeous nightmare world, this entire mess looks like it was set in a crack den. It would have been nice if they could have decided if they wanted it to be the TANZ or The Markos school...both terms were used in the film.Tilda Swinton- I'm so sorry to do this to an actor but WHAT was she trying convey? She speaks in a weird tone attempting to sound mystical. She comes off as someone DEEP in a Morphine haze. She has no grasp of this character. AND she played a triple role? WOW, and not in a good way.Don't even get me going on Ms. Tanner..what a JOKE in this movie...NOBODY but NOBDY can play Ms. Tanner like the lovely, late Alida Valli. I knew this was coming. Madame Blanc was a joke a well. The staff looks like a bunch of old drunk slappers.I may as well end it here because there's nothing redeeming in this mess to actually review and like. Only reason I endured this was to prove to myself how bad I knew it was. And people have the audacity to slam Argento for his masterpiece? Only the kids will watch this junk. Two and one half hours of my life I can never get back.Save your time and money...this is a complete waste of both.

I loved the original, but I'm so glad this is more of a homage than a carbon copy. The soundtrack, the sound design, the acting, the disturbing imagery, the bleak color pallet, all made for everything I look for in horror. I really hope we see a few more films in this universe.",Suspiria
609,mmelanthe,Outstanding!,10,4 March 2020,"I was stunned at how good this film was compared to the original. While the original was groundbreaking at the time of its release and has many special qualities such as a superb soundtrack by Goblin and is just full of gorgeous colours, it pales in comparison to the remake. I really enjoyed the underlying themes of feminism and women supporting each other as well. It runs long and builds quietly to a disturbing finale.",Suspiria
610,darkdragon-25432,Made an account to review,9,10 December 2019,"Perhaps I am too young to understand the old 70's horror tropes even I watched and liked many of them I don't like the movies that low on a solid story.That 1977 movie's story was weak against this one since this one perfected the original story. I think I can't argue with the original version's visuals were better arguement. This movie has outgrown it's original by being more realistic (I think one of the original one's flaws are that movie was like a drug fulled nightmare with unnecessary screams I get why people like that however that probably more scary if the think in the movie could became real in a super low chance ,By the way I 'm an atheist with doen't belive in any supernatural however everything has a low chance of happening and this film is one of the most realistic depictions of supernatural I've ever seen) etablishing a better lore ( with exploring those scary old world stories without it seeming to unrealistic.) and a genuine psychological thriller. The people who say that they disturbed and hardly finished this. That's the point. Something like this however it was better midsommar. Also one of my other compliments is you can't forget this movie after you watch it. And if you're watching this as a male like me, that way probably makes this movie more disturbing that it's intended. This experience like being in a women's locker room and waiting to be catched as a creep. (I'm talking about this movie was like something like it didn't intended to seen by me. Also the fact there is almost not a single male that masculine in this movie. Which is Uncanny in next level.",Suspiria

612,wyatt-57857,"Slow Intriguing burn, Confusing dash to the finish",7,20 June 2019,"The film starts of well, with interesting direction and characters with a hefty sense of story progression, I enjoy the incorporation of the real world with the fantastical world in the movie, but some parts felt too drawn out and should have been cut from the movie. as a remake, I appreciate the deviation of the originals execution of the premise of witches running a dance school, going for more a political drama rather than a supernatural mystery, although those beats are fulfilled in this movie as well. fans of the original might be displeased, as this remake does almost everything to counter the style of the original, with it begin a drab, gritty, realistic interpretation of similar event, with aside the finale of the film, but i do think it has a style in it own way, mostly through the cinematography and editing prowess. the final act of the film, however, feels quite drawn out and jarringly visceral compared to the rest of the more grounded nature of proceeding acts, and the soundtrack, while enjoyable on its own, can really take you out of the movie time to time. overall, i think this is one of the more ambitious remakes to ever come out, with it focusing on story and characters rather than visuals and horror of the Argento film, which can be very disappointing to some fans of the original. so i would say come with an open mind about the film, and you may enjoy it better for that.",Suspiria
613,jissactaylor,Worth it to watch,7,8 November 2018,"From a structural stand point there is no limit to how many acts should be in a story but for this film, I felt that revealing the acts to the audience worked against the film. To me, the story was a constant stream of events that didn't need to be noticeably divided. The characters were not developed enough to base this act division on their arcs. Mostly, the acts just served as time stamps, only revealing that the film was too long.The characters in this film did have behavioral arcs where you see a character's ""character"" drastically change at the end of the movie due to the big reveal. There wasn't much depth to them, though, in my opinion. I thought the film's overall grandiose ambition was expressed in the filmmaking but not in the film.I, however, found the film interesting. The world that the characters lived in was one that intertwined in reality, sorcery, and the subtle history nods to Berlin and of the original story that this one is based on. These dynamics seemed to weave in and out of each other.The actors did an amazing job, in my opinion. Dakota Johnson captured the innocence and stoic beginning of her character as well as the physical demands of dancing. The character's evolution throughout the story was only presented through Johnson's performance that even though subtle and slight, was visible. Honestly, the entire cast really sold this film, in my opinion. All of them made me buy into this story.",Suspiria

618,bennyg-72078,The Best Movie of 2018!,10,6 November 2018,"The film world today is full of the often liked and praised vat of cliches. You have the slowly dying/overatted Superhero genre or even the action movie genre that makes as much money as there are pyrotechnics. I'm glad to say that Luca Guadagnino's reimagining of Dario Argento's Suspiria is not one of those ""Popcorn Flicks."" Going into this movie with a level head is probably the best way, yes I watched the trailers (THANK GOD THEY REVEALED NOTHING!) and I read some pre-reviews. None of those formats really took away from the viewing experience at all which is suprisingly not what I expected. 2 hours and 32 minuets later and I can say for myself that Luca Guadagnino has created pure cinematic bliss inside a shell of insanity.
The cinematography was on point with its bleak and visceral images. While the characters are like some you would find in a fairytale with Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton being the absolute best of the bunch. A films music is like its backbone, Suspiria's backbone is fully functional and ready to win the gold medal in gymnastics! Thom Yorkes score is just oozing with mysterious tension that can only be described as ""gracefully haunting."" From the main track ""Suspirium"" which has a lustful and grim tone to the harrowing tension of ""Volk."" Thom has really set the bar for film scores this year.
There is a lot of divisivness and I now understand why. This movie will turn people away by the 2nd act of its 6 act + Epilouge run, for reasons that are complete understandable. People get bored sometimes, they want to watch stuff blow up or to watch people getting cut up with machetes every 10 or so minutes. This movie will ask you to take your time and think about what's happening on the screen: yes there will some shocking moments (Especially the last 25 minuets or so...) that may strike some viewers as horrific and maddening.
Suspira is really a treat for the eyes and ears and I wouldn't be surprised if it got a even less than limited run where its at right now. If you have the time, I would go see it then decide for yourself if all this hate on it is true or not. That up to you though...",Suspiria

623,ninowski-98527,"watch a 2nd time, you'll get it",10,22 March 2019,"The first viewing of this sumptuous film left me stunned (happily), but a little perplexed. What is the goal of these witches? What is the significance of the 2 mothers, and the devil dude? What is going on?? But after a second watch, it started to make sense: brilliant, cunningly executed sense. It all (I believe) hinges on something that the Dr. says to Sarah: essentially, that all institutions think they are doing 'just' or righteous work, when in fact they may have nefarious intentions - hence, the backdrop of Germany in the 70's - the shadow of the Third Reich (hmm, like 3 mothers...), still hanging over the nation, a new radical group comes to the forefront, The Bader Meinhoff gang emerges. They claim to want to destroy the establishment, which still has Nazi ties, but they detonate bombs and cause havoc all of the Berlin as well. And then, in Susie's flashbacks, her mother seems to be under the influence of a religion that shuns medicine/science, and we see the horrors of this institution too. So, the idea that organizations all involve pain in some way is clear - and the witches are just another one of these.All in all, the film is gloriously shot and has the coolest dance sequences ever - the imagery, acting and style is utterly unique.

I'm sorry but you won't get that. Keep that in mind.Obviously, Suspria 1977 is a classic of it's time but honestly, this movie provides so much more than it's original.This remake was done in different way! It's got it's own vibe. Dancing choreography is amazing! Dakota Johnson made me speechless! Whole atmosphere makes you feel like you're in dancing academy also you do feel you are in a disturbing place!Tilda Swinton without a doubt one of the best!Side stories and Dr. Klemperer's own storie make you feel that you are really in.When main theme is witching and their rituals Suspiria 2018 nails that! You are surrounded by them! Not just that. It gets more intresting at the end. No spoilers...If you are a hardcore Suspiria 1977 fan don't watch this. If you are open minded and want see Susipria imagined again you have to see this! Luca Guadagnino finishes what Dario Moreno started. David Kajganich's script makes it easier!",Suspiria
625,compoundeyes,Relies on shock to cover a very basic plot,3,5 November 2018,"Having never seen the original, I came in fresh with only a basic understanding of the original plot. I wasn't influenced by nostalgia or comparison, so I was able to judge this purely by it's own merit. With that said, I wanted to like this a lot. I wanted a psychological horror, I expected some highly graphic scenes, but I thought the plot would keep me engaged.
Well, the psychological aspect ended up falling away in large part, and in its place came pure shock factor that actually served very little purpose to the story and didn't evoke fear either. I'm sure some may think I simply don't understand symbolism and deeper meaning, but I understand plenty of subtlety. Most of it simply had nothing that actually pertained to the story.
For example, the first practice scene, when Olga is trapped in the mirror studio below and begins having her body broken as Susie dances. During this scene, Susie's dancing throws Olga about, sometimes as if she got hit by a car, others as if a force were grabbing her. This scene goes on and on, absolutely brutal and frankly nauseating to watch, but in the end, all it served to show was that the witches... can do that? Susie's abilities as a host I suppose? If depth is something to argue, so much more could have been given in Olga's movements matching Susie's rather than being struck by them, as they were in the same role. Another example is the somewhat subliminal imagery of the dream sequences. These were highly disturbing to watch, very unsettling, and yet none of the imagery really served a purpose. Hinting at the end ritual maybe? I guess? It was either so subtly connected that it was lost, or it was simply put in to unnerve the audience. One or two of these to that effect would have been fine, I get it, but every scene of violence or graphic content had no larger point.
I'm not exactly sure why such a simple plot, at it's core, had to be muddled up with bizarre attempts to give an artsy, pretentious feel. The sheer storyline gives tension, unease, and mystery. Most of the subplots, the with exception of the Psychiatrist, went nowhere, and half of the things the witches did had no payoff later (collecting urine/hair for no reason? The terrorists storyline?). There was nothing that was legitimately scary, I was only scared once when the girl behind Sara started crawling at her, but literally everything else was just disgusting, not scary. It felt like such a waste.
On the positives, because there were a few, the technical aspect of this movie is nearly flawless. The cinematography is stunning, every scene is captivating and the dance scenes are a treat to watch. Even the scenes of horror are filmed perfectly, they have so much more intensity and unease because of how they're filmed (if only they meant something). Also, this is a two and a half hour long movie, but I never felt like it dragged along and that's a massive positive in its corner. Few movies over two hours (and in some bad cases, less) keep me completely engaged, but this managed to. Even if it was only through actual nausea, I was never bored. That being said, if the unnecessary things were trimmed this movie would move at an even better pace and keep more of its tension.
Overall, I'm disappointed. The more I considered this movie, the more I picked it apart and was dissatisfied. It's not the worst I've seen, it has positive aspects, but making me feel nauseous instead of scared would keep me from ever watching it again.",Suspiria

630,olston-65215,A Powerful and Ambitious Piece of Cinema,9,4 November 2018,"Great movie from start to finish. Takes some interesting, yet worthwhile risks. From the very beginning it grabs your attention with interesting shots and transitions and a looming atmosphere, that holds throughout the movie. The film itself works best when viewed with limited expectation. This is especially the case with its marketing. The film seems to give an impression of being one of the most twisted, darkest, horrifying piece of horror to date. And while it is all of those things to an extent, it is even more so a slow unraveling of a suspenseful, ominous, and disturbing tale. I, fortunately, stayed away from most of its marketing past its initial trailer, so my opinions of the film are not ones formed with anticipation of a bone chilling horror film, but of an ambitious and unique approach to the horror genre while using a previously existing movie as a source of inspiration for certain key points. This is ultimately what the movie pans out to be and it does so incredibly. The movie relies heavily on atmosphere most scenes are constructed to maximize a tonal point which, when you're invested in it, it makes the viewing an awe inspiring and riveting experience. I am sure however, that if not truly invested in the film the viewer will feel a lack of clarity and purposefulness to certain film making decisions in the film, however they do all serve their own integral purpose.Positives:
There were some imaginative shots that pay homage to trends of 70's horror directors in terms of camera work.
There was also quite a few interesting and unique shot transitions that surprised me, in a good way.
Many of the characters were developed in an interesting way so they almost feel the same. This is a positive though, as these characters are meant to exude a similar atmosphere and it only results in a larger and more ominous atmosphere. Tilda Swinton did great as usual, and the same can be said about the rest of the main cast.
Sound design was overall very good, there were a couple scenes, one about 2/3 of the way through the movie and the other towards the end of the movie, that did have a slight drop off in quality. However it is largely unnoticeable and it maintains a good quality throughout the film.
The score for the film was great as well, there was one track that comes up at about the halfway mark of the film that I felt was out of focus with the tone of the rest of the film though, the rest of the score blended itself into the film so well that it truly did create an atmosphere that you wanted to be encompassed with.
The dream sequences of the film were edited in such an engaging way that you become engrossed in imagery and they only add even more intensity and anticipation as to what will come later in the film.Negatives: There were a couple scenes of dialogue that were a little difficult to hear despite that not being intended. Both were scenes of dialogue featuring the character, Dr Josef Klemperer. This could perhaps be chalked up to a simply difficult character to perform as Tilda Swinton had to play this old German man, but it must be said that it did take away from my enjoyment of the film a couple times.
I also felt that Dr Klemperers character was a little underwhelming. In terms of the stakes within the story, he bares little importance until the end of the film and even then his impact is minimal. It would be preferable to say that his character serves as a vessel for the audience but not even that is the case. Overall, scenes that were led by this character were a little weak because they usually took away from the progression of the intensity in the film. With all this being said, this film wouldn't be the same without this character, it's just a shame that there were some unintended consequences of his presence.
One of the last scenes of the film, that I will leave unnamed, was one of the best of the entire film due to its pure intensity and unexpectedness. Just as you think the film has shown you all it can offer, it ramps it up even higher and turns you onto a path you never saw coming. Despite this, it must be said that the scene drags on for perhaps a little too long. Not too terribly long that it ruins the scene but the way its shot coupled with its interjected character specific clips did feel a little worn by the end of it.Overall: This film is incredible, it excels in most technical areas and the cherry on top is how it builds a story and atmosphere through such artistically challenging scenes, whether that be dream sequences or even simple scenes where a character is being taught how to perform a simple move for a dance recital. There are a few bumps and bruises along the way in the slew of ambitious decisions made. However they are fairly minor despite being present. Despite this, it shouldn't be ignored that they did take away from the enjoyment of the film in some minor way. Its best to avoid watching this film with the mindset of seeing the original Suspiria with a slight upgrade, because both films are completely different undertakings that simply share some similar plot points, that is all. It is also important to understand that this film is not a brutish horror film, it is still a horror film, yes. But is a daring take on the traditional horror film, blending old and new traditions and using the element of suspense and anticipation as its main element of horror, over cheap jump scares or shock horror.This film is a must see for film enthusiasts for its unique approach and gripping tonal techniques.",Suspiria

Didn't see a lot of horror films this year (A Quiet Place, Hereditary, Annihilation), but this one will stay with me far longer. I hope it receives some nominations, but knowing the Academy, I'm not going to hold my breath. The story, acting, cinematography, score, sound design, and editing were so well put together.

633,assistantptg,At least the original knew it was trashy,1,3 September 2018,"I saw this movie in Venezia and I don't know why anyone will say it is good unless they are paid to say it. Which makes me think that is really what could be happening here (some of the reviews seem laughable and totally contrived and prewritten by someone working for the production) and perhaps this director seems to be living in his own make-believe illusion of himself. Luca Guadagnino is no auteur, but someone who just seemed to have hired a good cinematographer to get some beauty shots, while he was doing something else, but who knows what. The mise en scene is good, but that's about it, but there's more to enjoying a movie than how they set up the shot. I found no elegance to the actual direction, only some flourishes, some sizzle but no steak. It's really unfortunate because movies are magical and evocative, but this director doesn't offer anything new to cinema at all. I've watched three of his movies and this will be the last. They all feel like film school projects, not multimillion dollar pieces of cinema. The acting is melodramatic and unconvincing (that he tries to persuade us that the Psychiatrist is a man and not Tilda Swinton is such a middle finger to his audience, and thereby insults himself as a director. It's such a lame marketing attempt and makes me weep for the future of cinema if such a childish gimmick is what we can now expect to be where cinema is headed.) Auteurs have depth and know how to direct the story itself, invite audience respect, and are able to capture a theme, to pull from actors and crew something more than what they can give themselves alone. I didn't see that at all here. The movie seems lazy and without purpose, flawed - and it was so boring my friend fell asleep in it. There's a lot of jumbled ideas, faux symbolism and seems stolen from artists who were far better at original ideas. It was cool to see Thom York score a film, but it's unfortunate that it was for this movie instead of something that has actual artistic merit instead of a movie trying too hard to convince us that it has that merit. There were parts of this movie that took itself so seriously, and no one was behind the scenes saying ""its not coming across as artistic, it's coming across as funny and if you do that, the audience will laugh at you.""Which is exactly what my friends and I did when we left the cinema. Sad that movies are now being made this way. At least the original is known to be or meant to be trashy. This one seems to think it's high art, when it's more of a mockery of other great art, and somehow had no idea how messy and boring it actually is. Alighieri has a great quote: ""you were not made to live as brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge."" This movie is lost in its own inferno because it trades self knowledge for a self aggrandizing myth of wasteful proportions. I don't reccomend it.",Suspiria

636,vivekvi-02613,Black Swan without the depth,1,18 September 2018,"If you want to see a good movie about dance, that's dark, and has psychological depth to it, (without wasting two and a half hours (!)), I dont recommend this one, but I would point the audience towards movies that have accomplished this elegantly already, such as Aronofky's dance themed movie, Black Swan. On the other hand, a good horror movie involving dance would be the original Suspiria, which was already made. This 2018 remake seems to be an attempt at some kind of art film, and hedges its bets by throwing a bunch of loosely connected ideas and more shallow gimmicks onto the screen to make it seem 'different' instead of an actual homage to Dario Argento's already classic film. Suspiria 2018 seems to be secretly attempting to repeat some ideas expressed beautifully in Black Swan - the ideas of feminity and horrors of transformation, and it then replaces the horror of the original Suspiria with an attempt at high brow intellectualism that unfortunately takes that risk without ever really making a clear point. What it lacks in horror, it finds in the grotesque, but fails even at that because by the end, anything grotesque reaches a point of silliness instead. I was never scared, never intellectually challenged or in suspense, and I wanted to be impressed, but I kept finding myself checking the time and how soon it would be over. There's some nice attempts, but it all gets lost in the tedium and a kind of forced intellectualism that is almost never effective in cinema.Indeed, it's a different movie than any of those it pretends to not emulate, claiming to be something new; but it doesn't quite come across as anything original, not if you know other cinema. Instead, it wants to be Black Swan, a Fassbinder film, and the original Suspiria all in the same whisper. (all puns intended). Too many ideas, but not enough depth to really give it any legs to dance on.The disparity in artistic appeal is that in Black Swan, there is a significance to how dance and female puberty is tied into each other on an allegorical level (the protagonist slowly becoming like the swan played in swan lake), while in this Suspiria, there are no connections made between the iconography and the symbols posited by dance and witchcraft. The appeal of such ideas would be in horror, but while it takes a classic approach to horror, I find it better to just watch the original, as it is the real masterpiece in twisting your emotions.The writer has previouslydone good work (The Terror), and seems like this script probably was good at one time, (conveying ideas of death and rebirth_, but somehow it seems the director lost the writer's work by dismissing any kind of throughline and just threw the kitchen sink at it instead. Coming in way too long, there seems to be a total lack of self-editing, or perhaps, no other producer was there to keep the story/ideas from getting out of control. Opting more for 'a bunch of ideas that will seem clever,' this movie never quite gets the train out of the station, but instead it tries very hard to force the audience along for a journey in which no destination is ever quite clear.",Suspiria

I talked my friends into coming out for what I promised was sure to be an homage to something that was way ahead of its time. I said it was the ""grandfather of ambient, visceral slasher movies with a paranormal twist."" I said it was influential. All of that is true.The new movie has absolutely nothing for the fans of the original.If you watched the original (and you're an idiot), and you said to yourself, ""I really wish this movie had 50 more minutes of dance in it,"" then this is your baby.If you watched the original, and you thought, ""Hey, I wonder what it would be like if I broke the pacing over my knee, crow-barred in a needless WWII tragedy from an entirely inconsequential side-character and ham-handed something about good witches vs. evil witches""...then, I guess this is your version?Jeez.Utter garbage.

638,arrowmeetstarget,Very disappointing. Embarrassing cringe-fest,1,23 October 2018,"I was looking forward to this, but there is not even a story here. The fact that it is an almost 3 hour movie makes that very difficult to sit through. I thought it was cheesy, not really scary, not really horror. I found myself cringing for the sake of the director or whomever was driving it off the cliff that no one was warning them. In short, the filmmakers seem to want to treat the project like a graduate film school thesis. It tries to push the limit of sensation, but ends up a pseudo intellectual bore. They shouldnt have remade Argento's movie unless they could make it enjoyable. Recommend watching something else with your three hours.",Suspiria

640,revenge_of_the_intern,"Bad directing, bad choreography, no story, silly use of Digital FX, and boring.",1,29 October 2018,"Was so slow and boring and seemed like the director was just trying to be like a fassbinder movie, use brian depalma camera techniques, and rip off a few people along the way.Not really sure how this guy keeps making movies. A bigger splash was a nonsensical ripoff of a decent Alain Delon movie, and the movie he did last year about an adult male having a sexual relationship with a child should have sent some red flags up somewhere. Now he rips off a piece of genuine cinema history and tries to pass himself off as some kind of heir to the throne of originality (!?). I miss good cinema, and this always guy falls flat, despite him trying really hard to convince us.The dancers were good themselves, the supporting actors, such as Mia Goth, made great effort, but the actual choreography was so bad and kind of funny, in fact. The girls just basically gyrate around a whole bunch in some odd looking costumes. It felt so contrived, pretentious, and had a looming arrogance underneath it all, like we were supposed to be impressed.There was no real story here. Subplots that never resolve themselves mixed in with a boring concoction of 'a special dancer and her teacher' that never really goes anywhere. It moves so slow and for so long, other movies have done better at building suspense, and those movies are far more worth the time.The ending has some pretty cheesy visual effects in it. Ironic, since the movie touts itself as some kind of purist cinema but then it relies on the worst possible way to do blood, which is just cgi blood, which a teenager can do in his basement and it requires no planning or thought behind it. . Even many visual effects heavy films know how to rely on real sfx blood. It seemed a bit lazy and it took me out of the moment. But, in fact, it would have been pretty awesome if they had used modern visual effects to heighten the 2018 version, but alas, they just used it for silly looking blood. This movie had a bunch of mismatched approaches like this - just a lack of regard and, frankly, respect, for the audience experience.It was all I could do to not look at my phone, which is something I never think of doing when watching movies, but I honestly couldnt wait for this one to be over.",Suspiria
641,benjaminreturns,"Worse than ""mother!"" - 2 hours of nothing. 30 minutes of kitsch.",1,29 October 2018,"Here we have almost three hours of boredom, then thirty minutes of absolute silliness. ""Mother!"" got panned really hard by critics because of the same poison this movie suffers from - pretentious nonsense and complete disconnect from the audience. The belief that audiences really love to sit there for three hours and let you show off what you can do is disconnected from the sophistication of the audience's own tastes. This isn't the 70s anymore and people now have the power to choose freely and turn off what doesnt pull them in.Don't waste your time with this one, unless you like to sleep to the sound of Thom Yorke music, but you can do that at home with better music. It's almost three hours that you wont get back.",Suspiria
642,tennilleamuso,DUMB!!!,1,21 February 2019,This movie doesn't make any sense and is a waste of time. I tried to get into it and it was so dry and boring. I love horror movies but this movie was gross.,Suspiria

644,squinn-91531,Some good body horror,7,20 November 2018,"Once I stopped seeing it as a remake I started to enjoy it. Some incredible acting (Tilda Swinton as always) and some really good body horror moments which felt like you were really part of the nightmare. Final act is totally insane, in the best possible way.",Suspiria
645,kvnagsto,A subtle thrill ride with an explosive ending.,9,13 December 2018,"It's become evidently clear that most of these harsh and unsolicited reviews towards films on here come from those who haven't even watched said film. The statement suggesting that this movie is not for everyone is agreeable, but by no means is this a bad movie in any way, shape, or form. This movie paints a picture of a Dance School's descent into corruption and insanity. The cinematography alone is explosive. One of the dance performances had me in tears what with the raw emotion that could be felt through the cinema screen emanating from every one of these dancers. You'll develop a fondness for the relationship between Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) and Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton). Like a pigeon under her mother's wing, Madame Blanc helps Susie soar to new heights as a dancer and with that, does the darkness begin to manifest and show its true colours. The soundtrack alone is intrinsically mesmerizing and pairs well with the dark tone of the movie; Thom Yorke has outdone himself. If you can appreciate the uniqueness of the original, then this adaptation is sure to be a ride you won't soon forget.",Suspiria
646,mariahuaripa,The cinematography is brilliant,7,7 February 2019,"It is worth watching. There are some memorable scenes. The build up is good. Dance sequences and the connection between art and ritual leave a mark.The ending felt convoluted and saturated in all senses, not in a good organic way that worked with and for the movie (like the original suspiria) probably more a homage which derails and distracts. The music is good, the acting is good, the photography felt off all throughout.",Suspiria

648,bastardflakes,Dance Witch Dance!,10,30 January 2019,"This is the coolest movie of 2018, no doubt. I liked the original, but this version was way better. The stakes were upped, the political context was more interesting and thought provoking - and the special effects were off the chain. So bloody and disturbing and clever. Great performances all around, and dance too! the ending is so rewarding I can't even get into how graphic it is. SEE THIS FILM!",Suspiria
649,travism-15682,Sucked a part of my soul out,1,30 January 2019,"Easily one of the worst movies Ive ever seen. I was so excited to see it when I found out that Thom Yorke was doing the score. Drove 2 hours to see it in a select theater, and sat dumbfounded by the time the credits rolled.This is a long, confusing mess of a movie, with hardly any plot or characters. Development happens instantly and choices make zero sense. By the time you start to think you understand whats happening, the insane third act happens throws you through the windshield.As for pros, the score by Thom Yorke is phenomenal and made it worth it. Its too bad it wasnt utilized well when integrated into the film.The acting From Tilda Swinton is great, but everybody else feels like they are sleepwalking.There is a dance sequence about 2/3 the way in that was mesmerizing and easily the best part of the movie. I wish the rest was like that.I felt changed after watching this, like it had sucked a part of my soul and left me hollow. It's not a horror movie, it's kind of a stretch to call it a movie at all. It's just a series of barely connected scenes put together. You could watch any scene from the first two acts out of order and it would feel the same. There's no real timeline or understanding of what's taking place.I honestly cant reccomend this movie to anyone, although my boyfriend loved it. Just treat yourself to the soundtrack and leave it at that.",Suspiria
650,nickynorjean,Awesome Vision,9,5 February 2019,"This was hands down one of the strangest films I've seen in awhile, but I absolutely loved it. The cinematography was tremendous and the final scene was badass just a creepy vibe throughout the whole film. Definitely recommend to horror fans, it is long and takes awhile to hit you but when it does I swear you won't take your eyes off the screen till the credits roll.",Suspiria

653,greenryth,"Visceral, evocative and spellbinding",10,29 April 2021,"I am a fan of Dario Argento's work and many of us, including myself hated the thought of another reworking his 1977 Masterpiece. I made A solemn oath to not watch it and left it to it's disastrous demise in the cinema. But I did end up watching out of curiosity more than anything else when it came on to Amazon Prime. Now... Argento is a brilliant director thwarted by lack of funds to make many of his great works into the spectacle that many think his skill should be rewarded with. He is also very hit and miss. But Suspiria has always been his primary work that even with some cheap effects and bad acting had a fantastic vision, brilliant soundtrack and masterful direction to pull it into the bracket of cult masterpiece.So on to the modern remake. The story has changed, in places it has been changed a lot. However the feel of story still sits in that whimsical world of dance and high arts that those of us not in the industry find somewhat ethereal and otherworldly. Although different it felt like it had the DNA of Argento. The cinematography blends bleak images of post War Berlin and the terror of the Red Army Faction with the pretentious world of modern Dance and oddly escape from Menonite life to form a dark, almost fantastical and uncomfortable setting that immediately felt compelling. The script is solid and the performances, particularly of Tilda Swinton who plays several roles, are very strong. I found the story moves slowly but kept me intrigued, particularly as the differences to the original meant that I wasn't 100% sure where this was going. The crescendo is more impactful and less predictable than the original and the conflict within the coven adds an additional element to the 1977 version. The horrific segments are sparse but truly horrifying. Finally the soundtrack is brilliant. It all ends up blending into a disturbing mix of grim horror and dance that I found extremely compelling and I have rewatched this film now several times.",Suspiria
