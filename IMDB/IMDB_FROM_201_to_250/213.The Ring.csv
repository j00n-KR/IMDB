0,Leofwine_draca,A J-horror remake that actually works,7,2 November 2016,"Hurrah! Once in a while, the law of averages means that a remake comes along that's actually HALFWAY DECENT. THE RING is such a remake, and in fact, it's actually a very good movie (despite coming only just four years after the original Japanese film that kick-started the ""horror videotape"" craze). My only complaint is that it follows the original film so slavishly – albeit with a slight diversion into the world of horse-racing – that anybody who has seen the Japanese movie needn't bother watching this version, or vice versa. Director Gore Verbinski comes up trumps with this terrifying psychological horror yarn whose only flaw is to slightly overplay the running time, leaving us slightly bored about two-thirds of the way through as we wait for the finale to happen.Otherwise things are spot on, with the movie retaining a level of suspense and brimming terror all the way through. Acting duties are top-notch, particularly the unknown Naomi Watts who shines as the lead character, and Martin Henderson who is also strong as the estranged father (albeit not as strong as Hiroyuki Sanada, the actor playing his role in the original). David Dorfman is the most expressive, spooky-looking child actor I've ever seen, and old pro Brian Cox ups the ante with his powerful ranting turn as the anguished father.The visual look of this film is fantastic, complete with lots of shots of weird landscapes, moving clouds, and other great stuff. The videotape footage is extremely disturbing, as it should be, and the brief glimpses we get of the curse victims are extremely frightening thanks to the ultra-grotesque make-up. There's a surprising set-piece involving a run-away horse which acts as a nice release of tension, while the film steers refreshingly AWAY from the Hollywood formula by sticking close to the original and offering a handful of new surprises too. Following on from the last good horror yarn – THE OTHERS – THE RING may not be original but it sure is scary.",The Ring
1,SnoopyStyle,Well made horror,8,26 April 2014,"This starts with Becca (Rachael Bella) and Katie (Amber Tamblyn) watching a scary movie. There is an urban legend of a haunted videotape. After watching it, the person gets a phone call claiming that person will have only 7 days to live. It's a classic horror movie intro right down to the girls' school uniforms. It works surprisingly well for such a try and true setup.Rachel (Naomi Watts) is a single-mom reporter with a troubled son Aidan (David Dorfman) who lost his close cousin Katie recently. Rachel decides to help out by investigating the mysterious death. Only the mystery deepens when she gets a hold of the tape. She watches it and receives the creepy call from Samara (Daveigh Chase) telling her ""7 days"".The movie is able to carry the classic horror styles all the way through. It maintains the creepiness from the well made opening. Everything from the set design to the actual tape is made with the same creepy vibe. It also delivers something new to this genre. The Japanese original started the idea but this is a better made film. Even washing out the colors with blueish green creates its own unique creepiness. Naomi Watts is just so compelling, and David Dorfman looks so sickly. And the use of the ring motif also works. Just about everything works.",The Ring

3,claudio_carvalho,A Scary Movie with a Disappointing End,7,28 July 2003,"Rachel Keller (the gorgeous Naomi Watts) is a journalist investigating a videotape that may have killed four teenagers (including her niece). There is an urban legend about this tape: the viewer will die seven days after watching it. If the legend is correct, Rachel will have to run against time to save her son's and her own life. The premise is great and the plot is scary. Everything works in this movie: the cast, the direction, the special effects, the screenplay etc. Unfortunately, the end of the story is not so good. Probably the intention of the studio in preparing the viewers for a sequel impairs the end of the plot. Anyway, watching this flick (and Naomi Watts) is worthwhile, which is highly indicated for fans of horror movies like me. Now I intend to watch the original Ringu. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Chamado"" (""The Call"")",The Ring
4,kosmasp,Not Japanese,7,18 May 2007,"Funnily enough (or maybe not that funny for fans of the series or the original director Hideo Nakata), this installment is a better transformation from the original movies, than the sequel was! But beware a third part is scheduled for 2008! Judging after this movie that wouldn't be bad! So let's leave the sequel alone for a moment and concentrate on this. Naomi Watts takes the lead here and the movie does it's Japanese original justice, with it's adaptation. The story is changed for American/western audiences, but that's good and should be like that! And if you bought or rent the DVD, I have an easter egg that will have you ... Let's just say, this is not for the faint of heart!!!Follow these instructions (from dvdreview.com): ""Insert the DVD in your player and wait until the Main Menu comes up. Now press the 'Up' arrow key on your remote control and the cursor will disappear. If you press the 'Enter' key now on your remote control you will get to see the entire footage of the deadly videotape from the movie.""",The Ring
5,classicsoncall,"""I think..., before you die, you see the ring.""",7,11 April 2020,"This film had it's moments and had an excellent set up, but as I sit here and think about it after the fact, what exactly did the videotape and the phone calls have anything to do with the death of Samara Morgan (Daveigh Chase)? Think about it - who made the videotape? Who's making the phone calls? This would have been an effective horror flick without the video, simply by making a connection between the vindictive spirit of Samara seeking it's revenge by proxy on her adoptive parents, the father who didn't want her, and the mother who couldn't take a stand against her husband to protect the young girl. Samara, speaking as an entity to young Aidan (David Dorfman), was all that was needed to provide the supernatural link between the living and the dead. I did like the horror touches in the picture like the first victim Katie in the closet, and Samara herself crawling out of Noah's (Martin Henderson) television. There's decent suspense and a compelling back story, but I just don't see how it translates to the video. Someone had to make it, and that's just never forthcoming, as the two most likely candidates were already dead long before - Samara and Anna Morgan (Shannon Cochran).",The Ring
6,lee_eisenberg,the lord of this ring,9,18 July 2005,"Horror is so hard to pull off because usually, we can guess way in advance what's going to happen. Not so with ""The Ring"". Even if you hear what the story is, much of the movie will still probably make you jump.It all begins when two teenage girls are talking about a video tape that you watch, and then you get a phone call telling you that you're going to die. Sure enough, one of them watches the tape. After her death, her aunt Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) investigates further and uncovers the story behind the tape. In the process, she seeks the answers to some questions: What is that ring? Who is that girl? And how does a lighthouse fit into this all? The movie mainly works because they know how to pull off surprises when you least expect it, and they let the answers to these questions evolve slowly but surely. By the end, you may be weary of watching any movie, or picking up the phone.",The Ring
7,jboothmillard,The Ring,5,19 September 2005,"The first time I saw this I was terrified out of my wit and thought to myself that I will not watch again until after a week, just like the film, really, I was that freaked out. But now I can see that at least three quarters of it is now only creepy. Basically investigating a death of a girl, who was also a friend, reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) goes to a motel ranch that the girl stayed at last. The owner says the TV reception in each room is no good, so they have videos, and that is where she sees the one video with no case or label. After watching this video she is phoned by an unknown caller, saying ""seven days"". She now has that much time to find out what she can about the video, does it kill people after a week? Also starring Martin Henderson as Noah Clay, David Dorfman as Aidan Keller and Brian Cox as Richard Morgan. A good attempt by director Gore Versbinski (Mousehunt, Pirates of the Caribbean) to recreate a Japanese horror. I need to see the original. Worth watching!",The Ring
8,rmax304823,Carnival of Scares.,5,17 January 2011,"I didn't get to the end of this shock fest. Naomi Watts investigates an exceedingly strange videotape. Her friends are indifferent to her unease. A close examination of the tape, which seems to curse its viewers, reveals a connection to an Anna Morgan whose ranch full of prize horses appears to have died of some unfathomable epidemic on the beach and -- that's about where I left.Possibly the climax revealed all and was done in a way that fascinated viewers as much as that bizarre VHS did, but I wouldn't know. A couple of elements were turn offs.One is that it was filmed in a way that saturated the images -- ALL the images -- with a familiar ghoulish green. It's the color of a comic-book Zombie. Man, is that tiresome.Another is that if the film managed to avoid a horror story cliché, I must have missed it. Watts enters a room accompanied by spooky music, sees the back of the baby sitter's body sitting stiffly upright in a chair, approaches the chair and occupant, reaches her hand out to touch the apparently lifeless shoulder -- and the baby sitter shrieks, having only been asleep. Watts has a frightening dream, wakes up and thrusts her open-mouthed face into the camera lens, her eyes bulging, her chest panting. The experienced viewer pendiculates.I could see the plot developing in accordance with the usual textbook rules though. The shocks at first are minor, then grow more grotesque. The first truly bizarre experience that Naomi Watts has comes during one of her many playbacks of the tape. She stops it, zooms in on a fly that always has appeared in one corner of the screen, reaches tentatively towards it and then picks it out of the image, alive. Then what does she do? She's distracted and apparently releases the fly deliberately, uninterested in learning more about it. I'd have had it in a jar pronto and taken it to the nearest entomologist for a closer look at this mysterious mouche.Next up the scale, she's on the phone and begins coughing and hacks up a long string of what appears to be twined human hair, maybe a yard long, with some kind of small plastic device on the end of it. The object, whatever it is, shares the destiny of that fly. Nothing more is heard of it. The entire incident is immediately forgotten by Watts and dropped from the story.I noted before that when Naomi Watts wakes from a bad dream she sits upright and thrusts her open-mouthed face into the lens. That mouth almost saves the picture. In a movie full of dark shadows, rain, dampness, and green, Watt's two incisors are the only things that glisten. My God, those incisors belong on Bugs Bunny. I was in their thrall throughout. In some inexplicable way they add to Watts' delicate blond beauty. Talk about mysteries! That's about it. Naturally nobody believes Watts and her friends are helpless and any witnesses don't like to talk about the past and her child is in jeopardy and blah blah blah. I wonder what the original was like.",The Ring
9,Tweekums,Decent remake of a great Japanese chiller,6,21 June 2009,"I'd seen the Japanese original a few times but had not seen the American remake until it was on television a couple of days ago. I hadn't bothered watching it sooner as I assumed it wouldn't have anything to say which the original hadn't already said; while I prefer the original this was better than I expected and had some decent chills.As in the original the film opens with two school girls talking about a mysterious video tape which after viewing you only has seven days to live. One of the girls had seen the tape when she went with a group of other friends to a remote mountain cabin the previous weekend. Soon strange things start happening, the television turns itself on and something happens which scares to death the girl who saw the tape and leaves the other so scared she has to be put in a mental hospital. This would have been put down to a mere tragic occurrence had the dead girls cousin not been a reporter who thought something strange was going on and overheard the tape being talked about during the funeral. Rachel, the reporter, heads up to the cabin and finds the tape which being sceptical she watches then gets a phone call telling her she has a week to live. She takes the tape back to work to examine it more thoroughly. She lets her ex husband see the tape when he insists he can help her.When they examine the tape they see that there are references to something that happened on an island several years before where many horses appeared to deliberately drown themselves and the woman who owned them committed suicide, she goes there and finds the house in the tape where the woman's widower still lives, he does not want to talk about his daughter however...Anybody who has seen the original will have a good idea of what to expect although there are quite a few changes which will either irritate the viewer or make them think it gives the film a degree of freshness. I preferred the way it was done in the original although that may just be a matter of taste. Naomi Watts put in a fine performance in the lead roll and Brain Cox is excellent as always in his small role as the man on the island. I was less keen on the way Rachel's ex was portrayed, he seemed far too laid back. The character of the reporter's son also seemed to have been changed unnecessarily, originally he was just an ordinary child but here he has some unexplained psychic connection to the cause of all the trouble.If you like a good scare without having to see lots of gore then this is worth watching on television although I'd recommend getting the original instead if you are planning to make a purchase.",The Ring

Good performance of Noami Watts as intrepid newspaper reporter determined to find out the amazing events . The film is paced with intelligent edition, special use of color and slick utilization of shock images . While the look is suitable atmospheric and creepy , the argument stretches plausibility to the breaking point. This is an acceptable adaptation of the novel and movie that took successfully Japan and based on original Japanese novel by Koji Suzuki that was a real success in the Asian cinemas and all around the world . The movie has some excellent special effects describing series of weird and otherworldly happenings and a magnificent make-up specially reflected on the hair-raising countenance of dead . Eerie musical score by the prestigious Hans Zimmer who also composed the following . Tenebrous cinematography by Bazzelli with the TV surrealist images filmed in 35 mm and in super 8 style . The motion picture is well written by Kruger and professionally realized by Gore Verbinski in similar style to original directed by Hideo Nakata , an expert on horror cinema who directed its following ¨Ringu 2 (1999)¨ ; furthermore he filmed US version , the inferior ¨Ring 2¨ also with Naomi Watts and his son played by David Dorfman.",The Ring
11,BA_Harrison,Verbinski's Horror Succeeds,8,11 January 2012,"Journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) investigates the existence of a strange videotape that, according to an urban legend, causes the death of anyone who should watch it, thus making it the ultimate video nasty. After locating a copy of the vindictive VHS, Rachel not only decides to watch it, but also lets her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) have a gander, and leaves a copy laying around for her son Aidan (David Dorfman) to see!!! Needless to say, the legend proves to be true, the tape allowing the vengeful spirit of freaky murdered girl Samara to literally scare viewers to death.As someone who can actually be bothered to read sub-titles, I generally dislike it when Asian horror hits are remade to appeal to a Western audience, particularly since very few of them turn out to be as effective as the originals. Gore Verbinski's The Ring, however, is a genuinely worthy effort, because instead of simply being a quick Hollywood 'cash-in', it is actually a lovingly crafted movie.Storywise, Verbinski's film stays fairly faithful to Hideo Nakata's Ringu and effectively replicates its creepy atmosphere, but The Ring avoids being just a slavish copy by expanding on certain plot points, providing a few crowd pleasing jump scares along the way, and best of all, by being as visually impressive as possible, with coloured tints and CGI effects used to great effect throughout (I usually moan about such things in modern horror films, but here they actually work).I wouldn't go as far as to say that The Ring is better than the original, but I think it is equally deserving of a watch.",The Ring
12,moonspinner55,A cross between Nancy Drew and a Marilyn Manson video...,5,1 January 2004,"Intriguing, somewhat sadistic hokum about a videotape which, according to urban legend, causes death to the viewer who pops it in within seven days. Ominously filmed in steely blue-grays, ""The Ring"" is so full of red herrings that it can't possibly hope to clarify every horrific detail, leading to some dissatisfaction. Naomi Watts reacts to all the grim happenings with the same look of wide-eyed astonishment, but she's a grounded, approachable actress and an attractive presence. Saddled with an unnecessary final act (the perfect set-up for a sequel!), ""The Ring"" is ultimately more silly than scary. ** from ****",The Ring
13,dbdumonteil,"scary, thoughtful and satisfying which is fine with me",7,2 January 2006,"These last years, apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen, American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture, especially the Japanese one. Quentin Tarantino's violent and hollow ""Kill Bill"" (2003/2004) was supposed to be an homage to the samurai movie (but I'm not a Tarantino buff by a long shot). In the derivative ""the Last Samurai"" (2003), Tom Cruise discovered the secrets and treasures of Japanese civilization while Sofia Coppola used the city of Tokyo as the backdrop for her triumphant ""Lost in Translation"" (2003). Gore Verbinski chose a more direct and easy way to get interested in Japanese culture: to make a remake of a Japanese movie which became a sleeper: ""Ringu"" (1998). Against all odds, he made a killing with it although he's an uneven director. ""Mousehunt"" (1997) was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but ""the Mexican"" (2001) was a lame movie. Some friends had told me: ""don't watch ""the Ring"", it's a hokey movie"". I think they misjudged it and I found this supernatural thriller quite intriguing and gripping. It has enough commendable stuff in store to grab the audience. I haven't seen the original movie and so I will avoid any comparison.The starting point promises great things and Verbinski will deliver them throughout his flick. The main character, Rachel wants to investigate about a mysterious and cursed videotape which causes the death of the viewer seven days after the latter watched it. What do these outlandish and eerie images mean? What lies beneath them? At her own risk, she and her son watch the video. She has one week to find out the meaning and the omen of the video. ""The Ring"" could well illustrate this famous premise: ""to understand evil, we've got to go back to the sources..."".What distinguishes ""the Ring"" from other horror stuff of these last years is that there's a solid scenario which holds water until the very last minutes of Rachel's adventure and shelves quite an important number of formulaic ingredients. Special effects which have seemed to become the backbone for many horror flicks are used only when necessary and without flashy effects. Still better, Verbinski shows respect for the audience by clarifying as much as possible obscure points of the story. On an unhurried pace, Verbinski takes all his time to film Rachel's investigation. His directing is also worth the price of admission. It is well-crafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments. Besides, what is notable in ""the Ring"" is that Verbinski delays as much as possible chilling sequences to better play with the viewer's nerves. This entails an unsettling aura which helps to convey a latent tension. Lighting and makeup shouldn't also be forgotten.The thrust of ""the Ring"" isn't only to entertain and to make shiver. It is also doubled by a reflexion on the power of the image. One of the images of the film depicts a woman in front of a mirror looking at the camera. So, she's also looking at the viewer. This is unhealthy voyeurism that the movie denounces like the insensible media which expose to the mainstream, woes and sorrows of the victims and so manipulate the viewers' fears. The sequence during which Ann Morgan's husband is incensed by Rachel's will to learn more about Samara rings thoroughly true. Moreover, these seemingly maladjusted images embody symbols: the chair and the lighthouse illustrate loneliness, the figure at the window (a hint at ""Psycho""?, 1960) might symbolize parental severity.That said, Verbinski's genteel piece of work isn't exempted of drawbacks. Rachel's little boy is a cardboard character, a vague cousin of Haley Joel Osment in ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999). When Samara gets out of the well and the screen to kill Rachel's companion, it's nearly Punch and Judy and the first sequence with the two female students in their twenties something, all alone in a house in which strange phenomena and false alarms occur... well, you get the picture. But they're minor quibble and don't overflow too much on the thrill of the vision.I repeat it: I haven't seen the Japanese ambassador but when a remake is able both to scare with reserve, without flashy special effects and to make the viewer think about what he watches, it can be gratifying. And in the case of ""the Ring"", rightly so...A sequel ""the Ring 2"" opened last year. Is it worthwhile?",The Ring
14,Quinoa1984,"a remake with its own impressive, terrifying perspective that works",8,25 October 2002,"Coming back to The Ring, having (unfortunately) yet to see the original Ringu or Japanese Ring features, it is most involving and absorbing as an effort of a filmmaker who takes the materials of convention and forms them into terrifying shapes. It's all about ambiance, really, and director Gore Verbinski doesn't take any of this in a silly manner, or one that he would want us to think is too silly. It's about a video tape that when watched in seven days the viewer of said tape (a series of images not unlike a master's class at a university in gut-wrenching and eye-tumbling surrealism) will die.The characters in the ring investigate this, and come upon some familiar tropes of the ghost story and of things like sentience (I got a particular feeling and connection back to the Shining, no pun intended), but Verbinski's intent is to grip the viewer in a story that keeps to itself very well, is filmed without the gimmicks of, for example, Michael Bay's productions of remake-horror crap, and features actors that can make us believe this material. As with other superior ghost-story horror movies this decade like the Orphanage, it appreciates what is possible in just lighting a room, in letting a character take time to see things and experience them in a visceral manner so that we can as well, and Verbinski and his write bring on images that are inescapable (i.e. the horse on the ship, the girl crawling out of the TV and going across the room).It's a crafty piece of slick Hollywood horror, and it's intrigued me enough to go back to the unseen source material, which is the best a remake can do aside from its potential re-watchability. 8.5/10",The Ring
15,Coventry,Surprisingly good remake of a Japanese thriller,6,16 October 2003,"The Ring is the version of a Japanese thriller from 1998. This Japanese idea was original, chilling and very intense. You know what that means if the USA finds out on something like this..."" Let's Americanize it !!!"" I'm sorry if that sounded sarcastic but, usually, that IS the general rule behind it. But certainly no complaints this time ! Upcoming genius in Hollywood Gore Verbinski did a great job with it and I even prefer this remake over the original Japanese version. Ringu deserves all the credit it can get for originality and plot but when it comes to entertainment and production, The Ring is far more superior. The story behind the videotape is far more detailed and there's a lot more to discover. You're a lot more involved in this one and the background of ""Samara"" is fascinating up to the highest possible level. There already was a good amount of suspense in the Japanese version but Verbinski goes even beyond that level and delivers a rarely seen gem here. Certainly one of the better horrorfilms since The Silence of the Lambs. You almost are afraid to wink your eyes in order not to miss anything that could be an important plot element. It's good to see they still make them like this. Verbinski wisely didn't exaggerate with the horror elements. There are some frightening make-up scenes in it but the suspense keeps you focused well enough. A story like this really doesn't need too much blood or make-up, it all depends on the script and the acting performances. Speaking of which...they're great !! Naomi Watts is, besides a very beautiful woman, a good and promising actress. She got my attention after Mulholland Dr. and she certainly confirms it here. I hope to see her many times again in movies like this. Brian Cox never gives away a bad performance so there's no need to say that he's absolutely perfect in his role here as well. I still can't believe that this guy is so underrated. He should be right up there with other big names of his generation like Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman. He is at least as good as them ! And let's not forget the little girl who played Samara here. Daveigh Chase is really spooky in her role and highly believable. Certainly a girl to keep an eye on in the next few years. The Ring is one of the best films I've seen since the new Millenium and therefore I surely recommend it to as much people as possible. And if you like this film, I advise you to watch a 1980 film called ""The Changeling""...you'll find a few interesting similarities between these two titles. The Ring is the ideal film to watch with a group of people when it's late a night and the weather outside is dark. The perfect atmosphere for the perfect form of suspense. Enjoy !!",The Ring

17,sunwarrior13,Scary With A Great Story,10,10 November 2011,"The Ring is a psychological horror film that stars Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson together with David Dorfman,Daveigh Chase,Brian Cox, Jane Alexander,Lindsay Frost,Amber Tamblyn,Rachael Bella and Shannon Cochran.The movie was a remake of the Japanese horror film Ring. It is based on Koji Suzuki's novel Ring and focuses on a mysterious cursed videotape which contains a seemingly random series of disturbing images. After watching the tape, the viewer receives a phone call in which a girl's voice announces that the viewer will die in seven days. It was written by Kôji Suzuki,Ehren Kruger and Scott Frank.Also,it was directed by Gore Verbinski.The Ring starts when a strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the Pacific Northwest.It is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller, the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan, a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah, an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery.The Ring is a horror movie made not only to scare the viewer in front of their TV screen but it also has a story to tell.The creepy exploration of the unknown and unexplained is far more frightening than the violent killings that typify most horror films.Also,brilliant acting was prominent in the movie as the characters involved have depth.The visuals were also effective as it will definitely put somebody at the edge of one's seat.Overall,The Ring is one scary movie with a great story.",The Ring
18,hitchcockthelegend,Is she still in the dark place?,8,5 September 2009,"After the mysterious death of her niece Katie, journalist Rachel Keller starts to investigate an urban legend about a videotape which kills you seven days after watching it. With dire consequences coming her way if she can not solve the mystery....The sentence, English language remake of successful foreign horror film has been known to instill fear of the wrong kind in many a genre fan. So when it was announced that Gore Verbinski was to remake Hideo Nakata's terrifying nerve shredder, Ringu, the reaction in horror circles was akin to someone urinating on your chips. Refreshing to report then that The Ring is a candidate for best American remake and proof positive that remakes sometimes can be a good thing.Starring Naomi Watts (who is terrific) as Rachel, Verbinski and writer Ehren Kruger (adapting from Kôji Suzuki's novel) successfully transfer the atmospherics of Nakata's piece to a dank and eerie Seattle. It's with atmosphere that The Ring starts to play on your nerves, because after viewing the creepy and unsettling tape itself, we ourselves have been set up for the race against the clock theme that is driving Rachel on. So as the mystery starts to unravel, and sadness threatens to take a hold, the story quickly shifts direction to give horror one of its most baddest and cruelest characters. It's the kind of impact that crawls under your skin and refuses to move when you are trying to sleep at night.Though the story has been streamlined from its source, The Ring still has a bit too much filler in its meaty structure. Feeling a need to give Watts a quest among quests, Verbinski almost over cooks the mystery essence of the plot. However, with much relief he reins it in to stop any sort of scooby doo like nonsense detracting from the creepy sense of dread that has been built up previously. The ending here works a treat, but it is a tone down from the source and with that it's not even close to Nakata's version, and just maybe it has something to do with Dream Works wanting to secure a PG-13 rating?What is left though is a truly suspenseful and unsettling thriller - come horror film.

19,Theo Robertson,"The Ending , Oh Dear The Ending",6,13 October 2003,"Reading the back of the DVD case you might be forgiven that THE RING is just another "" Teens get stalked and killed by a stalker "" flick . In fact the first five minutes plays out just as you`d expect a "" Teens get stalked and killed by a stalker "" flick , but after the opening things start improving a lot . Director Gore Verbinski crafts one extremely moody film crammed full of haunting abstract images . This would have been a memorable film for all the right reasons if it wasn`t for ending which makes THE RING memorable for all the wrong reasons !!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!I don`t know if I`m stupid but the ending didn`t make any sense to me . Let`s see Rachel finds the body of the murdered child and lays her to rest and only then does her son tell her she wasn`t supposed to help ! Oi vey , now he tells me . Were all the other people killed simply because they tried to help ? It doesn`t seem fair does it ? you bust your ass trying to do the right thing and what happens ? , a spirit of a child comes out of the TV and kills you . This leads to another plot hole . If you`ve watched the video and seven days later you surround yourself with people who haven`t seen the tape would the spirit still be able to come out of the screen and kill you ? Oh and did Rachel survive because she saw a copy of the tape rather than the original ? You tell me",The Ring
20,preppy-3,Creepy but not totally satisfying,8,4 November 2002,"A Seattle newspaper reporters (Naomi Watts) cousin dies seven days after watching a video.  The video contains grainy, weird, frightening images and, after viewing it, you get a phone call saying ""seven days"".  Seven days later, you die.  Watts hears this but doesn't believe it.  She gets a copy of the tape, views it, then the phone rings...The plot is intriguing (and based on a 1998 Japanese film).  Also the movie takes itself very seriously and there's (thankfully) no stupid comic relief. Also Watts gives a powerhouse performance as does David Dorfman playing her really creepy little son.  There's no gore, very little blood and the scares are mostly quiet ones.  I usually love horror movies like that.  This one just misses the mark.The plot is way too intelligent for its own good (I got confused by the end).  It throws in a very frightening twist at the end that I didn't buy at all, and leaves lots of loose ends hanging.  Still, for 99% of the way, it works.  It's worth seeing just for that.",The Ring
21,poolandrews,"""Hey! My horse!"" Really rather good remake.",7,30 January 2007,"The Ring starts with a teenage girl named Rebecca Kotler (Rachael Bella) telling her friend Katie Embry (Amber Tamblyn) about a cursed videotape that if watched the viewer will get a phone call & die in exactly 7 days, of course it's all just a stupid urban legend until a very worried Kate confesses she has seen the tape & by a complete coincidence exactly 7 day ago & before the night is finished the inevitable happens... Katie's Mother Ruth (Lindsay Frost) ask's reporter & friend of the family Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) to do what she does best & investigate the mysterious circumstance's surrounding her daughter's death from apparent heart failure, Rachel agrees & soon learns of the videotape story. She retraces Katie's steps back to a motel & finds the tape which she watches & receives the phone call, as she investigates the tape & the image's on it Katie believes the story to be true & that she has a few days left before she dies unless she can figure out a way to put an end to the curse...This American Japanese co-production was directed by Gore Verbinski & is a fine remake of the original popular Japanese horror film Ringu (1998). The script by Ehren Kruger based on the Ringu novel by Koji Suzuki I think actually improves upon the Japanese original which I have seen & liked but I liked this one more, the films start off fairly similar with the news reporter becoming involved & watching the tape herself but about half way through The Ring '02 actually tries to put a proper story to the tape & at this point it goes in it's own direction & sets about telling a decent little ghost story which in the end is quite effective. The film moves along at a good pace although not much actually happens in it so don't expect lots of gore or action as The Ring is that type of horror film which actually tries to rely on a good strong story as opposed to in-your-face special effects & loud music. The character's are good as is the dialogue, there are some genuinely creepy moments & the basic concept of watching a videotape that will kill you in 7 days is quite sinister & freaky. Everything unfolds in a satisfying fashion although not everything works perfectly, for example the ending almost seemed like the filmmakers didn't know where to go with the story & they just wanted to finish the film. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by The Ring '02 as I wasn't expecting a lot but I found myself really enjoying it & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Verbinski makes this film what it is, the film has a terrific atmosphere of bleakness & gloom. He shoots everything in a grayish dull tone that gives the film an air of depression & hopelessness & it works extremely well. The cinematography is kept simple yet it is highly effective I mean I'd never have thought a single tree could have been so effective & striking, thankfully there's no annoying quick fire edits here. There are some great scenes in The Ring & some pretty creepy ones too especially the sight of a ghostly girl emerging from a TV set, forget about any violence or gore as it's not that type of film.With a supposed budget of about $45,000,000 The Ring has that Hollywood polish about it & has excellent production values as one would expect. Apparently a fair amount of footage was cut from the final version including a sub-plot about a child killer & Samara's death was far more explicit, it would be nice to see this stuff but I doubt there will ever be a director's cut. Turned down by Jennifer Connelly, Gwyneth Paltrow & Kate Beckinsale before Watts accepted she does a good job as the lead who desperately searches for answers & the rest of the largely unknown cast does well.The Ring is a remake which betters the original as quite a few do including The Blob (1988), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2004) that's controversial I know but it's just my opinion & The Hills Have Eyes (2006) so all this remake fever in Hollywood has actually produced it's fair share of good films & I definitely count The Ring as one of them, well worth a watch especially if you like ghost stories.",The Ring
22,dbborroughs,Slow Version of a Slow Original,6,7 March 2004,"The pacing of both the original and English remake of the Ring seems to be rather slow. While there are some creepy moments in this version of the story its still as over rated as the original. For the most part the two films are almost interchangeable in my mind, although the images from the cursed tape is better in this version. The only real differences being the location and the episodes around Brian Cox.The question of which is better ultimately comes down to whether you want to read subtitles or not. For me there is something creepier about the original version and its lack of digital effects that makes the final several minutes of this version less scary because its less real, but thats a minor complaint and either version is fine.",The Ring

24,Boba_Fett1138,"One of the scariest things I've ever seen, however...",8,27 September 2003,"...not completely successful as a movie.""The Ring"" really is one of the scariest movies ever. However it suffers from one mayor problem and that's the story. Even though it's original, hardly anything is explained and lot's of things are taken for granted, it also suffers from some plot holes. I don't know, maybe it was the creators intension to leave some things open and let the viewers themselves fill it up but to me it just seems that the story was an excuse just to make a movie with tons of scary moments. The fact that nothing really is explained maybe is what makes the movie scary but quite frankly I just don't buy it.But for some reason it doesn't really harm the movie. The biggest strength of the movie are obviously the scary moments and not the story. It are not the images that are the scariest things, what scared me the most was the use of sound. Next to ""Das Boot"" I rank this as the movie with the best use of sound. The movie also has perfect timing and a perfect horror atmosphere.An amusing things are that what I think we can already call the typical Gore Verbinski characters. There are some highly amusing and eccentric characters in the movie. It's funny that after have seeing only 2 Gore Verbinski films I can already recognize his style. I think that says something about the director.Best way to watch this movie is late at night, at home, alone with the lights of and the volume up and then you better hope that the phone doesn't ring. The movie is full with scary moments that will scare you in one way or another. I think it's safe to say that I can guarantee you will be scared. And be warned that you might have difficulties getting at sleep after you have seen the movie. It has a great ending that I will not and don't want to spoil.See this movie if you want to see a completely different horror movie. I would have rated this movie ""only"" a 7 but since it actually gave me a nightmare (something that I hadn't had for at least 2 years), it obviously had an higher impact on me then I expected, so I rate this movie a:8/10I just hope that ""The Ring 2"" will clear up some things.http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Ring
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Unbelievably scary,8,13 March 2004,"This is one of the scariest films I've ever seen; what's great about it is how it doesn't rely on excessive amounts of gore or cheap thrills to scare you. There's barely any blood or violence in the movie at all, and it's still more scary than most violent horror movies. I love how the horror is all atmospheric; it keeps building up to something worse, instead of just hitting you with constant scenes of violence. This is a perfect movie to put on, if you're sitting alone a dark night, in need of a good scare. Nearly anyone will find it scary. The plot is interesting, and keeps developing constantly, so you never get tired of it. The acting is top-notch, by pretty much every single actor involved, major & minor character alike. The characters are believable, and their actions understandable. The movie has an excellent mystery, that leaves a lot of open ends to the audience to figure out for themselves; unfortunately, there may be too many open ends... I've seen it three times, and I still can't make sense of everything that happens in the movie. That's the only complaint, though. Other than that, it's nearly perfect. It's definitely one of the scariest movies ever, especially if you're into atmospheric horror. I'd recommend this to any fan of atmospheric horror movies; this is one of those movies you have to watch, if you're into atmosphere in a horror movie. 8/10",The Ring

There are scary movies that have startling scenes, there are scary movies that will creep you out, then there are scary movies that keep you awake at night. This was all three. I was actually sinking in my seat and hiding behind my jacket while watching.The plot is that of a video that if you watch you then only have seven days to live. The concept of a ""killer video"" is new to me and it was played out very well up until the very end. The movie was chronicling the seven day hell that the main character, Rachel (Naomi Watts) was going through before her demise. You could feel every bit of fear and anxiety she was experiencing as she tirelessly tried to find out how to prevent her untimely death. As she clamored for answers and got closer to the meaning of this video tape she had more and more inexplicable events happen to her. The movie was only made better and more intense by not going the traditional route of discovering the injustice to stop the suffering.

Just ask ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". Positive word of mouth had me anxious to see ""The Ring"".  Not many clever horror/suspense/thrillers come around these days.  It appears the moviegoing public is so starved for this genre, that we can turn mish-mash into success at the box office.  Don't kid yourself.  This is a stupid, poorly made, well conceived milkshake of a movie.  It blatantly steals from the best - ""Poltergeist"", ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and ""The Sixth Sense"".  Even the lead actors appear to be rip-offs:  Naomi Watts (excellent in ""Mulholland Drive"") mimics Rebecca DeMorney and Theresa Russell, Martin Henderson takes on Viggo Mortenson and Elias Koteas, and little David Dorfman does his best Haley Joel Osment and Adam Hann-Byrd (""Little Man Tate""). actually have talent.  Director Gore Verbinski (""The Mexican"") seems to be a big fan of horror movies and by golly, was going to get every idea he ever had into this one. And I think he had Brian Cox use one electrical appliance for every one of his ideas.  Nice premise with the video tape and 7 days, just poor execution.  The film does offer up some wonderful visuals in dream sequences and video.  The past is much more interesting than the present for these characters.

28,anaconda-40658,A Half Circle.,5,1 December 2015,"The Ring (2002): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Cast: Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Amber Tamblyn: The title doesn't really represent what the film is about. It is beautifully crafted with dazzling production values and intriguing plot setup that somehow falls deep in the well of despair by its conclusion. It is a mind exercise about a video tape that kills its viewers after seven days from initial viewing. How it does this is never explained, and we never learn who's voice it is on the other end of the phone. Fear Dot Com had a similar idea that was even worse. It opens with the death of a teenage girl whose face is masked in terror. Naomi Watts plays a single mother and journalist who seeks answers and tension rises when she ends up viewing the tape in order to move on with the case. She seeks help from her ex-husband, a video processor who also views it. Directed by Gore Verbinski who has done worse than this. He made The Mexican as well as a wretched little number called Mouse Hunt. Here he is backed by visual elements and creative plot turns that fail to make sense of it all. Naomi Watts holds her own while Martin Henderson is effective in his collaboration. David Dorfman as her son fears that he too is at risk. Other roles are not as broad or are just plain strange. The film contains visually striking images that add to the film's pointless and warped presentation. Score: 5 ½ / 10",The Ring
29,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Decent entry, if not overtly spectacular",7,1 October 2017,"Several days after their cousin's death, a reporter and her young son find that a cursed videotape watched by individuals leads to their death in seven days and forces them to uncover the meaning of the tape and how to stop its terrible curse before it continues to be passed on.This does have a few pretty nice points about it. Among the better areas here is the fact that this manages to really do some stylized individual scenes to give this some exceptionally enjoyable and chilling moments. From seeing themselves in a live surveillance monitor where they notice their face is all distorted while everything else around them is fine, another starts pulling something out of their mouth that just keeps coming and looks like a long string with something on the end of it and another featuring a bunch of marbles coming together on the floor to make the image of a pointing arrow. It's also got the ability to build up some great scare scenes with a really weird dream where they see an image of a young girl who grabs her on the arm yet when they wake a hand-shaped burn mark across her arm where they were grabbed is noticeable, the incidental videotape itself is incredibly tense and chilling and makes for quite an effective central piece to the puzzle and the revelation at the cabin with the discovery of the well and the big highlight where a partially decomposed girl crawls out of a well on- screen and then crawls out through the TV, onto the floor and then starts walking toward him chasing him around the apartment which is just all sorts of chilling. The only other thing that really works for the film is its final resolution which is a rather chilling outcome. These are all great in making the film quite watchable even though it does have some pretty sizable flaws. One of the biggest issues is that the film didn't need to be as abstract and ambiguous since it's a mystery, and as such should provide us with a clearly defined solution. It's apparent the girl was quite twisted, yet we have no idea why she was mental even before being confined as there's absolutely no explanation what made her that way. What's even stranger is her sense of priority as nothing is given as to what she is trying to get out of all of this. It's obvious we're supposed to feel bad for her, but if they're completely crazy, then there's little chance of it happening. It's also not given how she got inside the videotape anyway, or why a videotape which too obsolete a technology to make much impact. This dates the material greatly and really makes the fear seem less important. Along with a plot that tends to go back on itself by never completely solving one mystery before starting to investigate another, these lower it substantially.Rated PG-13: Language, Violence, children in danger and animal violence.",The Ring

It is one of the few horror films made that have made me tense.  Are there problems?  Yes.  The story is about a reporter that while trying to find out why her niece died comes across a tape that supposedly kills you if you watch it...so what does she do?  She watches it.  On it are a bunch of disturbing images in black and white that reminds one of that one Nine Inch Nail video from way back.  She promptly shows it to her ex because he insists then her son sneaks and watches it.  So the reporter has to solve the mystery or in seven days as a phone call tells them they will die.  Some of the problems for me included the girl in the mental institution...you never find out why she is there or how she knows things.  Also, the little boy has some physic (I know this is spelled wrong) powers that are never fully explained and at one point you wonder why didn't the boy say what he knew earlier.  There are a couple of other little things, but all in all it was a good movie...now I just have to see what happens to me at the end of the week.",The Ring
31,Wuchakk,The mysterious atmosphere makes this film,7,16 January 2014,"""The Ring"" is a psychological horror film from 2002, an American remake of the 1998 Japanese film ""Ringu"", which in turn was based on the 1991 book. The story revolves around a VHS tape that is cursed: whoever watches it will die in seven days. A reporter (Naomi Watts) catches wind of it and watches the video. She starts to sense that the curse is real and tries to find the answer.Shot mostly in Washington state (with some parts in Oregon and California), ""The Ring"" is a polished film with a nice, haunting vibe, which can be attributed to the excellent cinematography, the thick forests and constant rain. Watts and Martin Henderson are worthy protagonists as well.Unfortunately, the back story of the ghostly girl is convoluted and too much is left unexplained (Why do horses go nuts on two occasions? Why is the little girl evil? Where did she come from? And the chronology of the back-story is hard to figure out), but maybe the answers are there if you rack your brains. I'll do that the next time I watch the film.Another positive is that the ghostly element is actually rather chilling. This is important to me because ghost flicks normally bore me. After all, what can an immaterial ghost do to you anyway? Not much except maybe make objects fly in a whirlwind of negative energy. So what's to be scared of? They're dead and can't do any significant harm. ""The Ring"" effectively changes this and makes the apparition frightful. Other films have followed suit, like 2004's ""The Grudge"" and it's sequels.Speaking of subsequent films, many of them have taken elements of ""The Ring"" and made better films, at least as far as the story goes; for instance, the excellent ""From Within"" (2008). But it's hard to beat the mysterious ambiance of ""The Ring."" Some complain about one or two false endings, but the movie couldn't end without revealing what killed the girl in the opening teaser.The film runs 115 minutes.GRADE: B",The Ring
32,The_Void,damp squib remake,6,13 November 2003,"""Candyman, Candyman, Candyman""I'm sorry, I don't know what got into me.Japan: 1998. A little known horror movie was released under the name of 'Ring'. Ring wasn't a bad film, it wasn't a great film, it wasn't very original (though it wasn't a total rip off) or scary, but it wasn't rubbish. I gave it 6/10. A fair score.America: 2002. Hollywood smeared its glossy mits all over the Japanese film, and we were given: 'The Ring'.The Ring centres on the story of a video tape, and if you watch the tape, within seven days: you die. ""It's truly terrifying"" said some guy in some review on amazon.com, ""What the f**k?"" said The_Void just a second ago, a haunted video tape? Run away! Run away! Lame. What's next? A haunted mobile phone? Send a text and die? No, no how about a haunted can of deodorant, smell bad or die? Or a haunted website? Oh wait.Anyway, let's just ignore the lameness of the storyline for a second. The film starts off with two girls in a room and one of them tells the other one about a piece of film she has watched and that if you watch that film, within seven days, you die. That was seven days ago. I'm sure I don't need to spell out what happens next...the girl who watched the tape dies with a silly look on her face and the other one goes insane. I just hope she never meets my friend, he can do this really strange face where he sort of scrunches his lips together and goes cross eyed, Eek. The one here sucks, though.Think that was bad? sheesh, that was the best bit.This film is probably better for the people who saw it before seeing the original. The reason for that is that this film is almost a carbon copy of the original, which is understandable because that's the nature of remakes but in the move from east to west, they forgot to transfer the two best things about the original: its look and holes in the story. The original was nice and grainy, which made it all the more frightening. I mean, OK, its hard to scare when your centrepiece is a haunted piece of plastic but the grainy picture and the darkness of it went some way to making it frightening, the fact that it was glossy meant that the picture was clear and easy on the eyes, and therefore the scares were kept down to a minimum. Which is a good thing in say, a kids movie for example, but not in a horror.The second thing: The holes in the story. Usually plot holes are looked down on, but I don't mean plot holes, I'm referring to the fact that the original left several stones unturned, or only partially revealed. I think that someone forgot to tell Hollywood that sometimes the unexplained is more scary than the understandable, after all that's everyone's principal fear: The great unknown.The main meat of the story comes when a reporter (Naomi Watts) inadvertently views the video tape, then lets her friend watch it, and then her son watches it without her permission (typical kid). Naomi and her friend then have seven days to avert disaster, and save the life of her son. They do this by tracking down the origin of the haunted video piece of plastic and finding out about the girl in the tape, Samara. To the films credit, it moves at a nice pace, and keeps your interest fairly well. Then again, that's to the credit of the original really, not the remake.To my knowledge, this was my first encounter with Naomi Watts. I can't say I was impressed. I mean, her performance in this wasn't bad, and it may be my contempt for the film that's clouding my vision, but after all the great things I'd heard about the woman, I was expecting more. More did come however on my viewing of 'Mulholland Dr.' and wow, what a step down from that to this, eeek, what was she thinking?However, despite all the negativity so far, even this film has plus points, two of them in fact. The first one is the direction. In my opinion, the film is a credit to Gore Verbrinski, his directing is nicely done and the use of the camera is solid, it's just a shame about the rest of the movie. The second good thing about the movie is the soundtrack. The soundtrack itself is nothing to write home about, in fact I can barely even remember it, but at least it didn't resort to lots of heavy metal with a strong bass line like in so many other modern horror movies, that sort of music doesn't go down well at all in my opinion.The film's ending is another one of those predictable twists in the style of 'The Sixth Sense' or 'The Others', you know, the ones that everyone likes. After Naomi and co have solved the mystery, they think all is well and they all go home. However, all is not well as Naomi's friend finds out when Samara comes out of the television set in one of the stupidest movie moments of all time and gets him. I couldn't have been the only one who saw that coming.",The Ring

39,sddavis63,It Did Absolutely Nothing For Me - Except Put Me To Sleep,1,6 June 2009,"From the high ratings and good reviews this movie gets, I approached it with very high expectations, which ultimately led to a major disappointment. The movie was spoiled from the start by a story that made no sense whatsoever (incoherent is a word that comes to mind to try to describe the plot), was then further burdened by weak acting galore and then ruins the only hope for its redemption by not even being bad enough to be funny - it ended up just plain bad (and not in the least bit scary.) Out of a mountain of problems, let me highlight just one: where in the world did the video come from? The story (such as it is) revolves around the concept that anyone who watches this video dies exactly seven days later. But the origin of the video is never satisfactorily explained. Yes, it has something to do with Samara (the deceased girl whose evil powers are still being used from her grave) - but how? And since the video is the centrepiece of the movie, I found that a major stumbling block that I couldn't get over. The truth is, this movie put me to sleep for about 40 minutes in the middle. When I could make no sense of the ending after waking up, I assumed it was because of the 40 minutes I had missed; so I went back and watched those 40 minutes. Clearly I was a glutton for punishment. It still made no sense. It was a total waste of 2 hours. 1/10",The Ring

41,sol1218,Ring a Ding Ding,5,6 November 2009,"***SPOILERS*** At first I thought that ""The Ring"" was the telephone ringing right after one watched this crazy video tape about trees deep water wells a fly in the ointment and finally a desolate island with this strange looking woman and lighthouse with only a ladder and chair in it! All taped in grainy black and white. It came as a complete shock to me when it was reviled in the movie that anyone who watched this mind bogging tape would die in exactly seven days! I thought that anyone who was able to sit through the whole God awful video tape would have died a whole lot sooner!It's after her niece Katie, Amber Tamlyn, suddenly died of fright seven days after she saw the tape that Seattle newspaper investigative reporter Rachel Keller, Naomi Watts, decided to check what was the cause of Katie's mysterious death. As things turn out not only does Rachel track down the strange killer tape, at the country motel where Katie spent the weekend with her friends, but also ends up watching it! What made things even worse is that Rachel's six year old son Adian, David Drofman, saw the tape as well without his mother knowing about it. This set the stage for Rachel, after finding out that the tape can actually kill anyone who watched it, together with her live-in boyfriend and Aidan's father Noah, Martin Henderson, attempt to somehow find out how to prevent the tape from not only killing Aidan but also Rachel as well as Noah who, you guessed it, also saw the tape! The movie ""The Ring"" never fully explains why this weirdo video-tape has this strange power to kill anyone who takes the time to watch it! We get this half-ass story that it had something to do with the creepy Morgan family who were champion horse breeders and lived on the island depicted in the video-tape. Anna Morgan, Shannon Cochran, the strange woman in the tape is shown killing herself by jumping off a cliff on the island. Anna's even stranger daughter Samara, Daveigh Chase, the person who the video-tape seemed to be all about seems to have had completely vanished into thin air after the tape was finished. It's old man Richrd Morgan, Brian Cox, the only surviving member of the Morgan clan who seems to be the only person in the movie who knows the secret of what this off-the-wall tape is really all about. But with him being tracked down and unmercifully harassed by Rachel into having him reveal the tape's secrets he just flips out and and ended it all in grand fashion. Richard goes out in a blaze of glory by electrocuting himself with some 20,000 volts of electricity using his overflowing bathtub as the electric volts powerful grounded conductor!***SPOILER**** The movie starts to fall apart as it slowly, and I mean Slowly, lumbers on to it's shocking as well as brainless conclusion. It's then that everything goes to pieces when the long dead, it turned out that she was murdered, Samara comes back to life in both the bottom of a 150 foot empty well as well as in, and out, of Noah's TV set! By the time the film is finally over you begin to realize that not only you but those who made it have absolutely no idea what its supposed to be all about!P.S ""The Ring"" seems to have copied, even though its based on the recent Japanese horror thriller ""Riongu"", from the 1983 David Cronenberg Sci-Fi classic ""Videodrome"". The big difference between the two movies is that ""Videodrome"" despite it's complicated storyline was both thought-provoking as well as entertaining where as ""The Ring"" never even managed to get off the ground!",The Ring

43,Robert_duder,Mind Blowing!!!,10,25 March 2005,"Of course different tastes will cause some people to feel differently about different films. I think The Ring is quite possibly one of the greatest films of all time, and needless to say my favorite or at the very least top three. Horror films, and I have seen hundreds, tend to lack extreme intelligence, they can be campy, crazy, senseless but still fun to watch. The Ring doesn't even fall into that category. Instead the American remake of the Japanese Ringu (also brilliantly made) is one of the most intelligent horrific and terrifying movies in existence. It doesn't just frighten, it gets under the skin and terrifies.The Ring is the story of a reporter named Rachel Keller, who's niece and three of her teenage friends quite suddenly die, their heart just stops. Rachel speaks to several people at her niece's funeral and discovers that many of them believe in an urban legend of a killer video tape that supposedly her niece and friends had watched. Rachel is determined to get to the bottom of the mysterious deaths and goes to the place where her niece supposedly saw this tape, an inn in the mountains. She finds the unmarked tape, and not believing the legend pops it in and is instantly caught in a downward spiral, no pun intended, of a mysterious, terrifying mystery. Suddenly a believer of the legend she calls her ex-boyfriend (possibly husband) and father of her son who is some sort of a video expert and shows it to him. He doesn't believe the stories at all until he gradually begins to realize he too is dying. They desperately piece together the clues from the killer video tape but not before their son, Aidan, accidentally gets hold of the tape and watches it as well. Now they're not only fighting for their lives but the life of their son. They uncover a horrible curse that started with an adopted daughter of a man and woman who were horse breeders. It seemed that the woman murdered her daughter after losing her mind. Despite the fact that they seemingly have figured out the mystery, they've got it all wrong and the evil won't go away.How incredibly easy it would be for a plot like this to do one of two things. 1. Become so incredibly confusing that it would be hard to follow and make no sense or 2. be completely cut and edited to shreds to ""dumb it down"" for the movie going public. Somehow, brilliantly, Gore Verbinsky managed to do neither. The film fits together perfectly, and leaves so much open to discussion, imagination, or further stories of this deadly curse. The cast is all around brilliant. Naomi Watts, who until this film I would have figured not a good enough actress to pull off such an emotional role is so excellent as Rachel. She shows confidence, fear, and breakdown all at once. Her boyfriend played by Martin Henderson is equally as great in his role and their relationship is handled with dignity and charisma. And huge hats off to young David Dorfman who plays Watts' son Aidan. Dorfman's character is diverse and very strange. He seems to carry a connection with the evil Samara, and perhaps has some sort of abilities himself. He is much more grown up than he appears. Dorfman engulfs this role and is just startling and creepy and adds to the mood. He does a great job. So why is The Ring so great?? It's terrifying, that's why. This is done first and foremost by brilliant writing, the story itself is terrifying. But Verbinsky also created a very dull, Grey, rainy, dark setting that is constant and never breaks for comedy or ""lighten up."" The killer video itself sends shivers down your spine and you finish the movie wondering if your phone is gonna ring with a proclamation of ""SEVEN DAYS!"" As in the original Japanese film, the time line is fast paced and you feel the anxiousness knowing they only have a short time to solve the mystery. The Ring is genuinely creepy and I don't suggest ever watching it alone. But I do suggest anyone a fan of remakes or horror or suspense, you MUST MUST own The Ring. I cannot wait another minute to see the follow up. There is so much more to this franchise!! HUGE 10 out of 10",The Ring
44,dromasca,An Unpleasant Experience,6,22 April 2003,"Well, a horror movie should not be a pleasant experience, should it? What I actually mean is that 'The Ring' is an unpleasant artistic experience, and this despite being actually well filmed. The director seems to be one of these technically skilled people, capable of taking a story and translating it into good cinematography. The problem is that the story has no logic, time is badly manipulated, there is no emotion to connect the viewers to the guys supposed to be good in the story, and frankly not enough thrill to make this a memorable horror film. The end which is suppose to explain what this was all about (need it?) is kind of a ridiculous joke, imported from the 'Gothic' stories. I realize that many people actually liked the film, but in this case I need to be rather on the critics side. 'The Ring' is a mediocre film, and there are not too many reasons to recommend it to my friends. 6/10 on my personal scale.",The Ring
45,CuriosityKilledShawn,Nonsense played straight,6,10 April 2005,"Morose color schemes, oddball characters and lots of rain apparently make a popular and successful film. While the Ring is an interesting view (once) if you look too closely at this film you'll realize that it's a huge pile of codswhallop that will never add up no matter how much you force it. Let's disassemble...A girl is born to a stray woman but possessed with the soul of a vengeful spirit in need of love and a mother but never in need of sleep. The child is named Samara and adopted by horse breeders Mr. and Mrs. Morgan. But because Samara is cursed with freakyness the horses go crazy and commit suicide while others fail to breed. As punishment for being this way the Morgans trap her in a big attic in a barn. Not content with this they smack her on the back of the head with a rock and chuck her down a well. Their suicides soon follow.Many years later Samara, using her freaky powers at the bottom of the well, somehow brings into existence a video tape featuring a freaky student film of imagery of her freaky life. Anyone who watches this tape dies 7 days later. Which doesn't make sense either as the first person who watched it wouldn't know they were going to die. And neither would the second. So how the urban legend surrounding it got started is a mystery. And why 7 days? Why not right away? Does she want the tape to be deciphered and to be found? A journalist called Rachel investigates the tape, luckily making a copy-ridding herself of the 7-day curse and unravels Samara's freaky life. Her body is found and laid to rest properly. BUT THIS IS A BAD THING! Somehow. It's never really explained why it is but other than the uttering of cryptic dialogue such as 'You let the dead get in'.But bad things don't really happen after this anyway, other than more people watching the video tape. And then everything's okay right? We might as well fade out now...",The Ring

48,tabuno,Not Scary But Really Intense,8,27 January 2019,"18 October 2002. I can't really describe The Ring as a horror movie, it's more like a mystery thriller with a paranormal twist. Unlike the average horror movie, this movie takes a much more serious tone, using little violence and gore. The movie wasn't that scary, but instead it contained a continuous undertone of heavy-leadened dread, like a nightmare from which you can't wake up. There were a number of excellent moments of fright, well done, suspenseful. On the whole, the movie was consistent in its plot, made reasonable sense and had a good twist at the end. There were also some exotic, original images (reminiscent of good indpendent movies). While the movie would have been even better if it could have scared us as much as a creepy Blair Witch Project, it had an even better intelligent storyline and emotional undertone. Movie's ultimate resolution, however, was implicitedly unsettling for those of the audience that think the whole storyline through, perhap even repulsive. Eight out of ten.",The Ring

53,zkonedog,Bringing Japanese Horror Stateside,8,12 March 2017,"Here in the United States, our horror movie culture is defined by mask-wearing, knife-wielding psychos like Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees. Over in Japan, though, their horror is much more dark and symbolic. ""The Ring"" (an adaptation of the Japanese ""Ringu"") brings that cinematic style over here.For a basic plot summary, ""The Ring"" introduces a video tape that, when watched, will result in the viewer getting a phone call telling them they will die in seven days...which is usually exactly what happens. However, when the tape is seen by a journalist (Naomi Watts) and inadvertently by her son, they become engaged in a race against the clock to try and decipher the tape's mysterious imagery and the real story behind the ring.The dark, disturbing imagery in this film is really what makes it a horror stand-out. Since we are accustomed to more in-your-face scare scenes, this oblique style proves to be even more terrifying. The young girl with the straight hair over her eyes, the well, the dead horses, and the horrifying faces of the tape's victims all add up to a cornucopia of disturbing images.""The Ring"" is also an exercise in the cerebral. Not all the answers are given up front or thrown in the viewers' face. Instead, we are forced to evaluate all the imagery and subtle clues to piece things together. To paraphrase Hitchcock, what we don't know/see is often scarier than the obvious.Overall, I consider ""The Ring"" to be a seminal horror film for fans of the genre (right up there with Halloween and Saw). Given the chance, I would have bumped the star-rating up to 4.5.",The Ring
54,poe426,Anachronisms abound...,10,24 November 2014,"Though it's only little over a decade old, THE RING is chock full of anachronisms: a VHS tape (analog, as opposed to the current digital dvds); a newspaper reporter who actually goes out and hunts down a story; a newspaper; a newspaper that actually prints the story that the reporter turns in; an implicit warning about the horrors of watching too much television; etc. Although it's an ""Americanized"" remake of a Japanese Fright Film, it's not dumbed down in the traditional manner of American remakes: it's superbly crafted, with some fine performances throughout; there's even a bit of suspense along the way. The opening scenes culminate with a real zinger (it surprised me back when I first saw it, and I was already familiar with RINGU). The makeup is VERY effective, by the way. Anyone who watches the tape that triggers the Horror has seven days to get their Earthly affairs in order. Rachel (Naomi Watts), the reporter, makes the mistake of showing the tape to her ex and, later, leaving her son alone with the tape- which he, too, watches. At this point, it's a race against Time as the Otherworldly occurrences commence. When Rachel tracks down the man ultimately responsible for everything, Morgan (Brian Cox), he tells her: ""You take one person's tragedy and force the world to experience it. You spread it like a sickness."" It's Morgan's dead daughter who's back from the dead, a ""horse whisperer"" who hated being in the barn with the horses that the Morgan family bred. THE RING is one of the better Fright Films of decades past, and it's still worth a look Today. (Note: Yet another comment has been censored.

55,johnnyboyz,Scary and eerie with what you'd expect out of a film like this but The Ring is an overall failure of forced horror.,6,9 September 2007,"The idea that you watch a video tape, receive a phone call and then die within a week of engaging in these two events is an interesting idea but at the same time, not that scary  what is it that's going to cause you to die that is so scary you can't get medical or authoritarian help? But that's what The Ring is; a film that doesn't rely on character logistics or 'what should be done in that situation' but rather relies on eeriness and uncanny things to get across its scares.I will not deny that The Ring is scary because it is a very unnerving and creepy film  although there's no violence or gore, I was still finding myself looking away from the screen once or twice but I realised afterwards that this was due to the fact I had absolutely no idea what it was I was dealing with in the film. If you were to make a ten second film of someone opening a creaky old door, going inside to a pitch black room whilst all the time having eerie music playing over the events and really dark lighting over the images, you'll probably find your audience looking away merely because they don't know who any one is, why what's happening IS happening and what's going to pop out at them. This is The Ring to a tee.The Ring is a horror film that takes a detective route and the character of Rachel Keller (Watts) takes on the detective role in a rather tired way. The introduction to the video tape in question is a very brief and rather crude way of setting up the events  no, I don't believe that fate would have one girl mention 'the tape' literally minutes before the other girl would succumb to its curse and no, I don't believe that characters at the funeral would be able to free roam their way through the bedroom where the death happened since it should be a crime scene, but there is no help in the form of authoritarian figures, remember? This is a world without police and the FBI to investigate strange occurrences which is ironic because at times, The Ring does feel like an episode of The X Files.Once it's established that this tape exists, The Ring turns into a film that relies on its breaking of everyday rules to crank up suspense. I mentioned the bedroom/crime scene occurrence which shouldn't have even happened because people wouldn't have been allowed up there. Also, the car ferry scene where a horse bolts from its carriage due to Keller's presence; again, it shouldn't have happened because once a car ferry starts moving, passengers aren't allowed on the car deck. As it was, that scene was self-motivated by the character of Keller (who could've stepped away when the horse got agitated) and turned out to be rather unpleasant.The film consists of Keller and her sidekick Noah Clay (Henderson) attempting to solve the case of the tape whilst avoiding the uncanny events that happen in-between every now and again. These include the horse/ferry scene, the taking of a fly from the video, nose bleeds, flashing images from the video itself and a creepy Sixth Sense-come-Omen type male child who the film relies on to get most of the uncomfortable atmosphere across; needless to say it works but on a basic level. Why anything's actually scary in The Ring is because you will not have too much of an idea to what is going on. The confusing plot that only really becomes clear in the final fifteen minutes merely toils on your mind more and more as each eerie scene goes past being able to cope with the scares and with the working out of the plot is hard work. The fact the film makers have a license to include just about anything in the form of scares doesn't help too much.I found the finale of the film a little disturbing but only because Keller involves her child in a way that I didn't think was necessary in fact The Ring ends rather downbeat and more like a tragedy when it becomes clear what the motivation of the tape actually is. The Ring has its scares and maybe two jumps at the most but this is very much a case of seen it - don't need to see it again.",The Ring

My opinion hasn't changed notably.Sure, this is an American remake but it goes too far on the CGI aspect and the Hollywood clichès. I mean, the original ""Ringu"" was creepy and started the craziness for ghost children in Horror.The American remake exploits the Samara factor to the point that it is cheap, non-scary, an even laughable. For those who haven't seen the original, this version may fit for ghost revenge tastes but forget about suspense or true scare scenes.

And, while it starts off typically, it ascends into a beautiful, darkling, twisted, genuinely creepy story, which holds you through to the end.Gore Verbinski's style is unmistakable. He has left this work well marked with his stylistic shots, and suspenseful progression.Actually, I found this far superior to most horrors done in the last thirty years or so. A lot has been said about Ringu, the work from which this was adapted for American cinema, and inevitable subsequent comparisons made, however, that is certainly NOT the case. That argument is moot, as this work was based on the novel, ""The Ring"" by Koji Suzuki, so if you want something to which an honest comparison may be made, I would suggest you read the book, and leave Ringu where it belongs.

60,Captain_Couth,You will die of brain rot after you see THE RING!!!,3,26 November 2003,"Cheap thrills. That's a summary of the entire film. The Ring (2002) is a dumbed down Hollywood version of the Japanese horror film Ringu (1999). The Ring is actually two movies in one, it combines both elements of Ringu and Ringu 2. Instead of making a straight horror ghost story like the Japanese version, The Ring suffers from the old scheme of trying too hard. Yes, it tries to be scary, hip and an instant classic. The movie fails on all three levels. The subliminal scenes are of old hat nature, adding elements to this film that were not in the original damage the film's chill factor and the liberal amounts of cheap scares land this movie right in the middle of Cheeseville.Naomi Watts is several years older than the character is suppose to be and by literally transposing scenes from the Japanese version will not make any sense to most of the audience giving Ms. Watts the aura of being a bad parent. The child in the movie is too cold for his own good and the father character is bad. I did not enjoy the film when I first saw it and after viewing it recently I still don't. Why mess with a good thing? Why did they have to add the t&a factor into the picture? Not only is the film bad but cheap as well. Not recommended.",The Ring
61,Polaris_DiB,Meh! Meh...,4,19 March 2007,"Remember when everyone was talking about this? Remember when it was, like, the scariest movie ever, and stuff? Man, am I glad that fad has passed.This decent but incomplete adaptation is also a decent and incomplete companion piece to the original Ringu. I consider a fan of Asian cinema, but Ringu was also a decent and incomplete film unto itself. That's pretty much the way to describe this entire series.Why does the ghost decide to inhabit the curse in a videotape (of all things, especially considering that this remake comes in the DVD era)? The answer can only be assumed. How does the tape come to exist? Well apparently it was first recorded by those teenagers up in the mountains, but then again, how did that urban legend then spread if it the teenager who dies in the beginning was one of the first and only ones to see it? But more importantly than plot holes... why do people think this movie is scary again? An answer shall never rise from the well.Anyway, as a production its pretty decent. Naomi Watts is as good as any movie she's in, which means she does pretty well but not spectacular here. Gore Verbinski is, I feel, a really good director, he just is caught in Hollywood doing stuff like this. Everyone gives their due and the movie itself goes along pretty well (in fact, I give it entertainment points for being funny, as the horse falling into the water scene is spectacular comedy). It's just that nothing in the proceedings really sticks or matters. It's a horror show that toned itself down enough to be handled by 13 year olds, which means it's pretty much refused the right to do anything really interesting at all.And if trippy videos scare people, why isn't avant-garde cinema taking off?

To find out, the mother of a teenager who apparently watched the tape (along with several other ill-fated friends) asks her sister Rachel (Naomi Watts), a newspaper reporter, to look into the matter. Rachel has a little boy named Aidan (David Dorman, looking a lot like a Culkin brother), who was close to the suddenly deceased teen. Rachel's travails take her to the stereotypical isolated cabin, where the group of teens stayed, and she discovers the tape. And watches it, of course, as I'm sure we all would. Does she also have seven days? Will she die of fright? And what of her cherubic, quiet son? And how about the neo-hippie, Bohemian ex-lover Noah, whose expertise in video production she needs? Rachel and Noah - who also watches the tape, against Rachel's wishes - find out more and more about the tape's origins and especially about the various specific images on the tape. You see, anyone who has taken a film class in college has seen student or arthouse film shorts that are steeped in abstract art. The images on the tape, very evocative and eerily mesmerizing, are all tied in together somehow - but how? What begins as an investigation of a seemingly harmless urban legend spawns a hysterical, desperate search for survival. It'd be one thing if Rachel had just been able to find out who was behind the tape - you know, a kind of ""I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that snooping reporter"" thing - without actually watching the tape. But she HAS to watch it, and we have to watch along with her. There are some truly disturbing moments on the tape, and there were plenty of people shuddering in the movie theater. The main problem with the movie is that it never makes one think it's real. Sure, movies aren't documentaries, but a movie is much more enjoyable when the audience really feels as if they're in the movie, or at least feels as if the movie could be happening. But The Ring doesn't quite hook its audience; instead, it feels disconnected, as if - surprise! - you're watching a movie. This is not to say that the characters are not endearing or well-developed, because they are. Rachel is an excellent heroine - she's very smart, can think on her own, she's inventive, curious, creative, and adventurous. (She's also gorgeous, but that aspect isn't played up at all, refreshingly.) And Aidan is a wonderful multilayered character - like many things in the movie, Aidan is not always what we see. Is he a just a quiet, smart kid? Does he know about The Ring? Director Gore Verbinski does a great job in setting the mood; what Rachel feels, we do, although we still realize that what's happening is happening on screen only. There's excellent atmosphere, including a creepy scene with a little girl in an insane asylum; it's all very lurid. Watching Rachel piece the mystery together, while racing the clock, is fascinating - but again, it's like watching runners in a marathon on TV. You can see them sweat, and you can see them gasp, but you can't feel the pain they're going through, either physically or mentally.   The pacing of the movie is also above average - truly suspenseful moments are drawn out, and the real terror isn't seen, but imagined. As with The Sixth Sense, the act of building tension in a scene can really make or break a horror/suspense movie. Lesser films show you everything, and that's why they're lesser films.   So what's the bottom line? Is this a movie worth watching? Yes, it is. It's not the full-blown horror classic it wants to be, but it doesn't miss the mark by much. And the scenes on the infamous videotape have to be seen to be believed. It is a movie that'll haunt you for a few days or weeks? Probably not. It has a lot of evocative images, and it's well acted, but it lacks a heart.",The Ring

65,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,8,13 October 2016,"This American remake of the Japanese original exceeds expectations. A 'troubled kid' always sends alarm bells ringing – often they are written and portrayed in such a precocious way that invites deep irritation rather than sympathy. Despite plenty of opportunities to exhibit such behaviour, young David Dorfman as Aiden mainly manages to avoid this. His mother Rachel (Naomi Watts) is actually less sympathetic than he is. She is an abrasive character who is very difficult to warm to.Luckily, 'The Ring' also resists being a 'teen' movie, despite opening with two adolescent girls talking about 'this videotape  that kills people'. Before long, as coincidence would have it, one of the girls has succumbed to that very curse.Overall, this is a good, spooky remake of the 1998 film. It cultivates its own unique brand of horror. Often shot in cold colours, much use is made of creeping water, blurred photographs and the everyday city portrayed as an oppressive, menacing environment. While the idea of videotapes is suddenly archaic, it actually gives the oncoming horror a nostalgic, creepy feeling that, for example, a Blu-Ray just wouldn't provide. The 'subliminal' imagery on the tape is also a very sinister, abstract series of events. You don't know what it all means, but it certainly doesn't look cheerful.Gore Verbinski's direction is very effective, building up a level of tension from less than obvious means. Views of tower-blocks, rain-swept streets and boxed-in people leading desolate lives help create an isolated world. Hans Zimmer's wonderful musical score also promotes the notion of seclusion, with echoing piano minimalism, notes like raindrops. The central idea of Rachael hearing about a videotape that kills people, and then watching the tape and inviting Aiden's father Noah (Martin Henderson) to watch it too, takes a lot of justification in logical terms and questions her intelligence. I'm not happy with the lack of explanation of this. Does she do this deliberately? In horror, stupid people do stupid things.The impenetrable images on the tape are shadowed throughout the film, providing a certain, slowly unravelling degree of clarity. And yet it isn't until the troubled Samara (Daveigh Chase) is mentioned, an adopted girl with deadly psychic abilities, who seems in spirit, to be responsible for the doings of the curse, do Aiden's 'troubles' become clearer - he has a kind of kinship with her.The standout scene, the moment the whole film has been leading up to, is a true classic horror moment. It's more spectacular than the scene in the original, but more or less retains the intimacy of Samara's singular mission: she's coming for you. First out of image of the well, then – blurred and the image fracturing – towards the television screen; then, impossibly through the screen and into reality. It's a blisteringly good moment of pure horror.",The Ring

68,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Chilling and beautiful,9,27 October 2015,"Gore Verbinski's The Ring is a commendable effort of chilly atmospherics and bleak grey cinematography, with a nice central performance by Naomi Watts. Before I get scolded for giving this airtime when it's based on a Japanese fright flick, I've seen that one and I think this is the stronger film (same goes for The Grudge). It's just got such a personality all its own. Watts plays Rachel, a journalist who stumbles on an eerie mystery after a suspicious death in the family. She's led to a videotape containing stark, disturbing black and white images, a video tape that's purported to kill you in seven days upon watching it. She, of course, watches it, spurring on a delirious search for the truth behind it before it's too late. She's led from dreary, rain streaked Seattle to a remote horse farm on an island off the coast, the adopted home of a strange little girl with some vaguely terrifying abilities named Samara (Daveigh Chase, also Donnie Darko's little sister and Lilo from Lilo and Stitch). Underrated Martin Henderson plays a colleague who helps her out in the investigation, and creepy little David Dorfman is her strange kid. Brian Cox, as Samara's adopted father, walks away with his segment of the film, giving him fierce heartbreak and fear. Heart stopping secrets are unleashed, and the threatening presence grows and follows Rachel. I like that the film never really clarifies exactly what is wrong with Samara, just makes it very clear that it's something very wrong, which for me is much scarier than spelling it out in bland exposition. There's some skin crawling moments in this one, mostly iconic now, but I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it and will say no more than the sequences involving a well, a television and of course the omnipresent video tape are highlights. It all looks fantastic too, the colours absent in favour of a suffocating monochromatic tone, punctuated occasionally by gasping breaths of red in the fall colours at the motel she visits, and a few other moments of brief vibrance among the gloom. A true fright flick that takes its time, ratchets up a slow, mounting fear, and releases it in short bursts of stinging shock moments, bridged by lapses of pure atmosphere.",The Ring
69,drownnnsoda,Disturbing and Genuinely Creepy.,8,28 July 2006,"""The Ring"" is about a woman named Rachel Keller. She lives with her young son, Aiden in their Seattle apartment, and holds a job as a journalist. She comes upon the story of a bizarre video tape with strange and frightening images. Supposedly, if you watch the tape, the phone rings, and you die seven days later. She is a little skeptical at first, until she begins investigating the death of a teenage girl who died seven days after watching the video. She heads to a cabin in the mountains where the teenage girl was staying with her friends, and comes upon the video itself. After watching it, sure enough, the phone rings. Now a believer in the tape's mysterious power, Rachel begins to uncover the mystery behind it before she becomes the next victim - and she only has seven days to save herself and her son.A remake of a Japanese horror movie, ""The Ring"" is a well-made American retelling of the unique, creepy story. Naomi Watts delivers a great performance as the heroine, and does it quite convincingly. The video tape displayed in the movie is really creepy, loaded with all kinds of gruesome images and bizarre things. I really liked the plot of this movie, it was rather original and creepy, aside from all of the unoriginal, dime-a-dozen horror flicks that are carted out constantly. The film may seem to drag a little for those who are so used to the fast paced slasher films, but if you pay attention it's actually quite interesting.Naomi Watts leads the cast as Rachel, and is believable and empathetic - both good things for her character. David Dorffman is her mysterious but intelligent son, and Martin Henderson is Rachel's ex-husband/friend. The cast performs well and all was believable. One thing notable about this film is it's disturbing and vivid visuals, which are really great looking and add the movie's spooky and strange atmosphere. There are plenty of bizarre and scary sequences in this film, mainly in the video tape itself and the horrifying backstory behind it all.Overall, ""The Ring"" is a pretty good horror movie, not perfect but very good for sure. I found it to be pretty creepy, and very different from most horror films out there. Definitely see it, it's sure to scare you even if it's the slightest bit. 8/10.",The Ring

71,Cristi_Ciopron,"But then again, those who exceedingly like this tend do dislike MALENA ...",7,2 December 2008,"A review I have read prepared me for a bad movie; but THE RING is not bad at all . It's very scary, creepy . It is true that it's only mechanically scary; it can be conceded that the supernatural remains exterior and that the note of the movie is very tonic, like that of a suspense action movie. The most creepy character was the small boy; the most inexpressive was Watts' husband.The atmosphere is purely natural, and, when the scene is not scary, is that of a tonic suspense movie. I guess this in-aptitude for conveying the supernatural must have disappointed those who dismiss the movie as failed; and this, I can concedeTHE RING is not a bad movie, but a failed one. It utterly fails to achieve a supernatural thriller. All the supernatural remains exterior and mechanical.Given the otherworldly plot, the movie's note is very mundane and basically secure and tonic. Like a wholly _movieish suspense romp; as I doubt that Verbinski meant otherwise, the movie is conventionally welldone. If confronted to its own premise, anyway, and not to the director's intentions, it's failed.Verbinski did not flop; he has skills, he is deft; and his mistake being as subtle as it is also obvious, I doubt he would understand what it was. His version is a 'desupernaturalization of the Oriental movie(s).",The Ring
72,davispittman,Not as good as I expected,5,8 March 2017,"I'll be completely honest, this movie was not as good as I expected it to be, even though it features a worthy performance by Naomi Watts. The acting really comes through and shines, but if you take the movie as a whole, then it doesn't quite measure up to my own personal standards of horror films. The plot is interesting, watch the weird/creepy video tape, you receive a phone call saying ""7 days"" in a very low hushed creepy tone of voice. And this of course means that you will in some way die when those next 7 days are up. Naomi Watts's character is trying desperately to figure out why people around her have died from watching this tape and where the tape originated from, what it's background is and how it has these powers to kill. The movie drags in some places, and then it can be thrilling in other places. The big issue I had with the movie was that it just wasn't scary. There wasn't a single moment I thought what was happening was frightening, and that of course is not good for a horror movie. But the reason the rating isn't lower is really just because the lead performance by Watts is so good. 5/10 overall for The Ring (2002). There are better scary flicks out there.",The Ring

The idea about a videotape that kills whoever watches it in seven days is a nice one. The actors also perform well and the main plot is nice. However, to me, there are a lot of sub-plots within the movie that appears and disappears throughout the movie that makes the movie make no sense. So instead of being frightened or held in suspense as you might expect from a horror or thriller I was just going ""huh?"" and ""what?"".However this movie isn't all that bad, mainly because of the idea and originality and the actors performance.

78,Jonny_Numb,a Hollywood remake done right,6,29 July 2003,"I saw ""The Ring"" last summer and thought it was a splendidly-designed and carefully paced thriller, but I was also disappointed that the movie tied up all its points a bit to cleanly (some more ambiguity would've been welcome to keep the viewer on edge, but I suppose that's minor).  Well, I recently saw the inspiration, ""Ringu,"" and was thoroughly unimpressed by it, so I decided to give the American version another look and, by god, it is a little better than I initially gave it credit for.  With a welcome infusion of COLOR, pace, more accessible dialogue, engaging characters, and some fantastic special effects (which translate surprisingly well to the small screen), ""The Ring"" comes out victorious (granted, it's not a long-standing classic for the ages, but it is diverting).  Another factor is the intricacies of the plot--whereas ""Ringu"" merely set up a spooky concept (mysterious videotape that kills a person 7 days after viewing) and didn't build much around it, the American version has a more complicated narrative that induces some genuine heart-in-throat intensity.6/10",The Ring

Naomi Watts provides an excellent performance, with a decent supporting cast. The film's pacing for the most part is quite fantastic. One of the films only problems is its cliche filled beginning, used to set up the film's plot itself. The scene itself does prove necessary, but it feels too on the nose to actually enjoy, and features most certainly the worst acting throughout the film. The tone and style of the film blend together perfectly, and the films script proves to be both charming and incredibly entertaining- full of twists and turn that are more than bound to grab your attention, and if you're a horror fan, put a smile on your face.

It was pretty clever and most of all it was very thrilling and full of suspense. The movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat and Naomi Watts is (as we already could see in Mulholland Dr.) a great actress.

I don't have high expectations of recently released horror movies, so if an opportunity arises where I don't have to waste money to see it, I'll take it. 'The Ring' was a major disappointment. As everyone probably knows, the story involves a videocassette that brings death upon it's viewers, who will recieve a phone call. Bottom line: don't pick up the telephone. Actually the movie makes for a good prank if you have friends watching this movie and then dial their phone while they're in the middle of seeing it. Will they answer it or won't they? I never found this movie to be scary and I blame it on one too many cheap scare tactics. At one point the story gets so ridiculous in trying to find out who the person is on the tape that I was expecting them to say the horse did it. It also doesn't add to the suspense when people in the theater are forcing their screams at nearly every (even subtle) little surprise in the movie. Now, normally, I love a good horror film, even if it is recently released, so long as I liked it. But this movie was just too overrated for what it was, probably trying to cash in on some of the fright fest exploits of the Blair Witch Project. They're not the same movie, but their scare tactics are similar at points. I say, if you're an easy scare when it comes to horror movies, then you'll probably go nuts with this production.

This film is hardly anything more or less than a weird, and often ridiculous charade of a ghost story, which is occasionally evocative but less so than it is dreary. sometimes it is on the right track, but usually it is not.After the bizarre death of her niece, Rachel Keller, a young journalist is asked by the departed's mother to investigate. Her search leads her to a motel cabin where she finds an unlabeled video cassette. She players it once, it contains about twenty seconds of grainy miscellaneous shots including a dead horse, a girl coming out of a well, and bizarre ring of light. Moments later the phone rings and informs Racheal that she has a week to live. Can she uncover the truth before it kills her and subsequently puts her own son in danger.The story is kinda spooky, but it falls apart. In the end, the Ring is a failure simply because it makes no sense. True horror fans will watch the Ring and probably dedicate the rest of the day to figuring out what it all meant. As a horror fan myself, when I see a movie, I want to be scared and intrigued as I watch, not hours AFTER I've finished watching.As a protagonist, I kinda liked Naomi Watts. She doesn't have a lot to do but she does it well. A lot of her acting is done not with her words but with her eyes, in the same way Jeff Bridges acted with his body in Starman. I guess she is the only thing memorable about this otherwise mediocre motion picture. The Ring is dull, sloppy and doesn't do much for me.",The Ring

85,triple8,Finally-maybe the first GREAT horror to come out of the last 10 years.,8,16 March 2004,"The Ring, which I almost didn't originally see, being that it looked so scary, turned out to be more then I bargained for. When I did see it, I had no idea I was about to view a horror flick that actually had depth and originality! Finally, Finally- a movie where the movie makers hit it spot on!This movie blows away other supernatural thrillers like:""The Others"", ""stir of echos"", ""what lies beneath"" and ""gothica"". It also blows away movies like ""Scream"". The ring is a heavily atmospheric, genuinely frightening film that relies almost NILL in the way of blood and gore and still manages to absolutely horrify-as well as haunt you.The Ring reminds me of the movies I grew up loving, those atmospheric horrors of the 70's and early 80's, it seems nobody MAKES anymore, like ""The Other""(NOT ""The others!) and ""Let's scare Jessica to death"". I had kind of distanced myself from the horror genre in the last decade or more actually, because there were so few truly GOOD ones around-most horrors now rely on gore and cheap effects. And the supernatural ones, many times just bore me with their unoriginality. I was exhilarated at the end of The Ring because it threw me back in time to when horrors were actually good!The acting was great. The scenes were vivid and surreal and stay with you. The photography,lighthouses, fog, scenery etc is haunting and has that air of quiet gloom where the movie is WAITING ,that is just perfectly reminisint of old school horrors. The makers of this should be proud. It also reminds one, how bad some of these other horrors can be. I actually rated ""Gothica"" about a 5 or so on here and after seeing ring as a rental(after I saw gothica) I wondered why. And really BAD movies like ""what lies beneath"" aren't even worth mentioning in the same breath.A good horror has to have more then the ability to scare. It has to be well made, atmospheric and if it's haunting so much the better. It has to hook you in. And as far as the sequel to the ring, The ring2 goes, I am not nor have I ever been a sequel type of person yet I am looking forward to this. I have to see it. This movie got me, hooked me and I'm GLAD! It's about time!I'm all grown up now but I bet if I'd seen The Ring as a kid, it would have scared me triple. The most frightening scene by far is :SPOILER When Samara comes walking out of the television set. Also when Aiden tells Naomi Watts :that she shouldn't have let ""her"" out. Also the pictures coming out distorted which really freaked me out and it didn't help when the phone rang right after the first murder and it was late at night. Scared the heck out of me but in a good way!Only bad thing-there was a tiny bit of gore which was rather icky and not even necessary-could have lived without it-that and the horse scene which was more sad then scary. Go see The Ring-right now if you haven't. It rocks!",The Ring
86,rosscinema,Fairly good remake but endless,6,26 January 2004,"I was impressed by the original Japanese version ""Ringu"" and that film was more tidy in it's storytelling but the same cannot be said about this remake. Story is about a video tape that when watched the telephone rings and the viewer has seven days to live. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a reporter and when her niece dies under suspicious circumstances she investigates and hears the story about the tape. Her son Aidan (David Dorfman) has been drawing strange pictures that end up being part of the mystery. Her investigation leads to a cabin where the viewing of the tape took place and she takes it back with her so that her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) who works with video equipment can check it out.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****Aidan views the tape and now Rachel must hurry to find out the source of the curse and she and Noah head to a ranch where a woman named Anna Morgan (Shannon Cochran) use to breed horses but she meets  her husband Richard (Brian Cox) who seems hostile. More investigating leads them back to the cabin and they discover a well under the floor where they think Anna's dead daughter may lie.This film was directed by Gore Verbinski who is a very talented director and he would end up making ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". This is a very good looking film that keeps a dark and hazy atmosphere throughout and I don't recall one scene that has sunshine in it. Every shot that takes place outdoors is either rainy or overcast and it helps create an eerie mood to the film. I enjoyed the pacing of the film and it keeps your interest throughout although there are a few changes in the script from the Japanese version to make it more Americanized. The one problem I had with this film was that it didn't seem to want to end and there were probably three different times that it could have. It just seemed to go on and on and I have to admit that I can't really explain everything I watched in this film. It is a complicated story and to it's credit this film never ventures into typical Hollywood cliche's but I wish this could have been wrapped up better. I do recommend this film and Watts once again proves she's a solid actress but the script sure could have been tightened up. The original is definitely better but this isn't a bad effort.",The Ring

Well, the question is about to be answered in Gore Verbinski's clever and very frightening adaptation of the Japanese movie RINGU.It tells the urban legend-like story of a ""cursed"" video that, when viewed, will bring death unto the viewer within seven days -- no less, no more. As a matter of fact, the tongue-in-cheek beginning in which two teenage girls are chattering about this video sets the stage which inexorably details the unspeakable fate which is about to befall to one of the girls, Katie (played by ""JOAN OF ARCADIA"" star Amber Tamblyn), the first of four victims to die in an inexplicable fashion.Enter Katie's aunt Rachel (Naomi Harris), a reporter called on by her sister to find out about what lead to her death. Rachel learns that Karie and three other friends died at exactly 10 o'clock at the same time and notices that pictures taken at a trip to a remote lodge reveal blurry, almost monstrous faces... as if their very images had been completely corrupted. She heads out to this lodge, picks up the video by chance, rents a room, views the tape -- which is a collection of disturbing, ""art-movie"" images... and gets a call in which she has seven days to live.And as simple as that, the story of THE RING takes off into uncharted territory as Verbinski develops the events stemming off from the act of viewing this tape while simultaneously trying to find out about its nature: where it comes from, who made it, why does it even exist. Because Rachel only has seven days to solve this mystery, as does her ex-husband Noah who has seen the tape, and because their own son's life is also in danger, the tension is greatly heightened. Matters must be settled, because it's becoming progressively clear that this is no ordinary tape, and because things are getting more and more complicated, and the noose is tightening.Verbinski brings forth the back-story surrounding this tape expertly, a little at a time, almost casually. One is led to believe the woman in the video -- Anna Morgan -- is the person to focus on, but this is far from the truth, as are several other details surrounding the ill-fated Morgan family. This is a trick that Hitchcock used fairly regularly in all of his suspense films and Verbinski clearly knows his suspense: in not revealing too much too soon and misleading his viewers, he fools them. Adding surreal elements of imminent danger about to manifest itself at every turn only amps up the terror, and one sequence is a definite standout. While heading to a secluded island on a ferry, a horse, sensing something other than Rachel's presence (or reacting to her taint, since she has seen this cursed tape and is marked by its black energy), breaks free from where it's being kept and threatens to cause some grievous bodily harm to someone, anyone, on the ferry. What happens to that horse is as horrifying as anything committed on screen, even more so than the film's denouement, and forces us to realize we are entering into a world of true, absolute evil.The thing is, to fall right into the heart of a mystery can be one of the most awful things anyone can experience, and Rachel, here being the Final Girl, does just that. More than a reporter she is the person who penetrates the inner circle that lies within the images of the video, but also, in doing so, she is also the one who releases its will upon the world and perpetuates its existence. Like the ring from LORD OF THE RINGS, like many of Stephen King's monsters and skeletons from his own books, Bad Things Want To Be Found because pain and terror are the things in which they feed on.Relentlessly disturbing, THE RING is proof that one doesn't need to spell it out to be terrifying. The mundane has become chaos, the third wall has been broken, and the author of this hellish nightmare has come to vampirize on our very souls. An excellent horror film, made better because of its deft direction, precise acting, rich atmosphere, and the law that having no explanation for the whys is the best approach.",The Ring
88,raulfaust,Bah,5,9 October 2011,"People hyped this film all around the world, stating this is one of the most scary movies ever. You guys who did that should start stop lying. ""The Ring"" has a perfect photography direction and editing; the actors do their best, Naomi Watts does an amazing job here. But something just doesn't work. Whilst the story is original and very intriguing, the film itself isn't able to scare or chill the spectator. The famous Samara only appears in the last minutes, spending less time in scene than a movie extra in ""Titanic"". I have no idea if the original Japanese version is better or worse than this, anyway I'm not recommending ""The Ring"" to any of my friends.",The Ring
89,lewiskendell,Psychological horror doesn't get much better.,7,20 April 2010,"Psychological horror films can be among the most effective ones. Their reliance on slowly building tension and atmosphere makes them less susceptible to the desensitization that can come with the repeated ""jump scares"" and excessive gore that can be an issue in other kinds of horror movies. Of course, psychological horror always must be sure to not be too slow-paced, because then it becomes boring. The Ring is a perfect example of what I consider a good psych-horror movie to be, because it unfolds like a mystery and keeps the viewer cerebrally involved...as it scares the crap out of them. There really is a good story here. Figuring out what is going on and why is a great part of why The Ring is one of my favorite horror flicks. It completely avoids many of the genre's clichés, while still providing scene after scene of unsettling imagery. We're talking some really freaky stuff. The characters come off as relatively normal human beings, instead of the annoying one-note caricatures that populate so many of the movie's contemporaries. I really think that it surpasses the original Japanese version in almost every way. The story is tighter, more focused, and more consistent. I love Naomi Watts, so it's no surprise that I think the casting was pretty great. And as I said before, the atmosphere is absolutely stellar. All the greys, blues, fog and rain mixed with the growing despair of the characters, really helps to put the viewer in the right mood. It's amazing how a sense of dread permeates the entire film, even though the main antagonist is seen so sparingly. There's virtually no gore or violence, and everything works exceptionally well without it. This movie scared the hell out of me in high school, and it still does today. It's a great mystery/thriller, artfully woven into one of the best horror movies in years.",The Ring
90,moviewizguy,Still Scary After All These Years,7,10 August 2015,"It's been 13 years since The Ring was released, and yet, somehow, the film holds up incredibly well. Maybe not in terms of technology, but in terms of scares, it's one of the best out there. I remember watching the film as a teen and immediately regretting my poor decision. Having recently rewatched it, the film still managed to get under my skin, and for good reason: The atmosphere is palpable, and a sense of dread is consistently sustained from the first scene through the end credits. And let's talk about that first scene featuring a young Amber Tamblyn who, nowadays, is instantly recognizable. What a scene to grab an audience's attention! Haunting and unpredictable, it's no surprise The Ring's opening is considered to be one of horror's best, easily as good as the ones from Scream and Jaws.Despite its scares, The Ring is also a surprisingly beautiful looking film, and with a $48 million price tag, it should be. Unlike most horror films these days, cinematographer Bojan Bazelli provides some amazing compositions and frames every scene with unexpected allure, even though the film is filled with plenty of disturbing imagery. Of course, director Gore Verbinski should also be given credit for the film's success. Rarely have I seen a horror film in which all of its moving parts worked together so well. From the production design, performances, the aforementioned cinematography, editing, and soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, it's like witnessing a master who actually understands the language of film.As for the screenplay, writer Ehren Kruger of... (wait for it) the Transformers films, gives time for the story to breathe and build, an uncommon characteristic for a horror flick. Kruger also cleverly writes in an familial subplot that provides an emotional underpinning for its characters. What people tend to forget about The Ring is that even though it's about a journalist trying to solve the mystery behind a cursed tape, it's also about a broken up family that slowly comes together in the wake of a crisis. Because of that, I will say that the ending is unnecessarily cruel and unearned, providing a twist that pulls the rug from under the audience just for the sake of doing so.Still, lead Naomi Watts is able to carry the film on her shoulders through and through. In spite of not being a notable actress at the time, her impressive performance as the strong-willed Rachel quickly put Watts in the mainstream spotlight. Martin Henderson and David Dorfman also provide memorable performances as the remaining members of the family, though it's disappointing to see Henderson has yet to reach A-list status as Watts did. He provides the charisma, charm, and humor required for the role. Cameos from veteran actors Brian Cox and Jane Alexander also raise the film to another level, and both are terrific in their limited screen time. Overall, The Ring is an unnerving yet gorgeous film, supported by an assured direction from Gore Verbinski and a breakthrough performance from Naomi Watts. Who says PG-13 horror can't be scary and well made?",The Ring
91,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"An uncommonly strong remake, ""The Ring"" chills to the bone thanks to its masterful visuals and a complex, puzzling storyline.",9,1 October 2016,"Remakes! Reboots! Re-imaginings! Terms that have come to be wholly dismissed by the filmgoing public, met with a collective sigh of exasperation whenever they're uttered. Yes the world of entertainment has notably been going through a bit of a trend over the past decade or so... any successful property, no matter how old (or young) or how highly (or lowly) regarded it may be, can and will likely be revisited with one of those labels slapped on.From a business perspective, it makes sense. Familiarity and recognizable names are an invaluable thing to have in the world of entertainment, with millions upon millions riding in the balance and audiences fickle of which original properties they'll give a chance to or not. But from a personal perspective, there are plenty of people who are getting sick of the remakes and reboots. Because they think it represents the loss of original ideas or does a disservice to the original works.But the reason why I personally cannot wholly dismiss good-old remakes, reboots, etc. is because for every few terrible cash-grab retreads... for every couple needlessly gritty re-tellings... for every handful of just plain awful re-treads... there's at least one good one. Sometimes even one fantastic one. A rarity that rivals the original, honoring it while also functioning well as its own artistic piece.""The Ring"", a 2002 horror film from director Gore Verbinski, is one such film.Taking inspiration from the worldwide phenomena that is director Hideo Nakata's Japanese thriller ""Ringu"" (or ""Ring""; inspired by the novels of Koji Suzuki), ""The Ring"" is a stirring, thrilling and often chilling excursion into the world of supernatural terror.After her niece is killed under mysterious circumstances, journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) probes her death, soon discovering it is connected to a mysterious video cassette containing a series of disturbing and twisted images... soon after, a phonecall with the cryptic message of ""seven days"" warns her of her impending doom. Together with her ex Noah (Martin Henderson) and young son Aiden (David Dorfman), Rachel must solve the mystery of this supernatural video in order to save her life.One of the most important things a remake must do in order to justify its own existence is to not only give honor and homage to the original, but also explore the concept, storyline and characters in new, relevant and interesting ways. And that most certainly is one of the main strengths of ""The Ring."" It takes the basic premise presented in the Nakata original, but builds upon and subverts the circumstances of the story in order to retain a degree of freshness. While most noticeable in the obvious and necessary differences in American and Japanese cultures and horror, the film also does a lot of other new and interesting things with the very concept itself and the characters to differentiate the two stories. But it never loses sight of what made the original so effective- that being the grand mystery aspect and the old-fashioned ghost-story. You can watch it immediately after the original, and still not quite know where it's going while still appreciating the wonderful homages to the original and the familiarity of the story. That's perhaps one of the best things a remake can do... present something familiar, but give it just enough of a new spin that it feels fresh once again. Which is sadly something most other remakes fail to heed, with many either being too much a slave to the original or too far removed from it.The other great strength of the film is the wonderfully oppressive and dreary visual direction courtesy Verbinski. While he is perhaps most noted as the big-budget director of fare such as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""The Lone Ranger"", I've often found that his strongest work is his more intimate and low-budget... particularly the quirky drama ""The Weather Man"" and this film. Here, he paints a beautiful and dark portrait of terror, using strong composition and subtle moments of striking fear to create an absolute atmosphere of dread. Along with his keen use of elements like rain, muted color and quick cutting, Verbinksi crafts a wonderful visual guidance that brings you right into the film. Combined with the cool, deathly palate of cinematographer Bojan Bazelli and the freakish and mournful music of Hans Zimmer, Verbinski is able to craft the perfect visual and audible horror experience to tell this tale.The performances of the cast are also quite magnificent. In particular Watts, who is just perfect in her role. There's a great sense of both personal strength and self-doubt that she fills Keller with, and it makes the character memorable and easily identifiable. Definitely one of the best horror-movie leads of its decade.If I were to nit-pick the film's few weaknesses, I'd have to say it's biggest issue is that it can occasionally fall for the rare cliché and predictable moment. And I'd be lying if I said I couldn't help but compare it to the stellar original, which was on the whole just a touch more startling and cohesive an experience. Especially in the way the story comes together in the end and you discover just what's happening and why... it seemed almost a little too far-fetched in this remake in comparison to the original.Still, those minor flaws cannot detract from the overall film, and it remains not only a great film on its own right, but also a prime example of why remakes shouldn't be outwardly dismissed without being given a proper chance. If it weren't for remakes, we wouldn't have fantastic works like this.I give ""The Ring"" a fantastic 9 out of 10. Worth seeing for fans of mystery, horror and suspense!",The Ring
92,Luigi Di Pilla,Mysterious,7,4 October 2003,"The Ring fulfilled my expectations. There was suspense, mystery and puzzles to solve. It was so mysterious that sometimes my wife was afraid and I have to admit me too a little bit. Fortunately it´s only a movie. The soundtrack from Hans Zimmer was superb. The direction was excellent and the picture was dark but impressive. The end seems ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" but this one doesn´t finish logical. It follows super natural films as ""Dragonfly"", ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Mothman Prophecies"". I am wondering how the story continues in ""The Ring 2"".

The plot, from what I can figure out, is that a woman tries to solve the mystery of a video tape that causes anyone who views it to die within seven days. That is an interesting plot but it was hard throughout the movie to understand what was going on. It also stretched out and got very boring at some parts. I might re-watch it because I'm not sure I got all the details. It's not a bad movie, 2002 was a great year for horror movies, but my friend and I watched it together and neither of us could really understand much in it.You've gotta give them credit for that scene with the poor horse going under the boat though, that was scary as heck and really disturbing.",The Ring
95,sme_no_densetsu,Atmospheric and mysterious but not without faults,7,6 August 2014,"""The Ring"" is the Hollywood adaptation of the 1998 Japanese film ""Ringu"", which was itself based on the novel of the same name by Kôji Suzuki. I haven't read the novel, nor have I seen the original film, so I can't comment on the faithfulness of this adaptation. My only point of comparison for this review is other genre films.In that regard, ""The Ring"" is a cut above the usual horror fare. Relying more on atmosphere than cheap shocks, the movie engenders in the viewer a keen sense of unease. The central mystery of the story is absorbing and creepily presented.The story revolves around a videotape that somehow causes the death of anyone who watches it. When a young female journalist (Naomi Watts) sets out to uncover the mystery of her niece's death she ends up being exposed to the tape's malign influence. With just a week before her appointed death, she frantically attempts to unravel the mystery in an attempt to escape her fate.While the story is interesting, the cast isn't especially impressive; that is, apart from the beautiful and talented Naomi Watts. The male lead, Martin Henderson, isn't too bad but he seems to have been cast more for looks than acting prowess. Young David Dorfman contributes a pretty good 'creepy kid' performance but his character is a little underdeveloped. The always reliable Brian Cox is a welcome addition in support but most of the remaining players are satisfactory but nothing more.Gore Verbinski's direction is nicely handled with a good understanding of building tension and sustaining mood. The visuals are often creepy and the cinematography is appropriately gloomy. The score by Hans Zimmer is also a key part of the film's foreboding atmosphere.However, while the movie does several things right, it isn't perfect. There are at least a few scenes that are like something out of a more conventional, teen-oriented horror movie. The central mystery of the story also may be a bit too obscure for some viewers. The ending also seems a bit forced to me, coming from a time when last minute twists were particularly fashionable. I also feel that the final act extends the movie a bit beyond its ideal running time.Ultimately, though, ""The Ring"" is definitely one of the best horror movies of the last decade or so. The PG-13 rating shows that the movie's impact comes from carefully managed suspense rather than gratuitous gore. So, this movie should appeal to more than just horror fans.",The Ring
96,rivertam26,A solid remake,8,19 March 2020,"The American remake that launched 100 more American remakes to varying degrees of quality. The truth is if the movie wasn't so damn good it wouldn't have started such a big trend. That being said its really one of the only ones that adapts it's source material quite successfully. It takes the story of an evil girl whose thrown down a well and haunts a cursed video tape. That if you watch it you get a call and only have 7 days to live. It's truly a nightmarish concept that has an urgency that just works. The original Ringu is superior and a brilliant film that is saturated in Japan's religion and mythology. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) adds a domestic spin to the material that doesn't overdo it and just works. I remember going to see this at a preview show weeks before it came out and people freaked during the finale. In fact one grown man ran out of the theater. It's easy to see why the film was such a word of mouth big hit and deservedly so. From the stylish direction to the star making performance from Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) as well as solid work from hunky Martin Henderson (Torque), David Dorfman (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Amber Tamblyn (Grudge 2) and Brian Cox (X2). Unfortunately it was followed up by an overly mediocre sequel and an awful reboot. Hopefully somewhere down the line they'll be able to continue it all successfully. A direct sequel to the first wouldn't be a bad idea.Budget: $48m

97,KUAlum26,"Dark and gloomy horror,imported(in story)from the LandoftheRisingSun",8,25 October 2006,"When the niece of investigative reporter Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts,beautiful and intriguing as always)dies under strange circumstances related to a video cassette and her quiet,shy grad school-age son(David Dorfman)seems to know more about the situation than he should,she decides to investigate what at first seems to be an urban myth.What she uncovers is something of a dark and disturbing riddle that traces to a small island community off the coast of Washington state involving a horse stable owner(Bryan Cox),his wife and his other-worldly daughter,now both deceased. With her ex-husband (Martin Freeman)in tow,Rachel tries to stop whatever it is that's been cursing the video tape before it goes for it's next victims:namely,her ex,her son and herself. This is supposed to be a shot-for-shot American remake of the Japanese horror success Ringu,but since I've yet to see the original,I can only truly judge this film for its own merits. Director Gore Verbiski(spelling?),who would follow this late fall of 2002 hit with another pay-dirt movie in Pirates of the Caribbean,Curse of the Black Pearl,is very good about keeping the scenery and images as gray,rainy and gloomy as possible throughout much of the film(Setting it in Seattle and near Vancouver was a very deft move). This film never strays too far from the concept of imminent peril hanging over anyone unwise enough to mess with the tape. I'd suppose that my problems with this movie mostly stem from the ending,which I will not spoil to you here,only to say that it seems to not tie together the questions of the movie as it would like. In other words,it,to me,seemed to only open up more plot gaps and questions as it sewed up. I will say that might have had to do with the producers wanting to leave room for a sequel,but somehow it feels like that could've been done more cleverly than it was.Still,a good watch for someone who appreciates the more visceral side of scary,tense,compelling movies.",The Ring
98,oneguyrambling,"This is no tacky Hollywood cash-in horror film, this is the real thing.",8,5 January 2011,"It's so hard to explain the premise of The Ring without making it sound dumb, so I'll be brief and then get to why it is so good.First up though: The Ring is the best remake / reimagining / reboot or whatever you wanna call them in the last decade. Films like this and Dawn of the Dead justify the 573 crappy films that come out every year trying to capitalise on the skill and/or success of other films.The Ring starts with a mystery VCR Cassette that appeared from nowhere it seems, whoever watches it gets a phone call that whispers only ""7 days"", 7 days later something is summoned and the viewer dies, usually with a look of pure wretched terror smeared across their face.Now that sounds straightforward, and upon scrutiny we can tick off a lot of other clichés from dozens of other horror films:* The protagonist is a woman (named Rachel).* Rachel is a single mother (to son Aidan with ex Noah).* Aidan is creepily mature and emotionless.* The ghostie moves strangely, and is a girl whose face is covered in long black hair.Check. Check. Check. Checkity-Check-CHECK!""So tell me then Mr, why is The Ring any good?"" I hear you ask.Well doubter, The Ring is better than just good, but for too many reasons to explainI'll try anyway;Firstly, Naomi Watts isn't afraid to make herself look like a goose, I've seen the film a dozen times - I love the film - but I still think that it makes hardly any sense.A VCR summons a chick from a horse farm via a well in a chalet through a TV?Whaaaaa????Yet Watts is deadly serious throughout, though perhaps the furrowed brow represents the fact that she has no clue what the hell is going on. Nevertheless there is no hamming it up from anyone, even the no-name cast of randoms play it all straight up and Brian Cox in a two scene cameo is convincingly nuts.The film gives you nothing that you don't earn as a viewer, if you snooze for a little you'll miss key info, in saying that the fact that none of what happens really makes any sense anyway if you think too hard, so perhaps it might be better not to concentrate What do I know?Secondly, despite the fact that in the opening scene a young teenage girl on a sleepover is the first victim, there are no big ""Wow"" setpieces in the film. No carefully staged, well choreographed deaths with multiple fake loud noise scares and perhaps a flying cat suddenly appearing to shock you. Everything grows through Rachel's investigation, with each seemingly minor discovery building the tension and creating further unease.It's again fair to say that a lot of the unease is found through not knowing exactly what is going on, but random bloods noses and photos of flies coming to life aren't run of the mill occurrences.The video itself is also pretty creepy and most definitely offputting, with staccato imagery that appears to be randomly spliced images, some cringe-inducing. When you later see some of the actual images crop up during the film it is a little eerie.Thirdly, none of the growing unease and serious stuff would mean squat if there were no payoff to be found. The final third of the film finds everything falling into place, again there are no earlier clues and they don't join the dots so to speak, each discovery leads them to another place to look. In the end though once Rachel and Noah ""solve"" the case and breathe a sigh of relief we the audience think well that's that thenOnly it wasn't.Fourthly and finally, the real finale of The Ring gets the hairs on my arms standing on end every time. What should be hokey actually works so well that it demands repeat viewings, most horror films lose 60% of their impact after the first viewing, and a second often wraps up any loose ends from the first viewing that you missed. For real scare value there are precious few horror movies that hold up, simply because you know exactly what's coming up and the surprise factor is gone. Only this film, Session 9 and perhaps the Exorcist hold up to repeat viewings, they may no longer scare but I grin inanely in the moments prior to the reveal because I know what's coming.If you can get a newbie to watch it with you that's even better.Writing about this film is annoying, as trying to explain it only confirms the logic holes and flaws, even if you simply try to cover the early events. If you are a horror buff and you have doubts after reading the above please ignore my shambolic inane ramblings and give the film a chance, it is worth your time.This is no tacky cheap horror film, this is the real thing.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. A horror film for those that claim horror is an inferior genre and not worthy of respect. Watch it with the lights off and the sound up.",The Ring
99,BrandtSponseller,"Finely crafted, superior film",10,19 March 2005,"After her niece and three of her niece's friends mysteriously die on the same night, at the same time, but in different circumstances, reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), hears the rumors of a video that when seen, ""curses"" the viewer so that they die in 7 days. She investigates the phenomenon with the aid of her ex, Noah Clay (Martin Henderson). They end up seeing the video. Can they figure out a solution in time?For my money, although the Japanese ""original"" upon which this film is based, Ringu (1998), is worth watching, this Gore Verbinski-directed U.S. version is superior in many ways, having none of the flaws but all of the assets and then some.I'm going to do something unusual and examine the differences between the two films by detailing just a portion of one scene present in both. I think the examination reveals why the U.S. film is superior. The scene is the tail end of the opening, which results in a death. Here's how it goes in Ringu: Tomoko Oishi's (Yuko Takeuchi) television mysteriously turns on to a baseball game as she's looking inside the refrigerator. She looks up, above the door, surprised. We get a reverse shot. We can see the television through frosted glass in the next room. A steadicam follows her from behind, peeking around the corner with her. We cut back to her face, which is relatively expressionless. We go back to a rear shot and see her walk to the remote and shut off the television. She turns around and walks back to the kitchen, pouring herself a drink. We cut to a lower-angled closer shot. We hear a noise. A subtle fear crosses her face. She trembles. Cut to a close shot from over her shoulder. Suddenly, she turns around, frightened. The frame freezes and quickly turns a blue/gray-tinted ""negative"" color. Here's how it goes in The Ring: Katie Embry (Amber Tamblyn) is in the kitchen, just about to drink, when the television turns on by itself to static. She stops dead in her tracks, her glass just barely touching her lips. Cut to a close up of her slowly turning her head and looking at the television, horrified. Almost achingly slowly, the camera creeps around the corner to show us the television. We see Katie look for any sign of an intruder. She sees the remote on the chair, but no one is around. She hurriedly shuts off the television, then walks away, trying to rationalize the event. Before she can get out of the room, the television turns on again. She stops again and turns even slower. The camera slowly creeps into a medium shot of Katie, with the television and its static reflected in a pane of glass. She runs over and puts her face right next to the television. We see this from a fantastically skewed angle, which distorts the television screen, sticking one end right in our face. We get an insert of Katie yanking the plug. Sparks shoot out. Back to the skewed angle, but now the screen is blank. We circle around slightly. Suddenly there's a noise from the kitchen. Katie gasps and turns around. Slowly, she peeks into the kitchen, just in time to see the refrigerator door open by itself. She runs to shut it, now breathing heavily. She mutters to herself and begins looking around with a very subtle panic on her face. As she quickly turns towards the hallway, the camera rapidly changes focus. We cut to an interesting overhead angle on the stairway. Katie appears, peeking around the corner. She calls for her friend Becca. She trots up the stairs. We cut to a beautiful, extremely low angle of the upstairs hallway, which exaggerates the perspective. As we see Katie reach the top of the stairs, we also see water slowly flowing into the hall from beneath a door. The camera stays at the low angle until Katie reaches the water. We cut to a close up. She's scared and bewildered, then trembling. We get an extreme close up of the door handle as her hand comes gradually into the focal range. She grabs the handle. Another close-up of her face. Cut to the interior of the room--her bedroom. Katie flings open the door, horrified. With a series of extremely fast cuts, we see a snippet of the Ring video on the television set in her bedroom. Cut back to Katie. A super fast zoom to her distorted, horrific face. Then back to the Ring video in a series of quick cuts, before the entire screen goes to static.The point here isn't that the U.S. version is longer. Rather, it's to exemplify the attention to craft, from technical to emotional aspects. Verbinski's pacing is much more deliberate and varied, creating intense suspense. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful. There is an obsession with details, from those that integrate and propel the story to those that are artistically striking. The construction is much more complex, but every shot is analyzed for relevance. Every angle exists for a reason. The ornate aesthetics amp up the effect of the story. This approach isn't unique to the opening scene, but occurs throughout the film, including the famed ""Ring video"" itself. The music is also better here, and is better integrated into the film. The performances are excellent, with Aidan Keller (David Dorfman) just as creepy and disturbing as the antagonist, Samara Morgan (Daveigh Chase). As would be expected for U.S. audiences, Verbinski includes a lot more exposition in his film, working in explanatory material from Ringu 2 as well as new material exploring Samara's history. It works well here, as the story is much tighter. Everything eventually fits together like pieces of a puzzle, and it gives the Ring video and the varied settings of the film more relevance.",The Ring

Naomi Watts is a reporter who investigates the death of her niece and four other teenagers; there is an urban legend about a tape, after watching ti the viewer will experience spooky situations and then die.The film builds up to the end brilliantly but for me the hype was a little too scary; but its wasn't as terrifying as I thought, the film itself is very weird, a woman brushing her hair and it works it keeps the audience watching and trying to work out what is happening. Naomi Watts is brilliant as the reporter and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, she proves that she in fact is a great actress.

101,areatw,One of the best horrors of the 2000s,8,24 December 2018,"'The Ring' is one of the few horror films that still makes me jump after multiple viewings and is probably up there as one of my favourites of the genre. I've always admired the way this film seems to sustain a high level of tension from practically start to finish. I can't think of many films that have done a better job at creating an eerie atmosphere and a level of creepiness that never seems to erode away no matter how many times you watch it.Part of the reason I like this film so much is it has a storyline you can actually buy into. Too many horrors focus too much on trying to scare the audience without giving enough thought to plot. For me an eerie horror like this with a convincing plot trumps anything that relies on gore and jump scares. Personally I would consider 'The Ring' is be one of the best horror films of the 2000s. Strong story, solid acting, successfully creepy and just as effective on second and third viewing.",The Ring
102,baumer,This is an old school horror film,10,27 October 2002,"Let's just get right to the point. The Ring is the scariest horror film I have seen in 20 years. Horror has been enjoying a healthy revival since 1996 when Scream got everyone interested in horror again. That is a good thing. What isn't so good is some of the cheap crap that has come out since then. For every film like The Sixth Sense and Blair Witch, you have a plethora of other films that have no idea what true horror is really about. Too many film makers think the best thing to do with horror is make a rockin' hardcore soundtrack and give us buckets of blood because this disguises the fact that most of them can't pace a film or invoke true chills. Gore Verbinski's The Ring returns to the roots of horror and pays homage to the early greats like Halloween and Psycho but almost goes a step past the greats, not quite but almost.The Ring does something that only a handful of horror films have done, and that is it stays in your subconscious hours and days and weeks after you watch the film. Gore Verbinski and Ehren Krueger have combined to make a masterpiece of modern horror that goes beyond anything that has come out for the last twenty years. This film is that good. For a guy who grew up loving films like Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street, I have been yearning for a film like this. A film that not only is a great scary film but a film that is a pure kinetic experience, one that makes me look behind me at my silent television sitting in the corner of the room. Is Samara there? When my radio begins to go haywire and search for stations on its own, is that Samara? This film gets inside of you and stays there. But it eats away at you like the nightmares that Malcolm McDowell is forced to watch in A Clockwork Orange. It attacks your mind and berates your senses. Samara is one bad ass villain. The Ring is a masterpiece and as I have already stated, this is the best horror film to come out since 1984 when Freddy Krueger stalked us in our dreams. The Ring may have it's roots in Japanese horror, but it owes much of its pedigree to all horror greats of the past, whether they are American, Canadian, Japanese or Italian. There is a bit of it all in here and the results are kinetic.When I watch a horror film, I know it is effective when that chill comes over you. Not the kind that makes you want to put a jacket on but the kind that literally starts from the nape of the neck and goes down the beginning of your butt. It's the chill that attacks your body and tells you that you are now at the mercy of the film and nothing you see from here on out is going to be expected. That is how The Ring is. The Ring had me scared. It had me nervous and it had me thrilled. Having fear envelop you is one of the most primal emotions you can experience. The Ring is a primal movie.There are a myriad of reviews in here that will tell you how amazing this film is, you should listen to them. This is a year that has been blessed with brilliant horror. With superb efforts like Mothman Prophecies, Frailty and now The Ring, 2002 should be known as the best year for horror films since the early 80's. If you only see one horror film this year, please see The Ring. If you want to be scared, see The Ring. It is a guarantee that this film will frighten and maybe even traumatize you. If films like The Changeling, The Shining and Halloween are synonymous with horror to you, then add The Ring to your vernacular.Oh, and you will never look at your television set the same again.And one final note. There is one infamous scene in this film, near the end, and I'm sure we all know what it is, and this is one of those scenes that will stand the test of time as one of the great images in horror films. I know horror aficionadoes will recall scenes like Hitchcock's shower scene, the bouncing ball in The Changeling, Michael Myers rising in the background at the end of Halloween, the head spinning scene in Exorcist, Freddy's tongue coming out of phone in Nightmare on Elm Street and Jason's first kill wearing his hockey mask in Friday the 13th Part III just to name a few. But *****************big spoiler here if you have not scene the movie********** when Samara comes out of the T.V., that is one of the most indefeasible and primal scenes I have seen in any horror film. It shocked me and thrilled me all at once. It is an image that will never leave my mind and it is just one of a plethora of scenarios that makes the Ring such an absolute masterpiece.",The Ring
103,DunnDeeDaGreat,Good little thriller,8,22 October 2002,"Before you judge The Ring remake, you should see the original Jap version which is clearly one of the scariest movies ever made. Gore Verbanksi and Ehren Kruger have made a decent remake with beautiful cinematography and a great performance by Namoi Watts. The little boy who played Aidan also gave a great performance. The film isn't extemely scary but it is tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat during some points. Dreamworks cut out a lot of the scares and a subplot involving Chris Cooper that would have resolved the film more. Hopefully the sequel which we know is coming will have the oringial Japanese writer involved. I give it *** out of ****.",The Ring

105,PatrynXX,Just awful. Some of the worst acting ever to grace the screen.,3,31 March 2003,"(spoilers!!)Good god!  Are people that dumb to think this is a great movie?  I'm just posing a question, not to say that they are.  But really.  This thing has virtually no acting whatsoever.  I was not impressed.  This movie couldn't scare a mouse even if it wanted to.  It's also emotionless.  It's basically and truely an americanized version of Ringu.  And it goes with all the blame.  Blame the parents, blame the parents.  The original movie put the blame on mistreatment from the mother perhaps, but mostly the doctor who killed her.  But in The Ring, the father is at fault, the mother kills the girl.  And the movie doesn't end all that good.The pace of the movie is poor.  Takes 55 minutes to go thru 6 days and 60 minutes to go thru 1 day.  Alot of the movie doesn't make sense.  The video is totally stupid. (the one we ain't supposed to watch)The timelines are rediculous.  That cabin is far older than 40-50 years.  It looks like it was built in the late 1800's.  And even at that, I grew up going to this cabin that was built in 1910 and it looked far nicer.  (yes it was a cabin.  paper thin walls built on bricks type thing) 
The girl is too cute of a monster.  Compared to Ringu which never really lets you see the face.  I basically assume that the creators were aiming at folks who either loved Blair Witch Project (or god forbid it's sequel) or as it's pretty obvious, The Sixth Sense.  Putting the focus on the kid.  Which for a good chunk of the movie the mother could care less for.My recommendation.  Watch Ringu first.  Then watch this movie at your own risk.  Ringu is very deceptive.  Certainly it won't make you jump watching it, but don't walk round in the dark for awhile.The Ring will make you want these people to die.  Especially that stupid brainless mother.  Who acts smarter than she is.3/10

106,emasterslake,Only if you like strange/thriller/mystery movies.,5,31 May 2006,"This one of my least favorite movies. So I'll try to make this review less abusive as possible to those who do like it.The Ring is about a mysterious video when it's viewed by someone they die within 7 days. After a girl dies within 7 days a single mom who works for a newspaper watches the video and doesn't find it possible for a strange video cassette to kill people for watching it.Within the next few days on investigating the single mom finds a lot of strange things going on. And soon believes that she will die soon enough.But with a lot of studying from the video and investigating she's close from solving this mystery.It's not my kind of movie. Probably because I'm not obsess with these kind of movies. But don't take my word for it, if you like Strange Thriller flicks then you might like this. Rent it or borrow it from a friend.Course one of the good things about this movie is they have Daveigh Chase from ""Lilo and Stitch"" & ""Spirited Away"" playing a role in this movie.",The Ring
107,carbuff,Creepy horror flick that would rate higher if I didn't know that a better version existed,6,26 June 2020,"First, I must confess that I have never seen the original Japanese ""Ring"" movie, but in my experience, without exception, the original foreign production is better than the Americanized version. There's just something that Hollywood and big budgets do to drain the life out of foreign movies when they remake them. Generally, it means emotion and nuance go out the window in the name of making a big hit at the theaters. So, even though I've never seen it, I'm sure the Japanese original is better.This is still an effective and creepy horror movie with a decently original plot (neglecting the fact that it's a remake). I never knew where it was going and what was going to happen next. There isn't much actual gore, but, without really ever letting up, it builds sense of dread and claustrophobia as it builds along. I'm definitely not going to give any of the plot away, but it's really not like any other horror movies I can think of off hand. I'm not the biggest horror movie aficionado, but I like to watch one now and again, and this is solidly on the better side. Now if only I could get my hands on the Japanese original, since I'm really curious about it now.",The Ring

109,fernandoschiavi,"The Ring is one of those rare exceptional thrillers that, unlike most productions of its kind, doesn't need to rely on overt violence to make an impact",7,31 October 2021,"Perhaps the most successful of the American remakes of Japanese horror features, The Ring is also a landmark for the careers of director Gore Verbinski, who, thanks to this success, gained carte blanche to develop the initial Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy (2003-2006 -2007), and actress Naomi Watts, in her first work after the acclaimed City of Dreams (2001), and whose good performance here opened the possibility of being nominated for an Oscar the following year, for 21 Grams (2003). The positive reception, however, opened Hollywood's doors to a flurry of eastern horror remakes, all with far lesser results. It was a time of cultural fervor in the horror genre, with news from all possible corners, giving the Americans the creation of a label called J-Horror, or Japanese Horror, a genre of Japanese culture that is at the base of the films mentioned in the previous paragraph , as well as in the various remakes made after the rise of Samara, characters inspired by Sadako, from the film starting point, Ringu, directed by Hideo Nakata, a creature who managed to found his own mythology in American territory, with positive results, both in aesthetics as in the dramatic issues that lead us to contextual debates and reflections.One of the greatest merits of this film is the construction of the narrative, director Gore Verbinski delivers a horror story that does not resort to the typical easy scares (so hot lately), the fear is precisely in the tension, in the gloomy climate that narrows down to reach the great climax. Verbinski already shocks us with that wonderful opening scene, which in a way reminds us of the equally great opening of the classic Scream. From there, the script goes to the investigation plot, which by the way is very well worked and which gradually reveals the secrets surrounding that tape.Verbinski's elegant driving and Watts' safe driving as the protagonist give The Ringa differentiator - something that not even its sequels (The Ring2, 2005, and The Ring3, 2017) have managed to maintain. He was given a detailed development of a supernatural story with detective touches and a final twist that appealed to the public, all taken by surprise by a curse that was just beginning - thus ensuring its sequels. She was already responsible for introducing a female figure that not only emits cries for help at every scare. On the contrary, she is not only responsible for her actions but also for those whom she ends up affecting in the course of her actions. She is a mature, confident woman who is not afraid of haunting her path.The script by Ehren Krueger, playwright who reorganizes an already structured text, having as its function the complex task of cultural translation. Thus, the dialogues change, as do the characters' actions. There is, between the two mothers of both narratives, basically the same dramatic need. Keeping yourself unscathed for the sake of your children. It is a theme that works within what is conventionally called ""universal"", a general idea that reaches east and west. In the American version, by the way, realism is also present. Rachel is the protagonist, but she behaves like any other human being, full of flaws that characterize her as a normal woman, full of imperfections. Rachel is intense but not perfect. She is a relapsed mother and with a strange relationship with little Aidan, a silent and sad boy, a kind of mirror image of Samara Morgan, responsible for the curse of the video. A journalist for a print media, she has no qualms when the need for the scoop or the answers to save her life speak louder than the values established by what people call ""ethics"", with the good thing about it all, the form how such characters circulate in the spaces conceived by the aesthetic elements of the story.The ghostly atmosphere is complex, as evil is mediated, as in a criticism of television. This becomes apparent when Rachel visits Samara's father's farm and in an argument, he vents her opinion about the media professionals: ""What do reporters want? They take someone's tragedy and spread it like a disease"". There is a scene where Rachel watches the neighboring building and all the visible apartments have their televisions on, with people doing the most diverse activities. In an era of depression and loneliness, television has become the silent and ubiquitous relative. The TV is Samara's portal, part of a scheme to destroy our brain molecules, as pointed out by two characters in the opening. And what about the family? Without the common standards established by traditional society that has been crumbling for eons, here we find a mother who must work hard to support her child, without the proper help of the omnipresent and irresponsible father. The search for motherhood seems to be a theme that tries to emerge in the narrative fabric of the work.Another positive point of the film that gained immense repercussion was the figure of Samara, the cursed girl who is responsible for a wave of deaths - and which the protagonists try to avoid. The hairy little girl determined to make them pay for all the harm she suffered in life has become a popular icon, not only being generically repeated in later similar titles, but also surrendering to self-parody - all the fear that inspires this chapter The initial opening ends up being reduced to an uninspired pastiche in the following episode. Samara was abandoned by her natural parents, adopted by a couple who do not understand her, and left to die at the bottom of a well for exactly one week. After these seven days, she returns, now to get revenge through an obscure recording found on a dusty VHS tape. Whoever watches it, immediately receives a phone call: on the other end of the line, a female child's voice says only ""seven days"".""The Ring"", interestingly, makes no mystery about the content of the tape (a series of dreamlike, seemingly meaningless images), which is presented to the viewer as the protagonist, reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts -the blonde from ""City of Dreams"") sees her. This creates a curious complicity between the audience and the character. Both, after all, are in the condition of passive spectators, with unvirgined and cursed eyes, which facilitates the unfolding of the plot, which follows Rachel's saga to unravel the film's message, the only chance to save her life and that of her son.The film draws attention to its team's brutal effort to create an atmosphere. As in the successful ""The Others"", there is no room for ironies or jokes here. Everything in the film is very serious, rigorously thought out to the smallest details, and its look is treated absolutely differently from the average Hollywood production today. Photography at this point helps a lot in the mood, the director opts for palettes in greyish and bluish tones and this combined with the often rainy and closed weather makes the scenes denser, more dramatic and somber, besides, of course, giving a finish and a better aesthetic than the narrative. Despite the photograph full of shades of gray, striking images to the point of recreating the damned video in the film itself, and a game of disagreements proposed by the script between what is supernatural or just impression, the most interesting of this The Ring ends up being, in a closer analysis, the family issues that are raised. Samara just wanted to be loved, and no one around her is willing to make that effort. Yes, it takes dedication and commitment to take care of a child, as we learned in the complicated relationship between Aidan and his parents, Rachel (whom he refuses to call ""mother"") and Noah (whose identity is not even assumed). It's an interesting parallel, which perhaps deserves a closer look, but which still, in the format in which it is delivered to the public, manages to go beyond mere cliché.As a curiosity, there are several tributes to the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock, in sequences with references to his classic films such as Psycho (1960), in the passage where there is water running down the bathroom drain when Rachel is taking a shower (in a reference to the famous scene from shower murder), or Rear Window (1954), through Rachel's building neighbor, who is watching television sitting in an armchair with a broken leg (recalling James Stewart's similar character, who liked to watch his neighbors with a telescope). Other curious facts were the quick appearance of images of subtle circles of varying sizes throughout the film, a clear reference to the cursed video symbol, and the absence of actor Chris Cooper, who had filmed some scenes as a child murderer and was cut into the final edit.The Ring is one of those rare exceptional thrillers that, unlike most productions of its kind, doesn't need to rely on overt violence to make an impact. On the contrary, the ubiquitous tense atmosphere of the production ensures audience interest throughout the duration of the tape. Such atmosphere is achieved by the competent work of Bojan Bazelli (photography), Hans Zimmer (soundtrack) and Gore Verbinski (director), in perfect harmony, aided by the excellent editing of Craig Wood. The tightly tied conclusion also provides a natural hook for the sequel to this intriguing film that deserves the attention of fans of the genre, and regardless of the veracity of the approach to an urban legend in a cursed video, it's always good to remember the words of sensitive boy Aidan, when worried he told his mother about Samara's vengeful ghost: Don't you understand, Rachel? She never sleeps...",The Ring
110,Rogue-32,The title is a double entendre & the film is a conundrum,8,3 November 2002,"The Ring has to be one of the most intense films of its genre I've ever experienced, with one scene so genuinely creepy I was literally rubbing my palms on my legs like an 8-year old (if you've caught the movie you know which scene I'm referring to - dare we ever watch tv again?!).  
Naomi Watts was the main reason I succumbed to seeing this movie and she never makes a false move, she's the real thing, a brilliant actor, and everyone else is stunningly convincing as well. And there are some very cool effects in the film - for example: did anyone besides me happen to notice the -=-minor spoiler =-= SUBLIMINAL ring that appears about halfway through the movie, during a scene-to-scene transition?  That was a very cool touch, in my book, and I also got off on how, by the end, you realize that the title is a double entendre and the film itself presents its main characters (Naomi and her son) with a very scary conundrum (it's no coincidence that the boy learns this word in the course of the proceedings).

Most horror movies today try to scare you with special effects or idiots with chainsaws. The Ring is what horror movies should be: a taut psychological thriller that builds to a fevered pitch and then lets loose with both guns. However, the movie does not know where to end. After the discovery of the well, the movie should have ended there. In fact, it might just as be best to stop the movie at the shower scene ten minutes from the end because the rest makes no scene and in fact leaves more questions. For one, not all the images in the video are explained and two, any boy who sleeps with his mother is going to grow up messed up.

Gore Verbinski does a great job directing this film, with an excellent performance by Naomi Watts and newcomer David Dorfman (he's the next big horror kid actor - after Haley Joel Osment). The reason I like this horror film is precisely because it's not B-movie style blood and guts horror - rather a smartly scripted psychological horror which only shows the scary elements when it is necessary and thus creates suspense (the same happened with Spielberg's Jaws - he smartly didn't ""show"" the shark until the very end of the film).

114,FilmOtaku,A sufficiently scary and disturbing film,7,13 July 2003,"I'd like to preface this review by saying two things:  Firstly, I have not yet seen Ringu, yet I understand that it is superior to the remake, The Ring.  Secondly, part of the reason that I have not seen that film is because just the trailer for Ringu terrified me while watching the DVD of The Ring.It took me a long time to see The Ring.  I am notoriously a lightweight when it comes to horror films, a trait that still baffles me as I was a horror film junkie when I was in my teen years.  Having heard the premise of the film, I was intrigued - I thought it was an interesting idea, an urban legend in the making.  However, finding someone to watch this film with me proved an impossible task - they had either seen it and were freaked out enough by it to wait awhile, or they were so offended by it's very audacity to try to compare itself with the original.  But, see it I finally did, and I'm glad that I did.From the start, Gore Verbinski directs the film with immense style.  The cinematography is the visual embodiment of despondency, and it works.  The atmosphere is incredibly dreary (you never see the sun shining, and rain is the forecast for much of the film) but it *should* be as such.  These elements, added to some incredibly disturbing imagery made me feel like I was in a dentist's chair waiting to have a tooth pulled:  The tension was palpable.**Spoiler Within**This is not a `fun' horror film to watch, however.  Perhaps if I had watched it in the theater it would have been different, but I remember seeing House of 1000 Corpses and having a great time because the audience was getting into it.  This was a horror film that kept me at rapt attention, and I didn't laugh once, even nervously.  It did, however hold surprises for me: There were not a lot of `BOO!' type scary scenes, I can actually only think of two where I jumped, rather the imagery itself was extremely disturbing. The actual `video' is comprised of several frightening images with jump cuts that at first made me harkens back to my student film days, but became more disturbing as I thought about said images.  Additionally, the movie was a surprise to me in that it wasn't just a horror film; it actually could be deemed a mystery/suspense film as well - with life and death depending on its resolution.  It also contains one of the scariest sequences I have ever seen, when Samara is crawling out of the well and out of the television. This was the second time I saw the film, and I was just as scared during this part, if not more. There are few people I have encountered who saw the film who did not acknowledge that this scared them, just a little.The Ring is far from a perfect film.  The acting is wooden, the characters have no substance and I'm getting a little tired of the cliché creepy kid with a `sixth sense'.  It also had a pretty weak ending.  However having said that, I feel that some of the most common complaints regarding The Ring are a bit unfair, and most of those complaints are those that say that Ringu is the better movie.  My thoughts on this?  Then watch Ringu.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with remaking a film that has been recently produced.  It is obviously a good story that Hollywood deemed worthy to put their own spin on, like it or not.  I can't make my own comparisons until I have seen Ringu myself, and I won't deny that I relish in the fact that foreign films are more liberal with `unhappy endings' than Hollywood films, but I feel that The Ring was a decent film on its own merits.  If anything, Ringu loyalists should be delighted that The Ring gave Ringu so much press that it is now available to buy or rent just about anywhere.  I heard rumor that a sequel to The Ring is in the works, and if it does half as well as Ringu 2 and Ringu 3 did in Japan I think we are looking at a franchise here. Hopefully it won't follow in the tradition of most franchises and sacrifice quality for quantity.",The Ring

It's straightforward and will leave audiences squeamish.Leave it up to Gore Verbinski to keep true to the original RINGU film in the atmosphere, plot, and all. Yet, I found the dedication a bit closer to copying rather than an emphasis on innovation.

118,Prichards12345,It takes the time to make itself effective.,7,29 October 2016,"I haven't watched the Japanese original upon which this movie is based, so I'm uncertain of the differences between the two. Viewed on it's own merits, however, I find there's a great deal to commend in this Hollywood version. Roughly 99% of remakes and reboots can be dismissed as trash cash grabs. But this is a carefully wrought and interesting horror-drama. Not exactly original, but with enough variation on the usual clichés to keep it working.The kid in the well thing may owe something to the 1979 George C Scott movie THE CHANGELING, another darn good ghost story. But it's an absorbing film to watch, and unlike so many throw everything AND the kitchen sink at the audience horror movies of the last twenty years The Ring develops its story carefully. The shocks when they come are not overdone (indeed just about the most frightening moment until the end is the simple device of a centipede crawling across a page); and there is a refreshing amount of STORY to tell rather than just horror set pieces.Naomi Watts was believable and watchable as the central character, a reporter trying to track down why four teenagers died at the same time, exactly seven days after viewing a video tape. With her slightly spooky kid I thought we were about to go The Sixth Sense cliché route (yet again!); but happily the film largely stays away from that vibe.There's an effective cameo from Brian Cox as a grieving widower, and the Ring is shot and edited in an interesting way, achieving some very haunting visuals. The tape itself is very well done.But no Hollywood we don't need another remake/reboot/sequel of this. Just leave it alone!",The Ring
119,Movi3DO,A slight improvement over the original,8,21 June 2021,"Oh god not the tape again!A remake of the classic Japanese Ringu. This one is not a complete copy, and there were surprisingly a lot of changes.In the original, the ex-husband character was a smarter and more intriguing character because he had a special ability. In this one, however, he became more like a dumb cop type of character that didn't believe his ex-wife at first and also teased her. So that change wasn't an upgrade.The young son character was given more time to shine in the remake. He was quite a creepy one.The main story behind the tape was changed quite drastically. In the original, the ability of the husband character helped solving the mystery. For this one, since the ability is not there, the characters had to explore the story more, and that improved the storytelling because there's much less exposition.Also, the infamous tape had better content in the remake. With improved technology, the visuals in the remake tape, albeit slightly similar to the original, were more disturbing and creepy. Even more, the details in the remake tape provided more important clues that the main characters had to use to understand the complete story. Because of this, I felt more intrigued into the story and more on edge whenever I recognized the clues in the tape.Another interesting change was the color and atmosphere of the movie. In the original, the quality was purposefully low to provide a raw and uncomfortable atmosphere. In the remake, however, the quality was good, but the color was mostly depressing blue. This made me felt like sad and melancholic. I prefer the original for this because it made me feel more uncomfortable.Lastly, the ending was changed a bit. I definitely preferred the original ending, which was more disturbing and consequential.Overall, it is a slight upgrade over the original.

When I saw ""Ringu"" I was heavily disapointed  and wrote about it here. In my post I doubted that the Hollywood remake (that was still in production then) would be any better. I was wrong. ""The Ring"" is spooky, spooky, spooky! Nice additions to the story have been made as well as really effective shock scenes. There are beautiful haunting pictures that teach movies like ""Feardotcom"" what ""atmosphere"" means. I can't remember when I last saw a remake that was so far superior to the original. If only I had seen the remake first. However, although I knew how the story would end I was still thrilled until the very end. A great, great horror movie. Applause!",The Ring
121,vostf,Why The Ring << Ringu,6,6 February 2003,"To put it simply where Ringu was elliptic, The Ring is a heavy-handed horror flick. Ringu mastered a blend of horrific fantasies with simple reality. The shuffling pace of its horror perfectly fitted the narrative structure: 'We want to know, to know only. But we have to experiment...'Yes, this is kind of the same premise as most slasher movies like, say, Scream 3. The difference is Ringu concentrated on it, leaving behind every over-used scheme, building its story and its rhythm over the journalist's investigation. The Ring drifts from this, focusing not on the journalist's investigation but on the journalist herself, her lovely sixth-sense lucid little boy and, last but not least, her dull-blank ex-boyfriend. But developing the central character is definitely not the point: it's all about the horror itself, stupid!'It's a remake, dude! Let's make it thoroughly understandable and bigger than life.'Producing an American version means lots of out-of-the-box rough-tunings. So first they build the story around Naomi Watts, director Verbinski revels in nice close-ups of his star all along her 'seven day pitch'. Then they used every narrative and horror cheap trick available. Of course they jumped on the opportunity to build up that little boy that sees. In the way they designed a sad witness for the source of horror (oh, the poor cursed father!). The horror cheap tricks are mainly expensive special effects: sophisticated ugly make-up and some digital stuff, all ringing out of tune.Eventually where is the horrific suggestive strength of Ringu? Why alleviate the original ending after dragging these leaden ballasts all along? When a movie/book is good enough there's no room for an adaptation. But I must be wrong since The Ring gathered more than $100m.",The Ring

125,Bogmeister,"Want to Die, Watch the Video",8,26 August 2005,"I'm not really sure why The Ring was the huge success it was. It's not exactly a horror original as many feel it to be. Besides being based on ""Ringu"", how about a similar urban legend such as ""Candyman"" from 10 years earlier? And the distorted faces on photos & video, we've seen that before. There's even a similarity to the doomed characters in ""The Omen"" way back in '76, whose deaths were foretold in photos. But all this may be irrelevant as The Ring uses the best elements of horror and makes them its own. Perhaps the most frightening element, at least on first viewing, is the suggestion this could really be; the viewer even notices a slight video static before the movie proper, on the FBI warning note on the DVD, for example. It's a clever tactic to send a shudder early on.The main power of the story is that it's a journey of discovery - some dark discoveries, to be sure, but compelling nonetheless. You're drawn to be a witness to the main character's journey. It's almost playful at first - rumors, gossip; she listens, a bit bemused. It's a slow, gradual rise in the dread. Naomi Watts has the task of tugging us all along with her and she's very good. You see that slight terror and disgust in her features when she first views the tape and you feel sympathy; you know things will continue to get worse. The countdown to doom, day by day, is also nothing new, but that doesn't mean it can't be effective. And it's strengthened by the increasing knowledge that this is a doom one cannot escape; no running away, no weapons will help. The photography also helps in creating a very oppressive atmosphere. Some of the scenes also remind of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" from 1980; it's a mood of steadily oppressive horror. All this works when you first see the film; on 2nd viewing you know who will or won't die and the viewing experience is rather empty. So watch it a second time. It'll get rid of the shudders.",The Ring

In Gore Verbinski's The Ring, viewers of a special videotape of seemingly unrelated shots get a phone call saying ""seven days"", meaning they have seven days to live. That's right. Mr. Budweiser Frogs and Mr. Mouse Hunt made this movie. Quite a transition.Naomi Watts, fresh from Mulholland Drive, plays skeptic newspaper reporter Rachel Keller. She hears about the videotape at a niece's funeral, and decides to investigate. And what does Ms. Smart do? She watches the tape and she gets the phone call. Oy, she'll regret that.The Ring, put in one word, is scary. It checks off the four ills: chills, thrills, spills, and yes, even a few kills. There are many, many tense scenes and scenes that make you jump (or scream, whichever type you are). I'm the jumping type, but in some parts my mouth was open. That's how scary it was. On the downside of the creepiness, Verbinski made too many jump scenes. If he had concentrated on putting on a few more sustained thrills, that would have helped.Watts wasn't super or anything, but she was serviceable. Martin Henderson, as Noah, a partner, was the same, nothing to write home about. Their son Aidan, played David Dorfman, made me think of him as a cross between Haley Joel Osment and a Disney cartoon. He had the look (and at the funeral, was exactly the same way) and he had huge eyes. And speaking of cartoons, I just noticed that Daveigh Chase, from Lilo and Stitch and Spirited Away plays Samara, a very important part of the movie.In a small but important role, Brian Cox plays Richard Morgan, Samara's father. He seemed to do like Donnie Wahlberg did for The Sixth Sense, playing a small part but obviously working hard to perform it. Cox seems to be the hardest working man in showbiz now.The runtime could have been trimmed by a little, but The Ring still kept engrossed me for two hours. It is the type of movie that will either keep you up at night or give you nightmares. Or both.The Ring doesn't really give you any characters to connect with.

129,WriterDave,"As far as modern horror thrillers go, this one is pretty damn good...",8,19 October 2002,"For a schlocky Hollywoodized piece of mass marketed horror, ""The Ring"" is shockingly competent, effective, and artistic. The director, Gore Verbinski (of ""Mouse Hunt"" fame) is by all means a hack, but a pretty astute and artistic hack who lays on plenty of stunning and haunting imagery that makes the film seem more important and artistic than it really is. The star, Naomi Watts, anchors the film with a performance that gets better as the film moves along (in fact, the whole film seems to get better as it moves along and almost entirely hinges on her performance) and shows that her award-winning turn in ""Mulholland Drive"" was no fluke. If the film is a hit, this should catapult her into the A-list of fine actresses.The first fifteen minutes of the film play like a ""Scream"" knock-off, but don't let that discourage you. That is merely a savvy ploy (great marketing but bad film-making) to lure in the teen-age crowd that grew up with Wes Craven's craptacular ""Scream"" films as their main reference for great horror. Judging by the shrieks I heard from the teeny-boppers in the audience, this film should get a lot of repeat business from them and I suspect could become this generation's ""Poltergeist."" Rest assured, that mature audience who grew up with ""The Exorcist,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" and ""The Changeling,"" will be rewarded in the end with a highly competent horror/mystery film that is much closer in relation to those great 1970's horror films than anything Wes Craven ever made us suffer through. I also appreciate how in the end, the movie could've easily turned into a melodramatic knock-off of the ""Sixth-Sense,"" but proudly stuck to it's genre guns and creeped us out with one last blast.Granted, many of the artistic shots are taken straight from ""The Shining"" (with rain replacing the snow), and there are many other ""homages"" to be found...everything from ""Psycho"" to ""The Blair Witch Project."" This could make the film fun for some film buffs (I especially like the cursed videotape that played like a German expressionist film) while infuriating others.

132,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: intelligent & scary,7,1 December 2002,"Normally, I don't like horror movies -- although a thriller like Silence of the Lambs is similar and OK. This one I thought might be a thriller but it turned out to be pure horror. My experience with this genre is limited, because I've always thought I've got plenty of nightmares and problems in my own life. I don't need to spend $10 to see a film that tries to emotionally scar me for life.However, since I did see it -- I must say it was thoughtful and well-done. Unlike films such as Halloween 3 or Poltergeist, where the story is basically ""Oh, they're magic so they can pretty much do anything,"" the mysteries of The Ring are partially explained and the story actually goes somewhere rather than consisting of a lot of running around.The acting, cinematography, were powerful and the film was quite scary. There is only a little gore in the film; it was definitely more cerebral and less hack-n-slash.Who should see this film:-- horror fans only, but it's worth your moneyI'll give this film a 7 out of 10, even though it really deserved an 8, just because it's not my thing personally, and for the ending which worked but created more loose ends than it tied up.",The Ring

It's a decent plot for a horror movie, and for the most part is quite well done. The plot is, like I said, well done. It's not what you'd expect from a horror movie, as it's more focused on the mystery of the horror over actually scaring you. There aren't actually that many scary parts in this movie. So as far as the plot goes it was done in a more original way, and it was interesting to watch. The story of the horror itself wasn't terribly original, but it was good nonetheless. The characters were pretty good, especially the main character. She's not a complete idiot (unlike in most horror movies), and she makes choices that are understandable. She does some stupid stuff, but nothing that would make her anything like the average horror movie girl. Everyone else is fine. There's enough screen time for them to show you what they're like, and there's only three major ones. The other ones you know aren't important so they aren't focused on. The horror itself is good. There aren't a whole lot of cheap jump scares, and most of them are more startling and scary because of how the scary thing looks, not because of the surprise. As for how scary it is overall, it really isn't usually. If you're looking to be scared, you probably won't really be by this one. Overall The Ring is good. It's an original take on the horror genre that I really appreciated, and while it isn't fantastic it's still very good.

Even worse the finale is over-longed in the coming, although it does have an admittedly great scare.Naomi Watts is the best of a pretty decent cast.So all around this hit thriller is worth a watch, but it's really not as good as some are writing it up to be.** 1/2 out of ****",The Ring

So finally I rented it and watched it at home. The filming style reminded me of the same style used in Koyaanisqatsi that eventually found it's way into the hands of Trent Reznor for the Nine Inch Nails video Closer. If that wasn't enough to pull me in, the Jacob's Ladder style of creepiness that runs throughout the movie would also have sufficed. I'm so sick of movies like Scream and Signs that have a certin wacky predictablity, and plot that fit together so tightly that it's a wonder why the charecters in the movie don't figure out what's going on. Here we are now with a visually intense what-the-why-the-hell-is-this-going-on creepathon that doesn't seem to pander. The movie contains very minute amounts of actual violence on screen, much like Jacob's Ladder and has this kind of decent into insanity where ""why?"" just sort of becomes an invariable question. As far as reasons are concerned for the source of or cause of the evil, lots of theories can be hypothesized. Mine goes along the line of thinking that the lesson learned by the movie is that much like the government, the only way to stay safe from evil is to partake in it's execution. No pun intended. I give this movie a nine out of ten because as much as I would have enjoyed some female nudity from Amber Tamblyn or Naomi Watts the movie would not pander to my idiocy. Thank you.",The Ring

137,bregund,"A complex, layered film that is an unsatisfying imitation of The Sixth Sense",1,6 April 2003,"***There are spoilers in this review***I doubt that any medium has ever captured so many shades of blue as this film has.  The cinematography is gorgeous:  the pacific northwest, in all its rainy, forested glory, is wonderfully depicted in this luscious movie.As much as this film strives to rid itself of its Hollywood-horror movie roots, unfortunately it falls back into them again, as evidenced by the fact that there are not just one but two prescient, sepulchral children (an old Hollywood standby), one of them so evil that her mother kills her.  The premise of this film is intriguing:  a strange videotape surfaces at a remote cabin, four teenagers die, and there's a big mystery.  The object is to solve the mystery before you die.  This film isn't as scary as the beginning would have you believe.  Much of the time is spent solving the mystery of the weird video, which, as the film nears its conclusion, is clear that it was most likely shot and edited somewhere in the afterworld.  Seems like a ghost would use a higher-quality medium like a DVD.  Evil characters usually make sense, but Samara's motivations make none.  Why a videocassette?  Why kill people seven days after they watch it, why not just roam the world killing people indiscriminately?  Why would Richard Morgan steal the videocassette of Samara's psyche-ward interview if he couldn't stand his daughter?  And just what was the connection between the cabins and the Morgan family?  Who built the cabin over the well and for what reason, did they know they were hiding a murder scene?  And how could Samara draw the tree on her `bedroom' wall when she didn't even see it until just before she died?  The plot holes get bigger and bigger as the film progresses.Although the characterizations are quite good, even complex, they are ruined by the unnecessarily confusing ending.  Why would Samara go after Noah and leave Rachel and Aidan alone, when Rachel and Aidan saw the tape before Noah did?  And given the expectation that all people who view the video will die, how could Rachel possibly hope to deter Samara by feeding the videocassette to unsuspecting viewers?  Sooner or later, she's coming back to get Rachel. This film starts out really strong, but the improbabilities pile atop each other until you have a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. 
This film is like the proverbial dumb blonde:  she looks pretty, but when she opens her mouth to talk, it's pretty clear that her porch light is flickering.  If you want scary, see Rosemary's Baby or The Blair Witch Project, two horror films which happen to be pretty and smart, a rare combination indeed.",The Ring

140,nickenchuggets,She never sleeps,9,22 October 2021,"Most people will acknowledge that remakes rarely manage to be as good as the original thing, but every so often, a movie comes along that shows it can work when done right. The Ring is a remake of a 90s japanese horror movie that it hardly known about in the US, and so the remake is all most americans are familiar with. It changes some aspects of the story, but not very drastically. Unlike Silence of the Lambs (which believe it or not I didn't find all that creepy), The Ring is a pretty disturbing movie that you'll probably watch with the lights on. What's strange is that there's not much blood or violence in it, but it still manages to make people afraid. This has a lot to do with the macabre storyline. The story starts with two girls, Katie and Becca, talking about an alleged cursed VHS tape that kills whoever views it after exactly 7 days. After Katie admits to her friend she watched it last week, she is killed shortly after, apparently by the television. Someone later finds her corpse with horrible mutilations on its face. Rachel (Naomi Watts) is unnerved to find out that some other people watched the tape and all died around the same time shortly after. Rachel eventually comes across the tape herself, and finds it contains black and white footage of mysterious and haunting imagery, such as a big centipede crawling from under a table, a woman throwing herself off a cliff, and someone pulling what looks like a stethoscope out of their mouth. After viewing the tape, it seems like Rachel is doomed to the same fate the others suffered, since she receives a phone call that simply says ""7 days."" Meanwhile, Rachel seeks out Noah, father of a young child named Aidan with whom Rachel lives, to get him to watch the tape. Not knowing what to think of it, they start to do some research. As it turns out, the woman shown several times on the tape is named Anna Morgan, a girl who used to breed horses on a secluded island. She killed herself when her beloved horses died suddenly for some reason. After accessing some compromised medical files on Anna, Rachel and Noah discover that she had an adopted daughter named Samara who has the magical ability to burn unpleasant images into people's minds. Even though she's not supposed to, Rachel stealthily goes into Samara's former house where her father Richard now lives and views a video of her being lectured by some psychiatrist. In the video, she admits she wants to hurt her parents but doesn't take pleasure in doing so. Once Richard realizes Rachel has found out about Samara's existence, he smacks her in the face with a bridle, then walks upstairs to electrocute himself in the tub. By this time, the 7 days are almost up, and with Richard dead, Rachel is lost as to where Samara could be. Her and Noah decide to go back to the cabin she found the tape in and come across a well under the floorboards that the cabin was built over. Finally, the tape's ending (which just shows a ring) makes sense. The ring refers to the halo of sunlight Samara saw while stuck at the bottom of the well when its stone cap was in place. After the floor caves in, Rachel is knocked into the well by a falling television. She isn't killed though, and manages to find Samara's intact body, which then turns into a skeleton. Now convinced Samara is set free and not vengeful anymore, Rachel goes home, but everything changes after Samara comes out of the tv and kills Noah. Rachel finds the same horrible mutilations made to his face that the victims early in the movie had, and she is left wondering why Samara killed her friend and not her. It's actually because Rachel didn't watch the original tape, but a copy of it. Even though remakes usually don't end up being better than the original film, The Ring really is a disturbing experience. Samara as a character reminds me a lot of someone like Anakin from Star Wars, since they were both normal at one point, but turned into malevolent killers because of unfortunate circumstances. In the film, we learn that Samara is unable to control her ability of giving people nightmares, and she uses her magic on her mother's horses. The things they're forced to see are so horrible that they killed themselves. Because of this, Anna suffocates Samara one day and throws her into the well that the old cabin was built over. Little does her mother realize, Samara actually lives for another week, which is why the video tape takes 7 days to kill a person. Even though a live version of her doesn't appear until the very end, Samara is most likely this movie's main character. She may be evil, but you still feel bad for her. I didn't think The Ring was a perfect movie, but it has a fairly complicated and intriguing plot for a film made so close to the present. Most movies today are just filler and have no intelligent writing. I was glad to see some kind of a change.",The Ring
141,ebeckstr-1,"Underrated, one of the best horror movies ever made in the US",10,27 August 2021,"Woefully underrated American remake of the Japanese classic. Inexplicably, more recent re-reviews claim that the movie has not dated well and / or that it relies too much on the cliches of this kind of movie and / or, stupidly, that the screenplays retention of VHS as the haunted medium is also dated. The latter reviewers clearly don't know their history, as VHS, while certainly being displaced by DVD in 2001 when the movie was made, was still hanging on. At one point in the film we are shown a pathetic scattering of VHS tapes on a shelf in a motel lobby, which, while pulled directly from the novel, which was written more in the heyday of VHS, does seem like a nod toward the impending demise of the medium.The other similarly wrongheaded reviews show a complete lack of understanding of The Ring's place in the lineage of this genre. The ring and its Japanese counterpart themselves helped define many of the genre elements these reviewers are referring to. In other words, it is the movies that came after The Ring and the classic cycle of J-horror from around that time that tap into the genre elements that have since become cliches from overuse.The Ring stands out as one of the creepiest American horror movies ever made. While there are a few minor inconsistencies with the film's internal logic, they don't detract from the overall effect, plot, or story. The acting is top-notch all around, and Hans Zimmer's score lends the creepiness additional depth.The movie within a movie - the notorious VHS - is even more creepy and atmospheric than the Japanese original. In addition, as good as the original movie is, the remake's cinematography is moody and at times bone-chillingly creepy.It's unclear to me why this movie hasn't attained classic stature and isn't ranked among others like The Exorcist and Halloween as one of the greats of American horror Cinema.",The Ring

The films are based on Kôji Suzuki's novel named Ringu, the book is about a mysterious cursed videotape, which contains some disturbing images. After the viewer is done watching the tape, the viewer gets a call, upon which she hears a girl's voice telling the viewer that he/she will die in seven days.The movie plot is similar in foundation to that of the book, it features a journalist who is investigating the death of four teenagers, there is a weird tale going around that the death of this teenagers was caused by the videotape that they saw. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) the journalist took the tape home, and she and her son watched it (not intentionally though).Now Rachel has to race against time to save her life and her son's from a mysterious girl.The Ring was met with considerable amount of criticism but most of which were positive, it was also a financial success, production cost was 48 million and the move raked in over 240 million dollars, such numbers led to the studio making a second part to this wonderful horror movie. The sequel still bordered around the events of the first film, but it was not as good as the first.If you have not got the time to sit down to see this horror flick, maybe you should, just to get the fun of the chills, I guarantee that this movie will make you smile, smile in fear.www.lagsreviews.com",The Ring
144,SkullScreamerReturns,Essential 2000s horror mystery thriller,8,4 October 2021,"When The Ring was new, everybody was talking about it. I believed it's just some trendy teen movie and I wasn't interested. Perhaps I also feared a little that it might actually be as scary as people say. I was more into older fantasy-type horror like Dracula and such not into current movies of the time.When I finally watched the movie I was surprised it was actually quite good. Tonight I watched it for the second or third time and it's still good. Perhaps even getting better. I'm ready to call it a 2000s horror classic.Everything in this movie works. It has that Asian style surreal weirdness that makes it creepy, but it also has a logical mystery plot that makes sense. I think the balance is good. It is a very visual film with great looking scenes. And most of all it has pretty great acting. Naomi Watts is the star. She's one of my favorite actresses and she does a excellent performance here. Without her this movie would be more average. But also the smaller roles are pretty good.I haven't seen any other Ring movie, the sequel or the original Japanese ones. Will check those out at some point. I would guess the Japanese ones are more creepy and weird, but since this version is already my favorite it probably will stay that way. Making international versions of foreign movies is a task that often goes wrong but at least this one ended up a good movie.It's quite creepy horror movie but the reason I like it so much is that it also has a very interesting mystery solving plot around the supernatural elements. It is very interesting to follow the characters try to find the meaning behind the strange video tape. But also, even if you have already seen the movie, it's still worth watching again because of the cinematography and acting. I think it's generally just a good film that is pleasant to watch. If you still haven't seen it, check it out.",The Ring
145,emperor_bender,Oh...my...god,1,22 February 2008,"This is a terrible movie. Not ""so bad its good"". There's nothing GOOD about it. It wasn't scary at all. And I kept dozing off during the too-long-talking-about-god-knows-what scenes. There was no plot whatsoever. A videotape? Give me a break! The ONLY fun I had with this movie was laughing about how terrible it was afterward. Oh, and calling the preppy annoying neighbors down the street and whispering ""...seven days"" into the phone, that was a riot. But not this movie, oooooooooooh no! This is a perfect example of the DEATH of the Horror Genre. The acting was pretty lousy (except for Brian Cox, who played Richard Morgan, the girl's insane father). The whole ""gloomy"" scene thing was just plain stupid. The girl wasn't scary AT ALL! Its called a gun people, SHOOT HER IN THE DAMN FACE! or...burn the tape and stop keeping the so-called ""curse"" alive. The horse scene was stupid as well. My brother watched the sequel and told me about 2 scenes...I forget what happened. I either got sick to my stomach or laughed so hard it hurt....either way, my stomach was in pain. Lousy movie gets 1/10.",The Ring
146,supertom-3,Scariest film ever!!,10,25 February 2003,"I am not normally a fan of horror films, for the simple reason that films generally don't scare me. I say don't normally, because this did. Some films can feel genuinely creepy and make you feel unnerved in some moments, films like Signs as a recent example, who didn't feel the blood leaving their chest when the first got sight of one of the Aliens in the Brazilian home video scene. The Ring has scenes like this throughout, and it makes you feel uncomfortable throughout the movie, and gets you really jumpy.There are big shocks and lots of little shocks and it is down to some first rate editing, directing and sound editing, as well as some unsettling imagery. The cast are all good, the gorgeous Naomi Watts is excellent in the lead and very convincing and there is a great cameo from Brian Cox, in suitably creepy mode. David Dorfman is good as Watt's son, he is a very good child actor, and in this sort of film it is essential to have a good actor for the child parts, Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense being a good example. Martin Henderson is also good playing the ex boyfriend of Naomi Watt's character Rachel.The film pans out brilliantly. From the initial opening death sequence to Rachel's investigations of the tape that apparently kills people if they watch. The tape holds within it a vengeful spirit who kills their victims seven days after they watch the tape. Gore Verbinski's version of the classic Japanese horror is excellent, and intriguing, it is how a horror film should be, it genuinely unsettled me, no film for years has done that, not even the Exorcist did.You should definitely watch this, and I hope there will be a sequel. I intend to watch this alone in a dark room when it comes out on DVD. 10/10",The Ring
147,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,4,7 March 2005,"One of the worst remakes of recent years, made worse because it should have been so much better. Wooden acting from most-unlike the original, the intro was far to teen movie like-unlike the original, terrible attempts at scaring-unlike the original, and a weak ending-unlike the original. You've probably guessed i'm a big fan of the original, yes, i consider it to be the best horror movie of the nineties, since Elm Street part one, but do not let you think that means i am biased- I had high hopes for this, which were quashed, but I have high hopes for the sequel. I also loved The Grudge remake and felt it was almost as good as the original.Although this tried to be clever, and gets points for attempting to create some atmosphere, it just falls on its face, reverting to very weak and predictable jumpy moments. Lesson 1- Loud noises may make the audience jump, but they will not be SCARED- in the cinema they have BIG speakers so the sound of a car driving may be enough to make us jump. Is this scary? No. The Ring relies far too much on this- horses kicking walls etc. Eg, you're walking around your house thinking about something. Someone bumps into you when you don't expect it- you are momentarily shocked, but soon forget it. This is not scary. However, if you are walking around you're house with the belief that someone or something is outside, or perhaps inside intending to get you, that is fear. You are scared. Ringu did this for 90 minutes or so, The Ring does it for 0. Naomi Watts is a good actress, and Verbinski is an OK director, but they do not seem comfortable here. He may not have been able to direct her effectively. The rest of the cast is instantly forgettable. The kid, Yoichi equivalent was good in Panic, but here is just another '6th Sense Look Out Scary Kid Alert' kid. Yoichi in the original said little, but he was not the focus, and he still managed to make us uncomfortable. The score in the original is extremely effective and haunting, this has nothing. The story is minimal admittedly, but the original covered this and dealt with what there was with great skill. Here it tries to cover it up by bringing in some nonsense horse side plot which has little relevance and is entirely dumb. And the ending. The original Sadako moment is one of the most frightening things ever filmed, you will feel your whole body become tense the first time you see it, edited perfectly and filmed so excruciatingly slowly that you may almost not be able to bear it. In this it is laughable, far too fast, (again with the loud noises) and we actually cut away from it! We cut away from it!! This takes whatever tension there may have been away from the scene, and then we are set up for another predictable 'jump' moment when the seat is turned round and...! How many times has that ploy been used in movies? Samara herself is not scary, just seems like an annoying little girl. Sadako however is pure rage, unstoppable, and very creepy. Let's hope that Nakata can do something better with the sequel.4 out of 10",The Ring

But I have seen so many horror movies where the jump-scare of the real revelation of the ghost kills it. Naomi Watts has acted well. The depiction of the ghost is good. The child playing the role has done well. But somehow the back story reveal is not up to the mark. If the back story was made better and spookier I would have given it a 10.

We see the dark film (and a nightmare producing young girl) early. Where did this damning video and girl come from? These questions are investigated by Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) when the movie is accidentally viewed by creepy son Aiden (David Dorfman) and his father (now her ex) as the whole estranged family is on a race against death! Watts deftly exudes her characters' many roles while the other two give one dimensional performances as she tries to save her son from the heart stopping fate in dreary Seattle.

150,Didier-Becu,THE RING (DIDIER BECU),7,29 February 2004,"Advertised as a horrormovie with a high intelligencegrade ""The Ring"" became one of the biggest hits on the horrorvideocircuit and for those who have their doubts it arises above the average horrorstandard. In fact I was asking myself if it really should have been categorized as horror as most of the times director Gore Verbinski (the man from ""Pirates of the Carribean"") creates a sort of style in where some David Lynch-style is certainly there! The story itself is simple...there is a videotape around and once you saw it you will die within 7 days. Most of the directors would have made a sort of Friday The 13th with it but director Gore Verbinski let us investigate why such a videotape is made, where it comes from and it is here where the viewer will undersrtand some bits but not the whole thing, not that there is any need to understand the ""Eraserhead""-like movie that will kill you once you've seen it. ""The ring"" is a Hollywoodversion from some Japanese cultmovie ""Ringu"" and Verbinski did a well job but only he should have chosen some better actors though, and not someone like Naomi Wats.",The Ring
151,LivingDog,Stupid ending ruins another possible great,6,8 January 2004,"The first ending, where everything was resolved was great. The movie seemed great, I was ready to say ""great movie"" 10/10. But then the second ending came along and made me feel nothing. This totally subverted the movie making it seem a mere trick of the director to frustrate the audience. 6/10.
All the symbolism became mere gimmickry. The movie led us down a clear and intelligently presented thread, only to abruptly change its course in the last few minutes. This is incredibly annoying. Oh wow, the ring is a ring - it has no ending... gee the symbolism! bleh. It left me feeling the way as the movie ""Adaptation,"" which I thought was brilliant until the single/signal word ""kill"" is uttered by the lead actress. It was so wrong and so forced and so awkward that it left me feeling nothing for the ""first"" movie.-Zafoid",The Ring
152,akshatmahajan,Absolutely loved it....,8,22 October 2020,"The Ring is one of my favorite horror movie. It is a remake of japanese horror film named RINGU.The introduction to this film is very smart. After few minutes into the film you realize just how mature and suspenseful of a film this really is. The characters are great. Rachael Keller is the perfect journalist. Noah Clay is sort of a comic relief, he's sarcastic and stubborn but is also very smart.Film is very unique in it's style, full of flash backs, creepy imagery, nightmares, mysteries, and hallucinations. It's very bizarre and surreal at times, which isn't very out of place since this is a supernatural horror/thriller.Overall, I would recommend this movie to any one with intelligence and an imagination.

So I don't know where everyone else comes down on the U.S. remake of ""The Ring.""  But, ahem, it scared the bejeezus out of ME.Gore Verbinski is just the Man.  ""The Mexican"" was well-paced and clever (I don't care what you say; the character, tone and script were well-thought out and original, which America abhors next to, say, anything with J.Lo. in it).  ""Mouse Hunt"" was cute, original and visually interesting, for a kids film (which the Harry Potter films were not, history will prove me right). This one, just, wow.  The imagery, the pacing, the way he respects silence, the tone, the filmmakers have always got one more surprise in their back pocket, right up until the credits roll...The whole opening scene does it.  ""AH! She's closing the fridge, is their something behind the door?!"" to ""WHY is the camera framing the stairs as she walks up them, what are THEY gonna do..?!""Drove me crazy.  Had me wound up tighter than a Network Exec during sweeps week.  And it will be SO much scarier on video.  In fact, I refuse to watch it on video.  The phone might ring.The one weak point is Brian Cox.  Great character actor, but he's also the most famous face in this film, so I don't buy him for a second as the guy he's supposed to be playing.

155,fil-nik09,Quite good!,8,11 March 2016,"Me and my friend were talking about horror movies and he suggested this one and it was quite good!The story itself - I guess - is similar to many of other horror stories and movies. I actually thought that the end of the movie was when she 'rescued' the girl from the well and you see the reporter with her love interest sitting on some old bench. OK, so she did a good thing - 'heard' the little 'evil' girl and now that the wrongdoing is kinda redeemed, everything can be as before. I was wrong! That is the beginning of the twists that happen in the last 6, 7 minutes of the movie and last two minutes being the ultimate twist!I liked that the movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end. I did not expect the ending to be what it was! Actually, at one point I thought that the little evil girl is now grown up ( not dead or in the mental institution) and that it is the girl who moved to the apartment of the reporters ex love interest ... I did expect however the drawings of the kid to be explained. Especially the last ones he was drawing on the floor - the big black hole. But it was not. There were too many drawings circulating in the movie with not really clear connections or purpose - at least, I believe. So, I do wonder what they all mean and above all why the faces of the girls / people were blackened / distorted. I mean, OK, you can say it is the evil presence / force, but ... I saw that there is the part two, so will probably see it tonight. I know the sequels are almost never as good as original movies, but... Will give it a try.Eight for this one!",The Ring
156,Dockelektro,"Creepy, even if flawed",7,11 June 2004,"Coming at the end as no more than good Friday night fare, ""The Ring"" is, even so, a scary movie. Since we can't talk about originality (this is a remake), our attention focuses on the way the concept is handled. As a horror movie, it has a great idea to watch: a cursed tape, which kills anyone who sees it in seven days. Naomi Watts comes across the tape, and the story unfolds, revealing finally that such original concept wouldn't survive for long. Soon, the formula comes roaring, and you'll start to see some clichés (face it - ever since ""Shining"" we have seen endless times a creepy girl with a covered-up face that says ""you're gonna die"" or something like that). Even so, it manages to twist a little and to get some surprises. I was glad to see that they didn't repeat the ""screeching orchestra"" gag too many times, which is always nerve-challenging. It's basically a classy horror movie, that doesn't extend on the gore and the guts, and wisely relies on the unseen to help us take it seriously.",The Ring
157,eddax,Nowhere near as scary as the original,2,22 November 2002,"Remakes of movies are often considered to pale in comparison to the original. In this case, The Ring has gone beyond pale. It's practically transparent. Case in point: I gave the original Ringu a 9; this movie I'm giving a 2. To be fair, if I had not watched the original movie before this one, I would probably give it a few more pointsSo where does this movie go wrong? I would say most of the fault lies with the director, Gore Verbinski, and his, well, chosen direction for the movie. He's taken one of the best horror movies out there, and art house-ified it. The result is a movie with luxurious cinematography but horribly inopportune splicing. In virtually every scene that's supposed to build to a scare, the movie ducks out before the payoff. And the montage that's on the cursed video simply looks like a collection of random shots, whereas the original montage looked appropriately like a portent of doom. The screenplay for this movie mirrors the original significantly. Unfortunately, I didn't care for the deviations the writer made. I don't recall too much of Ringu, having watched it years ago, but I'm pretty sure the horses weren't part of it and the boy wasn't psychic. I felt they were diversions that distracted from the main Samara plot. And oh yes, ""Samara"" doesn't sound half as creepy as ""Sadako,"" not to mention how much creepier Sadako looked too. The only thing I liked about the plot was that it managed to explain the aspects of the curse decently, including stuff I didn't catch in the first movie like the symbolism of the ring.It's terribly frustrating, trying to understand The Ring's appeal, particularly since most of the people who've seen it say it's scary. I reckon that if they ever watched Ringu, they'd have a heart attack.",The Ring

160,shanfloyd,A finely shot serious storyline,8,13 February 2003,"If we divide the history of horror films chronologically into three eras, we'll find that each of them has their own style of stories. Don't include low-budget B-movies here; they're all the same over the years. Now, films prior to the 70's were, in most cases, derived from old classics. Or, the stories were set in old times in old haunted castles. Films within 70's and 80's are mostly made up of gory violence, bloody horrifying spirits roaming around a quiet town or some deserted place at night and attacking young girls in candid conditions. Films after the 90's generally has a queer storyline and lots of visual and sound effects do the rest job, plus or minus violence. This is the general rule.... but of course, with lot of exceptions.""The Ring"", a remake of the Japanese film ""Ringu"", falls in the last category and it, I must say, satisfied the conditions loosely. Well it has a queer storyline, good sound and visual effects, some instant chillers but the most important thing is, it has a fine seriousness over the story that is somehow scarce among the other modern horror films. The film never let the story get loose in any place. Though the plot is basically bogus, but the presentation of this plot is so fantastic and so realistic that when you are watching the film you are bound to take it seriously. That's where the success of this film lies.The content of the tape on which the story stands is brilliantly shot and presented... I must say. It is not really horrifying but artistic if you don't consider the fate of the viewers. Naomi Watts in her first leading role seemed very well. Dorfman as her son rather acted well but it seemed to me that his character is quite influenced by Haley Joel Osment in ""The 6th sense"" which was not a feature of ""Ringu"". However, locations of shooting were very well chosen.This film probably is one of the best in its genre and era. But the ending is too much overrated. There lies a little mess. Otherwise it is highly recommended. 4/5.",The Ring
161,refresh_daemon,Visually intense creepfest--different purpose than the original,7,4 February 2008,"This film is the American take on the Japanese original and while it absorbs its source material intact, it twists around its formula a bit in order to make it fit its new surroundings. The story is the same: a journalist, after losing her niece to a mysterious circumstance, investigates and discovers a cursed videotape, which gives a viewer only seven days to live.Like its predecessors, the film doesn't spend that much time on the supernatural elements, but focuses more on the mystery. However, The Ring features a lot more supernatural elements immediately and throughout the film than either previous version, perhaps to make more obvious and visceral the impending doom that faces our protagonist. Visually, The Ring has been injected with a shot of adrenaline, being less the brooding mystery of the original and more immediate and menacing. The color palette is colder than Ringu and the story is also more detached and focused on the ghostly mechanics than the human story, which leads the film to be more recognizably intimidating.The story itself is a little more mysterious in that the backstory of our villain is rather thin and unexplained. Furthermore, the villain is clearly portrayed as senselessly malevolent; this weakens at least two significant scenes. The ending, I think, is more clever than the previous versions. I like that there is something to the relationship between the protagonist, Rachel, and her ally, Noah, but it still seems a little weak when compared to Ringu--where one line can effortlessly show the development in the relationship.As far as a horror movie goes, The Ring is a blunt, but nonetheless creepy example. Losing some of the trappings of its predecessors helps simplify the story for faster flow and to create room for more visual creepiness, but also loses some of the complexity that helped the story have more depth. It's more of impressive frightfest than Ringu, but is a little weaker in story resonance. In the end, that makes The Ring just as effective overall: if you want more chills, catch this version. If you want more meat, catch Ringu. Decent entertainment. 7/10.",The Ring
162,Jacques98,How can traditional horror get any better than this?,7,21 September 2008,"Let me be blunt for a second: I hate most everything that is defined as ""traditional"" or ""classic"" because they're almost always synonyms for unoriginality and predictability. Movies with those tags usually amount to nothing more than a big-breasted woman (who is topless half the screen time) being chased by a killer/monster(s) until she either finds a way to kill him/it or dies. That's all. Point A, topless sex scene, fake scare, ""Oh my God! The monster is real!"" scene, chase, woman lives/dies. For reasons like this, I have always preferred horror movies like Saw where every rule/plot you think you know is thrown out. However, The Ring completely made me remember that traditional horror can still be complex and original . . . and actually scary. In more way than one, The Ring is The Shining of its time.First, let me get the cinematography out of the wayit's gorgeous and incomparable. The blue tent has never been done to this level of effectiveness, and the camera angles take me back to the time when people actually put effort into cinematography.The plot is one of the most complex and memorable a ghost story has ever had. Also, it's revealed through action, mystery, and actually requires the main character to actually physically do something rather than just talk and talk until I fall asleep, as in most movies anymore.The acting is solid on all fronts. There is entertainment value, rather than just another cliché social commentary. The storytelling is never bloated or boring. The Ring also never plays it safe and uses the easy clichés that it could use. I also can't point to a single cheesy moment, ever.Overall, I cannot think of a more perfect example of truly flawless traditional horror. It ranks among The Shining and Alien for me. I can understand why a lot of people wouldn't like it, and it isn't for everyone, but I loved it. Watch it and make up your own mind. Just know that the original Japanese version has had more impact on the horror genre than most any other movie of our time, and the remake, in my opinion, is far superior.10/10",The Ring
163,Pookyiscute,"One of the best horror movies, ever!",9,5 January 2006,"Horror is my favorite genre, let me start off by saying that. With that being said, however, it is extremely hard to find good horror movies. They're often referred to as, 'horr-ible' movies, which a lot of the time, can be true of them, since a majority of the horror movies that come out are generally low-budget, bad casted, 'B' movies. But, this movie, was quite different. It captures attention right from the beginning, and doesn't let go of your fearful imagination, until the end credits role. There is non-stop intensity throughout the entire movie, and each puzzle piece, discretely and carefully makes its way into the film, without you realizing it until the end. Naomi Watts, wasn't exactly well-known before this movie came out, and it was somewhat of a surprise(at least to me), that after it came out, she became more prominent in the film industry. She was of course excellent in it, however it was the type of role, any mediocre actress could have played.The other big surprise that the film offered, was that it was originally a Japenease movie. Usually the remakes, either aren't as good, or don't do well, just simply because they were originally foreign. However, this movie definitely is much more different, and is on a completely different level then some of the others we're used to seeing, or hearing about.I loved it, and it's definitely one of the best, and one of my favorite, horror movies. It's not at all slow, just at the right pace, scary, yet more phsychological than bloody. And, although I loved 'Scream', and 'The Blair Witch Project', it's sort of a happy medium between the two. It's not as bloody as 'Scream', and yet not as mind-warping as 'Project'. It's again, in a league of its own, with scare tactics, and I give the film, and original creator of the whole idea, behind, 'The Ring' a standing ovation, for his efforts, in inventing the piece.Anyone who's a horror lover, will certainly take to this as well. But, I will warn the people who loved movies like, 'House of 1,000 Corpses'. This is not that kind of movie, and far from satanic, by any means. Of course, that always depends on each individual person's opinion on what satanic is. I feel, that it is not. And, I will let you know in other film reviews, what I consider to be satanic. Like, 'Corpses'...which I felt was satanic. But, again, this is not, and if you do like the other types, where all it would entail, is demonic possession, or bloody ouiji boards, and such...this is not that kind of movie.Check it out though, if you are a horror fan.

In all honesty, the last thing I saw that kinda freaked me out recently was the House on Haunted Hill remake and that wasn't all that spooky anyway, save for key scenes. This is cause for celebration! I went to see this not looking for an Oscar contender, I went to get spooked and thats exactly what I got! People pulling their hair waiting for some decent chills, look no further because this movie's got your number. The beginning of the movie literally had me trembling! It's the type of drawn out intro scene that you've seen in movies that you've seen before like Halloween and Scream but it's so well done here that it definitely gets the ball rolling for the upcoming events. I did think the movie was a little uneven at times and it left me with more questions than answers. Some of the acting is a little blah and there were definitely some holes but still, people... I haven't seen a movie that scared me this bad in a while. Naomi Watts gives a good performance and the little girl in this movie did what she had to do. The few special effects present were unobtrusive. The video itself is dang creepy in it's own right. I just like this movie. There's an air of dread hanging over it right from the beginning and any movie that has you feeling uncomfortable for almost two hours gets my vote. In all-time scariness ratings, I wouldn't put it past the Exorcist or even the Exorcist III. I'd put it in my top five though, I am confident in that at least. Now, on to the Japanese original!

It is a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror film Ring, based on the novel of the same name by Koji Suzuki. Watts portrays a journalist who investigates a cursed videotape that seemingly kills the viewer seven days after watching it.The Ring really is everything a great horror picture should be. Take an original story, an interesting protagonist and a genuinely chilling back story and keep the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout, this film checks all those boxes. The cinematography in this film is outstanding, the deep green and blue colour palette completely sets the tone and mood for the film perfectly well.Naomi Watts gives a career-best performance in the Ring that I still don't believe she has beaten until today. It's just a shame she's been in schlock like Shut In and Dream House in recent years, especially when she's clearly a great horror actress.I'm glad The Ring got the praisal it deserved receiving positive reviews. Many critics praised the direction, screenplay, cinematography, Watts's performance, and reliance on dread and visuals over gore. The film also grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror movies of all time.

166,noahgibbobaker,"Really, really dumb.",6,3 October 2020,"The ring wasn't bad by any means, but it's really, really stupid. I wasn't expecting to love it but it was impressively poorly written and silly.I'll start with what I liked then I'll talk about dumb things. Martin Henderson wasn't awful and Naomi watts was pretty good, not even close to her best performance but she was still decent. There are a couple jokes I thought were funny, though I can't think of any examples and I only watched it a day ago, not a good sign. Finally I thought the chocking on the ring scene was well presented I guess.Now for the stupid stuff. Spoiler warning from this point. Rachel decided to watch the tape even though she already knew that the people who watched a week ago died, she also already suspected the tape for being evil. The concept is the dumbest thing ever I couldn't take this movie seriously, you watch a tape you and die I week later, yep really. So much obvious foreshadowing which is definitely something I think is annoying. A lot of convinces, Noah breaks into the file storage room at the mental hospital and there are no guards or workers there and none turn up while he's looking for the file. it's the most conventional movie ever, me and my dad were predicting everything that happened before it happened. The horse scene on the boat is looked ridiculous and is ridiculously stupid, this was one of my least favourite scenes of the movie. Aiden is used so that the writers could do a bad job and still have the story make sense. Finally I'll end on one of my biggest problems with the movie as a whole, nobody who knows about that tape seems like they even care about dying in the next 7 days, everyone is way too rational in the face of death, nobody even raises their voice when they are just hours away from dying.Anyway the ring was not scary or interesting in my opinion. I kinda hated a lot of it. You probably noticed by now but this review has no structure whatsoever; it's just more of a rant style so let me know if you like this in comparison to my usual more formal analysis style review.

170,zac-04879,A Hair-Raising Horror Sensation,7,16 July 2021,"Most horror movies seem to use either unique or unoriginal ideas and use strong horror violence to scare you. The Ring is a well-made remake of a creative Japanese horror film that's genuinely frightening. To all horror creators and producers out there, movies like The Ring is what true horror fans are looking for: smart, scary and disturbing ideas that do not rely on heavy blood and gore. The best thing about this film is there's barely any violence and it's still super creepy, unsettling and frightening.Why do the majority of horror movies rely on bloody violence for scares? A scary film can be gory, but it's annoying when that's the only ""scary"" element. What makes films like this one scary is the unexpected flashes of horrific imagery, dreadful sound effects and usually the style. The Ring is basically a reptile; it's cold blooded as in the visual colours are blue, dull and cold and it's extra psychological that way.The film's producers and the crew who made some of these great ideas need at least 50% of the credit. It can be a slow-burn, but is usually able to entertain audiences with its psychological mystery. Plenty of horror movies are still decent with ""happy endings"", but some need twisted closings and other questioning elements to leave everyone like they've witnessed a real horror flick. No need for gory slashings and average characters; creators need to start using chilling visuals, unique stories and unsettling soundtrack.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Ring
171,hasosch,"A video that has not been made, but watched",10,21 September 2009,"I would like to suggest a solution of what the ring in ""The Ring"" is, around which two long movies circle. Many watchers may have asked themselves WHO after all has made the mysterious video-tape with this ""freaky stuff"" in it (quotation). In ""The Ring"" I, Noah wonders in the presence of Rachel that their copy isn't a copy (because of the scrambled code-numbers), moreover, in the scene where the lady is combing her hair one does not see the shadow of the camera, which one would expect. Not even the filmed persons' shadows can be seen in the pictured mirrors, etc. The worst thing, however, is, that the fly that appears in the tape is mirror-inverted when Rachel sees her the first time. When she sees her the second time, she comes even out of the picture. It is clear, that the latter event is meant to prepare what will happen in ""The Ring II"" (2005), namely persons being able to transcend the con-texture-border between screen-inside and screen-outside reality. Actually, this phenomenon will be THE horror motive of the Ring II. But therefore, let us stick with the lacking shadows and the ""inverted"" fly. Another most interesting question is that obviously, Samara's father was not the film-maker, since there will be more films after his suicide, especially during the whole ""Ring II"".I therefore suggest as a solution that the authors of ""The Ring"" have used a seldom semiotic paradox, namely a sign without ""thetic"" introduction. Normally, every sign has to be ""thetically"" introduced, i.e. declared as a sign (the knot in your handkerchief, f.ex.). A sign is only a sign when there is somebody who declares it a sign. Sign do not exist in nature like eggs, boulders of water. Now, theoretically, one could think of a sign that consists only of a sign-carrier, an object, and, instead of the introducer of the sign, of at least one interpreter. Such a sign-model, at least in theory, fulfills the requirement of Peirce that a triadic sign relation is established. In other words: The mysterious video-tape in ""The Ring"" is a film that has never been made - but only watched. Consequently, what is shown on the tape cannot concern the past (like in normal movies), but must concern the future. And this is exactly what is happening in ""The Ring"": Rachel sees the lady, the mirror, the man standing on the upper level of the house, the burning tree, the worms ... and at the end the ""ring"" itself.If this interpretation of mine is correct - and I have no doubts that it is allowed to impute such a high form of metaphysics to whoever wrote the script - , then this movie deserves not only 10 points but needs to be welcomed in the exclusive club of those seldom products of entertainment industry which have truly brought forward scientific thinking.",The Ring
172,tributarystu,The X-Files Revisited,6,19 August 2003,"I had been waiting forward for quite some time to see this movie at the moment I finally did. I was asking myself if it would be just another crappy horror movie, or maybe...something more. Well it's something more. Watching through the movie, I could not stop thinking of The X-Files or The Sixth Sense. The ending does make it rather special though.SPOILERSThe story starts with two friends, two girls. One of them had seen a VHS with a movie which is said to kill you one week after the day you had seen it. And, if you can possibly imagine, as the movie starts it's just that day! The start is quite tough and well made as it will most certainly thrill you if not scare you. The story from now on will follow the fate of three other people, who themselves have watched this wicked cassette. It will be a horror ride.The movie does have an interesting storyline and it does have the necessary scares to keep you glued to the chair(or to your partner). As it is a quality horror movie, which should sustain the ""damage"" it has caused, the end isn't all-telling. You would be the unlucky one if your phone rang just after ""the movie"". And if you didn't answer it, then you'd have to live with the scares for one week. Just what happened to a friend of mine. The acting goes well with what is happening and, as I've said(more or less), the couple really does remind me of the X-Files. And this is maybe a weak point of the movie. I mean, it's not that enchanting too look at something and say: Wait a minute! I think I've seen something like this before. It is a lack of originality.As a whole it's a very good piece of work. Not as thrilling as I might have wanted it and a little too unoriginal, but still very good. If you want to be in for some thrilling stuff, then just watch this piece of cinematography. 8/10",The Ring

Well, there's a video that if you watch it, you will get a phone call with some whisper saying, ""seven days"". This whole movie is about two people and a child who helps a little try to stop the girl from killing them, but when it seems like they won, they failed.

Now I see that this is more of a mystery / thriller with elements of the supernatural and horror. The effort is invested in a quality story, but also in the characters, I mean primarily the main actress and the little boy who plays the son. The main character is a journalist who is practically forced to solve a mystery that has been imposed on her in life. We follow as spectators and try to figure out what exactly happened. The atmosphere plays a big role in the film because the weather is always gloomy, it rains and the colors are almost non-existent. A few things in the film were not explained to the end, I was not happy about that. I'm sorry I watched the movie before so it didn't surprise me.

176,Shiva-11,Could have been a ringing endorsement. Too bad...,6,16 October 2002,"It's that time of year again when the leaves are turning kaleidoscopic colors, the air is tinged with the crisp scent of renewal and brain busting midterms are once again a distant painful memory. It also means that we will be bombarded with ads for half-baked horror flicks that have been gathering dust on studio shelves, in the vain hope of scaring up some cheap Halloween thrills. Worse yet, the gullible masses will inevitably take the bait. 
Everyone is shocked when Rachel Keller's teen aged niece literally drops dead for no apparent reason. An investigative reporter, Rachel's curiosity is piqued when she is hears that Katie and three of her friends died after watching a cursed videotape. Determined to debunk an urban legend and make great copy in the process, Rachel inadvertently stumbles upon a sinister secret.  If she doesn't solve the ensuing mystery in seven days, not only will she blow her deadline, she dies. Nothing like a little incentive.Based on the 1998 Japanese film of the same name, The Ring rises above it's contemporaries: it doesn't rely on elaborate eviscerations, naked nubile teenagers or multimillion dollar CGI effects. The first hour of the film is a pure Hitchockian-style thriller with a supernatural bent, mixing disturbing surreal imagery with quick cut away shots and an eerie score to devastating effect (there were moments where the hairs on the back of my neck literally stood on end).  It's too bad that the remaining fifty minutes are a different movie.The second half of the film serves as a caveat for film makers on what not to do: introduce irrelevant characters, lose sight of your plot and allow it to ramble aimlessly, have a fake climax (that's never a good thing), and wrap with a predictable ending.  The biggest glitch however is the `villain' of the piece.Whether demon, psycho, monster or serial killer, there needs to be some underlying motivation that drives the antagonist to seek vengeance.  While the killer in The Ring was indeed wronged, it is never fully explained why this happened, and the victims are in no way associated with these events. Consequently, the antagonist's actions make no sense within the context of the film, especially when efforts to ameliorate these injustices only serve to magnify her rampage.  Regardless whether you prefer the thinking person's subtle horror stylings of The Sixth Sense or the pea soup expectorant head spinning of The Exorcist, The Ring will leave you unfulfilled and annoyed for having let you down.",The Ring

I can't tell you which one is scarier,Ring or The Ring,you tell me. So,we all know what it's about the cursed videotape that kills you in seven days. The Ring has absolutely no flaws,what so ever,the story is exactly the same basically except for the names,the acting choices were brilliant and gave more time for the kid and his personality and how the tape effects him due to in the Japanese film,the boy had barely any lines. Two sequels were spawned of course after The Ring,The Ring Two was probably the worst sequel ever,probably worse than like Poltergeist 3 or Omen IV and then Rings came out the third reboot,that basically didn't really have any point to be made,but was OK,nothing special,OK.

I was bored to death with that kind of movie and couldn't see wasting the price of a ticket on it.Boy, was I wrong!Knowing my penchant for good horror flicks, my best friend got me a copy of The Ring for my birthday.

Well, that night was last night, and I must admit to being a little tired while I'm writing this because I didn't sleep last night.  Literally.  I think it was 5am before I stopped seeing images from the movie in my mind. 
This is what horror should be.  It is thought provoking, scary, entertaining, and disturbing.  There are none of the gross-outs of some of the other horror movies out there.

Wrong! It's the things in the movie you have to think about yourself that gets you. Naomi did a stellar job as Rachel. The little boy was not annoying and played his role well. When I saw the movie at a friend's house I was left jaw dropped. I then had to walk home in the woods at 1am and I swear I've never been more anxious than I was that night.

182,general-melchett,I'm scared.........,9,27 January 2007,"There are three main types of horror in the film world - gory horror, jump-out-of-your-seat horror and just plain weird horror. Though The Ring contains elements of all these three, the reason why it's so scary is because it's just so weird! I mean, even the tape alone had me freaked out - and when Rachel watches it in an empty cabin on an old TV on her own, it really builds up an atmosphere of true terror that no amount of disfigured corpses can do. Some scenes from this film are so strange and disturbing that they'll linger in your mind for the rest of your life. This was the film that inspired me to sleep with my bedroom door closed - creaking doors in the dark are the most haunting things horror has offered us. Samara is one of horror's most unorthodox villains - the bit where she comes out of the TV at the end is scary. And the ring left by the cup of tea on the newspaper - everything starts to come together. I personally found the conclusion hard to understand - I don't see how it brought everything together, and the sequel didn't exactly do a great deal of justice to any of it either. It is evident that some scenes were just put in the film for fright-factor rather than any real use in the plot, but this is one of the main problems of horror films. And as long as you've got a horror film with an original premise (a tape that kills you a week after watching it) and a few genuine frights (or, in The Ring's case, a lot), you've got an interested audience. There are some disfigured corpses and jump-out-of-your-seat frights, but The Ring is best in the sense that it is just spooky. And, in spite of what I said earlier, everything DOES kind of make sense - everything we see on the tape is later revisited. And when you see those places again, it feels very strange indeed... 9/10",The Ring

However, it held my interest because the stars whoever they were, were very good; especially the children.  The interesting thing about this movie is that everytime something scary happens it is accompanied by loud percussion, or some weird musical sound.  Inotherwords, the scary sounds come before a calamity.  I think the editors could have done a better job; showing us the priorities in time sequence; not in back clips.

184,RockPortReview,The Best J-horror Remake ever!,9,14 May 2014,"*Contains Spoilers* Based on the Japanese horror sensation ""Ringu"" the American remake ""The Ring"" launched the J-horror craze in the fall of 2002. Ever since several Japanese and Asian film have had remakes but none have had the power and success of ""The Ring"" Before you die you see the ring.Set in the wet and ominously gloomy city of Seattle single mother Rachel, played by Naomi Watts, works as a journalist who comes across the mysterious story of a video tape that has deadly consequences 7 days after watching it. Her son Aidan is a strangely mature and articulate little boy who seems deeply troubled but he is just another part in the thoroughly creepy and inventive story. The opening scene of two teen girls talking about the tape has been spoofed many times but effectively sets up the urban mythology of the killer tape and gets Rachel involved as the victim was a relative and one of Aidan's closest friends.7 Days.When Rachel starts to investigate she finds out that a bunch of teens that stayed in a cabin at some resort all watched the cursed video have all recently died. So what would be the logical thing to do? Watch the video of course. Rachel drives to the resort and stays at the same cabin, number 12, she views the short black and white video of bizarre images and immediately afterwards the phone rings. When she picks it up a voice echoes 7 days and the countdown begins. She enlists the help of ex-flame and current co-worker Noah to help her find out the origins of the tape.The technology portrayed in the movie is in that period where everybody still had the big tube television and VCR's were still hanging by a thread. Those two things made all the difference in making it as creepy and scary as it is. HDTV's and DVD's are just too cold and clinical. The old technology has a worn in grungy feeling that is indispensable. But also in a strange way the movie invented the term viral video.Their research has lead Rachel to a horse farm on a remote island where what's left of the Morgan family resides. The old patriarch Richard Morgan lives there alone with nothing to do but work the land. His wife Anna had committed suicide years earlier. But wait there's more, desperate for a child the Morgan's adopted a daughter named Samara. Now this is a creepy kid and the key to the cursed video. We learn the disturbing back story of Samara and the Morgan's and its Rachel's job to set things right and stop the curse. Then comes the clever twist that sets this movie apart and brings us the movies signature moment.Almost three years later we were given a lame duck sequel directed by the guy to did the original Japanese version. Needless to say the original stands alone as an entertaining and frightening experience.",The Ring
185,GirishGowda,One Of The Most Horrifying Movies In My Early Teens...,9,28 May 2010,"I saw this movie when I was only 13 and I didn't switch on the TV for 2 weeks after I saw this movie. I cursed my parents for taking me to watch it in the theatres, I was so afraid. After I actually lived for more than 2 weeks, I was feeling better and have watched it and The Ring 2 many times since then. The Ring 2 didn't match expectations. But that is my next review, I will explain in that. The Ring and The Sixth Sense were the movies which played a huge part in making me a fan of the horror genre. Gore Verbinski directs this movie which is a Japanese movie remake. This film and The Grudge spawned all those bad Asian remakes in the coming years.Anyway, coming to the story, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a journalist in Seattle city. Her sister's daughter died under mysterious circumstances and when she investigates, she finds out about an urban myth according to which a person after seeing a video dies exactly after a week. Her son had predicted his cousin's death before it had actually happened. She also watches the tape and knows that she is going to die within the week. Along with her boyfriend, she tries to find the reason behind the killer video and finds a strange and creepy story behind it. Can she save her son from Samara Morgan (Daveigh Chase), the girl in the video? Will Samara rest in peace? The beautiful and talented Naomi Watts captures Rachel's motherly instincts perfectly. Rachel is the only person to uncover anything about the video. So far, all the others simply died without knowing anything about Samara and her adopted parents. The son Aidan Keller (David Dorfman) is actually very creepy because his tone is very adult-like. He is no Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, Artificial Intelligence), but he really made me nervous. The film worked on many levels, mainly because the director does not go over the top with cheesy special effects. The backstory is really coherent and the film is completely sure of itself and that is a major plus of the film. It doesn't have long pauses in the story just to push the running time, as in many horror movies. For adults, the film may not be that scary, but it works as a thriller as well. Brian Cox as Richard Morgan is also very good. The story about the horses is something I had never seen before and it was amazing. When the plot unfolds and we know Samara's story, it is not too difficult to sympathize with her fate. A very satisfying horror movie which will be classic in the future.9/10",The Ring
186,AwesomeWolf,Boring,5,3 February 2005,"Never underestimate the ability of the most boring, to just plain bad, films to become big franchises. Now, I've seen 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', 'Ring 0', and 'Rasen', and the only one I thought to be worthwhile was 'Ring 0: Basudei'. The others ranged from boring to just plain silly (I'm thinking 'Rasen' in particular here). I was apprehensive in watching 'The Ring', and thinking about how most remakes seem doomed to failure, what could 'The Ring' offer in entertainment value? In the end, it wasn't that bad. Of course, it wasn't that good either. It ended up being an amalgamation of 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', with various Hitchcock moments thrown in and a sub-plot about horses thrown in, which leads me to: THE HORSES! WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE HORSES. I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.So, apart from the sub-plot about the horses, 'The Ring' is just another journalist investigating a cursed tape. I can't think of any other movie series that involves a cursed tape, so originality points would go there if there hadn't been five different versions of 'Ring' in Japan already. If I wanted to curse everyone with a tape, I'd just project onto the large-screens you see in city centres, allowing for maximum curse-age.Apart from the lack of any scares for most of the movie, my biggest problem with 'The Ring' was the character of Aidan. You know who he reminds me of? The kid from 'The Sixth Sense', and a bunch of other kids just like that kid. I really hate any movie-kid like Aidan. I would gladly trade him for Homer Simpson's talking-pie or killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason, if only there were no more kids with super-natural powers, or kids who seem to know everything about the occult.'The Ring' isn't that scary - it didn't even improve on 'Ringu', which wasn't very frightening either - and ended up disappointing and boring - 5/10",The Ring

Whoever put that together has to be really sick in the head, that was VERY engaging, although it raises so many more questions.  For example, the girl was left up in the barn with a TV.  How does her spirit connect to a video cassette?  Who made it?  For what it tried to be, The Ring is tolerable, I didn't HATE the movie afterwards.

The acting is good in the Ring, surprisingly. Naomi Watts does a good job here. Brian Cox has a pretty good cameo. The kid was really my only complaint dealing with the acting, he just came off like a rip off of Haley Joel Osment's performance from The Sixth Sense. The Ring represents Gore Verbinski's best work as a director, though there was one shot that maybe a ripoff of Rear Window. The dialogue is fine, though the TV conversation was a little strange and not in a good way. The Ring has some chilling scenes and some pretty scaring, disturbing ones. The film is pretty atmospheric, theres pretty much a sense of atmosphere throughout the movie. There are questions unresolved in The Ring. I'm hoping they will be resolved in the upcoming sequel.

The Samara villain was pretty damn clever and cool I believe she even won an MTV Award that year. Another memorable trivia piece for this movie was that half the reels sent out to the movie theaters were defective and showed only half of the movie prompting many viewers to get their money back. Unheard of I don't know of that ever having happened before or since. One thing is certain. This made Naomi Watts a star. Maybe not a huge star, but a star. Whether or not she gets any bigger I wouldn't hazard a guess. The special effects are cool and the plot twists are fresh and keep you entertained. Brian Cox unfortunately has a very small part blink three times and you'll miss him completely. It's not a scary as most other well known and popular horror films but it will keep your attention.",The Ring

194,debblyst,"Not without flaws, but better than the Japanese original",7,1 December 2003,"After having seen both the original Japanese ""Ringu"" (1998) and its American remake ""The Ring"" (2002), I found the latter superior in almost every aspect (atmosphere, cinematography, effects, soundtrack, acting, pace), though the script is in the usual Frankenstein-style of contemporary U.S. horror films -- borrowed pieces from everywhere put together with visible stitches all over.The original ""Ringu"" is part of the ""new trend"" in Japanese horror films (and since then imported by the U.S.) that goes like ""when everything seems the quietest...when you're least expecting...it's precisely then that...NOTHING happens!"" (add loud metallic noises). The cinema of anti-climax!! ""Ringu"" was full of these anti-climaxes, with an annoying slow pace, but it had other major problems: a very unsympathetic male lead character with Cronenbergian ""Dead Zone"" ESP powers played by a deadpan actor (in the American remake this far-fetched stuff is left out); perfectly expendable characters (such as the grandfather); several plot holes impossible to come to terms with (even more than in the US version), culminating in a very confusing third act.The American remake has several assets of its own: a trimmer pace; lovely and charismatic British/Australian actress Naomi Watts; fine attempts at creating haunting images (the breathtaking horse sequence on the boat; Samara's psychiatric treatment; and especially the ""short film on the videotape"" itself, a gem of surrealistic inspiration and telegraphic efficiency -- no wonder, as director Gore Verbinski was a highly successful publicity director). However, there are some letdowns too, especially those impossible phone calls (how DO you explain them at ALL? Who cares?) and some of the cast (the male lead, insipid; and the boy who plays Naomi's son, creepy beyond any sympathy). Not ""revolutionary"", but with subtler, richer shades than the usual U.S. noisy, in-your-face-special-FX brainless horror routines and much more exciting than the anti-climax Japanese modern horror films. My vote: 7 out of 10.",The Ring

The American version explains more than the Japanese original and goes a bit deeper into the reasoning of the main antagonist.A bunch of students return from a retreat only to die a horrible death a week later. An investigative journalist thinks this story goes a bit deeper. She finds out that they all watched this videotape that kills you seven days to the minute you view it.Would you believe an idea like this? I felt like there was something missing from the American version. I couldn't be drawn into the suspense and terror that existed in Japanese. I think they did an excellent job in introducing Samara.

I haven't seen the Japanese original but I don't think this version would have let it down. I went to see this at the pictures on a Saturday night after a few beers so I feel I really need to see this again at home on DVD. The film contains several jump out of your seat moments, proper ones, not the pathetic attempts to shock the audience in the likes of ""I still know what you did last summer"", which actually shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as films as classy as this one.

201,Dragoneyed363,First class suspense,8,4 May 2008,"The Ring, an American remake of the Japanese film ""Ringu"", is in my honest opinion a spectacular and enthralling film. The writing, directing, performances and replay value are amazing in and of themselves. I especially love the premise, and I will review this movie as it's own film, not a remake. What really makes it wonderful is the incredible performances and suspense. I really love all the actors' and actresses' dedication and believability, there being very memorable deliverances of lines and scenes after the film is over. The suspense is top-notch, because of how well the movie is played out and how creepy and fun the material is, that I was both eyes on the screen every second. Naomi Watts is radiant and brilliant; the scenes where she slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together, or uncovers something dark and haunting are haunting themself because of how marvelous she makes this material.Do not get me wrong, the material itself is great, but it would have been nothing were it not for the cast. The characters are all interesting, and the main story is quite saddening and effective when it is slowly revealed through many different aspects. While it seems as though the main threat, a ""killer videotape"", would be a ridiculous and stupid threat, hard to make convincing, it undoubtedly works to the fullest here and is entirely convincing, the videotape's images and the events themselves all being very interesting and entertaining. While the movie is not a masterpiece, it is not too short from it, having a great replay value and being one of the top 20 most effective horrors of the 00s, in my opinion. I am glad it receives a lot of positive reception, for it deserves every bit of it.",The Ring

It's a healthy mixture between thrillers and horror films, serving chilling delights for its target audiences on each and every twist and turn. It's almost hard to believe that the charming 17-year-old Daveigh Chase is also the girl behind the voice of Lilo & Stitch's Lilo.

It's been compared to ""The Sixth Sense"" and that's a fair statement.  Both films involve death and extrasensory perception, and both involve someone reaching out from the grave to the living.The story is about a reporter, Naomi Watts, who discovers that her niece died at the exact same moment as her boyfriend and another couple.  Upon some investigation, she discovers that all four watched this videotape together.  She tracks the tape down and watches it herself, and then the phone rings and a little girl's voice tells her she has seven days to live.I don't want to give away any more of the plot or the ending, but suffice it to say that it's a scary ride.  The mood of the film is enhanced by the spooky images throughout, of scenes where time is warped.  You're given little clues during the woman's search for what's behind the video, but the ending is surprising nonetheless.It's a good horror film.

Unless you have ADD or something, you have to at least appreciate what Gore Verbinski achieved in 2002. What he did was he basically took the premise of Ringu, a good suspenseful Japanese horror flick and made it more suspenseful and filled with creepy visuals.I am a huge horror fan, and this is one of the movies that unsettles me the most. The suspenseful pace, the incredible, beautiful but haunting visuals make this a unique experience. I love gory films, but this one relies a lot more on psychological horror and imagery to create scares. No jump scares, just good story telling.The movie may not answer all the questions it creates, but the viewer, if he pays attention accordingly, will be able to figure them out for himself.

There is no such thing as not realistic. Once a mind can imagine something, that something has officially become reality. It has logically shifted from something that didn't exist to something that exists.Horror movies have something pleasurable about them even if the same idea of people getting killed every time is being repeated. There is always the new way used for eliminating the victim and the factor which is causing the horror. This is the case with the ring, the source of horror this time is a regular video tape and here lies the originality of the idea.I am fanatic when it comes to horror movies.

Watts delivers a terrific performance as a news reporter who is investigating the origins of a freaky videotape whose viewers die 7 days after viewing it. The film borders on the absurd, but the atmosphere is unbearably tense.

211,Chromium_5,A good movie if you're willing to turn your brain off.,8,13 December 2004,"***Spoilers: If you have not seen the movie, you shouldn't be reading this*** Overall, ""The Ring"" was a fantastic movie, mainly because out of the limited number of horror movies I have seen in my life, this one actually managed to scare me. All the creepy little details are perfectly done, and it also has some great shock moments (the scene with Rachel's body in the closet made me jump about a foot). The tape itself is very mysterious and disturbing, and is, in my opinion, the best part of the movie.However, there were several things that were rather dumb, and the more I thought about them after I watched it, the more I didn't like it. It's the kind of movie that you can't analyze too much, or you'll ruin it for yourself. For one thing, the entire premise of combining supernatural mysticism with VHS technology is a bit goofy. But what really turned me off about this one was the kid, Aiden.Aiden drove me crazy. I'm supposed to feel scared for him, and yet he spends the entire movie looking like he's about to wet his pants. He's a shaking, bug-eyed, dippy little nerd. All kids in horror flicks are like this, too (The Sixth Sense, The Shining, Invaders From Mars, etc.), and I'm sick of it. I want to see a horror where the kid stands up for himself like a man. Maybe then I'd care about whether the ghost gets him or not. Nervous outcasts like Aiden just annoy me. If I had a kid like him, I'd LET the ghost get him. After all, if he's not gutsy enough to protect himself from a stupid ghost like Samara, he probably wasn't going to last long anyway.This brings me to my second point: Samara the ghost was indeed stupid. Yes, everything was creepy and suspenseful, until we find out the exact method she uses to kill her victims, namely, crawling out of the TV and... looking at them. What the heck!? How hard can it be to defeat her?? All you have to do is unplug your TV. If you're not swift enough to do that, then just run away! She can't catch you, because she happens to be the slowest-moving ghost of all time.This is why I got so mad at that guy Noah at the end. All he had to do was LEAVE THE DAMN ROOM, but this proved to be too hard a task for him. Samara's inching toward him with these teeny-tiny baby steps, and this guy decides to start falling over and crashing into things like one of the Three Stooges. What a moron. If he's so uncoordinated that he can't walk ten feet without tripping all over himself, then he probably wouldn't have lived long anyway, either.Well, if you can handle the unintended silliness of the plot and characters, and focus on the well-done atmosphere and details, then you will enjoy this movie.

213,FilmSnobby,Entertaining nonsense.,5,1 February 2004,"A movie about an evil VHS cassette.  Why not? -- we've clearly run out of other ideas.  But before you ladle on the praise for originality, please recall that this is a remake of a much tighter Japanese cult-shocker.*The Ring*  is equally weighted with virtues and faults.  The actual videotape in question, which will kill you exactly one week to the minute after you view it, is itself a rather clever take-off on some of the Surrealist work of Bunuel and Dali from the Twenties  (but without Bunuel's REALLY horrible imagery, like eyeballs getting slit with knives).  An advance here is that the imagery on the tape comes alive, right through the TV:  a filmed housefly can actually be plucked off the screen, as the days ominously pass and the curse gathers strength.  Needless to say, the housefly is merely foreshadowing for much nastier  ""interactive""  horrors to come.The plot is full of holes or is otherwise incomprehensible.  The movie never considers, for instance, that a person could simply be in a place where there are no televisions when his or her week is up:  without the medium of television, the ghost isn't able to manifest itself in order to kill him/her.  Or perhaps you simply die, whether you're near a TV or not.  Who knows?  There are other absurdities, but to give them out would be spoiling things.  (For those in the know, I'm referring to the efficacy of making copies.)It's not that I require water-tight plots for my horror films -- or indeed, for any films.  But it's to be assumed that a movie without a strong plot will have many other virtues to compensate.  *The Ring*  mostly fails here, as well:  Verbinski's idea of setting a mood consists of covering the camera lenses with icy-blue filters; the cast, with the sole exception of Naomi Watts, is low-wattage and includes a Haley Joel Osment copycatter  (at one point, the kid in this movie even wears an undertaker's dark suit); and the suspense is disappointingly light, except for the splendid beginning when we aren't sure what to expect.But having said all this, *The Ring*  also avoids being completely ridiculous.  The main characters, who operate and investigate under a cloud of certain impending death, seem caught up in a psychological anguish which is unusual in a genre where sudden scares are the norm.  Self-sacrifice in a horror flick hasn't been seen since the finale of  *The Exorcist*, thirty years ago.  All in all, *The Ring*  gamely continues the mini-Renaissance of decent scary movies that began with  *The Sixth Sense*.  Worth watching -- 5 / 10.",The Ring

It is implied that perhaps they made a pact with the devil.

The little demonic girl exacts her revenge by leaving 'haunted' images on a video tape, anyone watching the tape will die 7 days later, presumably because that is how long the girl lived inside the well. Naturally there is a way to save yourself, but I won't tell how. The ending is way too long and you are left watching the clock wondering how much longer this movie is going to drag on.The movie overall isn't bad and I think it is the general lack of quality horror movies that makes people believe this one is so good.

In this version we have the usual 'love angle' with the estranged child's father (yawn,) performed with textbook wooden acting. Then we have the irrelevant random shock images etc.The scene in the original Ring where she crawls out of the TV scene is one of the most chilling things I have seen, you know that this is evil in its pure form. On this weak remake it is nothing more than a girl with blood streaked horror make up on her face.The other really annoying thing about this film is how you keep recognising scene types that have been borrowed from other films.

As I sat through Naomi Watts' first few scenes, I knew she was playing the character wrongly, too strong, too directed, too much the antithesis of fearful. I think she could handle the Sigourney Weaver role from ""Alien."" But, thanks probably to the magnificent transformation Lynch gets out of her in the audition scene in ""Mulholland Drive,"" I kept waiting for her character to change, to learn fear and grow in it, especially to show the effects of the social responsibility ""Ringu's"" tape forces onto each it touches. She ever does. Maybe these things are in ""The Ring's"" too-faithful script. But they're never in her eyes.Hideo Nakata I consider a clever hack. ""Ringu"" is neither as visceral as ""Evil Dead Trap"" nor as cerebral and horrific as ""Kairo."" Even so, my comment at ""Ringu"" manages to back into some strong praise. No one who has a chance in hell of seeing ""Ringu,"" even on a small screen, even your computer screen, should see this remake.What if Lynch had directed Watts in ""The Ring""? If only he had! Maybe draw a rule of thumb, something like this: Great directors can remake the works of hacks. Look at all the trashy mystery novels made into great films. Maybe hacks can remake great works. Roger Corman's Poe series. (Lucas' trashing of ""Hidden Fortress"" must be the exception that proves the rule. Oops! No! Here's another one: Besson doing Jeanne d'Arc.)

The U.S. version, The Ring, arguably has a better content of the cursed videotape, with an apparent influence from the surrealism. The viewers may be more easily identified with The Ring's Noah (Martin Henderson), who is skeptical about supernatural phenomena, than with Ringu's Ryoji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who possesses an ESP. In The Ring, the protagonist's son Aidan (David Dorfman) has more significant role, in both storytelling and creating the atmosphere (wearing the archetypical Hollywood's horror-flick makeup), than the Japanese counterpart does. Several details added in the American version (e.g., a horse jumping into the sea from a ferry) deepen the backdrop, while the post-production that manipulates the pictures into a blue tone generates a chilly mood.

This film actually produced some very real and powerful chills without having to resort to grinding excessive, bloody gore into my face.Featuring plenty of ghostly images to frighten the viewer, royally - Along with a mellow flow of hypnotically haunting music (composed by Hans Zimmer) to set the mood - ""The Ring"" certainly didn't let me down at all as its story went deep into an investigation into the deaths of those who had viewed a mysterious video tape.Impressively directed by Gore Verbinski - There was definitely no question in my mind that this talented movie-maker understood the genre of film that he was working with, completely.For me, ""The Ring"" was a real ""gem-of-a-fright-flick"" whose spooky images and scary story-line actually stayed with me long after the whole horror-show was over.",The Ring
220,K-Slicer,Blank Videotapes Are Spooky...There's A New One,10,21 March 2003,"When I was younger, the spookiest thing that had ever come on a blank videotape was a loud, sustained beep that came on the head cleaner that was used to clean my VCR.  After watching ""The Ring"", now I realize that this movie is video tapes what ""Psycho"" is taking a shower.  Here are my reasons (some spoilers revealed): (1) Naomi Watts is a very capable actress and she has cemented herself as a suspense queen (""Mulholland Drive"" is also recommended). (2) Very solid plotting and very solid writing.  Ehren Kruger is a superior screenwriter and this is the best effort since ""Scream 3"". (3) Brian Cox is one of the best character actors out there currently and he stuns here as well.  (4) David Dorfman had the best performance in the film. He reminded me a lot of Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"". (5) Since when can Gore Verbinski direct a suspense film so well?  I was very surprised to learn that he also directed ""Mouse Hunt"". (6) The mystery of the tape's origin kept me glued to the screen because it was strangely complex. (7) I was still asking questions at the end of it. (8) I found the film to be an odd mix of ""8MM"" and ""The Mothman Prophecies"". (9) The American version has inspired to check out ""Ringu"". (10) Watching ""The Ring"" late at night makes you want to keep the light on as you fall asleep.  Ten reasons give a score of ten.  ""The Ring"" is definitely a great film if you want a good fright or if you want to waste time.PS:  As I watched this movie, I especially paid attention to Naomi Watts. The way she acted made me wonder if I was watching Nicole Kidman at one point and then Laura Linney the next.  She was a great choice for the film and I hope she chooses more roles to showcase her unique style of acting. Here ends my rant!",The Ring
221,hernan_amado,Naomi Watt's second triumph!,9,9 June 2003,"After her pitch perfect emotionally devastating performance in 2001's ""Mulholland Drive"". Naomi Watts comes up with another triumphant film, which is ""The Ring"". Although ""The Ring"" is not as powerful and inspiring as ""Mulholland Drive"". ""The Ring"" deserves the highest possible accolade as well.The direction is simply superb. Once you see this movie, it gets its hooks in you. I saw it at midnight about two months ago, and I thought I'd fall asleep, but I didn't. The story was so clever, that it doesn't let people close their eyes for a minute. The opening sequences are excellent; you really understand the story once you see them. You see two young girls kidding each other about the videotape that supposedly kills people, and they find out it's true and then they get killed. Then, Naomi Watts' presence in the film makes you watch without getting bored or annoyed for a second. The surrealistic video is so interesting, as well as the whole story. It's not a movie in which monsters kill others, but a psychological horror story that'll make you think a great deal about the complexity of Samara's personality.  It also has the most unpredictable and brilliant scenes in film history. For instance the scene where the horse is chasing Naomi's character is great. You'd never expect that. You say in your mind, ""Wait! It's not her time to die yet"". This scene is so full of horror, mystery, seriousness, etc. Another excellent scene is when she tries to find out about Samara's life and then a man kills himself in the bathroom. However, the best and scariest of all is when Rachel falls into the well and also when Samara gets out of the TV. What scenes! Besides its wonderful and dark photography, and strong acting by the majority of the cast, this shows the dark side of a little girl who could be so tender, but has reasons to kill even the nicest person. It'll make you think of how far a person can go because of being ignored by their family or other people. The final scenes are very unexpected, and understandable. If you really pay attention to this movie you'll understand the whole thing. Without a doubt ""The Ring"" is one of the most interesting and clever psychological horror movies ever made! I could say it's the best movie of 2002, since most of 2002 movies are very bad. An example would be the corny ""The Hours"" and the overrated ""Lord of the Rings"". Naomi Watts has become one of my favorite actresses. She's reached perfection and respect with ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""The Ring"". She's given the roles of a lifetime, and she'll be getting fantastic offers, which she obviously deserves.  8.5/10",The Ring

There are a fair amount of scenes to make you jump, but there's more than that. The storyline is decent and it's well filmed and acted. Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by it's PG-13 rating. It's not a gore-fest, but there are some unpleasant images that cross the screen. I'm pretty hardened after watching scary movies all my life, but I can still appreciate them. If you're going to see this movie, you should see it in a theater. I got much amusement from the crowds responses. There were three ladies in their 30s on my right, about half way through the movies I noticed they were curled up in their seats with their hands on their foreheads, covering their eyes anytime they thought something scary would happen. Then on my left there was a couple...they guy got a bit verbal at some of the last quarter of the movie. Not talking to his mate, but usually uttering one curse word at key moments. It all added to my enjoyment of the film. As a kicker, for those that have seen the movie, I got home and turned on my cell phone and the it immediately went off with a message. I laughed outloud. No worries, it was just my friend, Vince, inviting me to come over and watch the world series. I have not seen the original Japanese Ringu yet, but I am looking forward to seeing it as I've heard it's better and scarier! *** (Out of 4)",The Ring
225,lostintwinpeaks,"a daring, intelligent, suspenseful modern thriller ...",9,9 March 2003,"I thought this was an excellent movie, and its high quality surprised me. Long before this ever came out, I was a big fan of the original Japanese version and when I heard Hollywood were doing a remake, I thought ""oh no...""However the result is very good. Okay, granted, parts of it are slow and cliched. But the good qualities by far outweigh the bad.A modern horror movie with hardly any violence or gore? Yes, that is the Ring! As a result it was panned. I think it was brave of the filmmakers to make a modern horror movie without buckets of gratutious gore. They do throw in some shock moments that are very disappointing (they're there to make the movie more scary apparently but doesn't work - mere Hollywood stereotype pandering) but for the most part its psychological suspense, not physical.It was panned too for not being suspenseful enoguh. True, there are very little action sequences. This is more like reading a book than watching a movie. It is a mystery thats all about story, and if you warm to it, then it WILL be suspenseful for you.Naomi Watts (so vastly different than in her excellent performance in David Lynch's ""Mullholland Drive"") is a great actress; and her intelligence and grace really benefits the movie. Also check out Brian Cox's cameo. This excellent actor steals the show in his few minutes of on-screen time.Compared to the original, which just went for unexplained weird, this movie makes the attempt to explain many things... which some felt weakened it. I disagree: I think it makes the movie more complex and intriguing.On a final note: the opening scene. It starts out very cliched, like the start of a typical Hollywood slasher movie (the scene with Drew Barrymore in the beginning of ""Scream"" gave birth to this): two young girls, alone in a dark house on a rainy night, one of them walking around clutching a cordless phone. I think the filmmakers were not being unoriginal, but rather starting the movie this way on purpose: making you think you were about to see a typical horror/slasher, then changing course and delivering this instead -a daring, intelligent, suspenseful modern thriller.

227,manchester_england2004,Great ideas somehow lead to a mediocre movie!,4,20 June 2009,"I have to admit I was really excited about seeing this movie. Those who shared my opinions about movies on the IMDb have regularly cited THE RING as being a classic movie in the vein of such movies as THE EXORCIST or a proper horror movie (when the citation is provided in comments related to movies I hated such as JEEPERS CREEPERS). As such, I felt I was being provided with some good reliable advice. Unknowingly I was in for such a huge disappointment.Indeed, THE RING proved to be an even bigger disappointment for me than THE HAUNTING (the original not the remake).The plot of THE RING is as follows - people come into possession of a videotape that when viewed leads to their death 7 days after. This idea is great on paper and indeed the movie does take some positive steps to bring this concept to life.In the movie's favour are some excellent scenes that one never sees coming. These scenes are bolstered by some decent camera-work and suspense music in the background. The producers take the wise path of psychological horror - the movie is devoid of gore, silly CGI-generated monsters and speedied up action sequences that most movies from its time are notorious for. It was for perhaps these reasons that people perceive it as a classic. But the view of such people is misplaced - THE RING is not a classic, just something better than many movies of its time. This was the case until SAW came along to become what is easily the best movie of the 2000s decade.But I return to the good points about THE RING. A good performance from the lead actress, Naomi Watts, helps the proceedings. The young actor playing the kid with psychic powers, David Dorfman, deserves a special mention.Unfortunately, the material the actors are forced to work with is devoid of sustained suspense, tension or emotion. THE RING is certainly NOT scary. I will make a few comparisons to other movies to illustrate what THE RING should have contained.Fear of the unknown. THE RING touches upon this important element of psychological horror but without success. We don't know where the videotape came from, who made it or who is controlling the malevolent forces leading to the deaths of its viewers. Too many unanswered questions, too many scenes of boredom and too many inconsistencies in tone ensure the idea falls flat. In contrast, THE EXORCIST was successful in this respect because the unknown element was the demon possessing Regan. We didn't know what it was, where it came from, or what it would do next. We knew the child was suffering but didn't know just what was going on inside. For these reasons, THE EXORCIST rightly retains the status of a classic horror movie, even 36 years after its release.Fear of impending doom. THE RING brings to us the idea of someone knowing they will die in 7 days time. But, there is no reaction from characters put in this position. Not one character seems to be scared by the risk of death. As such, the fear of impending doom is non-existent, even though this should be the main aspect to carry the movie. In contrast, THE OMEN shows us how the fear of impending doom creeps up on the characters. We know these characters are doomed, they become scared, they turn on one another, they seek answers from the Holy Bible, they trace their steps back to find out where the malevolent force originated from and try to prevent disaster.A malevolent force to battle against. THE RING reveals a malevolent force that is behind the deaths of those watching the notorious videotape. The force is a young girl named Samara but she has no identity, no motives and no direction. She is just an evil girl who kills because she sees herself as being ignored. Good effects are used to make the girl seem freaky but we never find out HOW she kills these people. Also, her connection to the videotape itself is very unclear. In contrast, THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE provides a malevolent force in the form of a family of psychopaths. We know they once worked in a slaughterhouse and somehow turned from killing animals to killing humans. The menacing spectre of Leatherface and the symbols of death in the family's house consistently haunt us. It draws us in and never lets us out. We also know how they kill.Appropriate ending. THE RING doesn't even have a proper ending. Due to the subject matter and the concepts brought to the screen, the producers were unable to go for the usual Hollywood-style happy ending where everyone turns out to be fine, the monsters are dead, malevolent forces are banished and everyone lives happily ever after. So what did the producers do? They just stopped the movie. In other words, there is no ending. In contrast, who could forget the ending of Alfred Hitchcock's classic, PSYCHO? In PSYCHO, Norman Bates is shown to have a split personality and by the end, his sane half has lost the battle. The final scene of that movie remains one of the most disturbing committed to film and is certainly no happy cop-out ending. This is just one reason why PSYCHO remains one of the greatest horror/suspense movies of all time.I have used four classic horror movies as examples to illustrate where THE RING borrowed ideas from and what it aimed to be but failed to be. Its success was due purely to timing of its release.In short, THE RING is a very over-hyped, mediocre movie that I do not recommend. Instead, I would advise readers of my comment to check out the classics I have outlined if they have not already done so.",The Ring
228,gpeltz,Eerie and compelling,9,3 November 2002,"I liked this film a lot. The lack of bloodshed does not in the least diminish the overall tension and suspense. The horror is visually sustained on an almost subliminal level. Images from the video, defy logic. A fly moves on the video, even when the tape is stopped. Images from the video flash back as the locations are discovered. The detective story is satisfying, a mystery is revealed only to illuminate a greater mystery. The acting is good. The cinematography is carefully aligned to the palette of the story.It is a very visual experience.  Zimmer's score is appropriately spooky. There are a few threads of plot, left dangling at the end.points that could be important, under explained, but nothing to leave one frustrated.

I mean so what if you made a copy of the tape, she should have thought of that if she wanted to save him as well3) How the hell would you explain that to her sister, since she wanted to know how her daughter died?It definitely had scare factors in it, probably won't be able to sleep tonight but I think it should have ended with the soul finally able to rest",The Ring

The only time in the movie you feel part of the real world is the intro. As soon as that ends, you're pulled into this dreamlike series of scenes that paint a terrifying and hopeless story for the characters.

""The Others"" is one example, this is another. For most part, this is one truly creepy and scary horror movie. Naomi Watts is excellent in her (a bit awkward) part as a single mother. Let's hope she can lay her hands on some more major parts! It is a visually stunning movie too. ""Feardotcom"" tried to achieve a similar look and managed for the most part, but otherwise that movie led nowhere and was all over the place! Here the visuals serve a purpose. To set a specific mood. The best scenes are the ones on the island! They are genuinely disturbing in a very quiet and understated way. *******MINOR SPOILER HERE******* And even though the ""surprise"" ending after the ending is totally predictable, it is still chilling. *******END OF MINOR SPOILER***** There are only two things I am not satisfied with. First, the little boy who plays the son. He is not a bad actor but he displays some truly bizarre behaviour. Or rather, he displays no concern at all when all type of strange happenings are occurring all around him. He seems to be the ""Sixth sense""-boy crossed with ""The Omen""-boy. And finally, the plot is really no big shakes. Once you get the hang of things, there is really no need for any more explainations.

233,mrskywalker,10 is the score for Ring.,10,2 November 2002,"Fine horror film that is also a thinking persons mystery.  I found it was even better the second time because because less time is spent figuring out the interesting mystery.  This is Hitchcock meets Carpenter meets Castle meets Hammer. Better than the other horror film out now called Below.  The Ring slightly reminds me of Frailty another fine film. The girl I was with was hyperventilating.Of course this film won't please those people seeking gory murder movies and the usual fools who cackle and laugh  to draw attention to themselves may bother you.  This is not about thrills watching people murdered or tortured. This film may not satisfy those who seek an agenda.  This film is intelligent but scary.  This film is modern but not at all driven by political correctness. Actually the lack of gore makes it appropriate for most ages.  It is just a good story that is very supernatural  dark and brooding.All and all the audience was riveted to this film.  The second viewing of this film most of the loose ends can be figured out.  Slight spoiler: The film has an excellent payoff, better to me than 6th Sense or the Others. But I would have liked it to go on longer perhaps for a final confrontation if you know what I mean!

It's been imitated and parodied so many times at this point, that I don't really think it's possible to be ""scared"" by it (Scary Movie 3 absolutely made sure of that), but that's fine. Unlike any of its successors, the original Ring isn't really a ""horror"" movie for most of it. It's a mystery thriller disguised as a ghost story, and it works. The primary tone of this film is dread; the rainy, misty Seattle setting, the blue/green colour grade, the coldness of the world just emanates from the screen.To be honest, nothing ""horrifying"" really happens for a bulk of this movie. It's an interesting structure and makes the final 15 minutes all the more satisfying. That final scene is still so freaking great, 20 years later.The Bad: Characters. That's this movie's main issue. None of the characters are particularly interesting or compelling. They're not fun to watch. Rachel has no discernible personality. Her son...oh my. He is probably one of the most annoying and frustrating children I have ever seen on screen.The Ugly: It's kind of funny to think how little time Samara gets on screen, but how iconic of a villain she is. I also feel like it was an amazing decision to not show her kill anyone until the very end (and even that isn't actually shown).

I was totally mesmerised by her performance, just as I was in 'Mulholland Drive'. She's got that Bette Davis-like presence which transforms good movies, which 'The Ring' definitely is, into very good ones. I cannot think of a better actress than her, and whilst films like this don't win Oscars, I'm sure she will one before long. The minute she appears, after what is already one of the best starts of any movie I have seen for ages, you're gripped, and, mainly because of her convincing style, you don't so much suspend disbelief at the plot, but actually want to believe that it's all true. There are many creepy moments. This isn't, thankfully, a gore-fest, nor does it have you jumping totally out of your seat, but it does get you on the edge of it on a regular basis. And for once, CG effects complemented the film, because at least you don't have to worry about cruelty to animals any more...hopefully! My one criticism is that it seemed to me to deliberately leave a big opening for a sequel.

243,kevjfarrell,Didn't live up to the hype!,5,24 August 2015,"Maybe I'm just getting old and have seen too many horror movies through my lifetime, but this one failed to impress me.It was very formulaic - tension in the right places, and times that made you jump, but that doesn't make a good horror story. I am a fan of this genre but feel this one offers nothing new. Even the acting performances weren't particularly notable.I am quite capable of suspending belief for the sake of a good horror movie, but saying that, some of the reactions to certain situations just didn't add up for me. There were too many flaws - style over substance. It might have more appeal to younger people who haven't seen a huge selection of the horror genre yet. I really would like to be more complimentary - sorry!",The Ring
244,Anyanwu,Please get ahold of the original.,7,8 November 2002,"There are not many cases in anything that where a copy/remake is as good as the original. The main reason I think is that the original gives you an experience that you never had before. That is why I would be tainted haven seen the original Ring. Ebay rules! (Don't get me started on Battle Royale.) The thrill is gone, somewhat.  I will say this about this American version. I was suprised that it stayed with the slow buildup of the original movie. It did not try to get really exciting until it was necessary. I think it is hard to get an audience to stay with a film when it has such a buildup, especially post slasher quick fright films, like Halloween,Friday 13th, Nightmare.. Scream etc. The 10's are reserved for the Rosemary's Babys, Exorcist and the like. This movie is not in that category. But there are 2 aspects that are. 1. Rick Baker is a bitch. The little that you saw of his work in this movie substantiates his title as best in horror make up. 2. The music by Hans Zimmer was mesmorizing. It was in the same league as Tubular Bells of the Exorcist.  It was so good, I stayed, as I usually do anyway until the end of the credits, just to hear the music; I mean that was just f**king scary. I will be buying the soundtrack",The Ring
245,MagicMurderFan,Ok movie,4,31 December 2019,"After rewatch, still a solid creeper. Beyond that annoyed that somehow a definition of a unique, intelligent child translates, into a disrespectful brat, by calling his mother Rachel and ordering her around. Doesn't make you unique, it makes you a dysfunctional family. Kid is in charge, hard pass. I'm a laid back parent, but it almost makes you want Samara to kill them.

246,Phantasm01,Sorry but it sucks,2,10 May 2006,"This film is a waste of time.That said, the first ten minutes are extraordinary. Nicely shot, creepy, beautifully paced, and well acted. The only other ray of hope for this film was the first time we see one of Samara's victims (the blonde in the closet! Holy crap! I sure didn't see THAT coming in the theater!), but other than that this film tries and fails to repeat the aura of the first ten minutes for an couple of hours. Most of it is just too ridiculous. The horse scene, the electrocution scene, the final TV scene - nothing works. It's just not good. The horse/ferry scene is uneccessary, really just a lame attempt to be disturbing. The electrocution scene is too drawn out and implausible (this is a movie about ghosts coming out of TVs - for a shot to not work in it because it's too fantastic is really something!).This film almost works, or would have, if it ended after our heroine solved the mystery of the tape. ""Wow,"" I said to myself in the theater as Naomi Watts and her beau walked off into the night, ""They really tried some interesting stuff in that movie. Not all of it worked, but at least they tried."" Then the film kept going. ""Wait,"" I asked myself, ""Why aren't they rolling credits?"" Then it dawned on me that the movie was about to nosedive. I distinctly remember saying ""No good can come of this."" aloud, referring to the decision to not end the film. Obviously, I was horrendously disappointed. After seeing Creepy Little Hospitalized Girl Samara, Soggy Vicious Undead Samara was silly. The whole set-piece where Noah dies is totally predictable (right down to him tripping over something), Samara isn't scary, and removing frames of film to make movement jerky isn't frightening - it's headache inducing. God-awful ending to a god-awful movie.",The Ring

The acting isn't bad, Naomi Watts could have been a little bit better but she was good, the kid was creepy but at times I thought at times he was trying to be like Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense. The script was also underwritten in areas, not much but a little bit. In the end the movie doesn't end up making alot of sense. You still don't know who made the tape, but that might be explained in a sequel or a prequel. Overall, a very creepy movie that kept me entertained all the way and in my opinion one of the best movies of 2002.",The Ring
248,boondocksaint20,All about the chilling after effect,8,30 May 2003,"This movie is one of the best horror films made in a long time.  I have not yet seen Ringu, but I will in time.  Basically, this remake of the Japenese version, is more creepy than 'scary'...it doesn't have a lot of jump out of your seat moments, but the real fear stems from the chilling after effect. I watched this late one night, in the dark, and I thought it was pretty good, though not as good as I had heard, until I saw the end...all I will say is that the movie ends, and then it doesn't...kind of like The Sixth Sense.  I found the final 20 minutes to be incredibly exciting, and the end to leave a profound feeling of 'huh'?  You really have to watch the movie more than once to understand all of the story, I still don't understand a few things, but I've heard there will be two more sequels coming out, so hopefully they will shed some light on the mystery.Anyway, the next day was when I got creeped out by the movie...it may not scare you that much once you watch it, but if you start to think about it (and if you have a tv in your room), you may think otherwise.Overall, one of the better horror films to come out, though I don't really think it should be classified as a horror film.  There are some parts that could have been done better, IMHO, but otherwise, you have a pretty solid film with good acting and great suspense.  I recommend this one, but remember, this is more psychological than 'scary'.  8/10 stars.",The Ring
249,DogFilmCritic,Why do I enjoy this movie so much,8,20 February 2017,"The ring a remake done right, in the root of the death of a niece, Rachel ( Naomi Watts) investigates the story behind a mysterious and cursed videotape, which causes death in seven days of those who have seen it. The cursed objects are something that have been in the history of humanity since forever from jewelry, dolls,cars ,houses etc. fiscal objects created to torment the unfortunate who encounter them, the idea of ​​a videotape so accessible and habitual in our modern lives that passes unnoticed and harmless arousing the curiosity to see whats taped inside, a kind of curse attached to whoever puts it, is equally fascinating as terrible and at the time quite original.Gore Verbinski is truly a master of suspense, It doesn't rely on jump scares (and those that are there are rear but very effective), and it has some truly disturbing imagery that is not just filmed at random, but carefully chosen to mess with your head. It's nearly subconscious in how it consistently disturbs you. It's truly an example of great horror direction.﻿ I could make a list of bad examples but just using One Missed Call is enough, the U.S. remake ( it was terrible and completely missed the point ).﻿ It takes time, skill and effort to make film stand out specially in the horror genre.There's supposed to be a parallel between the two children (Aiden and Samara) Aiden is supposed to mirror Samara and some sort of psychic connection betwee them. The overall theme of the story is parental neglect. At the start Rachael is a somewhat negligent parent and is ignoring her sons emotional problems. By the end she's shown taking more interest in him after learning about Samara and her backstory.Also, the twist isn't that Samara is purely evil, it's that she wants to spread her story to everyone who dares to watch the video, to experience her suffer. The thing that makes this movie so complex is they had to keep a balance between Samara being sympathetic and menacing at the same time thus making her a tormentor, is a horror film after all, and she is the villain no matter if she is a little girl making her a more disturbing foe ,If they made it explicit that Samara's visions were just from her death (and hence not of her making) then that makes her too much the victim, and would detract from the terror of her climactic scene. Overall the film is worth the watch, the camera lenses used a sea water color giving the movie a cold vibe. I definitely recommend it as a horror movie with great acting and a solid story to keep you on your sit.",The Ring
250,deadsenator,Good suspense. Above average film. - 6 of 10,6,6 August 2003,"I enjoyed this film.  It has it's share of faults, but overall it was okay. I vacillate between a 5 and a 6, but I'll give the film the edge because I liked the surrealism throughout.  The dialogue was almost poor in areas, but I can overlook that.

251,muons,Typical horror flick,5,1 April 2018,"The movie must certainly be a feast for the eyes of horror film lovers with all its tension and suspense. However, it can't escape the cliches by touching all the twisted imagination buttons ever created throughout the movie history. As a person who has done with supernatural crap long time ago, I expected some intelligence after seeing Naomi Watts on the cast. Indeed, she was the reason for me to spare some time for this genre but the end result was total disappointment. The part involving the research about Anne Morgan looked promising for a while but towards the finale, nails coming off the walls by themselves, a zombie girl climbing out of a well and then coming out of a CRT screen to scare people to death... Those were all too much occults marring a flimsy story which was struggling to be coherent up to that moment anyway. I also read that the director initially wanted to avoid big names from the cast with the idea of movie being discovered by itself (well, if you believe it...) Sorry for dashing your dreams pal, but this is just another run off the mill horror flick who'd never find this much success but for Watts. As for the movie itself, the storytelling is patchy and lacks cohesion. Some reviewers complain about the lack of character development but I guess this would be too much to expect from a horror movie, anyhow. I should finally give the director some credit that by using blood and gore sparingly, he acted wisely enough to jack up the creepiness level a notch high.",The Ring
252,Raleon,Pretty much inferior to the original (may contain small spoilers),6,2 June 2003,"Many people like this movie better than the original, or hate it and still think it's made better. I'll give it the same those people gave it- they prefer it because: 1) The story line is more thought out.2) The effects are better in consequence to it being thought out more. For example, the victims rot as if being in the well. 3) After the deaths the movie cuts as if it was the end of the video, whereas the original had photograph negatives which many people found to be corny. I on the other hand, though I liked the remake's touch better, didn't find anything wrong with using the negative's effect. It rather suited the original.         If it weren't for such strange mutations of the storyline, I might agree this was the rare case in which the Hollywood remake was better than it's original. But the deal with the horses (especially the one jumping off the boat) didn't live up to it's original. There's no sign of a supernatural superstitious force, which makes the original much creepier. You don't know anything of the girl's father, and the mother was now talking english to her horse instead of another language to the girl's real father (from what I understood of it). So Samara just comes out as a normal angst ridden pre-adolescent who causes trouble. You don't see the hidden connection to the supernatural power which made her able to attack her victems through a video and make them suffer as she did.         And apart from that, the acting wasn't all that well either. The people were rude and unbearable (I'm certain not everyone acts this way in America). Part of the problem has to do with the dialogue. I'm sure Rachel wasn't meant to sound so rude when she said ""Excuse me, but what the hell are you talking about?"". She seems to catch on easily to the other clues in her way, surely she would be smart enough to catch on to what that woman was saying. In the original, her ex-husband gave her the clues. In this one he is just there and does very little.  You can't feel; the tension between him and his son either. Instead they talk about it- one of the faults of American acting. You should know what's going on by watching, not hearing.           But the worse thing is the failing attempts at comic release which certainly had no place in the film. Running with the hose and falling is one example. It just made the whole thing seem stupid.",The Ring

There's nothing scary about blood and gore. (I've seen plenty, so why be scared?) What's scary is the situation--when your TV turns itself on and you see something that makes you wet your pants. That's scary.And that's ""The Ring"". You could call ""The Ring"" a ghost story, and that would be fair, but instead of starting out showing us the ghost, the movie builds up suspense by first showing us what the ghost is capable of, then why the ghost is so angry. After we understand this, then and only then do we see the ghost. This creates an understanding in our mind of what this thing is going to do. So when we see it, we scare ourselves.You see, the scariest stories involve the mundane (like televisions and video tapes). They take the things we see everyday and ask, ""What if..."" This bypasses our rationality because we accept the plausibility of the scenario. And when a person can't think rationally, it doesn't take much to terrify them.Psychology 101.

Lets get it out of the way, it's not the traumatising masterwork that the hype would have you believe. That being said, I really enjoyed this film. This was my first experience with The Ring and I have to say it is extremely entertaining. This is a film full of interesting set-up's for scares and great set-pieces, at points I found myself more impressed with the visual aesthetic than scared by the subject matter. There are a handful for pretty great scares as well, personal favourite moments include Naomi Watts puling the fly out of the TV, the horse jumping of the boat and Brain Cox appearing behind Watts when she discovers the second tape. These moments are genuinely tense and visually unique. I feel I need to talk about the ending however, the last 20 minutes are the reason that this movie is so iconic. The revel that Samara had been evil all along is perfect after the slightly cheesy ""helping her"" sequence in the well. The shot of Samara climbing out of the TV is burned into everyone's subconscious who has ever seen this movie.It's not at terrifying as the hype makes it out to be but it is really entertaining. A great start to Halloween!",The Ring
256,evilmatt-3,The best horror film to come along in years,9,13 October 2002,"After enduring horror film after horror film from the 90's that paraded senseless violence and vacuous plots, I was severely concerned about the health of the genre.  From the late 90's until today, it's been even worse: we have films like _The Sixth Sense_ and _Frailty_ which purport to be intelligent but are little more than cheap cinematic jack-in-the-boxes that shout ""Boo!"" at the end.  Keeping that in mind, my standards for a horror film these days have been correspondingly low.  Now, along comes _The Ring_, and all that is blown away.Not only does this film have a fantastic story (for once, EVER, we have a ghost story that EXPLAINS the ghost's activity), but the acting is first rate.  The casting of Watts, whose intensity was integral to the success of _Mullholland Drive_, is nothing short of genius.  Such talent in a horror film is risky, but pays off in the emotional punch and urgency of Watt's performance.And of course, this movie would be almost laughable without the right look. Every person involved with the visuals audio here took the utmost care to get it in sync with the emotional tone of the film.  The result is that unlike _Rosemary's Baby_ or similar films, you never get a break from the mounting tension and sense of doom surrounding Rachel Keller.  Very effective.This should be a lesson to everyone involved with _Scream_, _The Sixth Sense_, _Frailty_, _I Know What You Did Last Summer_, and all that other crap: WE ARE ADULTS IN THE AUDIENCE.  WE CAN HANDLE IT IF YOU MAKE A FILM THAT IS ARTFUL AND REQUIRES THOUGHT.  Of course, this one has a surprising ending too, but (horror of horrors) it actually makes sense and clears up some earlier ambiguities in the movie that the movie goer had thought resolved (which, Mr. M. Night, is how surprise endings are supposed to work.)If you like scary movies, this is a must-see.  One thing though: don't go to the theater and then scream like a little girl every time something scary happens.

The little boy whoever his name was did a pretty good job too. I thought at first he was a culkin brother, but turns out he is not. He looks like he could be one of them.

Maybe I ought to blame it on my own selection of movies. But I realized that horror movies can have a deep and a decent story line after seeing The Ring.The Ring is an adaptation of the Japanese movie Ringu. Ringu is a well respected horror movie. Rather than call The Ring as an adaptation I would prefer calling it as an improvisation of Ringu. For I have seen both movies and in my personal opinion the producers of The Ring have made the story a bit deeper and of course with the music and special effects scarier.A particular thing worth mentioning is the work done by the child actor David Dorfman (playing the role of Aidan). My personal opinion is that he has done a very good job. And Ehren Kruger, in his script for the movie has given a major role to Aidan as opposed to lesser important role given to Aidan's Japanese counterpart.Full credit to the Ring's makers for a very fine adaptation of the original Ringu. And yes, a small word of advice for those who have not seen the real Daveigh Chase (playing Samara). After seeing this movie, do look up on the net for a picture of hers and make the comparison!

Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger move the setting to Seattle and the San Juan Islands, which Verbinski films in gorgeous, washed-out grays and greens occasionally punctuated by sunlight and blood, both of which are used sparingly. The effect is to make the film seem almost black & white, like the videocassette recording that kills you a week after you watch it. Naomi Watts leads a superb cast as the journalist investigating the unexplained death of her niece and perfectly combines both the grit and determination of an intrepid reporter and the growing fear and desperation of a mother trying to protect her child from a malevolent force she can't completely grasp.

There are definitely some very scary scenes such as the opening scene and when Samara comes out of the TV, but the film is really about trying to crack the curse. The fact that the main character, Rachel, only has seven days to break the curse adds an extra level of tension. ""The Ring"" also has great acting from the entire cast, and the cinematography is amazing. This really isn't the sort of movie that resorts to jump scares and excessive gore to scare the audience; it's all about tension and atmosphere.

We don't know how you'll die, but from what we've seen on previous victims, it's not going to be pretty and The Ring effectively uses this to build dread and tension throughout the film.

But not enough to compensate for the rest.
Personally, Ringu is better. Granted, it's only about as scary as this, so slightly to mild, but it does a better job of explaining things, and the lead charcters don't seem to be quite as stupid. Also, it doesn't involve the death of a horse, which just bothered me with The Ring, though it made sense later.Still, it was a good movie - just not that scary.",The Ring

I just recently saw it with some friends. My best friend was in my same boat. He saw it at the same age. We both had trouble going to sleep afterwords. Although I liked the movie during both viewings I enjoyed it more the second time. Great acting from Naomii Watts (female protagonist; Rachel) and David Dorfman (her son; Aiden). The Ring starts off with a very dismal atmosphere, and it increases as the movie goes on. This is what makes it so scary. It has a continual mood of doom, quite unlike any other movie I've ever seen. Samara Morgan (antagonist) is absolutely horrifying. She scared me very much during both viewings. But what scared me the most was....just the face of her first victim. Overall, this is a very effectively scary movie, it's almost too effective. Some people think it's boring, but I don't really understand that. I think it is gripping, just the way it counts down the seven days. With each passing day the suspense increases. It's like this certain doom destined to happen. One which is hard to turn away from.

But still, Mouse Hunt wasn´t the kind of a movie that would make its director a top director in the world of cinema.I´ve never bothered to watch the Mexican because it simply doesn´t interest me. I don´t remember when I first heard about the Ring, but when I read all the positive reviews I knew this was a film I didn´t want to miss. And when the movie opened in Finland some weeks ago I went to see it with my friends. And I was so glad that I catched the movie during its cinema run.The Ring is a movie that shouldn´t be watched in daylight. The best place to see it is a theatre with lots of people. If you watch it home, wait until its dark and then play the movie. And if you have a home theatre system the experience will be even better. This is a creepy movie that will scare you at least a couple of times.I´ve never been a fan of ""horror"" films like Friday the 13th or Nightmare On Elm Street. I enjoy creepy ghost stories like What Lies Beneath, the Sixth Sense, Poltergeist etc. Horror is a very difficult genre because you can easily cross the line between being scary and being funny. Take Thir13een Ghost, for example. I couldn´t even watch the whole movie because of its stupidity. That film didn´t give me any creeps at all. But luckily every now and then a good creepy movie comes out of Hollywood and the Ring is such a movie. I was very impressed by the movie´s autumnal style, dark atmosphere and performances. You rarely see memorable performances in this kind of movies.It´ll be interesting to see what Gore Verbinski´s next movie will be like. Hopefully it´ll be something as memorable as the Ring.",The Ring
274,remember_the_daze,Possibly the most scariest movie I have seen.,10,25 October 2002,"The Ring is by far more scary then any other movie I have seen. It was so scary I nearly cried. I defently reccomend this for ages 12 and up because it WOULD defently frighten young children. The Ring is nothing like The Others because this movie has more plot into it, though The Others was brilliant. My main point is The Ring takes a lot of concentration to understand it. The scary scenes are brilliant and frightening. Plus you even laugh after you get scared. See it soon. My Take: 10/10My MPAA rating: PG-13 for intense horrific terror content including disturbing images, and for some non-relevent language.",The Ring
275,campblood13,Horrible remake!,4,8 March 2003,"Having seen the original Ringu film, I was very happy to rent this it's first week out.  Having heard from friends how it scared them so bad, and how it was a good film, I had to see it.  How disappointed I was with the regular bland american studio produced crap it turned out to be.  With Gore V. directing I should have known, he would sell his mama if the studio's told him to.  This remake is so slow and pointless that it makes the original look so much better.  All of Naomi Watts' character's findings come to her very easily.  Maybe she is Columbo's daughter the way she solves this mystery.In the Ringu version the story unfolds slowly, but realisticly.  The actual video that you watch and will die for, is much more scary in the Jap version.  To much CGI and rip offs make for a bad time.  I guess the ending is what most people talk about.  I felt that the ending in the american version was forced upon us very quickly to the point where it wasn't even scary.  The Ringu version has a great scary ending, that will make you stop breathing (at least for a few seconds).  The biggest difference is the explanation of what's going on.  The Ring confuses people because it is a bad movie, period.There are 3 Ringu movies from Japan.  Ringu 2 is not that good, but decent. I think they used a few things from part 2 in the american Ring.  Ringu 0, which is a prequel might even be better or at least as good as the original Ringu.  Be sure to get ahold of Ringu 0, it is available on Ebay with subtitles.  Ringu has been available as well, even though Dreamworks just released it on Friday, to cash in some more.  Why does this movie have such a high rating?  Let's get with the program people.",The Ring

However, it did have both frightening and disturbing images in it that will stick in your mind. Naomi Watts was great in 'Mulholland Drive' and her performance in this movie was pretty good too. There were also great performances in this movie by a lot of unknowns, who I think will be seen in more movies to come.

278,Nigel St. Buggering,"Finally, some real horror films",10,4 November 2002,"Actual horror has become a lost art lately, probably drowned in the flood of teen slasher flicks with pop soundtracks.  It's become the norm that horror movies are out to make you laugh rather than scare you, as if the filmmakers don't want to be seen taking it seriously.  As happened when it was time to save the American action film, Hollywood looked to Asia, and here we have a remake of a Japanese film which has already seen a remake in Korea.I'd seen the other two before walking in on this version, so perhaps I'm not qualified to talk about whether the plot is inventive or surprising, being intimately familiar with the story already.  What I can say is that this version stacks up very favorably.  Whether consciously or not, it has taken some of the most interesting elements of both version, and added in a few little twists of its own.  The backstory has been fleshed out a bit more extensively as well.  The look of the film is excellent, using a washed-out, desaturated color pallette to create an oppressive tone (admittedly not difficult in Seattle in the winter).  Director Verbinski (director of MOUSEHUNT?!) does excellent work, allowing scenes to play out slowly, refusing to generate false excitement with jarring editing tricks like most modern horror directors.The bottom line, of course, is ""Is it scary?"".  Well, I knew every turn of the plot right up to the end, and it still had me nervous, creeped out, and on the edge of my seat.  This is a perfect horror film, a thing we see all too little of these days.  If you have any fondness for the genre, you must see this film, and let Hollywood know that this is how it should be done.",The Ring

The ending, although scary, is very satisfying, and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. The Ring is a million times better than its cheesy sequel, The Ring Two. I loved this film, I must have watched it a million times after I bought it on DVD. My parents kept asking ""Didn't you just watch that?"" And I did. Over and over.

The way the Japanese movie was filmed was relatively simple but very effective in overall effects.Don't get me wrong, the prequel and sequel of the Japanese ""The Ring"" did not strike me as being better in any way to the original.

I'll admit at the beginning I was like weeing myself thinking it was going to be really scary. Then as the film carried on it just didn't get scary. I mean it was scarier than the likes of paranormal activity (absolutely shockingly bad) but it wasn't great. I thought that it was very clever when you see all the things that were linked into the film. I was really shocked to find out that it was the actually the mum who killed her. I think the ending was silly when she found her in the well and she came back to life and killed that guy. It did freak me out a little when she found the girl in the cupboard but overall I would give The Ring 6.5/10, it is a good film with a clever story-line and is okay for ages 13+.",The Ring

When the girls heard the phone rang and they were spooked to get it and later found out it was her parent, I was about to leave the cinema. The rest of the movie was just a thriller investigation of what 'the ring' is.
I have never feel so strong negatively in my opinions towards a movie before, but this is the first one. (Not even towards Eight Legged Freaks) I thought it was really a waste of my time and degrading my intelligence.

The director makes some very poor choices which help kill the suspense that he worked hard to build. The scene with the firehose is a perfect example. Another complaint I had is the way the actors speak to one another in no way resembles the tone of voice that people use in real life. The kid - Capt. Melodrama - was the worst offender. Lastly, the script needed more work. (SPOILER ALERT ON) What happens if you watch the tape and there isn't a phone around? Also the phone always JUST HAPPENS to ring after the tape was watched, usually it was just a fake-out. The used this too many times. My big question: what time period was the little girl living in? The costumes certainly make this very unclear. Another question: how did the women know that failing down the well or watching the other tape wasn't what broke the curse? I think it would have been interesting if there was an anti-tape. (SPOILER ALERT OFF) I gave the movie a 4/10. Enjoy it for what it's worth and forget it.",The Ring
285,stargunner,Let's get one thing straight! The Ring does its job.,10,28 January 2005,"For those of you who feel all high and mighty because you've seen Ringu and think it's better than The Ring, how would you like to know that The Ring is not even based on Ringu! If some of you would do some simple research or at least watch the other films that have come before The Ring, you'll see that a Japanese film named Ring Virus (or Ring) is almost identical to The Ring, far more so than Ringu. Ringu has a lot of differences in comparison to The Ring, but Ring Virus and The Ring share a virtually identical plot and characters.And at that, i'd like to say they are both superb films! The Ring does a great job at what it's supposed to do - scare the **** out of you. It's a psychological thriller and provides a compelling enough story to drag you in if you let it. As for some of the cultural translations needed to make Samara - a character that is shrouded in Japanese folklore and phenomena - truly horrifying, I think the American version couldn't have done a better job. While some give The Ring the cold shoulder with questions and confusion, I think it's important to come to movies like this expecting things you shouldn't be able to understand or ask questions about. It's called imagination. Suspended disbelief.And if you're really that curious about how Samara can make images appear on videotapes or make phone calls from a well, you can look into it for yourself.The best thing about The Ring is the more you watch it, the more fascinating and terrifying it really is.",The Ring

I have to disagree with people who have said it relied on run of the mill scare techniques. The story was compelling. I was sure that the video was going to be some mish mash of unexplained ambiguous crap meant only to scare and disgust the audience. Instead it's like a map of clues, albeit deadly ones. They didn't come right out and mention psychic photography, but that is what I believe it was. You see that when they show the negatives from her file. In the beginning, the teenager says they put a tape in that was supposed to have been football. Instead a bunch of strange images appear. These were images from the ghost of a girl capable of psychic photography. That was compelling in and of itself. The reporter follows the visual clues which lead her to the body of the girl and you assume that once she's peacefully buried it will all be over. This is what most ghost movies end up being. I was sitting there thinking...why would she kill innocent people...when the woman's son drops the bomb about ""why did you let her out of the dark place you weren't supposed to"". A lot of people haven't understood why her son had to make a copy or why she lived because she did. It's simple she gave the girl a victim, her son's father. The chilling part was the question the boy posed of ""What happens to the person we show the video too?"" Theoretically the cycle can end by the woman being smart enough to say. Hey watch this and make a copy of it....etc etc. I was uneasy after watching it, but not terrified. It's well worth watching.",The Ring

Unlike some movies, this movie is actually creepy an may upset some with weak stomachs ( just ask my ex-wife, it creeped her out!.Naomi Watts, the lead actress in the movie, played the part of Rachel, a reporter and a single mother trying to cope with a young son named Aidan who's mental age is well higher then his actual age.

Although ""The Ring"" has one of my favourite actresses in it, don't see it. Naomi Watts is terrific in so many ways and very convincing as Rachel. Still, the movie should not be seen. It's terrible! I do think that either the director or the writers knew about Luis Bun~uel and Salvador Dali's ""Andalusian Dog"" because the video tape that Rachel is told not to see, but sees anyway, seems very much modeled on that early surrealist film. ""Andalusian Dog"" (1929) has its ants, while the video within ""The Ring"" has its fly.""The Ring"" is the scariest ghost movie you'll ever see, which is why you shouldn't see it. It ranks up there with my favourite FRANKENSTEIN-themed film, ""The Fly"". In terms of ""The Ring""'s fright potential, it is unequaled. It's well acted, well scripted and the music assists foreboding mood, rather than getting in the way.""The Ring"" could have been titled: ""Sleepless Around Seattle"". Calling it, ""The Ring"" gives it a Wagnerian tone. But no, this ring heralds a phone call. You pick up the receiver and some insomniac child from a 'village of the damned' will tell you that you only have seven days to live because you watched her personal ""Un chien andalou"".

292,afrodome,"""seven days..""",8,12 April 2018,"The Ring (2002) is a rare example of a remake that supercedes its predecessor. The combined elements of cinematography, character development, and special fx make for a movie that deserves acclaim amongst other classic genre flicks like Alien, The Exorcist and Let the Right One In. The scares are scarce, but that's what makes them so great. They never rely on a loud 'bang' sound to force its audience to react but rather used the ominous sounds of reverberated violin strings and the 'white noise' of a radio channel with no signal. Naomi Watts proves once again that she is one of the toughest actresses in Hollywood and still to this day is a true 'underdog' of the industry.While I didn't find it as scary as most fans did (I can understand why it scared them), the mood is genuine and consistent throughout the film; depressing and bleak, whilst not feeling too 'cold' or nihilistic, there's a heart at the center of all the grim Seattle fog. I saw Ringu as well, and found the 'medium/psychic elements made it feel more folklore/soap-opera and didn't fee grounded enough to engage me one hundred percent. The Ring pulls all the punches and delivers a better story arc, more fleshed out characters, and creepier imagery, and not to mention one of the most gorgeous production designs of any film in recent memory.

The writer of this story is up in the ranks of Stephen King.The actors were great, especially since this is the first movie I've seen them all in. That little girl is the creepiest thing in the world.What I like most about this movie is that it actually scares you. Unlike other supernatural movies (which usually end up as plotless gory bloodbaths), this one has a story, and scares the living feces out of you.This movie also plays with your mind a little bit, which is always good in a movie like this.The video sequence was the most disturbing thing in the movie. There's something about black and white freaky images that really engraves them into your mind.One thing I know. From now on, my entertainment comes from DVDs.

My only two complaints ***SPOILERS*** are 1) that the annoying psychic kid didn't mention that he knew what his mom and dad were supposed to do, so of course, they screwed up and (understandably) did the wrong thing, making you think it was a typical ""lay your bones to rest"" type ghost story, when in fact it was infinitely more sinister; and 2) that the real reason everyone hated and feared the ghost girl was never really explained. Otherwise, this is a perfect movie. Parents should avoid taking young children to see this (2 such families got up and walked out halfway through when I saw it, LOL), because the kids will have nightmares for weeks or months after seeing this film!

Each scene is one suspense master after the next.A great thing about this movie is the fact that there is actually some thought in it.  The plot advances as the film goes, which is usually unlikely in horror movies and to my surprise this film did not base its scares on gore (for the most part).I have heard some people compare this movie to this years earlier release FEARDOTCOM.  This movie is nothing like FEARDOTCOM and to compare it to such a horribly made movie is an insult.  THE RING takes the audience and while proving to be an effectively scary movie, it really keeps you interested from start to finish.My only complaint about this movie is that there are a lot of questions that were never answered, or things that just did not make sense.  The movie ends with a great compilation scene however, you realize that there are a lot of holes that did not fill.

It was downright creepy. Very creepy. It's important to understand the difference between ""scary"" and ""creepy"". Scary can be accomplished in a matter of seconds (someone jumping out from behind a wall with a knife). Creepy is something that takes a while to accomplish in a film. It takes a long time on the part of the director. It requires more attention and time on the part of the viewer. This film managed to accomplish creepy very well. It reminded me of the older generation of horror films, which managed to grab you in a way that was very psychological (""The Omen"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and of course ""The Exorcist""). Those types of horror are the ones that always stick with me. They are the ones that endure.

Nice soundtrack work, quick cuts, disturbing images, just enough revelation, kept the world feeling just a little off, and a little creepy.Unfortunately, not much happened, and what you had was a movie long on atmosphere, but almost boringly devoid of chills.

Excellent pacing, visually hypnotic, tight tight plot, surreal atmosphere. It's right up there with Psycho and exorcist.OK, maybe it does have a some weaknesses. Maybe it depends a bit too much on built-in Hollywood horror mythology. It doesn't explain a lot, or offer any kind of substantive framework for how this happens. I mean this is all in the mind, in the realm of ghosts and psychic stuff. I mean, it works, and very well, but it could never happen.Really, horror movies like Psycho are better, because that could have actually happened.This movie is just way out there in ghostland.But the visual effect is simply tour de force stuff. A beautiful movie. Not all THAT original, like I said--in a way it depends on a huge framework of Hollywood horror clichés. But the visual world is alluring.

I'm giving no spoilers away here, but the ending was a bit anticlimactic, and the final explanation wasn't that great.

303,ivony,"YES! Finally a GOOD ""scary movie""!",8,27 May 2003,"There are scary movies that are your typical no-brainers with silly little plots that really don't drive the movie, but rather hinder it.  These movies are purely for fun and not so much for mulling over at the water-cooler on Monday.  Then there are those scary movies that make you think...question...and ponder.  The Ring is definitely the latter.The premise:  there exists a video tape that when you watch it, you have seven days before you ""see the ring"" (ie: die).  Sounds silly enough...at least I thought so upon seeing the previews.  I will happily admit I was wrong since The Ring turned out to be one of the best scary movies I've seen in years.  The acting was well done on all accounts, right down to young David Dorfman as the Keller's young son, Aidan.  The imagery is incredibly freaky and was enough to make me sleep with a light on (Not something that happens very often, mind you, having seen about every horror movie I could lay my eyes on).  The plot was good enough without the standard ""cheese"" associated with most scary movies.  I like a movie that can make you think!If you're into a movie that holds your hand throughout and gives you a neat, tidy little explanation in the last thirty minutes or so, this movie is not for you.  Oh, don't get me wrong, it DOES give you answers; but it makes you think for them.  With subtle innuendos, imagery, and whispers of conversation, the viewer is able to decipher Samara's message and the overall ""meaning"" of this thrilling ghost story.  And while attempting to understand Samara's message, she will scare the bejeebers out of you.Honestly, a very good ghost story with few ""plot holes"" (regardless of what other reviews might state...there really ARE explanations).  Overall, The Ring deserves a 9 out of 10...not quite the BEST, but quite close.",The Ring
304,diztorted,Sweet and pretty version of the Japanese shocker,8,2 November 2002,"Well, being a big fan of the original, I didn't know what to think about an American remake being made. I thought all the usual stuff you might think when a remake of one of your favorite movies is made... ""It'll never be as good as the original"" ""I'm sure they'll change tons of stuff to Americanize it"" etc, etc. Well now that I've finally seen it, the answer is yes and no.Yes, now we have a prettier version of the film and the story. For one thing, we have gorgeous Australian beauty Naomi Watts and her incredible big blue eyes, and even Samara (American version of Sadaku) is a little pretty little girl who can either charm you or kill you. But that is understandable, is America for Christ sake, you have to make everything pretty. For the most, the photography and the editing were just a little above average. And the horror scenes if not utterly excessive were faithful remakes of the originals. At the end, it reinforced the opinion the original gave me of television.For those who might not know by now, the story centers around a journalist who is investigating certain videotape that kills whoever sees it within a period of 7 days. So, she has only a week to find how to solve the mystery before she also dies under the curse of the video. Vengeance, despair, and children misunderstanding form part of what might as well become a new cult hit or one heck of a good contender for the golden raspberry.
Now, the bad parts ***possible spoilers***. This is easy, since it is always more feasible to trash a movie than raise what is good about it. It is known that when a remake of anything is made, part of the deal is to change what you might consider not necessary or add something to improve the so called narrative. In this case, they tried to make the plot ""fool proof""; I can't stand that even for the slightest little detail there has to be a sometimes stupid explanation or flashback and never leaving anything to the imagination, which sometimes is more frightening than actual visual aids (remember the Blair Witch?), and that is one of the beauties of the original, the mixture of suggestion versus visualization. And for the plot itself, the changes they made of the origins of Samara's evil were not convincing at all, I liked it better when Sadaku was more like a vengeance for what her mother suffered, over here is just a bad spawn.Overall I liked it, when the final climax came, my heart beat increased, and when I least expected it, I was at the edge of my seat even though I knew what was going to happen, and that shows how well it works.",The Ring
305,Extraordinary_Machine,"Gore Verbinski never lets 'The Ring' breathe on its own like Hideo Nakata did with the original, which leaves the film floundering in a well of largely wasted potential...",6,5 May 2005,"The Ring Rachel Keller (a decent Naomi Watts) is a reporter who, while working on an article about an urban legend involving a videotape that kills whomever watches it, starts to investigate the unexplained sudden death of her niece, Katie (Amber Tamblyn). Rachel is understandably reluctant to buy into the rumour, and as soon as she finds the tape down at a holiday cabin where Katie and her friends stayed a week before they all died, she watches it without hesitation. But then the phone rings, and Rachel discovers just how much truth there is behind the talk after all. Now, she has just seven days to live, and with the help of her ex-husband, Noah (Martin Henderson, acting far too cocky), Rachel must delve deep into the mysterious origins of the tape, before it threatens to destroy her.Considering how many previous incarnations of Kôji Suzuki's 'Ring' universe there are, it's quite surprising that America didn't try to pull off their own adaptation of this story earlier. The very first part of this saga was originally brought to the big screen in 1998's 'Ring'. Directed by then-unknown Japanese filmmaker Hideo Nakata, 'Ring' was a masterpiece of the horror genre, and its runaway box office success helped to set a trend for the dozens of slow-burning thrillers to come out of Asia in the last few years, including its own remake from Korea ('Ring Virus'). So, with the benefit of hindsight, Hollywood producers have also cleverly chosen to translate Nakata's take on 'Ring' for native multiplex audiences. Their choice of director, however, is not as sharp, as they have recruited Gore Verbinski to replicate Nakata's subtle hand. But, as the presence of 'Mousehunt' on his filmography shows, ""subtle"" is not a word that first comes to mind when thinking about this inexperienced filmmaker.Verbinski, a former director of music videos and commercials (I'll refrain from using the word ""hack""), is by no means a complete lost cause in the world of 'The Ring'. Armed with tens of millions of dollars, Verbinski is free to design the film's visual and sound schemes with impressive precision, even more so than Nakata did with the original. Every frame of this film has something to keep itself moving along, with the omnipresent greyish green tones adding an interesting flare to the opening sequence. But they remain on the screen throughout the whole running time, and only serve to distract the audience from Rachel's Nancy Drew-style investigations in and around dreary Seattle. There's also some unneeded editing tricks (such as brief flashes of ""the ring"" between scenes) that really do recall Verbinski's music video past, and, disappointingly, a couple of equally cheap ""boo"" moments, which siphon off much of the tension and pace that 'The Ring' should have been made of, and that the original had in spades. Granted, Nakata could easily be accused of some of these tactics, but at least he used them in all the right places. Verbinski never lets 'The Ring' breathe on its own like Nakata did, which leaves the film floundering in a well of largely wasted potential.Even worse, some parts of the film are touched up with expensive special effects in place of the grimy, practical realness of the original. It's never a good thing when CGI draws attention to itself, particularly during the film's climax, which was so unrelentingly terrifying in the original, but here feels forcibly rushed and artificial. In fact, everything about 'The Ring' is far too dressed up with Hollywood production values, when simplicity was the key to making the first 'Ring' so unsettling. Call me a purist of the original if you must, but whose idea was it to give 'The Ring' to a man whose only truly inventive moment was when he created the Budweiser frogs? The script, by Ehren Kruger ('Scream 3'), shows as much promise, but this goes down the drain with the direction. Kruger elects to completely revise the background of Sadako (renamed Samara for this remake), and I welcomed these tweaks, as they would keep the unfolding mystery interesting even for those who already knew how things would turn out. The downside comes when Kruger feels the need to explain everything, from what the film's title means, to why the tape waits seven days to kill. There are even some small lines of ""comic"" relief present in 'The Ring', which seem entirely out of place considering the mood the film is trying to muster. Kruger is far too concerned with catering to western audiences, and never takes that crucial step away from the genre rules to really make a mark.I'm tempted to applaud the makers of 'The Ring' for not dumbing down the material too much, and preserving just a little of the original's integrity. But on the other hand, I'm also annoyed that the sheer creepiness and ambiguity of Hideo Nakata's film has been watered down so much for easier consumption. 'The Ring' was an apt opportunity to blend the potency of the original with Western horror traditions, but Verbinski and Kruger just aren't up to the task, and this remake has ended up as what the original never once was: a mess. If producers ever decide to create a sequel (the twist ending has been retained), hiring a director and writer with some genuine prowess in horror film-making would be much desired.~ 6/10 ~",The Ring

Okay, here is a logical point: if you watch the video, DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE. Unplug it. Or use your cell phone. Or better yet don't watch the tape at all. I could not stand the ignorance of the people in this movie. Would this 'threat' call cell phones as well? If not, unplug the land line & use the cell phone to your heart's content.

It goes for flinch scares rather than gore and is all the more effective for it.Naomi Watts is that rare thing: a great actress who deserves her success.

It also dragged on too long, and I was tired of the movie and checking the time before the movie finally decided to call it a day.The Hitchcock references gave me a chuckle of recognition, but at the same time they seemed like an overly self-conscious display of style, just like the odd coloring throughout the film.If your standard of horror consists of slasher flicks, this movie is going to look pretty good, a cut above the rest.

The film is well made with impressive cinematography and capable performances, and overall I found it mostly entertaining.

I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen ""The Ring,"" but this is one of those movies where the story relies on our main characters making obviously dumb choices, and a disappointing twist ending ruins the third act.

People in the movie (and the audiance) do see video, which sets us up for a 7 day deadline to get to the bottom of the tape, and try and solve the mystery to put an end to the curse.

319,johnnysugar,"Before you die you see ""The Ring""",9,19 October 2002,"A combination of the visual chill of ""Stigmata"", the remote horror of ""The Blair Witch Project"", and the otherworldly, alien evils of H. P. Lovecraft, ""The Ring"" is a well-crafted, visually-arresting examination of how one act can inspire madness in everybody.  Naomi Watts is Rachel, a journalist who discovers that four teenagers, including her own cousin, have died a week to the day after watching a disturbing video tape.  Rachel tracks down the video and watches it herself. Immediately following the last frame of the video, she receives a phone call telling her that she will die in seven days.  Desperate to stop whatever is causing this, she enlists the aid of her ex-husband.  Her mission is fueled by the fact that her own son has also seen the video, and they are both being visited by a malevolent and insane entity.Watts is fantastic as Rachel, reminiscent of Nicole Kidman in ""The Others,"" a stable woman slowly losing her grip on the real world.  Gore Verbinski, a director who's previous work (""The Mexican"") I could describe as wasteful, shocked and amazed me by the stunning visuals and sparse yet horrifying special effects.  The video itself is an emulation of the surrealism of Maya Deren and altogether disturbing by itself.  Other fine performances include Daveigh Chase (the voice of Lilo in ""Lilo & Stitch"") as a disturbed young girl who may be the entire key to the mystery of the malevolent video tape.I fault the movie briefly for David Dorfman's performance as Aidan, Rachel's son.  We have seen too many overly precocious, psychic children in horror movies since Haley Joel Osmont in ""The Sixth Sense.""  Enough already.This was based upon an acclaimed Japanese thriller, and I would be highly curious to see what has been changed in the American version.

322,MeloDee,Finally something that is actually scary.,9,15 April 2006,"A lot of horror movies make three very common mistakes.Mistake #1: The suspenseful approach.With this approach, the filmmakers basically have a character- or characters- wander around in a decidedly ""creepy"" location. The location is made ""creepy"" by various, mysterious sounds, poor lighting, and ominous music. The ominous music and creepy sounds all slowly rise in volume until they reach a climax. We sit on the edge of our seats, waiting for something to happen. They tease us a little, having the character(s) jump at harmless shadows for a little while. Finally, the ""evil thing"" comes out and gets somebody.The problem with this approach, is that they're not really scaring us. By forcing us to wait so long to see ""the evil thing"" and by taking advantage of the natural reactions that occur in our brains when we hear certain sounds, they make us ""edgy."" Edginess does not constitute fear.Mistake #2: ""Let's startle them."" I guess some filmmakers started realizing that several viewers are now able to tell the difference between suspense and fear, so they've decided to try and startle us in the theaters. They cut the music, the lighting and the jumping at shadows. Now, they just have things pop out at us with nearly no warning.The entire audience gasps, and you might even hear a few shrieks here and there. I can almost see the filmmakers smiling triumphantly.The problem with this approach? Again, that's not fear- it's a natural human reaction to react violently at sudden, loud noises. So for a few minutes, we actually believe we are in danger, drawing us into the film- but then, soon enough the feeling vanishes.Mistake #3: They try to gross us out.This is an ages old mistake, and still hasn't been remedied. When all else fails, the filmmakers load their movie down with blood and gore.Too bad more of us aren't afflicted with hemophobia.Oh, and let's not forget the hideous, misshapen, occasionally-vomitting creatures. We turn away in horrified disgust. Of course, because I don't want to see some slimy, decaying thing ripping the head off a screaming victim I must be just terrified by your movie.That's not the only problem with that, though. It- like the first approach- has become predictable, as the more disgusting things they show us the more desensitized we become....Now you -probably- want to know what my whole point was, besides that I am immune to ""fear"" so incorrectly named. My point really was that one movie rose above the sea of monotony and crowned itself king in the world of horror.That movie was The Ring.The movie starts off with showing us ""the film."" The film itself, instead of being overly gruesome, is instead rather mysterious, disturbing, and strange. This film inadvertently causes the death of Rachel (played by Naomi Watts)'s young niece. Yet even that death was done nicely. Though we do understand something ominous is going to happen, we don't understand what or why. This gives a sense of eeriness to the film that would not have been possible otherwise. In fact, they don't even actually show the young girl's death. They skip straight to the funeral, where we're given clues of the horror of the whole thing- yet we still have no idea what's going on.A favorite author said, ""There is nothing more powerful as what is left to the imagination."" The Ring proves this with increasing cleverness as the film goes on. Journalistic Rachel tries to discover what happened to the young girl. The only one who witnessed her death was confined in a mental institution- but we see that later.Meanwhile, Rachel goes to the place where her niece was the week before her death, after discovering that all of her friends that had been there died in the exact moment that she did. Rachel had heard about ""the film"" from two acquaintances of her niece at the funeral, and decided to go to the cabin where it was located and watch it.After she watches it, she is visibly frightened. Then she receives that ominous phone call around which the film is based.""You have 7 days left to live."" So that is the core of the movie. Rachel tries to find out what the movie is about and what it is, at the same time trying to save her own life. Eerily, one the scenes in the movie become manifested in reality for everyday that passes. First, Rachel walks under a ladder. Next, as she's making a copy of the film for study purposes, the fly from the film becomes real. Next, nosebleeds- and it goes on and on.This is meanwhile building suspense as well as mystery, without utilizing the ""characters jumping at shadows"" stereotype. To our surprise, also, it starts to frighten us.Fear...that ominous pain that fills our stomachs at the thought of the unknown; that shiver in your skin. For me, it's not manifested by seeing hideous things, perhaps more suited to scaring a young child than a well-informed adult (or adolescent). For me, it is an intellectual experience. The more the fear makes sense or feels ""real"" the more afraid we feel inside. The Ring forces us to use our imagination again, to think beyond what we are used to experiencing. It touches the fear inside us all.In order for a movie to feel scary, it must haunt me long after the pictures have finished showing. The Ring does that excellently, by forcing us to watch the movie Rachel does before the actual movie starts. We see what she has seen, and so, we fear that what she has feared may come upon us.To this day, when a fly flies near any electronic screen- whether computer or television- I cannot suppress a shudder.",The Ring

It has a lot of inconsistancies, stuff that doesn't really make the most sense and are only there to kinda make the movie look a bit more exciting. When I watched it, it was pretty ok, but when I started thinking about it I found more and more illogical things and other stuff that didn't really have to do with anything but which were cramped into this movie anyway. I had a hard time following The rings storyline, because some things arn't explained but just happen. That is not the case in Ringu. In that movie you'll understand everything sooner or later!Ringu is much more tight, there is a lot more suspence, the story is almost completely logical and it is not overdone like The ring is.

326,Tokyo-1997,"A terrifying film, though not as good as the original",7,17 October 2010,"I found this movie to be made quite well and quite terrifying. There were lots of jumpy scenes. The opening scene for this movie was done very well. The part where the main character pulls out the hair from her mouth was also done very well. This is the remake of the original film. Though I found this remake to be quite entertaining. There were a few flaws that made it not as good as the original. The opening scene to me in this movie seemed to be the scariest part in the entire film, in fact it was probably even scarier than the scene where the ghost comes out of the TV set. I have read some of the reviews about the wonderful opening scene in this movie, and I agree. However, this whole movie definitely was not as good as the original. Because the scary scene where the ghost comes out from the TV set in the original was much scarier.The storyline of this film is about the same as the original. Here's a comparison between the original and the remake. Original - The man was working on his newspaper articles in a typical house, when the TV showed a picture of a well.You could already see the terror and fear on the man's face. Sadako slowly crawls out of the well and crawls out of the TV maintaining her scary crawling position. She then stands up, with her hair still covered over her face. Her face was not shown. She slowly moves towards the man. The man was shocked and frightened as you could see from his expression. He struggles. Just as you thought that Sadako would move towards the man. No. Sadako twitches her eye and stares at the man. Just as you thought Sadako would move towards him. No, the man faces Sadako, his mouth was forced opened, his heart stopped beating and fell onto the floor with his mouth opened wide.I could not sleep after I watched it Remake- The man was also working on his newspaper articles, when the TV seems to be on, he turns off the TV. He did not look as terrified as the man in the original ringu version. The man even stupidly moves towards the TV. Samumara comes out of the well.(The atmosphere around the well was not dark unlike ringu) Samumara slowly comes out of the TV set. Strange, but the coincidence of the main character trying to call the man to warn him what was about to happen, reduces the tension and fear of that scene. Samumara slowly comes out of the TV set, her hair was still covering her face. She slowly walks towards the man. The man seem to trip over some shelf. The shelf fell onto the ground with a crashing sound.This part reduces even more tension and fear of that scene. The camera angle was then not right. The scene then shows Samumara's feet walking towards the man.(also reduces tension) The man then tries to hide. Up to here , the scene was still very scary. What comes next became a disappointment to me in comparison to the original. Sadako slowly raises her head, with anger, her entire face was shown(Sadako's hair was still covering her face in the original version).Then some crappy special effects occurred without even mentioning what happened to the man unlike the original. The ending for the remake was also disappointing compared to the original.there were a few plot holes in the movie. Firstly, the video which the main character watched left many questions in my mind. What has the centipede got to do with the plot for this movie? What has the ladder even got to do with the movie? What has the finger piercing the nail or even the housefly has got to do with the movie? I personally think the special effects were overly done in that video for the remake. Some parts like the mother pushing Samumara down the well was pretty unexpected. I love that twist, because all the while I thought the father was the one who did it. This twist was not used in the original. I love the creepy atmosphere being used throughout the entire movie. I love the tension and fear that builds up in this movie. I love the characters being used in this movie, Samumara really looked scary. I love the character development and the storyline used in this movie. I thought there were lots of character development. Base on cultural interest, the original has done a much better job than the remake. Overall, I found this to be quite a nice movie, but the original was three times better than this. This movie is still recommended, but I highly recommend one to see the original first before you see the remake. My scores for the ring series so far would be: Japanese version of ringu- 9/10 Japanese version of ringu 2- 7/10 The ring(remake)-7.7/10 The ring two(remake)-7.1/10",The Ring

This movie was ultimately crap.,7,18 January 2003,"While the more arrogant people in the room like to say that those who point out the gaping plot and story holes in this ""film"" just don't get it, this flick is merely a bone thrown to the jack-asses who have been jonesing for that grainy, Zapruder-like offering to salivate over since the first Blair Witch.When the audience is left having to figure out HUGE gaps in the movie, it's not because the film is trying to be a think-piece. It's because it's a piece of crap. Leave big enough holes and everyone can feel smart by making up the explanations. The talk of the sequal only feeds the people who are starting to realize you can't really defend this movie. ""Well, we only know part of the story now. You'll know it all after the second movie."" Sorry. That's a little flat for me, and only reinforces that this movie was poorly made.To be honest, though, I didn't have that bad of a time watching. You certainly feel cheated when it (finally) ends, but until then you don't know how many loose ends will be left unexplained.Like with Blair Witch, though, it really doesn't pass the ""waaaaaait a minute"" test just after you walk out of the theater and start thinking about what you just saw.Finally, I really don't give a crap how good or bad the foreign versions of this film were. I don't watch Japanese films. I'm not about to start watching Japanese films. I'm out of college, and no longer have to pretend to enjoy foreign or ""indie"" films of ANY kind, so I rarely do, save for Life is Beautiful, which kicked ass.In a nutshell, the ride isn't bad, but when it's over you'll be left to guess a great deal of the story, and I don't consider that intellectual entertainment.

This one didn't feature a psychic mother that Samara was trying to protect, in this was she just adopted and was kind of evil. Which is fine it suits the narrative of the movie and comes of as quite creeping in doing so, I forgot how much she actually speaks in this. It was a little weird hearing that, I'm not used to hearing her talk.It's definitely been a very long time since I saw this last, it didn't leave me in awe this time. As I've said it's still a great movie just didn't have the wow factor not sure why that is. I also didn't feel as creeped out as I have done in the past, this was on of the only horror movies to actually scare me but on rewatched it didn't make me have to leave the light on or anything. Guess that's part of growing up, I've watched a lot of horror movies since then.I still love everything about this movie, that hasn't changed.

Everybody who's seen this knows the story it's about a videotape and after you watch it you get a phone call telling you you'll die in 7 days now to me this was a very interesting and creepy concept there was one scene in the film that really scared me I saw there were kind of 3 main characters in this you had Rachel Keller who was investigating this videotape after her niece died,you have Aidan who is her son and you have Noah who's helping her to investigate the rape after he watches it the scene I'm talking about is when Noah dies his television screen comes on when he is working and he goes to look then Samara crawls out of the screen and kills him the whole film to me was very creepy and intriguing but to me that was the scene that really stood out I'd highly recommend this for people who haven't seen this it's one that gets to you it gave me chills down my spine I give it a 9/10.",The Ring
331,MovieRat-2,What the **** is this ****?,5,13 December 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I should have realized that this wasn't going to be a good filming experiance when I saw the Ring...the entire theater was filled to the brim with high school students with the front half of the theater being nothing but teenage girls.  Word of advice for all movie goers: NEVER SEE A HORROR MOVIE IN THIS CONDITION! I probably wouldn't have been so frightened by this film if the audiance didn't screem at the top of their lungs at every single little thing that happened on the screen.  But enough of that.The film itself was, unfortunately, was a typical mordern Hollywood horror film in that it relied on shock value to scare you. Fortunately, there was little to no gore involved in this shock treatment which was a plus.  What ever happened to the old days of horror films where building an atmosphere of terror was more important than shocking the audiance (like in this film when we are shown the end product of the Samara's wrath which is done suddenly without warning and is on screen for only a second).  And as I said before, if it weren't for the audiance (mostly highschool girls) screeming at every little thing the shocks in this film wouldn't have been so scary.**WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD**But the worst and absolutely devistating thing about this film was the ending. I mean, the film would have been decent it actually stopped after they found the girls body and buried her. BUT NO! They had to go on, they had to have the girl coming out of the TV. They had to give the pointless solution to the curse by making a copy of the tape. I mean, this has to be the most pointless and idiotic ending I've ever seen in a horror film.Don't waste your time with this film! Go see something of more redeeming quality than this...like JACKASS: THE MOVIE. (yes, THE RING was that bad).",The Ring

A curse on a VHS tape, an evil essence infused into electronics, a disturbed child mumbling and grumbling, everything adds up to an overblown mystery leading consequently and literally into a deep well ... a fitting metaphor for the yawning black (plot)hole(s) swallowing director Verbinsky's useless efforts of creating anything coherent, logical or scary out of this soulless teen scam.

333,pifas,A crappy remake,3,26 March 2003,"First of all, I'd like to start by saying that, in a very personal taste, I liked Ringu much better than this one. The only thing to receive applause in The ring are, without a doubt, the photography and the make-up. Anything else is poorly done: the story, the way to unfold it, the overdose of go-seek-a-scare scenes and the need to explain things at the end of it (which, by the way, wasn't that clear). Sure, Hollywood did a great job in matters of visual but, in a real content of the movie, which goes from the adaptation of the cursed video to it's plot development, it failed big time. I'm not one against the US remakes. I enjoyed The magnificent seven (from Sturges) as much as I did The seven samurai (from Kurosawa), but, let's face it, Hollywood also has stroke several times on adapting real art foreign films like The wings of desire (from Wenders) as to make a crap film named City of angels. My belief is, The ring, falls on this last category.In terms of pacing I would recommend watching Ringu first instead of The ring, for anyone interested in seeing both. The japanese is slower but sure is better constructed and explained. My biggest complaint about The ring is that this one traded the whole creepy, evil and an air full of a perverse presence atmosphere from the original (and it's sounds), for more expensive special effects and a more sped up rhythm. This changed the whole aura of creepiness for the urge of an immediate disturbance. Sure, I got really scared a couple of times, by being caught with the guard down may I say, but they were moments frightening enough to give me those chilly goose bumps -the best one occurres near the beginning-; but that was it. Nothing else captivated or demanded my attention. It appears to me that Hollywood wanted an attractive package to sell rather than one good film that could be really apreciated by moviegoers with a brain inside their heads.Also, the changes and additions in this film are more than evident. Despite being almost a carbon copy in it's first hour, The ring falls short on it´s task to get you IN the movie starting from the cursed video, that works better as a resemblence of the surrealistic and goofy movie Un perro andaluz (made by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí in the late 20's), than the images that comes from a distressed mind (which actually are). Sure Ringu is slower, but besides the lot of talking involved there's also a strange, weird feeling in the air; it´s something like an evil presence that you can guess and watch in some secuences, and verbinski wasn't capable of capture that in here. That´s way I like Ringu, and that´s why I also recommend it instead of The Ring.",The Ring

I've seen the proper Ring 2 and that was actually good as well. So why isn't this. I had to watch it in school because we're doing a Media project and this was absolute shi* It's not scary, it's not that intense and all me mates in class hated it. And who can blame them! I actually thought it would be good but it wasn't. The only bit that entertained me from killing myself was when Samara (what a shi* name) comes out the TV and kills the man. Apart from that it was rubbish. The stupid woman (Noami Watts) keeps on making copies of the film and then watches them! She even makes a copy so that her son watches it.

339,kmberger,Brilliantly scary.,9,21 October 2002,"If you watch the tape, seven days later, you die.  That's the tagline for one of the creepiest, most effective horror thrillers to hit the screens in years.'The Ring' is a remake of a Japanese film and novel, ably directed this time around by Gore Verbinski (best known for 'The Mexican').  It stars Naomi Watts as Rachel Keller, a journalist whose niece dies under mysterious circumstances exactly one week after having watched that cursed tape.  After tracking down a copy of the tape and seeing for herself what's there, Rachel finds herself drawn into a maze of mystery and intrigue mixed with the paranormal, working against the clock.  If the stories are true - she only has seven days to unlock the secrets of the tape.The key to this film lies in the visuals.  Obviously, in using a VHS tape to show this ghostly curse, it's important to have a strange, creepy look to the tape - it holds all the visual clues for the story to follow, as well as setting up the theme and mood for the entire picture.  Everything on the tape is grainy, black-and-white, and silent.  There is a definite foreboding to the whole thing, even though, as one character says, it looks like an art-school project.  Visuals are also important in the rest of the filming - most of the action takes place in gloomy, dark, and remote locales.  It's the Seattle area, so it's almost always raining.  Most interiors are gray and stark.  A rundown cabin in the woods.  A lighthouse and farm on a cold, barren island.  From the initial scenes, which are more vibrant and colorful, to the end sequences, things in Rachel's life are veering her closer to the secrets in the tape and the terrible answers she's looking to find.  Visually, the film grows darker and grimmer as the seventh day approaches. 
Watts handles this with a mixture of tension and unavoidable curiosity as Rachel's psyche is assaulted by tragedy and fear.  A lesser actress might fall into the usual scream queen traps - all stumbling and screaming - but Watts is better than that.  She shows fear, yes, but also resolve and a good sense of intelligence even as she draws closer to the end.  This is certainly her movie - she's the focus around which everything unfurls, and she holds her end together quite well.  'The Ring' is a ghost story, and a very tightly-plotted one at that. Everything in the tape is a clue to the mystery, and as it unfolds, more and more layers are evident.  The film does its audience the credit of not completely spelling out each and every detail, or walking through every step of the plot.  It reveals enough to bring gasps and shivers and even scares when it has to, and never resorts to manipulating the facts and motivations to achieve a cheap surprise.  There are twists, but there are seeds for those twists that fester in the background until they're needed - providing great chills along the way.This is a well-designed, well-executed thriller that has scares to spare, and a chilling backstory that will leave the audience in shivers even after the film is over.  Top-notch psychological horror here.",The Ring
340,McHuevo,Worth watching... just barely,7,8 February 2003,"A videotape that kills people when they watch it. *sigh* All right...The argument of the story sounds somewhat intriguing and the first sequence of the movie makes you think you're going to have a hard time trying to sleep that night. Well, I for one didn't.As the storyline develops the whole videotape business goes down the trash and the movie slowly turns into a ""What lies beneath"" or ""The sixth sense"" kind of film. I didn't like that one bit. By the end of the movie, and specially in the last sequence, you have to remind yourself ""Oh yeah, the tape! That's what this was all about!"". In short, the movie weakens itself progressively and finally collapses, just to have a little spark of life in that ""last confrontation"" scene. Still, the very ending, in my humble opinion, is nothing short of dumb. And Naomi Watts' performance doesn't help the story much either. It's just not convincing.I think the movie is worth watching for two main reasons:The videotape itself gives you goose bumps. As they say in the movie, it's something you'd only see in a nightmare. - The ""last confrontation"" I mentioned earlier contain some of the scariest images you'll see in any movie. The director chose many of those shots so that they would look like an individual point of view, and that has a big impact when you're alone in your room watching TV. But then again, most of this new wave of thriller movie directors do the same.Aside from this two sequences the movie does not contribute anything to the genre. Recent movies like ""The sixth sense"", ""The others"" or ""Signs"" have a much bigger impact on the audience using only the atmosphere built throughout the film and a few carefully selected shots and sounds; they don't rely in visual FX: just good directors and good performances.

The beginning of it looked as if it was another ghostly movie with ghosts and scary settings, but I must say ""The Ring 2"" has much more supernatural horror than this epic. In some scenes I felt like I did not understand a single various thing like at the very confusing end, but I think you have to watch it again to get the full meaning. Also, in some scenes, were actually scary and it kept me on the very edge of my seat, wondering what is going to happen next. So there are ups and downs for this movie, but the bring it to a conclusion, I would say, it was an OK movie but if you're looking for something scarier - watch the sequel to this.Naomi Watts, another successful actress, took the chance to perform a single mother and in my opinion she did it really well. She was the perfect choice for Rachel Keller and you could see she really tried and surprisingly it looked as if she was doing it for real. As for Martin Herderson and Brian Cox - they are really marvellous actors. Like every actor/actress in this movie, they truly done there roles fantastically well and they really tried their very best. So the performances really brought this movie to the next level - which was great. But there was a real let down on the script, like I said, I didn't understand anything in some particular scenes. I mean, in the end and some scenes in the middle...what? I did not understand! So, like the content of horror, that was a negative point to the movie that is what makes the movie get poor ratings.

346,the-jerk,scariest movie in years,10,14 April 2005,"I don't scare easily. Usually, movies that are supposed to be scary just roll off my back. That's not to say that I don't love a good horror film; I'm susceptible to a few shudders in a good horror movie, but generally I can watch one and be able to sleep at night afterward.Not so ""The Ring"". This movie scared the s*** out of me. I can't put it any less crudely than that; something about it just resonated with me more than with other horror movies. ""The Ring"" was the scariest movie I've seen in a very long time; not even classics like ""Halloween"" or ""Psycho"" approach this level of terror.I confess I've never seen the original Japanese film on which that was based, so I'm not in a position to compare the two; and I feel that it would be unfair to do so anyway. ""The Ring"" stands alone as a great movie just as a movie based on a book can stand alone as a great movie, and that's what's important. The cast is top-notch; Naomi Watts, as Rachel, gives the best performance I've ever seen her give. It's a career-defining moment. Brian Cox also stands out as the long-suffering father of the little girl, Samara, who as played by Daveigh Chase may be the most chilling movie villain of all time. That she could do such a terrible thing and feel no remorse at all, being a little girl, it's just scary because it's so unexpected. The climax, where we see her crawl out of the TV to kill Noah (Martin Henderson, who along with David Dorfman as Rachel's son Aidan is credible and believable in his role) is just the scariest thing I think I've ever seen. I remember when I was little, watching ""Carrie"", with this girl moving things with her mind, trapping all these people in a gym and killing them with an unholy bloodbath, being scared by that. I was not as scared by that when I was 10 as I was by the climax of ""The Ring"" at 27. I still get chills thinking of that scene, and that little girl.The idea of being killed 7 days after watching a videotape didn't seem that scary to me, and I confess that when it was in theaters I had written it off as just another dumb teen horror movie along the lines of ""Urban Legends"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". Obviously I was way off, and I'm glad I gave into all the people who told me I had to watch it. I'm not sure if I can actually say that ""The Ring"" is the scariest movie of all time, but it's definitely close.",The Ring

If you rent the DVD you'll have to go frame by frame in a few places to really see all the great stuff lost w/ bad editing.  The kid (boy) did a great job acting.  There's a couple of beautiful actresses (term used very loosely).  There's one cool evil (heh) part in the movie. Now the bad: That one cool part comes exactly 5min 30sec before the credits roll.  The holes in this plot are inexcusable.  There's probably at LEAST a couple hundred light houses on the coastlines of America.  Is mental hospital security really that easy to circumvent? There's plenty more but don't want to spoil the ridiculous plot details. Didn't someone else make this movie before and call it 'Stir of Echos'?  This is like Stir of Echos and Ghost Ship with a VCR and without a ship.  I didn't jump once and don't EVEN try and compare this movie to the Exorcist.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!

348,steve-862,Very clever horror flick,7,12 February 2004,"I haven't seen the original film 'Ringu' from which this movie was based but I would have to say that Hollywood did an OK job on this film.  The plot is not Hollywood's, thank heavens, because in recent years any horror movie with any plot coming out of Hollywood seems to need to conform to the Scooby Doo format.  By that I mean by the end every little mystery has been explained in full detail.... unfortunately at the expense of the real ingredients, fear, suspense, etc, etc.The idea of this film is very clever, if you didn't know anything about it then you would be surprised at what is going on and you would not be able to predict the ending even if you were convinced you had it right, you'd be wrong.  Having read reviews to other Japanese horror movies it seems that many of them have intelligent and curious causes to the supernatural phenomenon as well.  An influx of American remakes may follow The Ring.To give some sort of review I would have to say that it is for the most part one of the very best horror movies of the last 5 years.  There is a deep and disturbing atmosphere, although I will see Ringu next and compare to see if it comes close.  There is an excellent score of music to set the mood and tone of what the director wants you to feel during the scenes and the sound effects are used well to develop the tension.  The storyline itself is by far the movie's strongest point and compares with any horror I can think of.In short I would definately say watch this movie if you like supernatural horrors, or maybe you should see the original 'Ringu' first though??",The Ring

The entire movie just grows more and more absurd; thought I cannot give any specific examples without making this review a big spoiler, the movie either fails to explain the origins and purpose of the tape and all the mystery surrounding it or gives an explanation that is something more than absurd. Still, I concede that atmosphere is probably the most effective element in a horror movie and The Ring succeeds beyond my wildest dreams on that level. There are no showy special effects, but instead subtle little touches like an eerie cabin near a misty and spooky forest, a quiet farming town with an aura of uneasy silence surrounding it, and most importantly, a woman who changes from an everyday news reporter to a tense and fearful person afraid for the lives of everyone she loves.Still, one of the biggest gripes I had with this movie was the videotape itself. There are a lot of people who seem to think that it was creative and extremely frightening; I am not one of those people. Whoever was responsible for the creation of the videotape footage seemed to create a montage by just throwing together a bunch of individually interesting images that had little effect, especially in the long run. When we see some of the objects on the tape in real life, The Ring wants us to say ""wow,"" instead we are left muttering anything but flattery. The tape is the central piece of the movie, something that the audience yearns to see and be frightened by. To me the piecing together of ""artsy"" images has become a cliché and an all too easy way out.Another big problem is the ending, or rather, the lack of a good one. There are a few points before the actual end that I thought the movie should have ended; granted that any of the other ending points would have been more typical, any other ending would have stopped the continual onslaught of brainless explanations and commercially injected meaning. There is one point where Watts says, ""I want to go home,"" where I definitely would have liked to see the movie end. Yes we've seen it before and yes it's the easy way out that I was complaining the tape footage took, but not everything can be original and not everything has to be original. Horror movies and thrillers these days are still all trying to duplicate the huge plot twist of The Sixth Sense, and the eventual monetary success that the film enjoyed. At some point there has to be a concession that Shyamalan's picture was beyond what almost all people in Hollywood are capable of in terms of its shock value.Luckily, making up for the script's flaws is the talent involved in the cast, especially in Naomi Watts. Her performance as Rachael is often the saving grace of this movie. She transforms otherwise painful moments into something emotionally compelling or frightening. At first look, Watts is the typical attractive female that all horror movies like to showcase either in the main character or in one of the side characters. But she transcends the typical female in a horror movie role and shows us her character's depth and emotions. She starts out as reporter investigating her niece's death to a woman with seven days to live and a son and ex-husband with only a day or so more than her.In the end The Ring is similar to one of this weekend's other releases, Abandon. Both show us some elements of brilliance that are rare in movies of their type, both are bad movies in the end. The Ring is a movie that could have offered more than a few scares and a cool look, but alas, the writer failed to write with logic and reason as is often the case in Hollywood.",The Ring
350,someguy889,Enjoyable Movie,6,7 June 2004,"The Ring is a film starring Naomi Watts and Daveigh Chase (from Donnie Darko and Spirited Away). Personally, I did not find this movie scary, even the infamous ""walking out of the TV"" part. It follows a woman who is trying to uncover the mystery of a mysterious videotape and why people die 7 days until they die. Naomi Watts is that woman and she is a journalist and very good at uncovering the mystery, while both she and her son must race against time because they have both received the mysterious phone call saying they had seven days. This is a movie that does not follow the conventional, commercial means of getting a cheap scare, and it is above average with its intelligence. The answers to all of the mystery are very interesting, but sometimes this movie borders on silliness. It was remade from the Japanese movie Ringu, which is much more praised and also much more scary. Both of these movie use the use of technology as means of fright: videotapes, telephone calls, etc. This is an enjoyable movie, but not very scary.My grade: 7/10",The Ring
351,dcheng-7,This Ghost needs Psychiatric Care.,5,28 August 2006,"There is one common problem with Japanese horror films: the ghosts kill for no reason! This happens also in the Ju On(The Grudge) also. I mean, even Satan kills for a reason and not merely for pleasure, assuming Satan governs the underworld and set the code of conduct there. So this ghost must be very psychotic even in ghost's standard.But the funny part is that they want to do it the hard way. I can't understand why a ghost powerful as Samara has chosen to go through such trouble as making the video tape, promulgating it, giving the victims a ring, screwing up their photos, and squeezing through the small TV set to order to creep them to death. We have to be given a good reason to accept all these crap! And what's the rationale for being able to escape Samara's attack by copying the tape to someone else? Totally absurd! With all these unanswered, the rest of the film becomes meaningless and irrational. As Ju On 2 did not provide these answers to Ju On 1, I doubted whether The Ring 2 will do the opposite.Is this the culture with Japanese viewers: enjoy to be scared but don't care to know why??",The Ring

We had already prejudice before the first image.Thinking it's was again some kind of movie with a lot of nudity mixed with blood and scream(don't forget the cat).I'm not a fan of horror movie , because horror movie are the close parent of porn movie.Most of the time empty of storyline.The first scene give you already the cill , even if you expect her fates to happens , you don't expect the way she die.Curiously there's no blood.Just a tortured face of a teenager.Tortured by Fear.The reaction of her parents give you the chill.THinking to ourself , what she have seen?The first image was enough to make me tremble . Have we discovered a horror movie actually giving us reel horror and not surtaxing us with blood and scream?This movie from the first scene to the last build up the fear of knowing what these peaple must see before dying.Watching this movie at 00:00 alones at home really could scare the more brave viril man.It's not about believing or not.It's really about giving you the feel of what horror could really be.So far we've seen a load of movie trying to copy the RING.But they failed.Also . Tortured Kid and demoniac children really work on us Adult.GIvinh us fear and chill.Children are the symbol of innocence.When they start acting the opposite , we really start pissing in your pants.The Ring with The first Exorcist are really the movie that i would classify into HORROR.",The Ring
353,isotope2112,Disappointing,4,10 March 2003,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I was expecting better from a movie hypes as the ""scariest of 2002"". I found The Ring to be drawn out and much too slow paced. Too much time is devoted to the investigation into the origins of video. This leads to resolution of sorts at the end, but creates too many dead end sub-plots and plot holes in the process. Overall the suspense just wasn't there. The freakiest moments of the film are delivered at the end, but by then I was left feeling cheated that at 116 minutes running time I had only seen 10 minutes that were remotely scary. The DVD edition contains an imaginative presentation of what appears to be deleted and alternate scenes from the movie. To me, it was more enjoyable than the actual movie. All in all, I found that The Ring failed to deliver on it's promises. Maybe it's just because of all the hype... 4/10* A fun little prank to play if you are watching this movie with other people: If you have a cell phone, near the end of the movie discreetly cue up the phone number of the place you are watching the movie at without removing the phone from your pocket. When the credits are rolling, call the number (again, without removing the phone from your pocket). This should elicit a bit of fear, especially in younger viewers. Heh heh heh.",The Ring

Naomi Watts delivered one of her best performance to the big screen she really gave us all the emotions of a women who is more scared of her son's life than hers, even though she is going to die before him!

Our heroine Watts watches the tape after a relative's daughter dies after also seeing it...Watts' clock starts ticking. Since she's a darn good investigative reporter, she uses her time left to research the video's origins to try to find an escape... It's a neat premise but the story ultimately goes in the wrong direction, trying find pragmatic answers to the how and why. In doing this, too much that is abnormal (and there's a lot of it) is left hanging...and of course, we get the contrived ""ending within an ending"" that's been done a million times.

356,camraman,"OVERBLOWN, OVERRATED HYPE",2,2 February 2003,"I just viewed The Ring at the local $2.00 theatre and I'm glad I didn't spend any extra money.  Who said this movie was good? 
This movie, starring Naomi Watts as Rachel, Martin Henderson as Noah and David Dorfman as Aidan has little suspense, horror or thrills.  The movie begins with Katie (Amber Tamblyn), the neice of Rachel, and Becca (Rachael Bella) sharing information about a tape that, if watched, claims you will die within seven days. Surprisingly enough, the rumor is spreading amongst the high school crowd (courtesy of Becca and others). 
Katie, along with three of her friends rendezvous at a cabin retreat and view a non-commercial VHS tape of mixed messages and images.  From what I've gathered (unless I missed some crucial dialog), this rumor was amassed without anyone actually dying.  How many VHS tapes of The Ring actually exist?  If the Katie and her friends weren't the only viewers, when did other viewers die where a rumor (or facts) could be built?  If the only available copy existed at the cabin retreat, how did Becca find out about it and share the rumor with Katie who actually saw the tape and, no doubt, received the phone call that vocalized her future demise?  If symptons developed after viewing the tape, such as a bleeding nose, or a blurred face in a photograph, wouldn't Katie have noticed these things prior to her 7th day and shared the information with Becca?  I could go on with the unanswered questions, but I need to redirect my energy.Dreamworks, this is what I call good promoting.  It's an overblown production that produces below average results.Thrills, suspense and horror?  Give me the first two Alien movies. In fact, Deep Rising was a better horror movie than The Ring and it's current rating is averaging a full 2 points less; and Deep Rising had clever humor where The Ring failed.I hope they don't produce a sequel because this was garbage. In fact, please don't.  2 out of 10 because I did jump during the millipede scene.  But, I'd jump even if the millipede scene was intermixed in a comedy because I don't like bugs.",The Ring
357,vicdragon19-1,spooky and surprisingly well done....,7,14 May 2007,"I had heard mixed reviews about the film, with a silly premise about a videotape that kills you after you watch it. Hahahha...yeah that sounds real clever. However, this film isn't really a horror film in the first half, more of a psychological thriller. I found the story quite interesting about Samara, the disturbed girl with strange powers. All the performances are pretty good, especially from Naomi Watts. The cinematography is perfect, with a cold greyish tone for the film. I did feel that this deliberately made the film look like a horror flick - there was barely any real daylight in the film. I mean, even in horror films, you can have some sunny days, even though the characters are obviously trapped in a nightmare.Its the ending that will scare you, especially when Samara comes out of the TV. The curse never ends, so you have to show the tape to someone in order for them to pay the price for the curse. The ending is a little bit unsatisfying, but luckily the sequel (though nowhere near as good as this) will solve most of your answers.I think the Japanese version captures more of the scary elements, cuz they know how to do horror better -its in their culture in a way. So see the japenese one first if you want to.",The Ring

As Rachel is horror struck after watching the tape when she found it at shelter Mountain Inn, the phone mysteriously rings.......Coninsidense right?

In the end - after watching those two I knew I had wasted time. There was nothing scary, but gore cursing and other stupid effects in both those movies. This movie had some extraordinary direction. Each frame/scene ends leaving you thinking that something will happen.I had to turn away couple times so I wouldn't have to look at the faces of the girl who dies in the start and Naomi's husband who dies in the end. Not that I was scared, but I don't believe looking at those gruesome images is any good, mentally. A true horror classic with no gore, no nudity, no cursing and other B grade horror movie stuff. I would rate this and ""The Others"" as the best ones I've ever seen. I live alone in a studio apartment, but I wasn't scared or anything. It's simply a matter of what you want to believe.",The Ring
361,mcgriswald,Ring introduced new horror genre,8,1 February 2007,"When I first saw The Ring, I had yet to see other films of that type, such as the original Japanese films, The Grudge and Dark Water.For me, the film introduced the creepy, malevolent water child with jet black hair. Just the way the thing crawled around was frightening, and I had goosebumps throughout the film, which I saw on TV.Although I grew up in Seattle, it was hard to recognize the dark, Gothic locations, particularly the island where the child grew up. I knew where it was, but I never associated that island with anything that dark and foreboding.This film is truly scary, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good non-slasher type of horror film.

Of course I never saw the original one, because of no distribution whatsoever in the United States. But even so, the trailer (which I viewed nonstop on the Internet) was ... breathtaking. It reassured me that a good and well made scary movie was finally going to come around.It's definitely well made. The movie looks absolutely amazing. The music is perfect, really makes you feel like impending doom is about to be unleashed.But the film did a horrible job in explaining the plot.. I had a talk with some of my friends after the movie, and it took us about an hour to fully get it.Other bad things: the dialogue is pretty weak, and we have another cliched boy wonder (David Dorfman) who has big, big eyes and is in tradition of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. He knows lots and people confide in his words. Ugh.Nonetheless, the film works on some levels, mainly the ones I stated before. The video itself is pretty damn creepy, in grand tradition of the Nine Inch Nails ""Closer"" video (with chairs spinning really fast upside down and all, etc). And the cinematography gives it loads of atmosphere.So if you're expecting a scary good time, by all means come and watch this film.

364,boo_4ever,Confirming what we all knew - VHS is evil,9,3 April 2005,"The Ring follows the story of a journalist ,who, while investigating the death of her niece stumbles across a cursed video which kills its viewers in seven days.The Ring is based on a series of Japanese books which in turn were translated to film in Hideo Nakata's original film ""Ring"". Sometimes its impossible to talk about either film - the Japanese version or the US remake without comparing them such is the division of opinion. Taking The Ring on its own merits though it is a chilling and seriously creepy film.However if you have watched the Japanese version then some parts of the Ring will frustrate you. Such as the insistence US film makers have you holding your hand and explaining everything to you every step of the way. What ever happened to less is more? A big reason why Ring was so scary is that you knew next to nothing about the female apparition Sadako and this lent her an air of mystery. Here in The Ring we see her as a little girl sitting up and talking in bed. Not very scary. Also the main part - the video itself is just too well done in the US Ring. It looks more like a student art house film then a manifestation of evil. The Japanese version was darker, dirtier and plain freakier. As was the music.Don't get me wrong. The US Ring is still a fantastic horror film which improves on the Japanese version is some areas - just not overall. because of that its kind of impossible to say which was actually better. I personally prefer the original for the reasons I listed, but each to their own.After promising myself I wouldn't spend this comment comparing the two its obvious I need to go punish myself in some way.

I've seen the original Japanese version of the film and find both of them delightful to watch.  The American remake added other storyline which is fine because it adds another dimension to the horror/drama.  Instead of just spirit photography, this is a form of spiritual rage video where the outcome is horrible death.

366,eddy_currents,Better than average ghost story,7,21 October 2002,"It starts off silly, like the writers were fishing for ideas for another teen scream flick and decided on using a video tape that kills people, instead of a psycho that kills people, or a web site that kills people, or a car that kills people, etc. It does get better though, and the whole video tape thing makes sense later on.There are a couple of things that didn't make sense, like how the girl in the opening scene died of fright yet looked like she was just unearthed from a tomb. The coroner said she had died of a heart attack -- people don't look like that after a heart attack. Obviously they just decided they needed some scary makeup so they stuck it in.I heard this is a remake of a Japanese film. The original probably relied more on story than effects and so was probably better.But after a clumsy beginning the movie pulls you in. It turns out to be an intelligent creepshow instead of the teen slasher flick that it starts out becoming. It ends with an original twist that extends the movie considerably and ties together all the loose ends. You need to review the movie in your head, but you will see that it really did come together.Definitely worth seeing if you like a good scare.

It's been a while since i placed close attention to the Japanese version, but a lot of its shots & angles seem to have been copied as well.This sounds like a miserably failed nephew of Gus Van Sant's ""Psycho 1998"", but where a bloody shower was no recipe for quality, ""The Ring"" maintains a degree of tension throughout which elevates it above the original. Perhaps it accomplishes this mainly because of the Americanized (familiar) thrills & storytelling and the polished look of the production. However I also find the background on the murder of the psychic girl to be more comprehensible. Her nature seems less predictable, which leaves room for a few last-minute plot twists. Agreed, in retrospective most of them are in line with ""Ringu"" again, but i'd assumed at that point we'd be taking a different path. Another nice altering was the cursed videotape itself: the images were closer related to the psychic girl's past, and with all the technical research involved, it plays a bigger part, lol.

The acting is good, Hayden, the little boy, I did not like him, but this movie is compared so much to the sixth sense, and he doesn't quite match Osment's performance in The Sixth Sense, but that's because Osment's role in the Sixth Sense had a greater depth.

371,enazwo,Yikes! I want my mommy.,8,4 November 2002,"""The Ring"" was a movie that I thought was going to be a waste of time. I had no hopes for ""The Ring"" as the plot is very similar to a recent release called ""feardot.com."" Which was a very stylish and effective horror flick.Basically ""The Ring"" is about a urban legend of a video that once you watch it you die seven days later. In the movie ""feardotcom"" once you log in to the site you die in approximately the same time span. There are other plot machinations that also similar which ""The Ring"" tries to change in a obvious 10 minute tacked on ending.Unnervingly for me was as the first five minutes of ""The Ring"" started I was groaning because it reminded me of the start of countless cheap teenage drive inn slasher flicks. With two girls spending the night together alone with the parents out-on-the-town they try to scare each other with urban legends. Then one tells the story of the videotape that once you watch it you die seven days later. What follows was quite creepy and made me realize that director Gore Verbinski wanted to lull you into thinking it was going be a cheap teenage drive inn slasher flick.One of the girls has actually seen the video, with her boyfriend and a group of their friends. Well you can imagine what their fate is.Now a relative of the deceased girl, Rachel Keller, Naomi Watts, is an investigative reporter for the Seattle Post Intelligencer, who is asked to look into the strange death. Rachel agrees and soon comes across the video and watches it. Soon Rachel realizes that she's racing against the clock to solve the mystery before her seven days are up. Add to that, her son has accidentally seen the video too.What follows is one of the creepiest and compelling horror movies I have seen in awhile. Pay attention or you might make the mistake of assuming there are plot holes in the story. Also the black and white video is an eerie macabre piece of work that was a very effective component to the story.I do find weakness with the ending as I feel it was a rushed tacked piece to avoid to close a comparison with ""feardotcom""Finally I do want to admit that ""The Ring"" got me to jump a couple times like I haven't jumped in years. At one point I even launched my bucket of popcorn out of my lap. Embarrassing when that happens to us, however it makes us laugh to be that startled. So I say give  ""The Ring"" a shot.",The Ring

However, it'shigh 8.1 rating encouraged me. To say the least, I wasn'tdisappointed. As you may know, the premise of the movie revolvesaround a disturbing video tape and anyone who watches it dies. Iwon't delve too deep into the plot. The movie revolves aroundNaomi Watts' character, Rachel, and her investigation into thecontents of the tape and their origin, after she herself watched theit. Her niece and her friends had all watched the tape earlier andall died suspiciously. As she investigates further, we discovermore and more about the story behind the video and eventually wereach a frightening and unexpected climax with a brilliant endingwith a major red herring.The performances were fine on all accounts. Ms. Watts is superb,a real talent. She isn't quite as good, in my opinion, as, say, NicoleKidman in The Others, but the entire film rests on her performanceand she delivers. The story is superb, though I suppose I shouldattribute much of this to the original filmmakers. I haven't seen theoriginal, Japanese version but I suppose that they didn't muddletoo much with the original formula.Anyway, on the not-that-good side, the ending left a lot open tointerpretation.

I was ready to walk out of THE RING as well, but it also mercifully ended. Don't waste your time on this. It is a waste of time and money, unless you want to laugh very hard.",The Ring
375,larson.72,"Interesting concept, ultimately flawed",6,17 October 2002,"This movie has a very intriguing concept behind it, but it's ultimately flawed pretty badly.  The main problem is that most of the characters and situations are forced to the point where they simply can't seem realistic or natural at all.For one, take the kid in this movie.  Not only is his character completely unbelievable in the way he acts and talks just like an adult and expresses zero emotion, but he really wasn't even a neccessary part of the movie. He's not the exception either: Hardly anybody in this movie is really a believable character.  First there's the mother who seems rather callous towards her son and is always never-too-flustered that she is going to die in a matter of days after watching the videotape.  Then there's Richard who seems to react to strangers in a completely random and unexplainable fashion.  And then there's Anna and Samara who seem like they're pulled straight out of a German fairy tale or something.  In fact...the only character that seems somewhat realistic is Noah.The ending of the movie leaves a lot to be desired too.  Yes there's a plot twist, but it comes off as more of a cop-out than any attempt to seriously explain anything or bring closure.  It creates more plot holes than it fixes actually.",The Ring
376,kevino-4,Very Well Done,8,18 October 2003,"Much much better than the average movie of this type, with fine acting and an intelligent script. Starts slowly but the punch in the last half makes it well worthwhile. Drawbacks are the inevitable difficulty of child actors although the boy does his best, and the uninvolvement of the police or other authorities in grisly deaths which lends an air of unreality to the proceedings. However the solid pacing and scare rating allows any negative to be overlooked when the time comes for show and tell. Don't watch it alone.",The Ring
377,jennie0409,Must-see for scary movie lovers,9,2 November 2002,"This movie is a definite must-see for scary movie lovers. ""The Ring"" has tons of twists and turns. When you think you've finally figured something out, another curve ball is thrown at you. This is absolutely the freakiest movie I've ever seen. The actors and actresses in the movie have done smaller parts and less popular movies, for the most part, but I believe this could be a big break for some of them. I think it could have helped the movie to have a big name or two, but if you go for the horror aspect, you won't be disappointed. I have never seen such a scary movie, which is also a comedy. The whole theater will be laughing throughout, as well as screaming and jumping! This is a thoroughly enjoyable film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great horror film. If you aren't good with scary movies, however, this won't be your favorite film.",The Ring

379,Dave-330,Japanese Water Torture,1,7 November 2002,"Following in the footsteps of ""Panic Room"" (see my review) and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" as critically praised pieces of trash, ""The Ring"" comes from underground to bore you to death at a theater near you.  This is one of those movies that is off the charts STUPID, like ""Blair Witch"" STUPID, where anyone whose brain is in the ""on"" position realizes that this is nothing more than a lame fright film that has been done before a hundred times.  It is far from scary and defies all logic from frame 1 to the end of the flick. This film may have the bells and whistles to entertain 11-14 year old kids, but anyone who is above the age of 20 should be embarrassed if they enjoyed this garbage.The problems are mostly plot related and I don't feel like ""spoiling"" any of the logic defying twists and turns that nearly put me to sleep.  Let me just tell you that if you like really slow movies that don't require a pesky plot, or continuity, this is your cup of tea. It's a horror flick, so for the most part the acting is poor.  The ""acting"" in the opening sequence is quite horrid, as if the untrained kids were reading their lines off of the script just beyond the camera.  Brion Cox, who I have seen in other films, is quite scary in his delivery, as if he forgot that he has 30 years of film experience.Naomi Watts is the one and only positive in this stinker.  Her presence alone carries this movie, as in Mulhullond Dr. (another piece of junk) and she needs to learn how to say the word ""pass"" when she is offered fine fare such as this.  She still manages to remain relatively unscathed as the entire movie crashes and burns around her and hopefully will star in something better soon.If you think that ""Jeepers Creepers"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" are five-star, grade-A films, this movie is made just for you.  I think those movies are amazingly dumb and I felt stupid after I watched them, and felt even dumber after watching this film.  I think ""The Ring"" actually symbolizes the large plot holes that are readily apparent if you are paying attention.  If you are willing to check your brain at the door, you have a chance to not hate this movie, but I doubt it.",The Ring
380,ladulaser,As good as original but in a different way,9,1 March 2003,"I watched both this newer version and the japanese original in the same day. Thus, the japanese version was not as frightening, as I knew what to expect and when to expect it. If I had seen the japanese version first, though, I think I would've found that one better.One notorious difference between the two Rings is that the japanese is just about 95 minutes while the american one runs for almost 2 hours. It becomes clear why when they are compared in the same day as I did - the japanese main characters seem to have some kind of psychometric powers, i.e. the ability to see past events related to an object or a person that they touch. The american version is more true to scientific method and lets the characters find out more for themselves in a ""logical"" manner. The quote-marks I just used are of course there since there isn't much logic to be expected in this movie.I definitely love both versions, I am giving both 9 out of 10, perhaps I would give the japanese a 9 and the american an 8.5 if possible, but they are good in so different ways that they're almost two different horror movies, although you recognize most scenes and often even the camera angles and architecture of the rooms and the steps inside the houses where the action takes place! This is a Blair Witch Project for the 00's, let's just hope that the sequel isn't as bad as in the Blair Witch case.",The Ring
381,nunemkh,Brilliant and shocking!,10,16 October 2008,"THE RING is my favorite horror movie of all time for many reasons. It is a remake of an excellent Japanese horror film named RINGU. I love both films and own both DVDs. Now since there are so many reasons why I love THE RING, I'll organize all the things I love and the very few things I would change about this brilliant and creepy film. But first let me give you a short version of the plot: after the death of her niece, investigative journalist, Rachael Keller finds a strange tape that her niece apparently watched one week before her death. The rumor behind the tape is that if you watch it, you will die seven days later.THE INTRO: The introduction to this film is very smart. At first it seems like a cheesy teenage slasher flick. But that my friends is a trick. After about 3 minuets into the film you realize just how mature and suspenseful of a film this really is.THE CHARACTERS: The characters of THE RING are great. Rachael Keller is the perfect journalist. She's very inquisitive and smart; she certainly does allot in this movie and keeps the plot going. Also Rachael Keller is a great mother; she puts her own life in danger so she may save her son. Noah Clay is sort of a comic relief, he's sarcastic and stubborn but is also very smart. Noah helps Rachael solve the mystery of the cursed tape. Aidan Keller is the son or Rachael Keller, Aidan is quiet and wise beyond his years, he was very close with his cousin before she died a mysterious and horrible death. The character list goes on so I'll skip ahead to the villain. Samara Morgan is the antagonist in this film, and boy what a villain. The secret to Samara's past is a sad and brutal one, which would explain the things she does through out the film.THE STYLE OF HORROR: I love horror films like THE RING. THE RING is very unique in it's style, it is filmed like an Asian horror film; full of flash backs, creepy imagery, nightmares, mysteries, and hallucinations. It's very bizarre and surreal at times, which isn't very out of place since this is a supernatural horror/thriller. If you ask anyone who has scene THE RING ""which scene do you remember the most?"" they'll probably tell you ""the closet scene!"". This is referring to the 2 seconds of footage of Katie, dead in the closet. This scene is the biggest jump scene in the film. There are a lot of different types of scares in this film; jump scares, suspense, shocks, chills, and intense terror! WHAT I WOULD CHANGE: There is very little I would actually change about this brilliant horror film. In fact, there is only one scene, the climax. I guess I would like one that's a bit longer. The climax in this film is still satisfying but I definitely wouldn't mind a longer one.THE ATMOSPHERE: Atmosphere is something I highly prize in any film, but especially in horror films. It's industrial in some places and fantasy-like in others but it's always tinted green or blue. It's almost always raining and the settings are all very nice. The settings go from Seattle to the forests of Washington to a fictional island and beyond.In conclusion I would like to once again say that this is my personal favorite horror film of all time. I highly recommend this movie to any one with intelligence and an imagination. THE RING is an amazing horror movie, a cult favorite now and a cult classic in the future, a blockbuster, and so much more. The critics loved it and so will you, trust me.",The Ring
382,sibelian,Mildly Unsettling,3,17 June 2008,"Yeah.Kinda moody here and there, kinda liked the kid coming up out the well, liked the way she came out the TV. Nearly worked. Liked the flickery look of her, like she was made of TV. That was kinda cool.Liked the horse on the ferry, nearly worked with those worrying cellos thumping away a la ""Jaws"".But, um, its got that problem that movies have now, where everything's in the Modern Style, desaturated images, tastefully composed shots of grime and electric cables looking more like a still life in an art gallery than a scene from a movie, blurry shots of eeeevil Samara in the asylum, BEAUTIFULLY composed and tinted, making me think ""oooh how tasteful and elegant"" not ""cripes, what a creepy little girl"". My poor brain won't do ""arrg scary"" at the same time as it's doing ""oooo tasteful"". During that bit where they find her room in the barn with the cute little TV like something out of a spooooooky sort of Calvin and Hobbes strip (it had cutely angled little ariels like a friendly grasshopper) and the little carousel and her little bed all uniformly tinted in pale browns and faded sour creams I thought, how EVOCATIVE. How MYSTERIOUS. And how thoroughly FAKE LOOKING. Such a perfect, sweet little theatre set - it would have been beautiful on a stage but in the movie it just looks like something that would have been beautiful on a stage.If you over-stylise these things, they stop being scary and just become static, like images in a gallery. They're lovely to look at, but why not just make images and put them in a gallery? They'd work better and probably actually be scarier. It's fine to overdo the interior deco in a fantasy film or a comedy or a sci fi flick, but not a horror movie, horror movies have to be real, nail-scrapingy, eye-bulgingly real. Reality isn't tasteful or well-composed. Or cunningly tinted to look older than it is.Having said all that, the girl coming out the TV nearly worked, because it's supposed to be supernatural.Guys, horror movies have rules.Also, no, no, no, filmmakers, don't add pointless subplots about parents trying to reunite for the sake of their kid. It's a horror movie, not a chick flick.3 stars, all 3 for Samara coming out the well, which, had I been significantly younger and had seen fewer horror movies, would probably have been quite scary.",The Ring
383,xTkAx,This is probably the best supernatural horror film of all time.,10,5 February 2021,"I first saw The Ring in 2006 while house sitting alone one evening. After seeing it in their DVD collection I decided to watch it to overcome boredom.Without really saying anything about the movie, it was a very disturbing experience all the way through, and after it finished I realized I had made a mistake to watch it alone in the dark at night for the first time. It was the most terrifying horror movie I had ever seen, with psychological effects lingering hours and days later. I was unprepared for what this film was about, which is why it affected me very deeply and I needed time to recover. I've watched it a few times since, and while the experience isn't as impacting as the first time, it's still an effective psychological film.This type of horror is definitely not for everyone though, because it's a rare moment of cinematic excellence that can really affect the viewer. With that said though, the filmmaker and crew did an excellent job. I never encountered a film like this before or since, and even compared to the original Japanese film, Ringu, The Ring wins hands down.I had hoped other films would raise or surpass the bar this film set. But in 15 years I've yet to see it. As a result, I believe this film will continue to remain among the best horror films of all time.",The Ring

I have watched many horror movies over my 40 years of life from Hitchcock's great masterpiece `The Birds' To the some of the more recent Teen slasher movies prevalent recently. And in all that time I have never had a movie wake me the following night with Nightmares. This movie did exactly that! Whether it was the overall creepiness of the movie or the fact that it touched some dark fear buried deep in my subconscious I don't know, but the fact is after watching this movie last night I awakened four times to horrible nightmares three of which were directly connected to the movie. As I sit here today bleary-eyed writing this I think back to the house I grew up in which had an old abandoned cistern under it that our kitchen had been built over. I used to have a phobia as a child of falling through the kitchen floor into the depths of this black watery hole never to been seen again.  Maybe some of the scenes in this movie touched that long buried fear. On a creepy scale of 1-10 this movie is a 15!!!!

The film spooks you into the belief of the story and Samara's death. The film is extremely convincing about the websites being read by Naomi Watts.This film is the remake of the Japanese film RINGU and I saw this few weeks ago and RINGU is not too scary, but Hollywood feeds on dramatizing reality and this time they were successful with THE RING. The Ring is a simple story of a lady who watched a 30 second spooky video and is cursed to death, after which she conducts research on the truth behind the 30 second video and finally gets successful in her mission. All this is too simple to read, but wait till you watch THE RING, I guarantee you that ""Friday The 13th"" will seem lame.My credit goes to the director of THE RING and he has done an excellent pre-production plan prior to the making of this film.WATCH IT AND STAY AWAKE ALL YOUR LIFE.",The Ring

The effects were really good but the end was kind of fishy but other than that it was a great movie and scared the beans out of me when I first saw it. Naomi Watts Starr's in this movie as well as the award winning King Kong directed by Peter Jackson. The Ring really has a spooky plot and is scary every time I watch it. If you like scary movies than I suggest you see The Ring because it will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.

If the viewer see the film for the first time on DVD, going to the ""Don't Watch This"" section of the special features may absolutely freak them out.

I sure would like to know where the $60 million went? Surely noton the screen or its plot more for the markting of this film. Another film that shows how a company like ""Dremworks"" is just in the movie business to make a fast buck and not out make a truly great film. I saw this at an advance screening and boy what a waste of my time. The first 1/2 hour I was interseted in the story, & I was caught up in the mystery of the VHS tape that killed people who watched it, the last hour an 1/2 the film got boring, slow-moving and muddled; characters came and went and gave half assed answers and the characters seemed to spill over from the ""Twin Peaks"" Tv show, and the ending was the biggest scam since ""The Blair Witch Project"". Not scary more like the ""The Changeling"" gone high-tech. I very silly movie with enough plot holes to sink a huge ship & a film by then end that doesn't make sense and leaves more questions than answers. Thank god I saw this for free since I would been really made if I had wasted $8.00 to see this over hyped and under done film. Skip it & wait for $0.50 cents day at your local dollar theater, or better yet wait for $0.99 cents day at your local video store when your really bored.

389,Good-Evening-Clarice,"Before you die, please see THE RING",10,15 October 2002,"I saw THE RING last week at an advance screening. My reasons for attending were Naomi Watts (who radiated brazen sexuality in a mesmerizing performance in last year's MULHOLLAND DRIVE) and the trailers, which actually did not reveal the whole plot. I have to say I was quite impressed. The acting was top-notch and the visuals really remain with you afterwards, including the videotape, which you get to see in its entirety. The sound effects were equally impressive, some of the best I have ever heard in a horror film. They really set the creepy tone. Plot-wise, you get as wrapped-up in the mystery as Watts' reporter does, and my only quibble is that the film leaves a bit too much unexplained. Still, the very last scene ends a very mysterious film in a very cryptic and mysterious way. I urge you to watch it. 10/10",The Ring
390,Good-Evening-Clarice,"Before you die, please see THE RING",10,19 October 2002,"If nothing else, THE RING is a firm indication that Naomi Watt's mesmerizing performance in last year's MULHOLLAND DRIVE was no fluke. Even her most stringent critics cannot deny the brazen sexuality she radiated in last year's David Lynch freakfest, especially in the audition scene. And let's not forget those two memorable lesbian sex scenes, which Lynch was wise enough to make sensual instead of having his two actresses perform like endurance champions. Anyway, back to THE RING. Like last year's THE OTHERS, the film's emphasis is on suspense and creepy thrills rather than blood and gore. Some of the images are quite chilling and effective and remain with you long after the film has ended. The sound effects were expert as well, some of the best I've ever heard in a horror film. They establish the tone of the film and really do enhance the experience. My only quibble is that by the end, the mystery of the ring has not been cleared up in its entirety, and one cannot help but wonder if the filmmakers lacked the conviction to resolve the film in a satisfying manner. Anyway, for those who lack the attention span to try and unearth the mystery, there's always white-hot Aussie Naomi Watts in a wet T-shirt. Grade: 10/10",The Ring

It begins as a common movie, I was about to leave the watching scene, but afterwards begins to develop a plot in a very interesting way. I didn't understand some of the logic of the plot, but I guess it's a pattern of this type of movies. I liked it. For what it does, it's really intriguing. It's not boring, not stupid, not predictable (pretty rare, huh?), and a bit more sophisticated than the common Dracula+Ghost+Dragons+Monsters+Aliens+Fallen Angels+Dark+Sprits+Curses+masks+evile persons+blahblahblah common stories.

392,manalone923,Two hours of baloney that overbuilds to....nothing,3,26 March 2005,"Spoiler free, no specific actions or character details givenThe Ring will entertain you fully and you will have no unanswered questions if you accept anything that is thrown at you and never stop to ponder even the simplest details.Okay, there's a videotape that kills people after they watch it. A little girl is involved. We know that, but there's unanswered questions. Well, the movie does give you answers, which are satisfying as long as you don't ask a single follow-up question. If I want to know why some angry kid went on a shooting spree at school, the local news will give me the answers why. Instead, ""The Ring"" IS that troubled kid. For any question I ask, be it ""how did this happen?"" or ""why?"", the answer is a basic, uninspired ""uhh, because"". He may even give me an answer that he thinks makes perfect sense such as ""I want to kill people so I got a gun and did"". And of course, if that's all you ever heard of the case, and no other explanation were given for the series of questions that would follow, you'd be completely satisfied, right? Well, not for most people, but then here you have the Ring which pulls that crap with almost every important question you'd have. Yes, you learn how this video kills people, as demonstrated in one of the two ""big reveals"" of the film that is so powerful and scary that I think ""Oh,"" and shrug. The other big reveal a is red herring near the end that's just a bit of dialog - basically ""Uh oh, what we thought was the case really isn't, and now it's actually worse!"" The film ruins this too, giving no explanation, reasoning or motive whatsoever for what was just explained. Savin' it for the sequel I guess.The end made me realize that, more than anything, I could have summed up this film in one sentence and saved myself a lot of time and letdown. Yes there's a little girl, a well, and a mysterious video that kills people. But why, how, and what do they all have to do with each other? Well, the big ""why"" is revealed without much more than ""well, uh, because"". ""How"" isn't answered at all- not in any logical, explainable way unless you just accept the very silly and ostensibly MEGA CHILLING super payoff that I think I was supposed to have seen. Of course, after seeing what I saw, I'd still like to know ""how"" that event, upon which this movie's very premise hangs, is possible. No explanation attempted. You just buy it, 'cuz it makes the story super neato, you know?As for ""what do they all have to do with each other?"" Well, the movie goes on for an eternity trying to make this the big mystery. In fact, if I gave you the answers to what happens, then went into detail of how this is visually represented, you'd probably think there'd have to be SOMETHING more going on, and probably say ""oh, that's what happens? How? Why? (there's those troublesome words again).Nope, there ain't much of a story here. It's a concept that, when stripped down, comes down to a special effect, one that has different motives than what we were led to believe. Huh, pretty powerful I guess, or so I'm supposed to think based on the Sixth Sense ""slowly zoom in on the character as they reveal the 'big twist'"" shot. I mean, sure I know that the movie's last ten minutes are supposed to be pretty profound and I'm not supposed to question it. I suppose it's just the natural learner in me that says ""Gee, now I know the big secret. The video kills people by doing what I just saw. What again is the motive for this, how again does it work through a plastic videotape, and why does it take 100 minutes of buildup for the basic or nonexistent answers I received? Huh, what? Distract me with the end credits and release a couple answers on a special edition DVD released in time for the sequel? Sure, sounds great.To make matters worse, no one in the movie is appealing. The protagonist is a pest and a (expletive). In addition to other annoyances, she's rude enough to walk up to someone's horse, let it out of its cage, and watch its resultant gory death as its little girl owner cries in horror, all without a word of apology or explanation. I can also ponder credibility leaps like how she can be holding a dessicated corpse while up to her waist in putrid water and not think too much of it.Of course I'll get a personal message ridiculing my stupidity. How dare I try to find logic in a film that, as a horror film, shouldn't apply to logic? It's simple. I got the film, got the message. But you know, after two hours and all that praise, I expected a better ending than that, or at least some explanation beyond ""it's just magical. Accept it."" Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a horror film too, but Leatherface didn't kill people by popping out of a tree and making his chainsaw hover at his victims. If a movie isn't going to bother being realistic, it should at least give a better explanation than this film did.But hey, this movie is the perfect conformist's exercise. Everyone else loves it, so surely I must be stupid if I don't. I guess I need to just watch it and accept it, not asking any questions or pointing out flaws in the story since that's clearly what everyone else has done. Then once I'm done with that I can go and love Blair Witch instead of actually wondering what it was on the screen that I was supposed to be terrified of.",The Ring

This movie is a thinking man's of a horror movie which requires one to put some efforts into figuring out what the movie is about and not have to spell it out for you.

399,patrick_bateman_90029,I went into total paranoia for a few weeks after viewing The Ring,9,1 February 2003,"I had received sneak passes to see The Ring early. I was expecting a film with some eerie elements, like The Sixth Sense or The Others. I wasn't expecting something that would send me deep into the dark tunnels of my own paranoia and leave me locked in it for a few weeks. I will kid you not. I am a person that doesn't get scared easily and The Ring shook and crumbled the very foundation. Gore Verbinski takes the basis of Ringu, the original Japanese version, and mixes in his own little twists to create the most frightening movie of 2002.SPOILERSThere were two scenes that scared me the absolute most.A) The first being when Ruth tells Rachel about how Katie's face looked when they found her body and they do that quick flash of Katie's body falling out of the closet with that disturbing look of shock embedded in her face. What made that scene so eerie, besides the make-up, was the sound effects used and the fact that you weren't expecting it to happen at all.B) Whoever says that the scene with Samara coming out of the well and the TV in the end wasn't scary is probably lying because they refuse to admit it. That was the scene that sent me into paranoia because I have a TV in my room that's right in front of my bed. Imagine how frightened I was when I was getting ready for bed and having to eye my TV the entire time. The way it's shot and the way Samara moves sends your nerves straight to Hell.END SPOILERSThe film also showcases an excellent cast, including Naomi Watts, fresh off her voyeuristic role in Mulholland Drive, Martin Henderson, Brian Cox, and Daveigh Chase, who takes her sweet roles of Donnie Darko's younger sister and the voice of Lilo and totally changes into Samara, the black-haired, dead-eyed girl with a mind of pure evil.Be warned: don't see The Ring alone.",The Ring
400,driffma,At least I saw it at the cheap second run place.,1,16 February 2003,"Movie Review for The Ring By MaxDRoger Ebert said of the movie Pearl Harbor, that is was 'a two hour movie crammed into three.' I mention that only because Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, performs a trick of time manipulation similar in scope and power. He manages to make two hours seem like four. Essentially he has crafted a test of human mental endurance: How long can a mind be subjected to the insanely boring?The Ring tells the tail of a cursed videotape that kills who ever watches it precisely seven days post viewing. Whoever watches the tape gets a phone call right after the tape ends. A whispery voice, says 'Seven days.' (It is interesting that every one who gets this call knows that it means they have only seven days to live. No one ever thinks to ask, 'Seven Days what? Who is this?). Our heroes are a divorced single-mother of a withdrawnchild-professional-journalist-torn between her career and motherhood-type, a withdrawn child who draws weird pictures and is mildly psychic, and the slacker-video expert ex-husband. The journalist is put on the case by a grieving sister confused by the mysterious circumstances of her daughter's death. 'You ask questions its what you do.' Says the grieving sister to the journalist. Great. From there on we know that at the very least the journalist and the withdrawn boy-who draws eerie premonitory pictures will see the tape. That much does not shock us. What is shocking is the fact that no one takes the news, 'seven days', too hard. We might expect this from the journalist, she is used to working with deadlines, but what about the kid? Or how about the slacker ex-husband? In fact no one really gets too worked up about it at all.The Ring begins much the same way Scream, a superior movie to be sure, did, with one minor variation. Instead of one young teenage girl alone in a big house out in the middle of nowhere, there are two. Actually there are other variations in this scene. For instance, Verbinski opted to substitute snappy dialogue with the utterly banal. He also managed to remove any tension or malice from the opening scene or any scene. We, the audience, are never scared, we are never made to jump, and we never, ever care.What is on the cursed tape? It is supposed be like someone's nightmare. However it is full of images that are not as menacing, disturbing or scary as they could be. I will not bore you with the details I wish the film had not bored me with them. Actually I will bore you with one detail. Embedded in the images are the all clues an enterprising journalist with a mildly psychic son, and a video expert ex-husband need to unravel the motives, and origin of the malevolent force behind the tape. The son however is no help at all. While he is obviously in contact with the malevolent force, and could provide some valuable information to the other heroes, he is a cliché.He is the disturbed boy who voices his deeper revelations through cryptic drawings. This means that to the rest of the cast he will only speak in sentence fragments, nods and grunts while trying hard to look mysterious and somewhat beyond.The mistake Gore Verbinski makes, well the most important one anyway, was to think he had a film more important than he really did. At the heart of this film is a Friday night teen horror flick. He misses this and instead tries to make a film that is deeper, and more mysterious. He cannot do this because he is, after all, working the script he was given. The result is a ponderous film, that tries to beat into you, with clichéd shot after clichéd shot (the film uses every cinematic convention in the horror filmmaker's arsenal), that it is a film with depth and originality. On top of that he steals from truly engaging suspense/horror films: Psycho, Halloween, The Exorcist, Scream, The Sixth Sense. I am sure I am missing others, but I hope you will not fault me their omission. After all, about 20 minutes before the film was to roll the blessed credits, I had pulled out my cell phone and began playing brick attack.",The Ring

Most horror films dont have a plot or good characters but this one had both. The entire film is full of suspense and some very jumpy moments.

I went in expecting to have the holy popcorn scared out of me, like a reviewer said. Did I? Nope. Yes, the tape was kind of creepy, and the noise that played during the tape, but pretty much everything else about it sucked. The acting was good, though, and so was the plot. However, they don't explain a damn thing. For instance: Who made the tape? Who calls you when you watch the tape? Why hasn't anyone in the movie ever heard of star-six-nine? *SPOLIER, I SUPPOSE* And when Rachel says, ""What did I do that he didn't?"", she comes to the conclusion that she made a copy. Well, yeah, AND you went down in the well and held the girl's corpse. And anyway, it's impossible to see a ring of light when you push a lid onto a well AFTER you see the half-moon shape.

I would honestly say this is one of the 10 scariest movies ever released in an American theater, and the scariest I've seen since The Exocist was re-released.

406,bayou_hannibal,Easily the best true horror movie of the past 20 years,8,1 August 2012,"Ever since the horror genre reached its peak in the late 70s and early 80s, it has almost completely dropped off the map. There are movies branded as ""horror"" films, but they are either crummy rip-offs, sequels, or lame ""slasher"" movies that provide no atmosphere. Or, they are psychological thriller types like Silence of the Lambs, which is a great movie but barely fits into the genre. The truly great ones have told interesting stories while frightening us with the ugly side of our nature. The truly great ones, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Exorcist, are unsettling enough to make a grown man like me have a little more trouble sleeping that night.The Ring is one of two horror movies of the past 20 years that I think are legitimately worth owning (the other being The Sixth Sense). It is a great movie for the same reasons that The Shining, The Omen, and The Thing are great movies – because it is creative, it tells a great story, and it has great atmosphere. It also features a threat that you can't hide or run away from. The monster is scary because you don't get to see it for most of the movie. When you finally get to see the ""monster"" at the end, it is a spectacular, surprise climax – one of my favorite horror scenes of all time. The Ring is highly unpredictable, and at the end, it has a meaning that is completely different from what you expected it to be. It is a movie that gets better the second time that you see it, because once you know how it ends, you notice the themes a lot better – themes that are relevant and play off of the things that we see in our life that scare us.I have seen mixed opinions about whether The Ring is better than the original Japanese Ringu. It is rare that I say this, but in this case, the remake is better. If you ask me, a lot better. Why? In my humble opinion, it is because of the outstanding cinematography and production values that this movie showcases. The vibe of this movie is ""David Fincher meets Twin Peaks"". The sound effects, especially, are fantastic. The movie revolves around a mysterious videotape that is supposedly fatal to watch. When you finally get to see that tape, we see that it is nothing but a bunch of short, black and white video clips spliced together. But boy, is it creepy, and that is because of the sound that comes out of it. It is so creepy that if you hadn't been told how dangerous it was during the movie, you would immediately figure it out on your own.This movie does have one big weakness and that is the acting. Bryan Cox is in a brief supporting role, and he is good. Naomi Watts gives a somewhat flat performance as the main character. When she has to step up and show a bit of emotion, she doesn't do it very well. For the rest of the cast, it's no-name city. Watts's son and ex-boyfriend are equally ""meh"" in their performances. I don't mind that much though, because Watts's character dominates the screen time, and she is almost a passive observer. Although she has a personal stake in solving the movie's mystery, she spends almost all of the movie just asking people questions, researching, and watching.The Ring is a movie that deserves a score higher than the one that it has here on IMDb. I would give it a 10 to try and prop it up, but it's not quite a masterpiece like The Thing. I think that The Ring suffers a bit, public perception-wise, from having started the short-lived ""Japanese horror"" fad of the mid-oughts. Creepy ghost children became old hat almost immediately, so now this movie looks like just another flick that tried to score cheap thrill points by following along. What none of the other ""creepy ghost children"" movies like ""Dark Water"" and ""The Grudge"" ever had was an interesting reason for the creepy ghost children to exist, or an interesting story. The Ring has those in spades, along with the ability to make itself linger in your mind for a long time after you turn off the TV.",The Ring
407,gvf,didn't sleep too well for days after I watched it,8,15 June 2006,"Thank God I now sleep tight again. This doesn't really happen to me much after scary movies, but boy did it happen with this one. As far as the scariness factor goes, this movie has it all. Creepy story about a dead girl's ghost seeking revenge, very disturbing special effects that make you want to crawl and hide under your blanket, split-second shock effects that will bring you close to cardiac arrest... and an overall mood that is very dark and eerie.Never mind the plot holes that some reviewers here have pointed out, this film has already become a modern classic for its unique attempt to leave the beaten path and try something not substantially new, but innovative enough.At least I'll never look the same again at white noise on a TV screen late at night.. who knows what's gonna come crawling out? ...you'll know what I mean once you've watched it. But be warned - the worst setting in which to enjoy this movie is home alone at night after a couple of beers. And I should know...",The Ring
408,witness-7,Not bad for a horror movie,7,31 March 2003,"Scary movies have had something of a renaissance over the past few years. After the devil-baby prime time of the early 1970s, the genre fell into horrible self-parody, high school squeal reflex actions, sex-and-death associations for post-pubescents, the franchising of countless sequels, and quick pocket change for many a B movie queen.But just when the self-parody-parody set in (e.g. ""Scary Movie""), so came a few experiments that worked: The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, etc. The Ring, owing to its Japanese origins free from the American massacre of the American massacre film, qualifies among them. While it falls short on a lot of levels, many criticisms stem from my improved expectations from scary movies of late.To its credit, the movie delivers the scares. There's enough to keep your interest throughout the film, and for the most part the movie rides the right side of the scary-silly line. There's a lot of good and convincing acting. There's a good plot with the right amount of the unexplained to keep you guessing -- a nice change from most American movies where subtlety comes with a sledgehammer.But therein also lies some of its flaws. In the end there are clearly too many questions and inconsistencies left behind. For every question that might be best left unanswered for effect (***spoiler*** : for example, how was Samara conceived, and what made her evil), there were multiple inconsistencies in the plotlines that left the movie feeling incomplete. Other areas were spelled out that either detracted from the plot or added nothing (***spoiler***: Did you really have to show Samara crawling out the the TV? ***non-spoiler***: And what did it add that Aidan turned out to be the son of Rachel and Noah in some kind of Darth Vader-lite plotline?).As for plotline, to its credit, many parts worked. However, some did not. There were a few scenes where I had a far greater urge to laugh (and did) at a ridiculous situation than be frightened by it. And while unravelling the mystery makes for a good story, the 40,000-ft view of this movie is little more than a fatalistic episode of Scooby Doo.Sorry, but contrary to some opinions here, the child actor (David Dorfman) who played Aidan was stiff, annoying, and wholly unconvincing. It made me realize how much of a joke ""Sixth Sense"" could have been without Mr. Osment. By the end I was hoping for some kind of mythical man-month math, wanting Aidan to watch 7 copies of the tape so they could eliminate his character in a single day. But the performances by Naomi Watts and particularly Brian Cox are solid.Some scenes interestingly struck me as something lifted completely out of Japanese comic books or anime -- like the scene where Noah is first walking up to Rachel's apartment in the rain in his hooded coat, his wet hair flying about.The fact that I wrote this much about it says something. Despite all its flaws, it's a good movie (7/10). But the gaping holes and questions at the end are too much to call it a classic by any means.",The Ring
409,princesss_buttercup3,You've got to be kidding me.,5,19 June 2008,"While this was definitely not the worst horror film (or ""psychological thriller"", as some have erroneously dubbed it) I've ever seen, it most certainly is not worthy of ""scariest film ever"" status. It's creepy and strange, but also totally hokey and full of plot holes. This is basically a teenage-level horror film that's pretending to be much more. It's an insult to the viewer's intelligence, as well as actual psychological thrillers like pretty much any Hitchcock, or more recently ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others."" My specific critiques are given below.*SPOILERS AHEAD* Firstly, the whole phone call thing. Lame. That was so unnecessary and was just plain silly. HOKEY. How many other scary movies did that plot point steal from? Creative.Second, the girl crawling out of the television. I seriously laughed out loud. That was supposed to be the scariest thing we've seen in a movie since ""The Shining""? Please. It would have been much scarier if the people watching the video had gotten sucked into it.Third, the marbles forming in the shape of the arrow. Also laughed out loud there.Finally, and I think this was the main weakness of the movie. WHAT was Samara's motivation??? Up until the ""twist"", it at least seemed plausible that she was trying to be freed from her ""dark place."" But when it's revealed that she'd been hurting people *before* that and her fall into the well was the result, not the cause, of her misdeeds, everything just unravels. The whole POINT of the psychological thriller is to reveal *why* the person is doing what they're doing. They hinted that the circumstances around her birth were suspicious-- why couldn't they carry that out a bit-- was she the spawn of Satan? A demon? Was she conceived by some voodoo curse? For cryin' out loud, give us something to work with. The whole ""Evil for evil's sake"" is a cop out and totally uninteresting.I'd give it a 5 out of 10.",The Ring
410,olympicator,"Thrilling, but doesn't resolve the issues it addresses",6,11 November 2013,"The Ring is a horror movie about a video that kills people. If you watch it, you will experience hallucinations for seven days, and then die mysteriously. The movie's protagonist, a single mother named Rachel, watches the movie in the hopes of finding out what caused the death of her niece; but Rachel soon realizes that she is going to be the movie's next victim.In The Ring, we find that the video was created by a girl named Samara, an adopted child whose origins are never explained, much like Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights. But, while Bronte's novel shows Heathcliff's demented psyche to be the result of much harsh treatment at the hands of his adopted family, this movie shows precisely no explanation for how Samara came to be the satanic, sadistic child that the movie reveals her to be. She was adopted by a couple who wanted a child. Was this girl the creation of witches, or goblins, or Satan himself? There are hints that she is an aberration upon nature itself: her presence causes horses to go mad and pitch themselves into the ocean. Similarly, in Macbeth, the title character causes nature to go awry because, by murdering the king and taking his place, he has interrupted the great chain of being. But Samara, as far as we know, has committed no act that violates nature. She simply is a violation of nature, was born a violation of nature. Either that, or her adopted parents were extremely cruel to her, but nowhere in the movie is there evidence of such cruelty.The movie is a fantasy – televisions turn on by themselves; people's images are distorted in photographs; a mysterious phone call informs Rachel, moments after she watches the movie, that she has ""seven days"" to live (couldn't she do *69 or something to determine the source of the call?). Yet it also does a remarkable job of imitating a detective story. One by one, the odd images of the videotape are all explained by what Rachel sees in her research. Unfortunately, her research never does more than lap the surface.How, for instance, did Samara create this videotape in the first place? How did she distribute it? Why does she attack people whom she does not even know? The ready answer is, ""She is evil, it is her duty to do evil deeds."" Rachel's ex-boyfriend Noah remarks, upon examining the videotape, that it does not read like a normal tape and that its lack of a proper imprint is like a person being ""born without fingerprints."" That captures Samara to a T: she has no fingerprints. She came from nowhere, she returned to the nowhere, and she insists on dragging people with her retroactively.Samara has no remarkable effect upon anyone's personality. She has nothing to say about the real world, or how people ought to live their lives. For all practical purposes Samara is not a person at all, but simply a monster whose form happens to be that of young girl. Rachel knows she will not bring her niece back from the dead; she watches the videotape out of curiosity, and love for her niece. Five minutes after she has watched the tape, the niece is as good as forgotten, because Rachel must protect her own life. She investigates for the sake of survival, and because the story behind the tape is, I must admit, moderately engaging and it arouses her curiosity. But we watch because the evil of Samara terrifies us. Ignorance has always been the chief source of fear: the less comprehensible the object, the more powerful the fear it inspires.This focus on the concept of fear lends itself to the fact that the movie is, in the end, about a videotape. Most people in the world have little or no idea how a videotape actually works. You pop it in the VCR, and the movie starts; you neither know nor care what happens inside of the VCR. It is only the image on the television – the surface, not the depth – that matters. In our modern world of information technology, we are farther and farther distanced from the inner workings of the mechanisms that daily serve us. We want only the images, not the wires and sparks within. And so this movie asks the question, ""What happens when a videotape is possessed by a fantastical spirit? What kind of repairman do you call for that? He'd be just as confused as anyone else.""The Ring contains no redemption, or morality; it is horror for the sake of horror. Needless to say it is not the first of its kind; but it is a half-hearted attempt to be something more. My problem with The Ring is not even that the movie raises questions and fails to answer them – the questions themselves are never formed or articulated. Throughout the movie there is a loosely visited theme of families staying together, but neither Samara's family nor Rachel's family obtains the unity it deserves. ""How can we live without any love?"" Rachel's son Aidan seems to ask of the audience. Aidan alone seems determined to coexist with Samara, to live within the bizarre parameters that she has set. They are parameters we can neither see nor chart, but they are there, and Samara has provided a way to survive if you can figure out the route.There is no ""ring"" in The Ring; the title refers to something different, although you might figure it out before I did. Relationships between people end unhappily in this movie, but the evil of the videotape runs uninterrupted. Samara is, somehow, the absolute, and when the movie finishes her hold on the world has not been weakened. And although Rachel solves the mystery of Samara's effect on her adopted parents, Samara's origins remain a mystery, and the filmmaker shows no interest in solving this other, deeper mystery.",The Ring

Whichmakes me want to rant on WHY this one made a PG-13 rating inspite of its thematic content and yet a light romantic comedy likeKissing Jessica Stein received an R. but I'll abstain.
Comparatively, this version is more engrossing than the Japaneseoriginal (1997) and although it does flesh the original script out abit, it still fails to live up to its creepy theme - that a supernaturalpresence is killing people by having them watch a videotapedpicture puzzle riddle.  The Japanese version depended too heavilyon the metaphysical and internal struggle of its heroine (and herclairvoyant ex-husband) and as a result it doesn't pack much of anemotional punch.  The American version brings more of that innerturmoil to the surface and we are able to follow along as she tripsand stumbles and figures her way through this nightmare.The production values are all good, particularly with re: to thevideotape itself and the collective imagery it holds.  It's a well-shotmovie, and the DOP deserves kudos for a job well done. 
The performances are all fine, and the story is full of possibility, butthe delivery is lacking and could have been much better.  I blamethe director, Gore Verbinski, who has failed to live up to hispotential before (The Mexican, Mouse Hunt).  In what otherprofession can a man make millions by being mediocre? 
Naomi Watts deserves better material than this, as does theunder-used Jane Alexander, who makes an appearance here asan island doctor who may or may not have a clue to what's goingon.

They're all the same; immature young adults move into a house rumored to be haunted. ""The Ring,"" however, is a different story. It is truly disturbing and mind-boggling. It is probably the scariest movie I've seen in years.From the moment I saw the videotape - which will kill its viewers in seven days - to the very end of the movie, I was totally freaked out. ""The Ring"" doesn't rely on jumping out of your seat but constantly builds the tension, giving a sensation like that's going to happen. But it never does.""The Ring"" relies on images. There are times in which there is no music and very little sound, but what we see is scary and enough to give us nightmares. Director Gore Verbinski shows us the remains of victims killed by the videotape, courtesy of Rick Baker, he shows us an eerie video tape with a mysterious woman brushing her hair, looking in the mirror, among other things on the tape.""The Ring"" asks tons of questions but never answers them, leaving it remain mysterious.

Well, I'm glad I saw it for only $4 w/ unlimited soda and popcorn, but I won't be seeing it again.  Short summary: If you happen to watch this videotape, you'll die in 7 days. After her niece's mysterious death, Rachel finds the tape and watches it. She decides to figure out who made the tape and why, and how to possibly avoid death, before her time is up.To me, there are different horror categories. First there are the realistic and the unrealistic.  Realistic are the ones with human serial killers or ghosts.  In the unrealistic, the ""killers"" may be some kind of robots, aliens, or in the case of The Ring, a videotape.  I like watching both types, but the realistic kinds scare me more because I walk out knowing something like that could really happen, or have happened.  There are 3 other groups to divide horror movies.  There's the scary ones(like Scream), the creepy/spooky ones(like The Others), and the sad/freaky ones(like The Ring).  This movie will probably scare some people, but not me.   I usually get scared at movies that have a lot of suspense and moments that make me jump.  This movie was suspenseful, but there was no moments to jump.  And I don't understand why people would scream.  It really is more of a mystery type movie than a horror movie.

What the Japanese version Ringu (1998), the meaning of water for Japanese people, the way it was shot, symbolism and the over all plot development is, to this day, is phenomenal. Dated yes, but can stand up on its'own.Sadoko in the Japanes version is just freaking scary. Those who have seen it, know the well scene can scare the living daylights out of viewers. Nevertheless credit is due to the American version where the lead female character Rachel, played out by Naomi Watts is more fleshed out and modernized. This may be a cultural thing, but the Japanese Reiko Asakawa comes across as submissive to her male counterpart.The ring a a great movie and the pacing is well constructed, but if you have seen the Japanese film first, than you may end up not liking this film.",The Ring
421,tsheridan94,I absolutely love this movie,8,5 February 2010,"The Ring remains to this day one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. It is not particularly violent, like all those cruddy (and the occasionally decent) slasher film. But honestly, is there anyone who doesn't get a chill running down their spines when they show those dead bodies with the gray skin and hollowed out eyes staring out at nothing. This movie honestly gave me a nightmare the night after I watched it.And that videotape. With its odd, seemingly random images flashing across the screen. I remember distinctly the falling chair, a ladder leaning against a wall, a tree standing isolated in the middle of an empty feel. These images by themselves wouldn't be able to generate anything remotely resembling fear, but it's not the images. It's the relative calm and oddity of these pictures that leads to a feeling of unrest, a feeling that something more sinister is lurking just out of sight.This is Gore Verbinski's best movie. Period. I liked all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies a lot, too, but none of them come remotely close to achieving the upper echelons of their respective genres, as the Ring did, at least in my opinion. And honestly,perhaps most terrifying of all...is just seeing-her. With the long dark hair hanging ominously over her face, so no expression is visible.This movie is relentless. Something is always waiting in the dark, around the next turn. And then just when you think it's over...the movie hits full throttle. The pacing starts off quickly, and just continues to pick up speed. The Ring is the definition of the phrase ""Never a dull moment.""This is another movie to watch alone, in the dark, just like Alien. The difference-once Alien is over, you can say the terror was long in the future, on an isolated spaceship. The Ring is here and now. And with nothing stopping her, that cold-hearted terror, it seems just within the realm of possibility that she is coming up behind you now, as you read this, about to strike...",The Ring
422,MrMowji,Just cinematography was OK,1,23 September 2017,"Some points:At the beginning, how did exactly Katie's friend (Becca) know about the video tape? Somebody already found out that he/she needs to make a copy to survive and tell someone else the story?When they gonna watch TV, they sit very close to them, and no one wear glasses.Two of Katie's friends who watched the tape too, died in a car accident (crashed into a tree). They had TVs on their car? Or was they just running?So, Samara can control water, cameras, photos, and TVs (or at least their remotes), open refrigerators, call people and talk or leave a message after the beep, burn things. All of that, when she's a ghost. We must just accept it without any explanation.When Rachel is visiting Becca, how did Becca know that Rachel watched the tape? Does Samara control friends of people who watched the tape?What was that nose bleeding and taking a fly from TV?Typing fast into a local HTML file (from Desktop) and still using the mouse (with slow motion) to click the Search button. Just press Enter.How does Samara's father know about the tape?Why did Rachel suddenly attract to the horse in the ship? Just leave him alone. You're hurting him.""Are you OK?"" ""Yeah, I'm fine."" Seriously, your daughter just died in a horrible way, you just watched a man electrocuted himself in front of you.Too much symbolism and not-important events.",The Ring
423,LondonOnMyMind,Atmospheric horror at its best **SPOILERS**,8,1 April 2006,"The Ring is not only one of the best horror films in recent years, but also one of the best remakes. Contrary to some truly awful remakes, such as The Fog, The Ring does not drown (no morbid pun intended) in ridiculous back stories and unnecessary characters. Instead, director Gore Verbinski takes the Japanese Ringu and transfers the story's elements to the Western world, without having the narrative lose any of its dread. While Hideo Nakata's original may have presented the fear in a more subtle manner, mostly using the actors' reactions and the imagined rather than seen, Verbinski presents it by way of gloomy, tense cinematography, music that hints at the unexpected horror right around the corner and locales that do not exactly spell out domestic bliss. Simply put, Verbinski is not attempting to translate Ringu; he is adapting the Japanese film in a new way and fully succeeding at conveying its themes of urban loneliness, parental worry and, of course, its supernatural aspects.Needless to say, I loved the rainy, shadowy atmosphere of Seattle. Had the story been set anywhere else, the menace of the piece would have been lost. The dark weather also adds to the ending, further accentuating Samara's evil intentions.The acting is good all around. Naomi Watts is great as a serious, rational reporter who has to confront an unbelievable, yet very real danger, all the while protecting her son. Martin Henderson also strikes a chord as a not-quite-grown-up father, whose outlook is also changed by the deadly video tape.An excellent horror film, made even better by its underlying socio-cultural themes and unique imagery.8/10",The Ring
424,JSSTyger,Great Horror Film,10,19 February 2006,"First i would like to say those of you who saw Ringu first should not even comment on this film. Why? because once you see one of them you begin having expectations for the other. Once one scares the crap out of you do you really believe the other one is going to scare you as much?? For those of us that did not see Ringu first, this was the horror movie we have all been waiting for. No pyschos with knives. No blood/gore. I found in some of the comments that this movie was unoriginal and in some of the other comments the movie did not follow the horror guidelines...well those two statements are pretty much contradictory which means those people are just blabbing for attention. If you are looking for an original horror movie i guess you can count out scream 1, 2, and 3, all the Friday the 13th and Jason movies, all the psycho movies ie. Silence of the Lambs, etc. Is it possible for a horror movie to be original?? The Ring is about as close as you can get to original.And now to blast away the people who gave negative reviews even further. Most of us know that what we fear the most is the unknown. The origin of Samara and her powers are not revealed to us. But honestly do we have to know? Many things do not need explained but will still scare the crap out of people. If you ever thought you saw a ghost you would neither care or think about how it got there and you would be scared out of your wits. Why are you scared? Because most supernatural phenomena cannot be explained and you cannot possibly understand it. Samara is pure evil...that is all we need to know to be scared of her...the most dreadful sadistic girl you can imagine. She has the frightening ability to burn horrific images into your mind and drive you crazy, all the while you feel your death approaching. This is how scary Samara is...and how scary the movie is. And you don't even need to know a thing about Samara to be scared.The story of this movie is actually well thought of. Contrary to what you may read in some of the negative reviews, this movie does have a great story and is not exactly difficult to follow. I saw one review where one person said that the movie never explained the chronology of events about the horses and how the child, Samara, affected the horses. Are you kidding?? This was fully explained. Anna Morgan was driven insane by the images Samara was revealing to her in her mind. Anna and Richard Morgan decided to banish Samara to their barn, hoping the separation would help stop all of it. While Samara was in the barn, she grew annoyed of the horses and decided to drive them insane. This was an act of revenge for being put in the barn.Now lets talk about the two things that make up a great movie...story and acting. The story is pretty much original, especially the scare tactics. Some of you say they are cheap. Cheap????? They scared the crap out of me. Quick flashes of distorted faces and horrific images do not allow the brain to settle/desensitize. Seconds or Minutes after each ""scare"" that one quick moment is etched into your mind...the summation of all these moments is the main reason why many of us are still scared of this movie even 10 days after we first watched it. The split-second shots of katie's face and Samara's eye did it for me. The storyline is understandable. Some of these people comment about how the story just doesn't make sense. Well I'm sure if they popped in the movie one more time and stopped whining about how this isn't a Friday the 13th or Scream Stabber movie, they would be able to follow the story pretty easily. As for the acting...well Naomi Watts was perfect and the others, while not being excellent, did an good enough job to where their bad acting did not take away from the film.Because this film has the originality that most horror films do not, and because this movie scared the crap out of me, i have no choice but to give this movie a 10 out of 10 rating",The Ring

426,sarastrahan-61184,Seven Days!,10,16 October 2021,"20 years later and The Ring still packs a major wallop. Gore Verbinski drenches his film in rainy, grey dread throughout and Naomi Watts gives one of her best performances as Rachel, a journalist who's niece dies under mysterious circumstances that she discovers revolve around a creepy video tape that causes anyone who watches it to die seven days later.How they die is anyone's guess and that's where the dread of the film plays a huge part. We all know that seventh day is coming, but we don't know exactly what horrors await us and the characters. The mystery is compelling as well and keeps the audience invested until we get that final, terrifying answer.",The Ring

Depends on how much you care about the plot and characters because even the scariest of scenarios will fizzle if the character does something stupid. On the other hand this is a atmospheric film with a strange, scary vibe(thanks to Gore Verbinski). To describe The Ring, two adjectives leap to mind: spooky and lame. The former refers to the tone and atmosphere, which are about as good as it gets for a ghost story. The latter refers to the storyline, which is about as poorly constructed as can be imagined - a sad amalgamation of irritating contrivances and gaping plot holes that defy even a generous attempt to suspend disbelief. And, while I normally appreciate open-ended motion pictures, The Ring takes things too far by leaving about 75% of its questions unanswered. This isn't an artistic choice; it's screenwriting sloppiness, and it results in a profoundly dissatisfying experience.",The Ring
429,Beerdrinking Dog,I'm still shivering...,9,17 January 2003,"I just saw this movie in a sneak preview. I had heard some stuff about it, but nothing more than it was about a videotape killing people and that it was a remake of a japanese film called Ringu. I didn't really expect anything, but DAMN, was this film GOOD! Sure, it has lot's of loose ends that aren't tied, in fact most of them aren't, but I couldn't care less... This movie is all about atmosphere. The creepyness sets under your skin, waiting to attack when you least expect it. The hairs on my arms raised higher and higher throughout the film untill the climax gave me the final blow... I left the theater shivering and I'm still shivering now...Mind you, I don't scare easily and I thought The Blair Witch Project and The Mothman Prophecies (to name but a few) sucked beyond believe. But this movie got to me... I was alone, so I ended up mixing into other moviegoers conversations (who mostly thought the movie was boring and sucked), explaining the ending to them.... that was cool...Go see it unprecedended. Don't listen to everybody saying the original was better. It does NOT matter. This film is great in it's own right...

The ""not knowing"" and fear factors poked at all of our fears of the unknown. One of the most wonderful things about this film was the title.

The images come from a VHS tape that one youngster described as someone's nightmare. Perhaps. Strange nightmare. But then again, nightmares are supposed to be strange.Was the movie scary?I found it rather disturbing in a very strange sort of way. My 14 year old son and my wife did not. I found it just disturbing enough to watch it again. All in all, I really don't know weather I would recommend this movie or not. There are some plot holes, the pacing is off, the writing is not bad.

434,Skip_4591,"Scary, Mysterious, and Flawed, but Interesting and Entertaining",10,17 August 2006,"This is a good scary movie if you like stuff like ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Mothman Prophecies"". Everyone knows the plot, as this movie has become quite famous, but i'll tell it anyway: A reporter investigates the circumstances surrounding a videotape that causes your death in seven days if you watch it.This is a very entertaining and well-made movie, but there are a few problems.1. The dialogue in the first scene has to be some of the WORST dialogue I have ever heard in a movie in my life. It is lousy, unrealistic, and just plain atrocious. Luckily along came ""Scary Movie 3"" to make fun of it.2. There are some parts during the movie where the dialogue is also a little weak, although not as week as the absolutely dreadful first scene.3. There are some parts where Naomi Watts' character acts so dumb that its unrealistic. I mean, the character acts really stupid for no reason. I am keeping this review absolutely spoiler-free so I won't reveal any of those moments.That's about it. Other than those problems, the movie is quite fascinating. The acting is top-notch, its interesting, there are very entertaining elements, and its just plain fun to watch. Its also one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not get sick of (well, for a while at least). In fact, the movie is so entertaining and good that it automatically makes up for all the flaws.ALso, the directing by Gore Verbinski is outstanding. Best part of the film.I said it once and i'll say it again, if you like Twilight Zone or Mothman Prophecies or anything like that, then this is the movie for you.

It raises a scary barrage of questions that had me on the edge of my seat through most of the movie. The ending floored me -- but not in a good way. This is another one of those films that takes your expectations to the heights and then drops you with a sudden thud at the end. In the final analysis, the movie never explains nearly enough to satisfy. It doesn't even try. I am weary of movies without an adequate conclusion.

437,monkeybone,"Once you've read this, you will die in seven days.",8,13 March 2003,"As far as remake's go, Gore Verbinski's version of the Japanese horror film Ringu is one of the rarities that are as good as the original.Based on the same premise as it's predecessor, The Ring is about a mysterious video tape that when viewed, causes the watcher to die in seven days. Reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) catches wind of said tape after her niece dies under mysterious circumstances after reportedly viewing such a tape. She then tracks down the tape and views it for herself. Then what follows is a race against time as not just to save her own life, but the life of her son who accidentally watches it.What makes The Ring stand out is it relies on genuine scares and psychological terror to strike fear into the audience. Whereas most films use the 'it's-only-a-cat' routine, there is nothing in the movie that leaves the audience screaming at something ludicrous.In terms of acting, it is of high quality, especially from the Haley Joel Osment type sprog who has a sixth sense type of ability (that's being able to see dead people for those who haven't been initiated to the genre).Verbinski has proved himself a worthy director and the movie could stand him in good stead for future blockbuster's. It will also make you think twice about going down to the local video shop to hire out the latest titles. You never know, you may get a phone call saying you will die in seven days after watching it.",The Ring
438,Magnus-83,What a horror flick should be like,9,2 April 2003,"As a great fan of horror movies, I feel that the future looks promising for this genre. During the last two years, there are two movies in particular that have made an impression on me, ""The Others"" and ""The Ring"". What they have in common is the lack of excessive gore, something that otherwise seem to be the foundation of American horror. Instead, they are creepy and scary, ie they will terrify you, but they won't make you sick.The storyline of ""The Ring"" in short: A young reporter investigates the events surrounding a strange videotape, where a few people have died a week after watching this tape. During her investigations, she watches the videotape, and immediately after receives a phonecall by someone, telling her that she have seven days left to live. This quickens up the pace a bit, and this reporter eventually uncovers what she believes to be the truth of this cursed tape - Case closed? No, there is a twist, you see... And that's about all I'm going to tell you, watch the movie if you like to know more. ;-)In difference to some of the other reviewers that consider this to be a crappy movie, my verdict is that it is one of the greatest horror movies I've seen in recent years. A simple reason to disagree with them is this - Each and everyone with an internet connection and an e-mail address can write a review here on IMDB, regardless of experience, knowledge and judgement, and I know that writing reviews is NOT easy, if you like to communicate anything more than your own opinions and personal interpretations. Some reviewers claim that every movie they've seen is either the lowest piece of crap they ever seen, or the greatest movie to ever hit the market, with a total disregard for the fact that there is quite a span between ""utter rubbish"" and ""finest piece of work ever done"". It's hard to take that kind of shallowness seriously.Thus, I rate ""The Ring"" as 8½ out of 10 - It's a great horror flick, but I don't think it's the best I have ever seen.Others have complained about ""The Ring"" as being too much of a 6th Sense-ripoff, and claims that anyone who compares this movie to ""The 6th Sense"" is doing the latter movie a great injustice. Well, on the contrary, in my opinion - ""The 6th Sense"", although a good horror flick is far from as good as ""The Ring"", as it relies more on blood and gore (all the ghosts you see are either decaying, covered in blood and gore or puking) than horror, in order to scare you. Unfortunately, blood and gore equals to horror to a good part of the American crowd, but I believe Europeans have a little more taste than that. Covering everything with ketchup is a very cheap trick, and it don't work on me. Otherwise, ""Black Hawk Down"" would be the pinnacle of the horror genre. ;-)The bottom line is this: If you like to watch a great horror flick with a creepy mood, some unexpected twists and a good deal of mystery, this is the movie for you. If blood, gore and excessive use of sound effects is what you like, I'd recommend you to watch ""Pet Sematary"", ""Night Flier"", ""Terror on Elm Street"" or some other splatter movie. ;-)""The Ring"" is a horror movie, no more, no less.",The Ring
439,cnwiper,Blissful horror....,7,21 February 2003,"One can safely comment that this movie is absorbing and highly entertaining..The concept that the viewing of a videotape leads to a certain death 7 days later and the struggle to prevent such demise in the meantime while time is steadily running out attracts the attention and interest of the viewer who is captured by the charm of the dark life threatening secret from the first scene and is not released until the end or long after it even...The acting is solid ,the characters behavior not always ""smart"" but believable , the visual effects convincing ,the atmosphere impressive and it maintains both the agony and the guesswork in your mind active throughout.""Im scared but i love it "" would be an accurate description of the experience. I wont reveal the exact plot but i will make a couple of general comments on it so if you belong to the category of viewers that don't wish to know anything about the storyline don't read any further.The first observation is that the actual killings are not shown while committed .This ""just before and after"" approach which is handled well gives the film a less bloody profile and effectively helps to remove of it the label of ""another horror movie"" since bloodbaths have become very much a cliché that provokes disgust but not necessarily fear. But is the movie a thriller proper? Well , if you expect at the end of it to leave the movie theatre with all the answers you will be a little bit disappointed.As in most movies that employ the supernatural as part of the explanation more questions than the ones answered are created and that for me is not a triviality.. If on the other hand you are not bothered with such approaches you can be sure that you will be in happy agony for 2 hours .It is certain that you wont regret your choice to see this otherwise impressive piece of film making. i would rate it 7.5/10",The Ring
440,LoveCoates,"forget the plot holes, this is an instant-classic chiller",10,25 October 2002,"The Ring is not a horror movie or even a thriller. This is definitely a ""chiller,"" an emerging genre which seems to be blossoming after the success of The Blair Witch Project. Like other movies of it's ilk, it combines the sometimes sickening fright value of horror movies with the thrillers' unique way of packing a suspenseful detective story into a ticking-clock (""i hope they make it...i hope the make it...""). It's a distinctly non-Hollywood kind of filmmaking, I can't think of any of the popular chillers of the past few years that has been particularly satisfying for an American audience so used to nice, neat endings. The one that came closest to tying everything up, The Sixth Sense, is also the most celebrated, interestingly enough. Yes, a lot goes answered at the end -- some of it is deliberately ambiguous, some of it begs questions that actually SHOULD have been answered, and a lot of it can't make any sense. This movie's biggest flaw is asking questions that it never even attempts to address, let alone answer.But plot is not the strength of this film. It's strength is an impending sense of dread -- the waiting for the horror to happen -- and this movie is so great for making you feel that dread almost constantly. There are great stretches in the film when nearly nothing ""scary"" in the traditional sense happens, but looking around in the theater at all the covered faces, you would think somebody was getting knocked-off every three minutes.
Kudos to the director and the cinematographer Bozen Bazelli for creating what I think is the most visually-arresting movie since Requiem for a Dream. I recently saw a preview of the director's upcoming project Butterfly, which, despite being a science-fiction melodrama, is just as hard on an audience as The Ring. It's what you see and how it is shot that frightens you, rather than you what know. Zimmerman's score is incredible -- I just bought it today, and I saw the movie last night. There's nothing here to challenge last summer's The Others as the best of the new chillers, neither will this film keep you up at night (like Blair Witch did if you saw it before the hoax was exposed). But it is a feast for the senses, and well-worth the money, which is true of few movies these days. Ignore the plot holes, and just LOOK.",The Ring
441,LoveCoates,"A Complex, Multi-layered Chiller (the simple-minded need not apply)",10,31 October 2002,"It appears only time will redeem The Ring. The response to it reminds me of the hoopla surrounding Blair Witch Project: mixed reviews from critics, a pleased audience, followed by a swift and bitter backlash.Like Blair Witch, film history will no doubt be more fair, since again we find audiences going into a movie expecting an American horror film, like I did, and coming out with something rich and layered.Unfortunately for an audience used to simplistic, straightforward stories, The Ring becomes something much more complex. It's not a linear, Aristotelian story. It's very Eastern in its use of circular time, of yin-and-yang. Everything is not neatly wrapped-up at the end. It leaves you with a myriad of questions and a bad taste in your mouth.That bad taste is why it took my friends and I multiple viewings and several discussions to decide if we liked The Ring or not. It begs for -- and holds up under -- multiple viewings. This is a movie for careful viewers. Important details and lines are delivered only once, and even then they are mysterious. Certain elements have double- and sometimes even triple-meanings. Your understanding of it hinges on being able to interpret symbols.In other words: there's a lot of figuring out to do. What critics are calling plot holes I call vagueness. A plot hole means that the explanation is just not there: it's a goof. In The Ring, it's all there, it's just not all-spelled-out. There's a difference.If you're the type of person who likes your movies wrapped in pretty paper and handed to you in a bow, do not bother investing time in The Ring. This is not a cheap horror movie. The horror may be choppy, jumpy, maybe even old. But the meanings are very subtle, and the meanings are where the meat of this movie lie.And to be fair to the movie, lots of it is damn scary, too.I don't think anything like this has been seen on the American screen before. This is a higher level of film-making. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography, which does not deserve to be an afterthought here, is masterful...this is one of the best movies ever made. 10/10.",The Ring
442,etale,Horses in Place of Volcano-A different look at a horror masterpiece,10,4 August 2003,"Now that I've seen the original Japanese version of THE RING, I would be hard-pressed to choose between the two films. Both films are not that faithful to the novel, I understand (Can't verify it until an English translation comes out), but the US version is generally a mirror of RINGU. Except that the female protagonist in the US version is a much stronger character than her Japanese counterpart. That is because of the difference in our cultures.Another difference is that we seemed to replace the volcano from the original with the strange death of one woman's horses. The horse-owner replaces the psychic, placing more of the power in the daughter (It's also interesting that it is the mother in the US version who throws the daughter into the well, while it was the father in the Japanese version). Verbinski (or the script writer) was wise to set it in the Seattle area, so to echo the original's obsession with water.

The cinematography alone was enough to keep me there, but the story line, the plot, the ending...all of it was so twisted and catchy like the first time watching the Closure videos by NIN.

450,flying-monkeys,THE Best Scary Movie...Ever!,10,24 October 2002,"I'm an avid horror/suspense/thriller fan and this flick blew me away! First off with the vagueness of the trailers you really don't know what to expect and I tried not to find out too much about the movie ahead of time--my usual practice with scary movies because lately the movies seemed ruined by the detailed trailers. So going into this movie all I was thinking was ""When you see the ring, you die.""The suspense was terrific! The shock/surprise of the first scary image (if you've seen the movie you know what I'm referring to) was awesome. And then of course from their it just builds and builds until THE scariest movie scene I've ever watched (to date, that I can remember). I definitely give this film two thumbs up! Don't read too much about it, if you can, it'll increase the fear factor.And a bonus was you didn't figure the whole story out 15 minutes into the movie. I'm notorious for guessing the entire plot and then sitting for an hour and a half waiting for it to play itself out. Not with this movie. About halfway through I even turned to my sister and said ""I don't know where they're going with this...I am confused."" LOL it was great. So definitely give this movie a view or two. And thanks to the creators for restoring my faith in the scary movie makers ;)",The Ring
451,beccabentley,Truly terrifying stuff!!,9,5 June 2003,"My husband took me to see this film and when he said it was a horror I was expecting to sit through another of his kind of horror films i.e.stupid teenagers with lots of gratuitous blood, guts and violence thrown in. I was fortunately very mistaken! I have not seen the original ""Ringu"", which everyone keeps harping on about, but I am glad I saw this first as it is good not to have anything to compare it to. Taken by itself, I think it is a fantastic film. It's not everyone's cup of tea and the usual horror fans may think it slow, incomprehensible or just plain unscary. However, I loved the mystery and weirdness of it.It begins a bit like your typical American nonsense with two teenage girls chatting and the conversation coming around to a videotape that is supposed to kill people that watch it. My first thought was: how ""urban legend""ish and ridiculous!! However, as the film went on, it clearly had a darker, more powerful and very much more thought provoking aspect. The images on the videotape itself are so ""nightmarish"", in that disjointed and freaky way that real nightmares can be. They really got under my skin anyway and I actually came to believe in the power the tape had to kill. You  wonder how on earth Rachel is going to escape the same fate as the others and I felt real horror and despair on her discovery that Aidan has also watched the tape.One thing that I think really robs horror films of their ultimate ""horror"" value is when you come to the explanation/discovery of what's behind it all at the end. I thought the film had let itself down with a typical, rationalised ending. I was very pleasantly surprised with the horrifying twist that developed and I loved the eerie ""non-ending"" ending - it left me really freaked out and actually believing that the whole thing might be real after all. It is wonderful, psychologically terrifying stuff and I defy anyone to watch it and forget it - I am still thinking about it and giving myself the shivers months later! I won't give any film 10/10, as this is the ultimate and I am always challenging for there to be an even better film out there (this film does exist and is Ringu if everyone else's comments are anything to go by). I give it a superior ""must see"" 9/10.",The Ring

While I thought the movie at one point had ended with what I felt was an acceptable ending, it instead continued on for another 12 minutes only to make your more confused.Once again, the acting was really good. I'll say that much. And the young actor who plays Aidan was very convincing with that always creepy frightened look in his eyes. He would've made a great Damien in the original The Omen.",The Ring

They rave on and on about how terrifying it is, how creepy the little girl is, how unexpected the ending is, etc. I wasn't sure if I wanted to believe them, seeing as most horror films I had seen in the past were pretty dull.Now, after having seen it, I can say that it lived up exactly to my own expectations: boring and slightly trite. The only thing remarkable about this film is the originality of it's basic idea (from the original Japanese film ""Ringu""). A journalist and your basic horror movie creepy psychic kid are chased by an even creepier raggedy undead girl who kills people one week after they see a cursed tape by coming out of their TV and, I don't know, consuming their life essence or something. Originality is really the only thing going for this movie.

But I later realised that would simply have not been a good idea considering the state that particular audience had been :)The Ring is absolutely beautiful in its imagery and Blair Witch Project like in terms of using your own imagination against you. However unlike that particular film, this one gives the scares a much harder push so no matter what, chances are you you are going to be very tense throughout the film and actually be left with an uneasy feeling that you may not be completely aware of until later - a mark ofa  true chiller.Ive already ordered the Japanese version and well as the Japenese sequel and prequel - I am hooked, what can I say.

458,smokskren,"Campy, predictable, not worth your time",3,1 November 2002,"My first inclination upon hearing the storyline to this movie was that it was going to be another in a long string of predictable un-scary movies. In an attempt to keep an open mind (and find a truly riveting, scary movie) after reading the fabulous reviews The Ring was receiving, I decided to give it a try. I should have listened to my first instinct. This movie starts out so poorly that I (and the person I saw it with) thought it was going to turn into a show the people in the actual movie were watching.  That didn't happen.  It was the real movie.
This is simply another Urban Legend that has been put to the screen and the lengths to which they went to contrive some of the scenes are incredible. There was 1 scene which had a startle factor of about 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I jumped a bit, the person I was watching the movie with didn't move at all.  I am not familiar with any of these actors but I suspect they're fairly good actors subjected to horrid scripting.  The little boy appears to have potential but they actually used the Sixth Sense technique & had him whispering on the phone.  (remember the ""I see dead people."" scene?) They actors were good looking for the most part, if that's a redeemable quality, then The Ring gets a point on that. There is a surprise albeit predictable (if you've watched more than 3 scary movies in your lifetime) ending. Surprise in that you think the movie is over but then it continues on. Surprise.Scary? No. Good for a laugh? Yes. A laugh worth 7$? No.  Not even worth watching on a rainy Saturday afternoon when the only other choice is to wash the dog. Wash Rover. It'll be more entertaining.",The Ring

461,amacmillen,Possibly one of the scariet movies ever made!,9,10 June 2005,"Wow. It's been more than a year since I saw ""The Ring,"" and yet it still sticks in my mind as the scariest movie that has ever been created. The musical score is not only intense and horrifying, but the sequence of images that are flashed at you seriously freak you out. I watched this at a sleepover with three other guys (in the pitch black) and we couldn't sleep all night.There were two scenes in particular that stood (and still stand) out in my mind:1) When Noah is in that workshop place and his 7 days are up, that has got to be the scariest sequence in the whole movie. What happens:first, Noah is reading a newspaper and puts his cup of coffee down on the paper. When he picks it up again, a ""ring"" of coffee has leaked through and forms a ring on his newspaper. A sign of things to come.next, the TV in the workshop flickers on to complete static. noah pales and stands up, staring at the TV. he's the only one in the workshop. he walks over to the remote which is sitting on a table, and flicks the TV off.third, the TV turns back on. Noah seriously freaks now and pulls the plug from the TV. he's satisfied that everything'll be OK, but the TV goes back on (to a screen of static, of course)next, the static goes away and is replaced by the infamous well, bathed in gray-blue. and who should climb out of the well but...samara. noah watches in horror as she crawls out of the well and towards the TV screen.eventually, she reaches the TV screen and crawls out...with her gory skin and tattered clothes and black hair, samara is the devil. literally. then she goes for noah.noah tries to get away, but of course, you cannot get away from samara. he runs, but samara employs her ""evil ghost child"" powers and teleports to right in front of noah. noah keeps running, samara keeps teleporting. there's one shot where she's right up near the camera and you can literally HEAR her.then, samara is standing over noah (he's tripped over something and can't get away) ... and the screen goes blank.cut to rachel, who is running up the stairs to the workshop place, runs in, and you get a flash of noah's totally ripped up face. very scary.2) when rachel is on the island at night, she breaks into samara's dad's house (remember, samara's dad is a horse-obsessed psycho) and rachel is searching for clues in the guy's house at night. Of course, he hears her - and jumps out from behind with a hook. EXTREMELY freaky, because this is day 6 and rachel isn't supposed to die because of some crazy other guy, she's supposed to be murdered by samara. Anyway. the guy, who is obviously having some sort of mental malfunction, goes for rachel with the hook. rachel starts yelling at him and screaming - then something in his brain clicks. his mind basically stops working, and ...he jumps into the bathtub and electrocutes himself with a really weird contraption. scary sequence with freaky shots and intense music.

462,pniemeyer-47222,*snicker*,6,5 April 2017,"There's a fine line between creepy and silly, and this movie crosses it more times than most of its admirers would care to admit. A remake of the vastly superior Japanese film ""Ringu"", this film is about a videotape that causes everyone who watches it to die seven days later. This premise is ripe for all sorts of commentary on the novelty of video vs. more modern forms of entertainment, but this film is far too focused on being gloomy and disgusting. To be fair, there are some good moments: a scene with a horse on a ferry, the moody visuals, and a few performances. For everything that works, however, there is something that doesn't. Naomi Watts is great as the plucky journalist heroine, but the actor who plays her inexplicably psychic kid was apparently auditioning to be the next Haley Joel Osment. Brian Cox is great, too, but he has barely any screen time, and his death scene is so over-the-top as to be unintentionally hilarious. (Seriously, why did he need to bring all of his electronics to the bathroom in order to kill himself? Dude, just drop your TV in the bathtub and be done with it.)I said that the Japanese version is better, and that's primarily because it understands what kind of story it's telling. Watts spends the bulk of the film trying to unravel the mystery behind it, but the twist is that none of it matters. How did the girl shown in the video get her psychic powers? Who shot it? None of this is ever explained, and it shouldn't be, because the only way to escape death is to show the video to someone else and pass the curse on to them. The Japanese version's scares were subtler, allowing the whole thing to build to a conclusion that would be funny if it weren't so terrifying. The American version features so many jump scares, body horror moments, and visual tricks that it's as if director Gore Verbinski didn't have any faith in the source material. I'll give him credit for a few moments here and there, but whereas the video in the original was nonsensical and otherworldly, the video in this one just looks like a really bad student film.If you don't watch the original first, you will probably like this one a lot more. I just couldn't get over how unnecessary all of the changes were. It's more middle-of-the-road than actually bad, but it's worth watching more for how iconic it's become than its actual quality.",The Ring

I put The Ring way up there on the list of scary movies, right alongside The Shining, Poltergeist, and The Exorcist.  In fact, I had not experienced such a room-filling sense of deep dread and fear in a theater since I saw the recent re-release of The Exorcist.  The nightmarish imagery was very unsettling and the peak moments of horror were very well timed.  It wasn't perfect, though.  The non-scary parts didn't come off nearly as well as the scary parts.  Not the greatest acting during the ""straight"" parts of the movie, and some of the dialogue was pretty weak.  But when the scary parts were on screen (which, fortunately, was most of the time) it made up for the little deficiencies, and then some.From seeing the very-creepy trailer, I had high hopes for The Ring.

My conclusion from watching this movie is a lot of people are very easily frightened. What on Earth did people find so very frightening about this movie? It doesn't have a more than mildly frightening scene in it up until the last 15 minutes. Personally, I wouldn't rank it in the top 20 scariest movie, never mind *the* scariest. I should have know better than to expect it to be scary when one of the ads compared it to Rosemary's Baby, which is about as scary as 3-day-old leftovers- you know, before they go all green and moldy.However, if people thought The Ring was really scary, they should see Session 9, another non-scary horror movie that has a similar ""feel"" to it, which seems to scare some people, anyway.Don't get me wrong, though, the Ring is a pretty good movie, I'd give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10, but it's just not very scary.",The Ring

I have not seen its like since Psycho, Jaws, or Alien.  Genuinely creepy with believable dark tones and still a twisted sort of happy ending: like any good ""classic"" fairy tale.  Many a Homage to many a classic thriller and/or scary film with the most obvious being Psycho (you will notice without me saying). It has it all the ""must haves"" of a stereo typical ""thriller"" including the car chase; the damsel in distress (and getting herself out with minimal assistance), and people looking for trouble and walking into certain death.  Oh yeah, and the obligatory up the stairwell shot.  None of this detracts from the film however, it only adds texture and flavor!  The cinematography is lush and only makes the pacing taste even richer.  My favorite spice in this endeavor however was the sound and music which are outstanding and as integral to the scare and fun as they were in Psycho and Jaws.  Zimmer bows to Herman all over the place. 		I will say no more for you shouldn't know to much before you see it, else you might not have as much fun.

From the boy, who is a clear ""Sixth Sense""-rip-off to the heavily inspired filming and cinematography from Blair Witch, this movie was a huge disappointment. I admit the ""Horror-genre"" has it tough, it's now easy making one that's critically acclaimed, but I have found out it's all about feel and mood. Films like ""The Shining"", ""The Exorcist"", and ""The Kingdom"" have that great creepy feel, which, even if you don't get scared, just shows the best of genre, and is a joy to watch.The Ring doesn't have it.

It was so well made it had me and the rest of the audience to constantly on edge waiting for the next scary thing to happen! The Ring tells the story of a reporter named Rachel (Naomi Watts) who while investigating the strange death of her 16 year old niece discovers a tape she and her 3 friends (who are also dead.) watched a week ago. She watches the tape herself, which contains strange images of a woman, dead horses and a lighthouse to name a few as well as a ring shape. After watching the movie the phone rings telling her she has 7 days to live. Rachel starts on a mission to discover the meaning of the movie and who made it and why before her 7 days are up and she dies. The movie contains so many plot twists and turns after this, delivering up scary and scarier things that leave you completely freaked out and chilled to the bone. The final ending (a HUGE plot twist that turns the ending from a semi-happy one to a terrifying one) had me just horrified. You will never look at a tv set the same way again. This movie is definetly worthy of being called a horror, it relys on the sharp wit of the writers and director to create some very chilling scares rather than gory blood and guts. The pacing of this film was perfect, leaving you on edge almost the entire film.

472,thoughtfox,Sophisticated horror,8,14 November 2002,"The PG-13 rating got me thinking the film was going to be another awful teen slasher flick, and for the first 30 mins. that's what I though I was in for. However, after the first time the audience sees what ""The Ring"" (i.e.video) can do, my expectations were raised, as was my attention. The editing is wonderful; fast-paced, cutting, almost violent. The film relies on this among other excellent methods of filmmaking. The film's use of dak color allows for a macabre, creepy, morose, and unsettling feel. The fluidity of motion sustains the high level suspense. What you think is just another ferry ride turns into a first rate chase scene featuring a horse gone mad from an unknown, but malevolent force. This is why the filmmakers could get away with a PG-13 rating. The film is sophistcated; a cut above the rest of other low-grade horror movies because it doesn't need obligatory, bloody, body gashing scenes to provide the audience with a scare factor. The ""video tape"" is itself a wonderful example of filmmaking. It has an edgy, artsy feel to it. In fact, some of the images in the video aren't fully explained. Some of the images are simply weird and disturbing, but because the images are so striking, they deny need for full explantion. There are a few aspects of The Ring that aren't explained at all, but because they are so visually appealing and shocking, the need for detailed explanation is often not necessary. What I thought was most powerful about the film was the antagonist. It is truly evil, and evil for so many reasons including the fact that the evil is almost omnipotent in nature. It knows where to get you. Victims are killed mercilessly not because they are torn apart or cut in half by some hockey mask wearing man, but because death is the only thing that's certain when the onslaught of The Ring's power is unleashed. The victim is faced with a raw, merciless, and ugly death. And because the origin of the evil is not explained, this adds to the omnious enviroment the film is saturated with.

477,daveblythe69,WHY WHY WHY,1,16 February 2003,"ok, i got hold of this film after having seen the original and been absolutely terrified by it, i couldn't get through it the first time was much too scared. but this one i just wanted to kill myself it was so so bad on its own not just in comparison. they tried to make it different by changing some thing about the film but it all just falls flat on its face. there isn't anything in the film except a promising performance from the guy who played Noah. the kid was just whinny and irritating, the dialogue was kinda dire and Brian Cox is completely pointless and unnesesary in the film. the effects in the film are appauling and really not needed see the original for proof that CGI aint needed, or see the Two Towers for how to CGI somebody well. i suppose ishould comment on the plot at some point apart from just bitching about how bad it is. a journalist promises her sister that she will find out what killed her daughter, which leads her to uncover the tape that seven days after watching it you die, she watches the tape and so do some others and then it has some pointless rubbish and it ends badly and unlike the original. there is very little that remains the same about the remake, for a good example of remaking a classic and brilliant japanese movie and making it american you can do no wrong it watching the magnificent seven! but if you want a film that is just quite bad tehn fine go ahead. but please at least give some consideration to watching the original and you can't possibly argue that this is in anyway 1 billionth the film that is! a poor film and one of the worst americanised remakes i've ever seen",The Ring
478,dannyag,"Who said this movie was scarier than the ""Exorcist""?!?!",9,5 March 2003,"Ok.....some of you kiddies who have seen this movie are probably not going to like this but ""The Ring"" doesn't hold a CANDLE to ""The Exorcist"". We're not even talking the same sport here, let alone the same ballpark. After all the hype and all the stories going around that this movie is as scary as or scarier than the ""Exorcist, I decided to let my daughter go out an buy it since I'm a BIG horror/Sci-fi fan. I popped in the DVD and we were on our way.  The first scene, poorly acted, by two teenagers was the first omen that I was NOT going to like this movie. I don't mind ""campy"" or ""corny"" horror movies provided that they're not hailed as ""the horror movie event of the century"" or ""The scariest movie ever made"".In any event, After the opening scene, I decided to give it a chance before leaving the room.  Well, I'll tell ya what......when she opened that door with the water leaking out from under it to reveal the TV playing that water well in black and white and the camera RUSHED at her face.....I nearly poopied in my pants!!!   (LOL).
""Ok"" , I thought....""you got my attention!!""  That was ONE of the three, maybe four scary scenes throughout the entire movie.  Enter Naomi Watts.......Where did this girl/woman get her license to act!??!?!........In a cracker jack box!??!!?   MY GOD, MAN.....she was absolutely horrible! SO bad, in fact, that she ruined the entire movie in my opinion.  Ok.....so there's more bad acting.  I figure, what the heck, let me finish it because I really have to see what everyone is talking about. And besides, that opening scene was really something.
She watches the tape and blah blah blah.....she tries to figure out what's going on with the death of her niece and more blah blah blah......Then there's a horse that escapes from his container on a ferry boat and jumps in the water and more blah blah blah.....THEN, she finds Brian Cox, who by the way, played in ""Manhunter"" aka ""Red Dragon"", the first Hannibal Lecter.  He's a GREAT actor and it was a pleasure to watch him. He's no Anthony Hopkins, mind you, but still a great actor.Anyway, moving right along here.......Instead of telling you what happens and giving away scenes, I'll just tell you that, overall, this is a VERY decent thriller despite the horrible acting and slow scenes inbetween the scary ones.  The moments in this movie that are scary, are TRULY HORRIFYING.  I'll give 'em that one!   There's a scene near the mid-end where her ex is watching the TV and Samara starts to emerge from the well. OH MY GOD!   That's All I'm going to say!  If THAT doesn't raise the hair off your skin, nothing will!
It's just a shame that this movie wasn't done a little better. It COULD have easily been as scary as the Exorcist but the poor acting and holes in the plot prevented it.  Again, the foundation is there for a brilliant thriller/horror movie but it just didn't make the grade.  I'll give it 7 out of 10 for the really creepy scenes that were truly horrifying. I just get upset when you have all the makings of a GREAT movie and then poor acting and holes in the plot ruin it.  And as always, I hope I haven't offended anyone.

The performance is flawless from everyone involved. It does not rely on cheap jump scares or shaky cam or the recent find footage trick. The find footage in the movie is actual find footage and is important to the story. Many horror-movies tried to copy its formula for the years to come. Iwould say that even paranormal activity was inspired by it. All fails to comparison to the ring. Only one that came close was the grudge.I've never seen the original Japanese version, but I never felt the need to do so after watching the remake, simply because I was satisfied and scared at the same time.

480,nshaw,This movie was ridiculous.,3,3 February 2005,"This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, right next to the Blair Witch. Basically, this is the premise: A bunch of teenagers watch what looks to be a Marylin Manson or Nine Inch Nails music video on a VHS tape they find in a motel in the woods. Then they get phone calls from a ghost who politely tells them they will die in 7 days (gives them time to buy life insurance policies, I suppose). Then in seven days an 11 year girl crawls out of their TV sets and beats the snot out of them. I'm serious, it really is that stupid.Eventually, the protagonist of the story decides to copy the tape thus allaying her own demise at the hands of the vengeful cathode ray tube spector. That is right, everybody who has seen it has to copy the tape to avoid having a little girl climb out of their TV and beat the crap out of them. There were many elements blatantly stolen from other movies (such as the sixth sense). In all fairness, the production values and special effects were pretty good and there were a few choice gory scenes. But for the most part this was an immensely stupid movie that scared no one.Wait for this one to come out on cable TV or borrow it from someone who has the DVD. DO NOT PAY TO SEE IT.

The Ring is probably the only true horror classic we've had in the past decade, and is more frightening than many of the other classics one can name. It's a shame that more people don't realize how deep and well-crafted this movie truly is, and how well the visuals tie together the whole film. It really helped me appreciate how nearly everything in the entire movie meant to frighten can be traced all the way back to Samara's experience, because throughout the whole movie, she is forcing everyone to share her experience. Take a look at all the deaths that happen in the movie. What is similar about them? Watch it again, and you'll see it's just another way of Samara forcing others to share her pain. The visuals in this movie are tremendous and subtle; I recommend that anyone go slowly through the tape scene, just to see where these visuals are repeated, and where they come from. You've noticed that I haven't said anything of the actors or the plot. They're really secondary to me, even if they all give decent performances. And I'm not going to even mention The Scene near the end of this movie. If you've seen it, you already know it is probably one of the most frightening things ever filmed. In the end, this movie is sucha totally solid and coherent piece, because nearly every moment of it seems to be haunted by the presence of a little girl who has seen horrible things and will never stop sharing them with you.",The Ring

Also i did a test i have the original and saw it long before this one, so now saw the new US version (lol didn't scare me 1 second) and when i got home i putted the original in my tapeplayer again thinking this time the original wouldn't scare me, well euhhh it did, the way the things are filmed, putted in screen, the lights the little video frames puts you in sort of uncomfortable way. Also they mix something up here in the originalk she does alot to save not her but her SON!

Only thing i wait is ""The Ring 2"" the sequel of the original made by the same original screenwriter and director.Oh by the way i really wanted to say Well done lately to the japanese Movies because they teaching some directing arts to the US that seem lost lately to find a good scenario.

But of course, being the kid that I was, I would sneak peeks at the movie here and there, which me doing so would scar me unknowingly for life. As a kid you love television, I grew up with Spongebob and Winnie the Pooh, so being exposed to something like The Ring was something I had never experienced before, and growing up I always had my grandmother and mom telling me about Poltergeist, in which the Carolanne was sucked into the television, so you could only imagine how it was for me to watch a girl climb out of the television! I had nightmares for months, and every time I would close my eyes I would see Samara climbing out of the television, coming to get me. Every time the move was on television, I would stray away from it, I would eventually go on to watch the second one first, to which I had no problem watching, it wasn't in till I saw the first one on DVD at my grandma's friends house when I was around eleven, but even then, I ran out of the room as halfway threw the first scene, when the two teens are at home. I would have gone on for for four more years in till I watched it finally, and even then I was on the edge of my seat, with the blanket by me almost the whole time. It has been many months since I watched almost all of it on HBO, but I made it to the end where Samara goes after Naomi Watt's boyfriend in the movie, and that's where the channel was changed. I have still not seen the whole movie from start to finish, but I have been looking for it on cable everyone in awhile. This is a truly scary movie, and a great one at that, so that is why I gave it ten out of ten stars without seeing the full product first.

Most of its supposed horror is of the ""jarring musical chord as a door is opened to reveal a mutilated corpse"" variety.  It wasn't effective in Friday the 13th Pt.

Katie claims she watched the tape with three friends a week ago. Minutes later, Katie is killed by an unseen force, and Becca is institutionalized after witnessing it.At Katie's funeral, her mother, Ruth, urges her sister Rachel Keller, a journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel lives with her young son Aidan, who possesses a degree of mediumship. Rachel learns that Katie's friends Josh Turandot, Scott Conduroy, and Stacey Miller all died on the same night, sporting disfigured appearances.

Renting the same cabin as Katie, Rachel watches the tape, which contains disturbing, gruesome imagery. Once the tape ends, Rachel receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers ""seven days"".Rachel recruits Noah Clay, her ex-boyfriend and Aidan's father, to study the tape, making a copy after he watches the original. Rachel begins to suffer supernatural symptoms as the week passes, haunted by a young girl with soaking wet hair. Investigation into the tape's imagery leads Rachel to Anna Morgan, a horse breeder from Moesko Island, who committed suicide after her prize-winning horses drowned themselves. Rachel catches Aidan watching the tape, and discovers Noah is suffering similar symptoms.Leaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel travels to Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard. On the ferry journey, a horse is spooked by Rachel's presence, leaping to its death. Noah goes to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. Both separately discover Anna had an adopted daughter, Samara, who possessed an ability to psychically etch mental images onto surfaces and into minds, driving her parents mad. Rachel tries to speak with Richard about Samara, but he denies her existence.Rachel speaks with Dr. Grasnik, the island's general practitioner, who explains Samara was adopted due to Anna's infertility, recommending them to admit her to Eola, assuming Samara is still there. Rachel sneaks into the Morgan farmhouse, watching a videotape of Samara in a psychotherapy session, who claims she has no control over her abilities. Rachel confronts Richard, who electrocutes himself in a bathtub with a horse bridle upon learning Samara's powers are still at large. Noah arrives, he and Rachel go to the barn, where Samara was isolated in the loft. They find a burnt image of a tree, Rachel recognizing it from Shelter Mountain.They return to the cabin, locating a stone well hidden under the floorboards; the final image on the tape. Rachel falls in the well, experiencing a vision of Anna suffocating Samara and throwing her down the well, sealing her in, where she drowned seven days later. Samara's corpse surfaces after Noah tells Rachel that the seven-day deadline has passed.The next day, Rachel reassures Aidan that the curse has been lifted by liberating Samara. In a twist, a distressed Aidan tells Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara, revealing he is still cursed. In his apartment, Noah encounters the vengeful ghost of Samara emerging from his television, murdering him. Rachel, upon finding his disfigured corpse, returns home and destroys the original tape in a furious rage, asking why Noah was killed but she was not. She realizes that the difference is that she made a copy of the tape, which Aidan watched, thereby continuing the cycle that Samara wants to spread of duplicating the video and showing it to someone else to save oneself.Rachel shows Aidan how to make his own copy.

After some really scary scenes she is dead and her aunt, a reporter starts to investigate this mystery and ends up seeing the tape herself. And her ex-boyfriend and son too. So the clock is ticking for them to solve what is behind it or they'll end up dead too. The suspense keeps the viewer in its grasp all the way trough the film, but...It seems that the writer ran out of ideas how to end this and how to give a reasonable explanation for the tape's magic powers. The ending simply sucked. The suspense that the film built bursted like a bubble and makes you laugh. Might have passed as an episode of X-Files but a feature film, no. 4/10 for a good attempt and the scary parts.",The Ring

It was unpredictable and filmed brilliantly. The picture was incredible and they did not over do it with the scary stuff. It was the fear of the unknown that was just incredible. Wonderful! Brilliant! The scariest movie I have ever seen. Awesome...",The Ring
502,myftiu71,Excellent movie ... but intensely terrifying?? I think not.,8,9 November 2002,"I just saw ""The Ring"" and I loved it ... the video itself was extremely disturbing as were several other scenes. And the overall atmosphere was extremely creepy, mostly due to the use of music and sound effects. But the film is nowhere near ""intensely terrifying"" or ""the best horror film ever."" I'd give it an 8, but there are many horror films that are much better (""The Shining,"" ""Jacob's Ladder,""The Exorcist"" ""Last House on the Left"") Who know's, maybe I've just seen too many horror movies to really be scared anymore. I just wasn't completely terrified. It's an excellent film, but not all it's hyped up to be. Maybe all that hype is what left me a little disappointed at the end. All I know is that I won't be scared everytime the phone rings or the TV shows static, like someone I know told me they were when they went home after seeing the movie. And by the way, to clear up another misconception, ""Blair Witch Project"" was not scary.",The Ring
503,daledeloy,Great plot idea...ordinary thriller,8,4 January 2003,"Before I saw this movie, everyone had been making a big deal about how scarythe movie is.  I thought, ""for once, a movie that will actually scare me!"" Well... it did have great unexpecting events and situation that leave you almost offyour seat, but it was just like any other thriller movie.  So, my point being, it wasn't that scary people.The plot idea I thought was great.  And I also enjoyed the twist at the end of the movie.  The acting and setting were fine.  I will probably have this movie apart of my DVD collection, once it is released.  I give this movie B+.",The Ring
504,ranndino,How many times will you jump?,9,28 October 2002,"Movies usually don't scare me. Even the ones that are supposed to. This one did. Yes, you have to get past the plot line full of holes and suspend your disbelief, but how many horror movies actually make sense? This film is stylish with great cinematography and images that will haunt you for a while. It is quiet unbelievable that it is only rated PG-13 because it would scare the bejesus out of any more or less impressionable child (more on that later). It scared the bejesus out of an impressionable adult - me. I am pretty sure that this film made me jump and say ""sh@t"" more then any that I have seen in a while. I would highly recommend not going to see it by yourself and have someone to sleep with after. In my case that would be my girlfriend. We sat in the theater grabbing onto each other and were sure glad we didn't have to come home alone. The characters are not deeply developed and like I have said the story is ludicrous when you actually think about it. But if you forget all that for a moment and remember why you came (to get scared) this movie is one of the best horror films to come out in a few years. It simply works. Yes, it might not be incredibly original in what devices it uses to make your skin crawl, but the skin crawling effect definitely happens. It never lets go and keeps your senses tuned in. The story ties itself more or less well at the end, perhaps leaving more then a possibility for a sequel. I have no qualms recommending it. Definitely not a waste of your money and one to see at the theater as it would lose a lot of its luster on video. One more thing. Someone at our viewing took what looked like a five or six years old girl to it. Please check your head and do not create more psychos that are already floating around in this world! That poor little girl will have nightmares for the next 10 years and someday many of her phobias and weird behavior could be traced back to her moronic older sister taking her to see a film like this. Adults need to remember that children are hundreds of times more impressionable and have no reference points or experience to control their fears. This movie is very scary for a well balanced adult. I can't even imagine what impact the elaborately created, incredibly creepy visions that stick in one's mind would have on a little child.",The Ring
505,jackattack286,Never Fails to Scare Me,10,1 May 2003,"I don't care what anyone says, this is hands-down the scariest thing I've ever seen. And the way it carries out the scares is fantastic. It doesn't give you the usual ""BOO!"" to jump you out of your seat. Instead, the film makes sure you're throughly disturbed and on edge and then keeps building the suspense. Without giving any spoilers, I loved the way the movie pulled the rug out from under you with a seemingly happy-all-the loose-ends-tied-up-ending changing into one of the scariest scenes I have ever seen. If Jaws made us afraid of sharks, and Poltergeist of clown dolls, then this is the movie to walk away from scared of static on your television.",The Ring
506,K_ash10,Is it just me or is this movie just okay...,5,9 January 2016,It is surprising to say this movie didn't really scare me. The Ring is about a woman who comes across a video tape that seems to be causing the deaths of people who die seven days after viewing the tape. It's probably my own fault I waited too long to see this movie. I have seen so many horror movies that this film didn't really scare me. However that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It has a good story and some really effective imagery. I was not scared but I was pretty creeped out. In my opinion if you have yet to watch this film and if you are easily scared watch it. But if you are not easily scared watch this with a group of friends so they can get scared and you will have a good time with it. It does have its ups and downs but it was an okay horror movie.,The Ring

I would recommend it *highly* to anyone.*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***The only gripe I have with the movie is that it should have ended a few scenes earlier. Instead, it felt as if the filmmakers had to wring out the last bit of energy possible for no good reason at all.

This was an adequate ghost story at best. I thought you had to be pretty much brain dead, once you saw the well, NOT to know that was 'The Ring"".There are far too many plot holes to make it truly creepy. ""My wife wasn't supposed to have a child..."" Richard Morgan sez. All right, the daughter is not adopted as stated earlier in the movie. Is she a Demon Seed? What is her motivation for perpetuating her evil? Is she evil for evil's sake? Enquiring minds want to know.This isn't a ghost story that makes you think, it's a ghost story that annoys you. It could have been a lot more but wasn't. If you MUST see this, wait until it comes out on video and save the full price of admission. If you can't wait that long, see it at a matinee.

Things are a little fuzzy at times, but that's life. Not everything is clean cut.Every review I've read so far has stated there were unanswered questions, the ending didn't make sense.  Sure it did.  The key is that Samara wanted to be heard.  The tape was a form of chain letter.  Pass it on or die. Everyone hears her and she'll go away.Not a top ten film, but not a waste of money either.

But, overall, this was a very enjoyable bit to watch. Moody and well-photographed, this is as much mystery as horror. I watched it in a cinema full of jerk highschoolers that would not shut up and I STILL came away thinking about the movie. The mix of music with strange imagery tied on top of the urgency of it all will cause you to be a little antsy throughout. One review called it panicked (and complained about the feeling) but I think this is something they are shooting for. For me, it was ultimately the image of the ""ring"" itself and the music that got me...that is the part that I am thinking the most about, afterwards.",The Ring

Otherwise, this really was one of the bigger waste of time movies I've ever seen.This was NOT a truly scary movie. It was creepy. Absolutely creepy. But, the expectation that I would suspend my disbelief was SO high I simply couldn't do it.Many people have said there were too many questions left unanswered - that is totally true. I was more frustrated after the movie ended simply because there wasn't enough information provided about the WHY of the premise.Unfortunately truly bad acting by the two main adult characters did not contribute positively to my viewing experience. I had a hard time caring about anyone in the film. And the main woman did the most amazingly stupid things over and over and over - starting with watching the video to begin with!I don't recommend this movie at all, and am horrified that anyone would think to compare it to anything as excellent as The Sixth Sense!",The Ring
513,Hugo_diaz,A clear example of how real scary movies are going to be in the future.,8,24 February 2003,"SpoilersI realize this is not an original movie, I was very impressed with this version, though. When I say impressed, I really mean it. I still have disturbing dreams about Tv-sets, long dark hair little girls or wild horses.The only flaw (my humble opinion) would be the imperative need to use the editing process in order to create a deep impact in the audience. I think there is a big challenge to change so in the future. However I also think that ""The Ring"" can be a perfect example of how real scary movies are going to be in the future. If we think about The Exorcist for instance, and how less interesting must be for a whole nintendo-generation despite all of the devil references. In short, the question to ask would be:  How can you scare 21st century people who can't be scared with anything at all?, people who are got used to live among winds of war, murderers, etc.Maybe the answer would be: Suspense, no visual effects, fear to unknown things. Because the worst evil, the ugliest monster exists within our own minds. No art designer, make up artist, or screen writer will ever be able to compete with that. M. Night Shyamalan understood so already. I think ""The Ring"" type of film is the next step.I'm not an easy-to-scare guy. That's why I always feel a bit embarrassed when I remembered I let a scream out in the theater, while I was witnessing the last sequence of this film.The last ten minutes of ""The Ring"" has the most scary images I've ever suffered in my whole life.

The cinematography is quite impressive, and several paranormal scenes give you the chills and will, in fact, get you to squirm in your seat.  Watch it with someone because you will need an arm to hold when Samara makes her moves... just thinking about it makes me shiver.Those who ""didn't understand"" the plot of the movie are not to be paid attention to.

515,JT-Saint,Not as memorable (or disturbing) as the original,3,16 October 2002,"Slightly disappointing remake of the 1998 classic Ringu Japanese horror film. Although the film made a good effort at 'Westernising' the original concept behind the Ring, it failed in creating the mysticism behind the originals urban legend story.POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe removal of the psychic abilities from mother to daughter from the original story means we have no background on Samara, prior to her apparent 'adoption'. Also, the inclusion of actually seeing Samara, in a mental hospital, speaking e.t.c., completely ruins the mythos surrounding the 'evil' little girl. The necessity to over-explain plot points through banal dialogue and the inclusion of more disturbing imagery and shocks during the film, only helped to detract from the horror of the final act (especially the overly artsy video).The acting, however, was not bad from Naomi Watts and Brian Cox, but the little boy, Aiden, I found to be irratating and somewhat resemblant to a potato.If you can get hold of the original Ringu, watch that instead. 3/10",The Ring

But when all is explained, it actually makes it plausible to even the most critical critic. Well, most critical critics anyway. Some people are never happy.*This paragraph has some spoilers* Look out for the moment where the boy says - ""You helped her? ... Why did you do that? ... You weren't supposed to help her."" Granted, the fact that I've just told you about it spoils the whole moment. But the concept is brilliant! And the idea that you can be frightened to death is also excellent.

The imagery and cinematography of ""The Ring"" is stunning and would've rated a ""10"" from me alone had it not been for that one crucial scene, and for the fact that the film leaves far too many questions unanswered at the end.",The Ring

The direction of Gore Verbinski is outstanding. His directing builds the suspense to a head, without giving much away.

For that matter, exactly how creepy is a wet 12 year old with stringy hair supposed to be? The point of killing random strangers seemed a bit strained as well. Overall, I found the cinematography disappointing and the acting never rose to the level of mildly convincing.

Naomi Watts coming fresh off Muhollund Drive does a decent job as a mother and a victim of the situation of the videotape. No gore or blood, instead great quick shots and a haunting score from master Hans Zimmer causes this film to  scare without the over done sick killer movie. (ex. Scream).

528,n_nocturne,"Be afraid, very afraid.",7,1 March 2003,"I saw The Ring (Gore Verbinski, 2002) yesterday.I went by myself to the cinema, leaving my fiancée at home by herself (knowing that the movie would be far too much for her). I was almost an hour early and waited upstairs, staring blankly at a large TV whilst watching the trailers of countless movies to come. The hour passed swiftly and I was soon inside the cinema theatre, seated happily in my usual spot (yes, I'm one of those sad people that always sits in seat B12). No popcorn, just a half full bottle of cherry coke. The movie started ominously. The Dreamworks' logo crackled. Glee. Joy. Happiness. I'm a Ring fanatic.The original (Ringu, 1998) by Japanese director Hideo Nakata, chilled me to the bone. The sequel (Ringu 2, 1998) and prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) were equally potent. They're all members of that fading school of horror cinema in which blood makes almost no appearance (or if present, is a catalyst to the atmosphere, rather than a tool overused by the director to weed out the squeamish). I must admit at this point that I have not seen the Korean remake Ring Virus (1999) also known as Ring, but am planning on getting it from Hong Kong when I can scratch up enough cash to buy a few more oriental horror movies. It's high on my list.Back to the Hollywood English-language remake by Gore Verbinski: I was positively thrilled. He was almost entirely faithful to the Japanese version, but fortunately he also added to the entire Ringu mythology with certain elements. He anglicised others, changing the name Sadako to Samara for instance, and used Western imagery instead of Oriental. He added nice elements of symbolism such as the burning tree, the stagnant water that seeps through the floorboards and under doors, the entire equestrian idea, and others. Fortunately, they all worked well. Gore Verbinski did however add a little gore, taking a bloodless film and adding the odd writhed, decomposed body - a rare occurrence, granted (there is far less gore in this film than in the mainstream Se7en, 1995), but one that Nakata did not use. My feelings about this are quite mixed, but as a whole, I think I liked it.The best way to look at the 2002 remake version is to quite simply look at it as an entirely new film. If you do this, you will not be disappointed. If you look at it in the context of the Japanese versions (and Korean, I imagine), you will find this a thrilling appendix to the Ringu mythology. Either way, you will enjoy it. Unless you are part of that large group of people that actually ran out of the theatre half-way through the film yesterday afternoon. That is always a good sign.Personally, I found that the English-language remake version was as strong, if not stronger than either of the other sequels, but still remain adamant that the original Ringu is both more potent and horrifying than any of its offspring. This is the only horror film in which I have seen myself obliged to switch the light on to watch (I own Ringu, Ringu 2 and Ringu 0 on DVD). The final Sadako scene in Ringu is the most frightening, terrifying, chilling and unreal scene I have ever set eyes upon. Samara's final scene in The Ring is almost there, but this is where I must loudly voice my disapproval of Verbinski's handling of this scene: He cut it with the Rachel's car scene, dispelling in my eyes the uncut, continuous horror of Samara's appearance. This is in my eyes, the single flaw of the Verbinski version.I would recommend this film to all the horror fans out there. This is without a doubt an unforgettable movie and it will hopefully lead you onto a desire to watch the Japanese and Korean versions. Do not see this if you have even the slightest heart conditions or are easily spooked. You will run out of the cinema. Another word of warning: This is not an easy film to watch; it demands your entire commitment to the story and especially the atmosphere (the soundtrack is amazing). Do not watch this film (or its forefathers) on DVD whilst munching popcorn and chatting with your friends. This is not ""Watch over the weekend during a Horror movie marathon"" material. Your attention is required from beginning to end, switch off the light, pull out the phone cord, close the doors, and be afraid. Be very afraid.I shall now go and build a little shrine to Ringu. Or I might go and watch it again.",The Ring
529,n_nocturne,Why another remake?,7,9 October 2003,"Why another remake?Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Ring, a relatively good quality remake of the classic Japanese ""Ringu"". It was rather faithful to the original, made good use of atmospheric elements as well as providing a good setting for some fairly good acting. But, unfortunately, it was incapable of keeping the viewer's attention focused on the atmosphere and had to rely on what I deem cheap camera fast-panning tricks (*rapid movement* followed by ""Boo, are you scared yet?"") and gore (blood/decomposing bodies), something that the original had none of, which leads me to believe that Hollywood is incapable of making a horror film that will keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat without the use of these two rather amateurish features.This film does make me wonder why everytime a quality film is made in a non-Hollywood studio, America always has to vandalise this original piece of work and attempt to Americanise it by remaking it into a white-Caucasian, adrenaline joyride. Are our colonial cousins incapable of savouring an original piece of work in its original form? Or is this simply a testament to a fast-food culture where reading subtitles is simply too much effort?Anyway, I'm getting carried away once again. The Ring was a good remake of a classical masterpiece.However, do yourself a favour and stick with the original. It is far better.",The Ring

What I can tell you is this movie is wonderful...it is a very good story along with great acting...I heard they were making a sequel or prequel about Samara's life beforehand or something like that...which is cool..but I hope they don't butcher it like Blair Witch 2 (which wasn't real bad..I have seen worse..just if you got a hit on your hands don't screw up the sequel). The scariest movie in 2002 is what I give it and hopefully they will get nominated and/or win awards for this cause it was great!!

532,angelalyn14612,Problems with the negativity of this movie,10,28 February 2004,First of all who said it was a horror movie? Are you basing that off of what the Japanese consider horror movies? Because this was a psychological thriller. Horror movie is like the Jason/Freddy crapola.This is one of the main reasons people thought the movie was stupid cause they are expecting someone to be killed every 5 minutes. I saw Ringu and I didnt think it was that great but I have seen worse and I have seen better. You also cant determine that it was a bite off of Sixth Sense since Ringu was made before Sixth Sense.The Ring was much better than Ringu. I liked the dark gloomy weather of Washington. It was much cozier than Ringu. The actors were much better!!I give this a 9/10 because I dont like the finger through the nail part....ick,The Ring
533,TheSwedishJFK,A decent thriller but certainly not that scary,7,11 November 2020,"I should begin with clarify that I saw The Ring for the first time a few weeks ago. Everyone talked about it when it came out, but at that time I was only eleven years old.When I finally came around to see it I really thought it would be genuinely horrifying. Instead I was met by a dark investigative thriller that reminded me of The girl with the dragon tattoo. It would have been frightening in a cinema, no doubt about it. But come on. It is not that scary. However, the sense of unease that Gore Verbinski tries and succeeds with portraying is a rarity. The phasing is on point, Naomi Watts does a stellar performance together with David Dorfman and it's always a joy to see Brian Cox appear in a small but memorable role.My review had been different if a saw it when it came out, of that I am certain. I believe that the scariness may have weakened with time, but the quality of the movie is still there.",The Ring
534,nzbungy,"Outstanding, as well as scary",8,31 October 2002,"A very well made film that I enjoyed greatly.  Scarier (if it is possible) than The Shining and Psycho.  Creates a tremendous atmosphere of intensity and fright.  Do not go alone.  One fault, if it can be called one, is the lack of levity to release built up tension, but if you let yourself be scared, you will have a lot more fun.  It also has a rather good ending for a horror/thriller movie.  Altogether a wonderful experience, rating a 9/10.",The Ring

536,daveshubcaps,One of the creepiest films ever!,7,24 March 2003,"This has to be one of the creepiest films I have ever seen! Verbinski manages to set the perfect mood for this movie. From disturbing imagery (especially that tape!), to the inspired choice of Seattle, Washington as the location (it gave the movie a murky grayish quality).This is a movie you need to pay attention to though, otherwise you will miss many of the answers to questions asked. Even those questions don't always get completely answered, I suppose that makes for good sequel material. Casting was quite good, especially the kid, Aidan. Reminding me a bit of Rory Culkin, he had that bug-eyed look that let you know that something is just not quite right!Overall, if you're looking for something to really creep you out, and you don't mind some loose ends, the Ring is a good choice.7/10P.S.: I found an easter egg on the DVD. On the main menu, keep pressing the up button until the red arrow indicator disappears, then press play. This egg uses surround sound systems to full effect, especailly at the end!",The Ring
537,LadyKanerasoka,"A ""Horror"" Film That's Actually Really Enjoyable For Anti-Horror",8,14 October 2021,"I'm not a horror film person, but around Halloween when I was in the mood for a horror film (for some unknown reason) and decided to watch this, I actually really enjoyed it. This so-called ""horror"" film is actually anything but in my opinion. This film isn't ""scary"" scary like a serial killer chasing after you with a chainsaw that's going to give you nightmares for life; it's really more of a murder mystery thriller with quite a few jump-scare scenes (hence why it's categorized as a horror film) that's spread really far throughout the film. If you're prone to jump-scares, this film will most likely make you scream. For a film released in 2002, the visual effects are really stunning. But some of those visual effects are going to be pretty disturbing. There's a couple scenes with blood and gore that, like I said, are pretty disturbing, especially since they involve deaths, but they're shown very briefly. In fact, all the death scenes are rather brief, but are still really disturbing. Luckily, the majority of them happen either offscreen or out of ""our viewing range."" When we see two of the victims, their faces are all distorted in a horrifying way. One of them is shown so briefly (like half a second) it's one of those ""blink and you'll miss it"" scenarios. You'd have to pause the film in order to get a good look, which I do not recommend unless you want to get grossed out. The second victim is shown for a few seconds towards the end of the film, but it's not as disturbing as the first one is. All in all, this film will really keep you on the edge of your seat. The horror scenes are pretty minimal as it's only jump-scares and the material pretty much is only murder mysteries connected to paranormal activity. The mysteries though will really keep you hooked. A great film to watch around Halloween.",The Ring

The symbol of the ring on the television screen and later, in real life.

The mood of the movie is dark, gray, and eerie, and that's why it is so appealing. So many horror movies today are so intent on shoving gore and depravity in your face (*cough Saw*) that its refreshing to watch a horror movie that just lets its spooky story creep under your skin. Everything from the water motif to the strange and disturbing videotape is scary and different enough to not feel totally clichéd.That being said, its not free of clichés. There is a little boy who draws a lot of creepy pictures (like, um, every horror movie in recent history). For some reason this movie's clichés didn't bother me as much as usual, though, because unlike other movies, The Ring wasn't built on clichés, it just borrowed them for its story. The excellent score by Hans Zimmer also helps move the film along and add to its dark, heavy mood.A very enjoyable and fresh horror film.",The Ring

I haven't seen the original version, so I can't really compare it.  All the actors were very good.  I also like some of the transitions between scenes.  As for it being really scary, depends on just how screamish you are.  What I would suggest, though, is to not read any real in-depth reviews of it since a lot of them might give away too much.  How important is it to see this in the theaters?  not really critical.  I would go to one of the earlier shows to save some money. Although it was interesting having several teenagers in the row behind constantly asking one of them who already saw it if a certain part was going to be scary.  Like other people have said, a lot of the questions that get asked durring the movie are never really addressed.  Can't really say because it might spoil it, but don't get upset if you still have questions afterwards, I think most people will.  I gave it an 8 out of 10",The Ring
544,rrc-2,an assault on your senses,8,24 October 2002,"Be careful with this one!  It accomplishes exactly what it wants to.  The acting is excellent, and the plot is quite intriguing and mysterious.  You will leave the theatre thinking about what actually happened and trying to put all the links together, while at the same time not feeling lost. 
That said, this is not your typical scary movie.  This does not use foreshadowing and suspense music in the traditional way.  Most horror films will build the suspense with foreshadowing, but this also allows you to be prepared when the freaky stuff shows up.  In the ring, you have no clue when its gonna hit you.....that is combined with the fact that the scenes are more gruesome and brutal than any ive ever seen.  It can be a bit much.  The scenes don't really make you jump so much as cringe deep down inside, with a hellascious spine tingle to boot.  This is the kind of movie that will give you nightmares for a long time if you are prone to that sort of thing.  It assaults you in a more subliminal way, in a way you have never experienced before, and the effect is much more lasting and powerful.The screen is usually filled with terrible images, and you should keep this in mind before you enter the theatre.

545,JDOldSchool,Not all it's cracked up to be,3,30 October 2002,"I never expect anything from a horror movie. The ""scares"" are rarely based on anything truly horrific and instead rely on jump cuts, obscenely loud sounds, quick gross-out shots, and other cinematic devices. In my view, this is much less a sign of great filmmaking and more a sign of a gullible and unintelligent audience.With that said, The Ring tries. Ultimately, however, all the common editing tricks used in other horror movies are used in The Ring.The story itself is confusing and leaves a lot unexplained. Sometimes in films, like in Memento or Last Year at Marienbad, this is a good thing. In The Ring, it's a very bad thing. What is unexplained can not really be interpreted and is left too open-ended to satisfy.And am I the only one that expected the little boy to look at his index finger and mutter ""Redrum""?6/10 - Naomi Watts was good.

Naomi Watts does an excellent job carrying this film and it is very apparent that she has great things ahead of her. The direction of this film is very tight and does a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat without resorting to over the top violence or gore.

A journalist's son watches the video and she has to figure out how to stop it.The son is odd and has  taken out of him in a Scary Movie film.

I feel like this movie doesn't get enough recognition compared to stupid things like Friday the 13th with no substance.I feel like this movie is the right balance of mystery and horror. Movies like Poltergeist that are pure horror or like Seven that are (almost) all mystery are interesting on their own. The Ring manages to juggle these genres effectively, without ever feeling like you're watching two movies.Inevitably, a lot of you have probably seen the scene where Samara crawls out of the TV.This scene, and the scenes leading up to it, make one of the most underrated plot twists ever. It's brilliant because it's so simple. Oh yeah, that girl you were helping the whole movie? Turns out she's not so nice.But it my opinion the best shot of the movie is a shot of a car driving from above. It perfectly captures Washington with its greenish colors and beautiful views.

551,Macdonaldmichael,An intelligent and creepy story.,8,28 October 2002,"I headed out this past weekend to check a horror flick in the local theatre.  When I arrived, my choices were pretty narrow:  The Ring and Ghost Ship (Red Dragon was playing - but I had already seen it).  I was in the mood for something a little more 'serious and intense' - if that's possible. So I selected the Ring. (Ghost Ship seemed to carry a bit more 'camp' than I was in the mood for).I went into this movie knowing the bare bones of facts: it's a remake, it starred Naomi Watts and it carried odd looking trailers.
The film was nicely done, unbrilliant yet highly likely to leave an impression on you.  The premise is simple: there's a tape out there, and when you view this, you'll receive a telephone call advising of your demise in exactly seven days.  Like all good horror flicks, this devise is simple but has an excellent hook.***Potential Spoilers Within***Naomi Watts was great as a newpaper journalist who investigates the death of relative; she carried her role with a confidence rare in newcomers.  Her colleagues were also sufficiently engaging, but not so overpowering that you didn't buy into the story.  The thing I respected the most about this film is that it was a horror story that didn't resort the cliches identified in Scream and its plethora of predecessors.  Actually - the number of actual deaths was minimal - surprisingly.As our journalist proceeds through the film racing against her ultimate deadline (as expected, she watched the film, and is left with seven days to solve this mystery) she (and we) learn the origins of the tape and the reasons for the mysterious deaths.Being a film made for American audiences, it carries a number of predictable elements, and these are ultimately forgiveable.  For a film with such a broad audience base (PG13 in Canada), it did remarkably well with its restrictions.  The deaths and the surrounding circumstances are quite creepy.  There aren't a lot of jump-in-your-seat moments, but rather the director opted to set a creepy mood with the dusty yet sterile hospital environments, and the foggy/rainy outdoor scenes.  While these can be overly familiar, they do work here, and the mood is set.As the story unfolded, I found myself increasingly engaged in the plot. With each revelatory encounter, the thirst for more grows, and you want and need to see what lies around that next corner.  The plot twists are minimal - the story follows a fairly linear path.  The main thing that sets this movie apart is its ending - choosing survival, the journalist does the unthinkable (see the film if you further insight).Ultimately - The Ring employed familiar horror film tactics with the eerie score, sudden noises and spooked animals, but it managed to tell an original creepy tale using imagery (the stuff on that tape were just creepy and will give you willies after dark).  It blended the artsy elements quite well with the Hollywood elements.  It could have easily been a re-hash of ""Shocker"" and it could have readily gone into Fellini-esque territory - but instead it straddled those and gives a solid and good story.  I rank it an 8/10.  Not brilliant, but memorable.",The Ring
552,mgbesq,An unfortunate let-down,5,17 October 2002,"***Spoilers Ahoy!***Fill in the blanks: Our film begins when _________ mysteriously dies as a result of having accidentally stumbled onto a _________ with strange supernatural powers.  It turns out that when the characters see the ________, a female voice then tells them that they have ______ days to live, after which a creepy little girl shows up to usher in their untimely deaths.  The only real way to solve the mystery is to have the main character subject him/herself to the ________, thus putting them in harm's way and the ____ day countdown begins. At the very last minute, our hero discovers that the cause of all the commotion is because the creepy girl was murdered by ________ and just wants her soul set free.Is this the plot line for 'Feardotcom' or for 'The Ring?'  Unfortunately, it's both.  'The Ring' is by far the better of the two films, with superior acting, pacing, effects, and script.  It also tacks on a pretty interesting twist to the ""little girl done wrong"" story, which I presume is what will ultimately set this film apart from its cinematic doppelganger.  However the backbone of 'The Ring' is so strikingly similar to 'Feardotcom', that I ultimately felt like I had already seen this flick before, and it sucked. Very, very disappointing.I also felt that the film-makers chose their path too early on.  Four teenagers die in the opening sequence (almost entirely off-screen) as a result of having seen ""the tape"" (as it comes to be known).  After some sleuthing, our main character Naomi Watts discovers the tape, watches it, and begins the countdown to her demise lest she solve the mystery.  At this point, we can assume that either she will succeed and live (very probable), or will fail and die, leaving the peripheral characters to pick up the slack (not very probable-this IS American cinema after all).  And that's just it. We know that if anyone is going to die on screen, it has to be Naomi Watts first, and I just didn't believe that was going to happen.  Now, there is the now-obligatory twist at the end, so the audience doesn't go home completely unsatisfied, but the explanation is sketchy and it's too little, way too late.  4/10.",The Ring

Who cast this movie?  Even her little son was an irritating and unpleasant-looking character.  Contrast with the Shining's Danny.  In the hands of a competent female lead who faded behind the material and allowed the story to unfold for us, rather than causing us to watch her overact, particularly with a son marginally concern-worthy, this could have been a top-notch horror movie.

555,Jill_valentine,Chilling.,10,13 April 2003,"Having seen the Japanese version,its tempting to compare the two. But I prefer to think of them as two parallel stories in the same world. Which you prefer, is up to you. Honestly, for me, its this one.It starts with your classic Slasher scene: Two teenage girls in a big empty house basically outline what to expect in the coming movie. But before that scene is over, its clear that this movie defies expectations. More than that, it manipulates them.The imagery in it is really chilling. I'm talking insomnia inducing. Ever scene is surgically crafted to freak the hell outta you, and boy does it work. Our every fear is manipulated (long painful death, claustrophobia, bugs, being forgotten.) and I defy anybody not to be shocked at a particularly brutal scene involving a horse. The film looks unique, somehow washed out and hopeless, even in broad daylight.The effects are well done, but just subtle enough so that you are never really quite sure. Did you see what you think you did? Did she really look like that? Did she make the right choice? And thats the beauty of the film. You're never quite sure about anything. The lines between the heroes and villains are very blurred. And the one time you are sure, you're then proved very wrong.But the movie is really made by two scenes in particular. One, is the rightly lauded ""Money shot"", where the...villain, I suppose, appears. I saw it 5 weeks ago, and that still freaks me out. You have to see it to believe.The other is the last scene: Poignant, moving, and somehow the most horrifying of the whole film.Don't go alone. Or perhaps it would be best...",The Ring
556,Joe_Chip_627,What a terrible ending!,5,24 November 2009,"Based on the Japanese film ""Ringu"", which is based on the novel by Koji Suzuki, ""The Ring"" follows a woman named Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) as she investigates the mysterious death of her niece, in the process discovering a videotape that kills all who watch it in seven days. The final twist is not one of your typical Hollywood clichés, but thats only because Hollywood clichés do not negate the entire film, which is what the ending does. There have been so many movies with a little boy who looks and acts similar to Rachel's son Aidan (David Dorfman), that watching all the scenes with Aidan are difficult because you feel like you know exactly what he is going to say and do. The visuals are excellent, but that doesn't make up for the mediocre acting and direction and the terrible ending. When compared to recent horror films, ""The Ring"" really is not that bad. Just about every horror movie within the last decade or so has been terrible, except for ""28 Days Later"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"", and ""The Ring"" is without a doubt better than something like ""Freddy vs. Jason"" or ""Alien vs. Predator"". All the previews said that this was one of the greatest horror films ever, and everyone who saw this said it was so scary, so I expected to be scared. There is nothing in the film that makes you jump out of your seat, which is obviously what most people look for in horror movies. While ""The Ring"" is probably one of the ten best horror films of a 21st century in which good horror films have been almost impossible to find, there is no way that this film could rank among the truly great horror films of all time.",The Ring
557,Spinal-Column,Unnecessary but better than expected,5,23 March 2003,"'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' was sold out so I grudgingly went to see this. Usually I hate supernatural horror but I enjoyed the original Japanese version of 'The Ring'. Despite its inherently implausable premise (a haunted video tape) the Japanese movie had enough atmosphere and interesting scenes and characters to make it a worthwhile piece of film.Surprisingly, the American remake is not a total disaster. Of course, it has been Hollywood-ized greatly and, needless to say, it doesn't improve on the original, but it is not without merit.There is some interesting imagery and some chilling moments (though most of the scares come from unexpected loud noises). Funnily enough, I could detect an influence from the trashy horror movie 'Final Destination' -particularly the water motif and a sequence towards the end.The writer and director have tried to explain the story of Samara more than the original did. This works in some respects but really could have been developed further (and the CGI used near the end was not necessary).The worst change is the new version of the video tape which is crap. Not scary at all -it looks too professional and well made. Also, the soundtrack throughout the film is too overpowering -a bit of subtlety would have been nice.Naomi Watts has had some bad press for her acting in this film but I thought she was fine. The actor who annoyed me most was the one playing the little boy -he just did a poor impression of Haley Joel Osment in the 'Sixth Sense'.The more you think about the film, the more stupid it seems, but whilst you're actually watching it, it is an effective and quietly disturbing movie. Still, see the original!5/10",The Ring
558,Sleel,One of the better horror movies out there,9,13 July 2003,"My girlfriend and I saw the original in Japanese, and we both agree that the US version is much more suspenseful and scarier than the Japanese one, with the exception of some extraordinarily creepy sequences in the Japanese version. One of the small but significant changes from the original was that the Japanese version had the girl's face mostly hidden by her hair and she never makes eye contact, which I found more effective than Verbinski's treatment. The original also had one scene that I thought was a bit creepier than the remake, when the girl comes to attack the man. Other than that, the changes made were mostly positive.Japanese plots tend to be short on causality and detail, so the story changes, which add about a half hour to the original story line, serve to make the plot coherent to Westerners. The production values in Japan make the fairly high-budget original with A-list actors look like a B-movie to people accustomed to Hollywood films. The ending shows the difference between cultures, since in the original Japanese, the woman appeals to her father for help.There are holes in the plot, as many people have pointed out in reviews. Those that remain are either intentional, like those relating to the essentially unsolved mystery of the tapes and the girl, or were left over from the original Japanese.The lighting and deliberately limited spectrum enhance the mood of the film greatly. The attack on the ex-boyfriend occurring during daylight hours is surprisingly effective even though it flouts the normal rules of horror films. One of the things I liked most about this movie is that it is a bit unconventional, through a combination of good director choices and some fresh ideas borrowed from Japan. People who were expecting to see a kill-em-all slasher flick were probably disappointed by the relatively slow pace in the building of the story and suspense.Overall, I found the film to be a very good treatment of the original story and a fairly creepy horror movie too. It doesn't try to startle you into being frightened, it doesn't offer lots of gore and shocking violence, and it doesn't play down to the audience. The result is a slightly cerebral and haunting movie. There are some images and scenes that will stay with you and still give you the creeps for quite some time after you see it.",The Ring

I borrowed this film yesterday because I was curious why people where so into this film.I spent the whole time heckling it and making snarky comments about it because it was not even the slightest bit scary.

I was able to sit through the whole thing and instead of feeling scared, had to resist the urge to laugh all the way through.The only freaky thing was the little kid. He was definitely a piece of work and needed therapy even before viewing the videotape.I think my brother, who joined me in heckling the film (and he is a horror film lover) summed it up best when he said: ""I guess the point of the movie is VHS is evil so watch DVDs."" *Thumbs WAY Down*",The Ring

However, trust when I say that any bias I have would cause me to feel more negative than positive about a film if it was not up to par. I was, frankly, quite disappointed with The Mexican, and was hoping Mr. Verbinsky would have chosen better material this time around.  In my opinion, this source material gave him the ability to demonstrate some real talent.First, the good.  The look of this film is very Fincher-esque.  The grays, the blues, the blacks, they are all used heavily.  In less capable hands, this would only convey sadness and depression.  Here, the dreariness conveys something beyond a simple, sad world.  This world is haunted.  Every shadow, every corner, every closed door seems to be hiding something.  The atmosphere it generates is perfect for this story, and doubles its effectiveness.  The soundtrack (or lack thereof) complements this.  There are no cheesy moments of thumping melodramatic compositions getting in the way of things.  It's understated and haunting, often going for creepy white noise instead of overwraught symphonies.Beyond the good looks, there is substance.  This leading lady is no pushover.  She is determined and driven, never helpless.  The remaining cast plays out well, too.  All of the cast members seem to have exaggerated features, which gives them almost the feel of a comic book, and adds to the surreal feeling of this world we're looking at.  These are not the usual horror movie flakes waiting to add to the bodycount.  These are accessible characters with real flaws but are smart enough to make you believe they have a chance of thinking, not fighting, their way out of the situation the find themselves in.  I found this quite refreshing.The scares come early and often.  This is not a slasher movie, since a large part of the mystery here is wondering what the heck happened to the people who get killed off.  You get bits and pieces, just enough to tease you each step along the way.The plot is effective, some things are very subtle and will likely not be picked up by everyone.  In discussions with others, I found that people were looking for plot holes in the wrong places.  The video, how it was made, that's all there and reasonably explained if you pick up on it.  This subtlety is nice for someone like me who enjoys figuring things out and picking up on seemingly innocent clues.  Sadly though, there are some key plot elements that do not hold up under the same scrutiny, and that holds the film back from true greatness.My score:  8 out of 10.  Good scares, great acting, beautiful to look at. Lets you dig deep for answers, but you'll find bigger holes along the way. If you can forgive that, or at least suspend your disbelief, you'll have a good time.",The Ring

I want to mention that I have not watched the original version ""Ringu"" yet.""The Ring"" is very suspenseful. A good story but for me it's the characters that make this movie so very good. Especially the little boy Aiden (David Dorfman), he is so creepy, so much. Great acting! Naomi Watts plays the mother's role very believable in my opinion, a very passionate character who tries everything to save her son.The videotape is very disturbing. This may sound odd but I think the oval-shaped mirror is one of the scariest things I've seen in movies.Samara's story is an interesting one. You want to know what happened to that little girl, why is she doing what she is doing? ....and at the end you don't know whether to call her offender or victim.",The Ring

565,Ken M,Surprisingly good,8,28 March 2003,"The Ring surprised me. I have to admit, I didn't expect much. My son rented the movie from Netflix, and before I sent it back I thought I would check out a few minutes. I was expecting a teen slasher movie. However, I was quickly hooked by its stylish imagery and interesting characters. Some of the scenes were very David Lynch. I like a story where the characters behave (more or less) believably in unbelievable circumstances, and I think they did a pretty good job in that regard. The pacing of the movie is very good. I never felt the story was dragging or jumping to far ahead. Extras were minimal on the DVD. I would have like a directors commentary, or ""making of"" segment.

It was absolutely the most tedious, poorly acted, unoriginal and boring movie I've seen all year.I thought Naomi Watts should have won the Oscar last year for her amazing performance in Mulholland Drive and now am rethinking that opinion.  I'm starting to think that she owes that performance to typecasting and David Lynch. What I thought was a brilliant job of intentional bad acting for the first half of ""Drive""  may have been the work of a bad actress being brilliantly used by a great director.there is so much wrong with this movie I don't even know where to start but suffice to say that you will lose count of the absurdities that fill this movie.  And all for nothing.  There may be a couple of scenes that make you jump but nothing is in the least bit scary.Watts should give 90% of everything she makes to David Lynch and take out a contract on Verbinski.  He may have killed what I thought was a promising career.BTW, you'll see a lot of good reviews by critics around the country but believe me they are being baffled by BS (lit. degrees can be catered to by the way).This is a load of crap.",The Ring
567,Tivor X-09137,Great Americanized remake of the Japanese horror,8,19 October 2002,"I watched the original Japanese ""Ring"" (aka ""Ringu,"" as per the Japanese phonetic) two years ago.  It was a very freaky film, to say the least. So when I learned that a remake of the film was being released here in the States, I had to see it.  I was curious to know if the American filmmakers were going to improve upon the original, or totally screw it up by ""Americanizing"" it.Well, I'm glad to say that they mostly succeeded.  After the opening sequence which was a virtual carbon copy of the Japanese original, the movie improved upon the original in many ways.  There were some plot changes, but most had to do with Americanizing the characters, their relations, and their background.  The writers did a great job of only Americanizing the setting while keeping the core plot elements and themes intact.  (Personally, I really enjoyed the Seattle apartment complex which Naomi Watt's character lives in because the buildings looked decidedly more Japanese than American. :D )  Furthermore, there were some additional scenes and freaky stuff that I don't remember seeing in the Japanese original.  Those new stuff and the Hollywood production value did a good job of improving the movie.  The acting was pretty good too.  Definitely more compelling than the Japanese version, IMHO.Unfortunately, I was let down by the climactic ending of the movie. Naturally, I will not spoil the movie for you by going into details.  But let me just say that I found the Japanese ending to be ten times more freaky (and memorable!) than the American one.  In terms of the plot, the endings are practically the same, but how the scene was executed was different. I feel that the Japanese ending was more tightly directed and more freaky as a result, compared to the slightly self-indulgent ""ooh, isn't this scary"" American rendition of the same scene.But apparently, I felt that way only because I had watched the original. There were plenty of girls screaming and guys yelling ""Holy $#!+"" in the theater, and my cousin (who had not watched the Japanese original) was very freaked out too.  I was definitely among the minority.All in all, I think ""The Ring"" is a great remake of the Japanese original. Even though I personally feel that they somewhat botched the ending (probably only because I'm comparing it to the Japanese original, which most people probably haven't even heard of anyways), the American version successfully brings the feel of the Japanese occult and horror to the American moviegoers.  It definitely ain't your usual hack-and-slash cheese-and-sleaze gore-horror flick.  It's a great, great movie for the Halloween season, and I expect it to enjoy a long, happy life at the box office.Oh, as a side note, while watching David Letterman the other night, I learned that Naomi Watts (the leading actress) went to the same high school with Nicole Kidman in Australia.  Maybe that's why Naomi has same facial expression things going on as Nicole.  I thought it was very interesting. I wonder if I'm the only one who saw that.  :)",The Ring
568,chilipalmer,One of the most genuinely scary movies ever made,10,11 November 2002,"I hardly ever have the motivation to come on here and comment on a movie, but this one is worth that effort. I am a massive fan of horror movies and films of intrigue.  I can easily say that The Ring is way up on my top ten list of scary movies.  And I mean scary movies. There are horror films which are just great thrillers, like Seven and the Hannibal trilogy and others like Friday 13th or Scream that are inventive in their death scenes.  Then there are the very few that genuinely jolt and unnerve you, prompting you to cover your eyes with your hands and make your heart leap like on a rollercoaster. Films like The Shining and Fire Walk With Me.   This is definitely one of those.I have not seen the Japanese original so I cannot offer a comparison, but this US version pulled off what in my opinion is one one of the most chilling movies ever made.

Please watch it for the scene in which whatever tension was being attempted is brought to an abrupt halt by the man being yanked to the ground by the firehose. I'm thinking the film must have glitched in editing and no one saw that that take made it to the final cut until it was released. I certainly hope this is what happened.

Anyway the film's kind of dark, don't expect to leave it in the theatre it goes home with you for a while!ja,ja.(not joking). It is really intense! ** Spoilers ahead ** it starts  with this girl who dies after seen a strange videotape with rough images and a doomed call the minute after seeing it!! There's where reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) starts investigating the strange death, she founds the tape and right after she sees it the phone rang and behind the misterious call a voice of a child saying ""seven days"" wich is the time of life she  have left after seeing this tape. So then Rachel must hurry to find out what's it all about along with Noah (Martin Henderson) who also sees the tape a day after Rachel. The mistery clears up little by little and nothing's what it seems believe me, there's even a time when you think its ending hollywood style, but the really scary stuff is yet comming!! I must say i liked the film  it's very original, but pay much attention because the plot doesn't give everything directly away, some people whom had seen it stays with plot holes, may be 'cause of the state of fright they're in the moment.

574,pyramidhead84,The most psychologically terrifying movie I've ever seen,9,27 October 2006,"This movie scared the bujeezus out of me. That's saying a lot for someone like me, who has been watching horror movies since childhood. A lot of people may be disappointed that there is so little gore, but honestly, that is the very reason this movie is so great. This movie utilizes suspense and fear of the unknown in a way that I've never seen before. The basis of the story goes as follows: A teenage girl is found dead, huddled in her closet. The friend who was with her that night is sent to a mental health facility. No one can explain what happened to either of the girls, so the grieving mother asks her sister Rachel, a reporter, to investigate for some answers. Rachel slowly pieces together the last few days of the dead girl's life and discovers that she and her friends all watched a mysterious videotape. She finds the tape and watches it herself. The video makes little sense and is mostly a series of frightening imagery and curious music. Immediately after she is finished watching, the phone rings. The voice on the other end whispers, ""Seven days."" For the next seven days, Rachel is subject to horrifying visions and physical anomalies, all while trying to uncover the truth behind ""the videotape that kills you when you watch it"". It's a race against time to save herself and her young son from a mysterious yet certain death. The film utilizes suspense to frighten the audience. It's not immediately clear exactly what fate awaits those who've watched the tape, aside from the fact that after seven days, you will die. Visually, the movie uses subtle colors, causing the foreboding mood to nearly swallow the viewers whole. Imagery from the cursed video is reiterated throughout the movie in sometimes subtle, other times obvious ways. Fear of the unknown is the movie's weapon of choice. Gore is nearly non-existent; one of the images in the cursed video depicts a fingernail being torn from it's base, but it is shown in black and white and for less than a second. The only other time blood is used to terrify happens when a horse falls from a barge and is sucked into the spinning blades of the engine. Even this is not all that hard to watch, as all you can see is the water behind the vessel turning crimson a few moments after the horse goes under. If you are tired of the same old Texas Chainsaw Massacres and Cabin Feveresque movies, check out The Ring. Psychological terror is far more disturbing than any limb-ripping bloodfest could be.

Is is a great scary movie or are there so many unanswered questions that it was just too unsatisifying.  The answer to both questions is ""Yes"".This movie was a great date flick.  I'm pretty sure that most people understood that the little girl was some ""force of death"", like the grim reaper.  Everyone was at the edge of their seats trying to unravel the mystery of the connection of why the killer's modus operandi was confined to killing only those who saw the tape.There were some other technical questions that went unanswered. Maybe on an artistic level, it is better leaving everything up in the air and allowing the audience to theorize their own explanations.  But still, the questions beckon for answers.  The only problem is that in the sequel-happy mindset that is Holloywood, most of us know that most sequels somehow cheapen the novelty and artistic integrity of the original.",The Ring

I thought ""The Ring"" was extremely well made, with great pacing, acting, cinematography, characters, and a suberbly creepy soundtrack. My wife and son were so freaked out by it that they refuse to even be in the room when I watch it - but, then we all have very active imaginations. My brother, on the other hand, and two of the people I work with could not get into it and were not scared in the least, so to each his own. I think the key word with this film is ""subtlety"". If you like horror/suspense movies that scare you with the subtle things you can't see, then ""The Ring"" excels. If you want some knife-wielding maniac to jump out at you every 10 minutes, then you will probably be bored and underwhelmed. As far as the ""holes"" in the plot, several explanitory scenes were cut from the final film because they disrupted the flow.

What followed created more and more shivers: the gloomy pictures in foggy, rainy landscape and the well-wrought plot giving you no clue where it all ends did not fail to make this quite a frightener. The video itself is a fine, morbid piece of art, the clues in it are so hidden that one does not think that there is actually a story hidden in it. And the end was a really cynical surprise. This is a modern version of the classical subtle haunted-castle horror. Stay away if your nerves are thin - or if you lack sensitivity and only go for splatter blood-baths. (9/10)",The Ring
579,rodneyrude01,Superbly crafted and most of all..scary,10,20 November 2002,"After recently seeing The Ring, it is not since The Blair Witch Project that I have been scared and freaked out so much by a horror film. After the endless array of horror films that rely on people bumping into each other or the use of orchestral blastings after a period of silence, The Ring creates one of the most unnerving cinematic experiences ever and having none of the latter cheap scare devices.After just seeing the Japanese version, there are few differences between the two but as a gasp to many other horror fans, I do prefer the US version. I thought the screenplay was more in depth and the changes and additions writer Ehren Kruger composed, really added an edge to the original story of The Ring. Although the well scenes were more chilling in the Japanese version, The Ring was a film which really needed a bigger budget and more polished visuals to suck the most juice of of the story's great potential and the US version perfected it without ruining it with the usual loudness, gloss and insubtlety.Never seeing director Gore Verbinsky's previous work, i was extremely impressed. After the 'Scream' influenced opening, I'd have to say it had me on the edge of my seat more than the 3 Scream films combined. His use of little music, unnerving sound effects and the splashes of stylish transitions and shots were very beneficial to create the extremely creepy atmosphere. Along with the help of cinematographer Bojan Bazelli, The film features a very dull and overcast look which in such scenes as the horse sequence, add elements of mystique and coldness.Overall The Ring is an excellent film that creates the atmosphere and genuine scares that horror films have lacked for years. With various complaints of plot holes and seldom explanations for plotlines, it IS a horror film, there will always be plotholes to make the film more entertaining and if people always need plots spoonfed to them, wait for the next wave of Summer blockbusters in 2003. With the jawdropping ending, accomplished acting, It provides a twisting and chilling experience that many of us have waited for in a horror film for a long time.",The Ring
580,ccjuggalo69,you have GOT to be kidding me,3,17 February 2005,"Well, I just watched The Ring for the first time, and it was probably the dumbest movie I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the horror genre, and was practically raised on them. I had very low expectations for this film, and after the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought the my expectations would be proved wrong. The movie got off to a very spooky start, and then just grasped at straws for the remainder of the film. The movie starts off with two teenage girls talking about this video that kills you when you watch it, and true to horror movie form, one of them is doomed. It was a spooky setup and I was starting to look forward to seeing the rest of the film. . .only to be brought back down to my original expectations. The movie continues on from this point to follow Naomi Watts' character around as she investigates the tape. She follows all her clues, and asks a million and one questions about the tape, and those involved in the making of the tape, and then the movie ends without answering any of the questions. It really is a shame. It is the success of this film that has sent the horror movie genre on the lame downward spiral of PG-13 ghost movie after PG-13 ghost movie, and the movie was absolutely pointless, and not scary.

581,kalel6868,"Absolutely Riveting, an Improvement on the Original",9,3 December 2002,"It's nice to know that occasionally, Hollywood CAN do it right.No doubt about it, THE RING is one of the scariest, most intense horror films I have ever seen.  And that's amazing, considering I'd already seen the original Japanese movie it's based on, RINGU, and pretty much knew what was going to happen all through the film and was still on the edge of my seat.  The screenplay by Ehren Kruger manages to faithfully retell the original film's story but add just enough new twists to keep you guessing.The story follows reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) on the trail of an urban legend about a cursed videotape.  Apparently, as soon as you finish watching the tape, your telephone rings and a whispered voice tells you that you have seven days to live; and at the end of seven days, you die.  Rachel is drawn into the mystery of the tape when her sixteen-year-old cousin drops dead, apparently a victim of the curse.Pretty soon Rachel finds the tape itself, and, being the reporter she is, she watches it and, sure enough the phone rings... and suddenly she believes.It's incredible how much more suspenseful this film is than the original, considering that it follows the same basic outline.  One way it does this is by adding new texture to each scene; what was eerie in the first film is absolutely frightening in this one.  And director Gore Verbinski's visual style keeps the tension building, with an almost total lack of humor (which is interesting in and of itself, considering all of his previous films have been comedies).To sum it all up, this is an amazing film you do NOT want to watch alone!",The Ring

I can watch any type of zombie movie that can be thrown at me. But this movie has a less then direct way of getting to you. An artistic approach to the typical what's ""behind the door"" style of suspense really lets this movie push people's senses. When the movie first starts you won't really know where there going but after the first 15 there is a defining moment in the movie that will keep you weirded out for the remainder of the film. But as it's been stated before, only of you let it be. I heard a few rumors about this film that `It's the next best horror / suspense film since 6th sense'. So I dimmed the lights except a candle or two and challenged the movie to get to me. With the DTS on full alert (Try it in Pro Logic II for the hard core VHS guru's out there). I was well surrounded by the unique yet eerie sounds this film had to offer. And let me tell you the sounds are the money makers with this film. The plot can easily be put on paper; the film can be easily watched. But if you let the sound put you in the movie... be prepared to be crept out... for a few nights. I watched this on DVD but I have a good feeling for those of you that watch it at home on a quiet night on VHS.

583,Thelightbulb,An unbiased view,7,24 October 2003,"I haven't seen the original Japanese version of this film, so i was able to watch the film without having to compare it to Ringu. As a result i quite liked this film. I found it to be genuinely scary and well acted. Unlike most horrors that are produced in Hollywood nowadays this film turns its back on ""teen horror"", and the opening sequence can perhaps be seen as a kind of tongue in cheek rejection of teen based horror movies. The storyline in this movie manages to captivate you into the film; you find yourself caring for the main characters as well as feeling a fascinating mixture of pity and horror for the family featured in the video tape.Overall therefore the film comes across as a decent horror movie, with the director Gore Verbinski wisely using suspense over blood to scare the audience. Verbinski is triumphant in so far as he has created a film whose dark mood manages to leave an unsettling psychological effect on the audience by the end of the film. The main actors too are in good form, in the shape of Australiasians Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson. Another major plus for this film is the cinematic use of colouring. There is a distinct use of dark greenish imagery throughout this film which greatly heightens the gloomy atmosphere that Verbinski clearly wants to create.That said this film is not without criticism. The ending is unsatisfactory and damages much of the good work of the film up until that point. There is also little attempt made at making sense of just who the little girl really was, and why she was doing what she was. The boy too is a bit tedious, his character almost seems to be saying to the audience ""we wanted Haley Joe Osmond but he is now too old and too expensive."" That aside this is a decent horror movie, though had i seen the original, like with so many other Hollywood remakes i suspect i would have been disappointed with this film.",The Ring

I didn't find it scary in the least and fairly comedic at times when it wasn't intended to be (its pure slapstick when the horse jumps off the boat).  The plotline seems solid enough but it lacks any real depth.  The videotape in question origin is never explained, nor where it came from, only a horror story involving a child (which has become fairly cliche in psychological horror movies as of late).The supposed 'twist' at the end (which was supposedly more surprising than the one in ""The Sixth Sense"") was bland and didn't warrant me going through and watching the movie again to appreciate the full magnitude of it, since there was no real magnitude to it whatsoever.I always liked movies that had an open-ended finale, but this was just idiotic.  The question ""How can we stop this tape from killing more people?"" is essentially asked.  My response:  JUST DESTROY THE DAMN TAPE!!!  The special effects were admittedly very well done, especially in the final scene, but that's hardly reason to recommend so much as a rental of this. Don't waste your time.",The Ring
585,joshm-gemmell,A great film based on the Suzuki novel,9,12 June 2009,"If you are a fan of the original Suzuki novel, you will enjoy this. The film IS NOT an adaption of the original novel. This however is a positive factor as it allowed the writers to tool with the concept of the cursed videotape, giving Sadada/Samara an interesting, new back story for us to follow.This film could have been like any other modern day horror, knives, blood and mindless violence. This film, however focuses on a more mystery based Thriller, which is good as it doesn't ruin the atmosphere of the original Suzuki novel.The acting is very good, Naimoi Watts does an amazing job at capturing the films horror psychologically. The child actor playing her son is very skilled as well and creates an eerie feel to some of the scenes.The film isn't very graphic and focuses on a more artistic horror. This is a nice break from the amount of mindless slashers like saw and the stupidly on going Jason series. The film only doesn't get a 10 stars because the book had a slightly more gripping back story for Sadada/Samara and explained a bit more about why the cursed videotape exists.

Anyway, I finally taped a modified version of the American movie from HBO and watched it during the day with the curtains open. My hair stood on end and I had to take two breaks but I got through it.It is a very harrowing and clever film - and don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it by saying more. Previously I thought ""Halloween"" (the first one) was the creepiest film ever (the music is still haunting) but this film is a masterpiece - scarier than ""The Sixth Sense"" but similarly unnerving and deserving of a repeat viewing. I compare it to ""Seven"" for shock value and style.Now I have to summon up the courage to watch the Japanese version.",The Ring

That specific desire coupled with the nice camera work were the only things that got me through this ""nightmare"" of a film. The cinematography is really impressive; evoking Kubrick (mostly from The Shining)and at times even Spielberg (specifically from Poltergeist). The director has definitely done his visual homework. The film itself evoked my previously-eaten taco to become uncomfortable in my tummy and work its way up my throat. I'll let you read about the plot holes (more like plot abysses)from other reviewers as I am not interested in wasting much more of my time with anything associated with this flop of a film.

As the movie goes along, it's just like a confusing puzzle, and as it moves closer to the end, everything begins to fall into place for you, and it's fantastic how Verbinski can do it with such power.

I will say the acting is stellar as is the atmosphere and the storyline IMO was fresh and new for that time.

595,eibeh007,Overrated,6,21 May 2007,"Many critics heaped praise on this film, some even calling it the scariest film since ""The Exorcist"". I can name several horror films that were far more scarier than this film. Is it is a good horror movie? Yes. A great one? I don't think so. ""The Ring"" is just as overrated and devoid of scares as ""The Blair Witch Project"". If you want a good scare, I suggest horror films like ""The Omen"", ""Suspiria"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", and ""The Changeling"". ""The Ring"" isn't a patch on these horror classics.""The Ring"" is obviously a remake of a 1998 Japanese film called ""Ringu"", which is a much better and scarier version. I liked some things about this film--the sense of foreboding and atmosphere of the film, the background score, most of the performances. I thought Naomi Watts gave a fantastic performance, as did David Dorfman, who plays Noami's creepy young son. Brian Cox and Jane Alexander were both quite effective in their small roles. Daveigh Chase gives a chilling performance as Samara. I didn't like Martin Henderson's performance. I thought it was rather empty.

The most dreadful thing about ""The Ring"" is its characters' lack of belief in and respect for themselves.  Thus, to me, this movie draws comparison to the equally-dreadful, boring and inane ""Blair Witch Project"".My neurotic and droll mind actually thought that DreamWorks' marketing funds generated (a) the good buzz on this movie from the starving media, (b) the bad buzz from the media on ""Abandon"" (another inane thriller movie which opened at the same time as ""The Ring"" on 10/18/02) (Translation:  No marketing funds from Paramount), and (c) the phony squeals, screams and applause from the Saturday night audience at Loews Cinema at Universal City in Los Angeles.In the end, it's all about money and good old-fashioned ballyhoo.

598,lebowski_achiever,The Ring vs Ringu,8,22 February 2003,"I have never known an original to be less of a movie than the remake but in this case I have to give it to Gore Verbinski for keeping the tone of the original in-tact but amplifying the chills a few notches. I was disappointed with the original (I tried very hard to like it) although the tone was decidedly creepy. The remake really delivers. It is everything a scary chiller movie is supposed to be (including plot holes and far fetched premise). The story line of how the girl came to be so evil was nastier in the original (but why did they switch from the father being the culprit in the original to the mother in the remake??) but the tale around how the tape came into existence was more plausible in The Ring. It gave me the creeps throughout without resorting to gore or special effects. Also,I thought that the character development of Rachel was very cleverly done and more developed. You were meant not to care for her parenting skills in the beginning as it gave the chance for her to redeem herself as a parent when the father did not. Naomi Watts character was certainly flawed and this added to yourself being drawn into the movie. Cardboard cutouts never do well in this type of movie.  The role of the son was more prominent in this one which was no bad thing although 6th sense comparisons are inevitable.All in all I would suggest to see both the original and then the remake and make up your own mind. I actually think they compliment one another. I certainly think more of the original now then I did before. This is maybe because I saw it in a more 'western' context and it filled in a lot of unanswered questions I had before I saw the remake.",The Ring
599,rayw-4,Be careful reading if you haven't seen it -- POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!,5,12 March 2003,"Standing on its own, The Ring is probably an above-average horror movie. Having said this, I'll admit that this review is biased toward the original Japanese version, Ringu. Believe me, I know that by reading most of the reviews on this film that a lot of people disagree with me. However, I tend to believe that the reason for this may be due to the fact that some of these people have seen the remake first which would kill the element of surprise in Ringu. The problems that I had with The Ring were its representation of the antagonist and some of the plot outlines throughout the movie. The whole aspect of the horse subplot was needless. Then, to add more to this, you have the horse and the ferry ride which still serves no real purpose to the movie except to add more time to the already overlong 116 minutes. And why are we always treated to the same ""I don't believe you"" to the ""you're right, something's going on"" scenario that seems to be always present in today's horror movies? At least with Ringu, the male role in that movie is smart enough at the start to realize that something out of the ordinary is going on, therefore, saving us from this cliché and moving us toward the rest of the story. And now we come to our antagonist, Sardona. This was a complete letdown for me. I know, again I'm comparing an original to a remake but it can't be helped -- Sardona doesn't hold a candle to Sadako's creepy demeanor.
I'm not saying that this movie doesn't have its moments. The opening sequence really grabs you and made me think at the time that it could possibly surpass the original. Honestly, I would recommend The Ring if only for the fact of the beginning and parts of the third act. But I would also recommend seeing the original Ringu first in order to preserve the surprises.",The Ring

She watches the scary tape; heold flame watches the scary tape; he scary kid watche the scarytape; scary girl calls each of them and tells them that they haveseven scary days to live before they die scary deaths at the handsof a scary girl with no motive at all whatsoever to be doing whatshe is doing. Scary things abound.Only none of it is particularly frightening. In fact I found most of thefilm to be quite laughable and never for a moment entertaining.

605,marshmallow_pies,A truly worthy remake of one of the scariest films of all time.,8,15 November 2002,"It had its faults, but The Ring was genuinely scary. At a point in life where chainmail and urban legends are at the maximum, I entered this film with caution, and was rather put off by the opening scene. ""Well, this is just Scream all over again."" Two minutes later I took that back, and sat transfixed to the screen, afraid to watch, afraid to shut my eyes (unlike my companion in the seat next to me, who assumed the feotal possition for 95% of the film).Perhaps the creepiest part was the tape itself, and I walked out with a strong desire to hire the Japanese films on DVD and get the full story, rather than wait for the next film (which there no doubt will be, knowing Hollywood and its ability to ruin a good film in order to get a great franchise). Would you know it? None of my local video stores had the DVDs AT ALL! Which really annoyed me, because I am really intrigued by the whole idea.I liked the reference to rear window, with the man in the cast. To the ""constructive criticsm"": The plot was easily deciphered. I managed to string together everything 25 minuted before the climax of the film (and I am NOT talking about the ending.) Things neatly fell into place for me.I should like to compare the USA version to the Jap, and the original text, and see if it was realy easy to solve, or if the US version fell short due to writers dumbing down the text so that every Tom Dick and Harry will be able to understand it, even if they have had their eyes poked out and their ears blown off. An above average pyscological thriller could have become a GREAT one, with a much tighter, interlectual script (like ""The Usual Suspects"" crossed with ""The Shining""). But ""The Ring"" was a fresh idea, with an interesting plot and impressive visuals. It was a nice change from the Hohum prequel to a brilliant thriller of 1992. Worthy use of my $10.50",The Ring

I was genuinely frightened throughout the entire length of the film.  I will go see this film again at least twice, and I suggest you do, too.

607,Solid Eagle,Very Overrated,7,25 December 2002,"After watching both versions,the original and the USA remake,all i can say is that both are very overrated,im not saying they were bad movies but just to overrated,especially the USA version. Maybe the reason of this could be that,comparing to the other ""horror"" films of hollywood from the past years,like Hallowen Resurrection,Jason X,Scream,etc,almost anythyng else could be scarier,even seeing a fly pass by,and so the audiences think the Ring is so good just because is not another slasher-teen crap.The film creates a good atmosphere,but trows a lot of irrelevant plot events that made a lot of confussion,and the ""scary"" moments come more from cheap editing tricks,in a very hollywood style,when they are going to understand that especial effects don´t make a movie good?I didn´t like the ending,and the ending of both versions are similar,but in the USA version,because of all the unnecesary elements they put it in(horses,bugs,nosebleeding,puting the son of Rachel in a six-sense context,etc) the ending seems more weak that in the japanese version.Also,the face of Samara doesn´t scare at all,meanwhile the face of Sadako it´s complettly more frigthening,and when she crawl out of the TV is more convincing too. Overall,The Ring is not a bad film as it´s own,but saying that is one of the most spooky movies of the last years,again,just because the other USA horror films from the last years(Scream,Blair Witch,etc) sucks a lot that doesn´t neccesarilly make this one the ""best"" of all,just a little more good from the average,that´s all.At first,i gave it 2 stars of 4,but now i really aprecciatte a lil more this version,and after seeing that the Japanese version is not worthy of all the hype(but also not a bad film),i will give it 2 1/2 stars to the USA version.",The Ring

609,purplehayes76,"Creepy, Post-Modern and Haunting.",8,18 October 2002,"Rule #1 of watching this movie - it is a remake with two subsequent sequels...it isn't meant to come to a neat conclusion. The ""barn door"" is left gaping open for part two at the end.Rule #2- leave the kids at home unless you want to cough up for expensive therapy bills and remove your tv and phone from your house.I am a big fan of horror films, and ""The Ring"" just about pushed me over the threshold of what I can stand in terms of scariness (still not sure if this is a good or bad thing). This is a beautiful, haunting, stylized and permanently mind-altering film.As I sat in the theater, I was struck by the thought that ""The Ring"" will become this generation's ""Psycho"" or ""Poltergeist."" This film is no mere horror movie. ""The Ring"" embraces its forefathers of the genre, then proceeds to spin it's own near-therapy-inducing post-modern chills. One of the characters asks ""Where does your mom keep her Vicodin?"" You will be wishing you had some too after the first freaky, wicked-creepy flash of disturbing imagery.What ""Psycho"" did for showers, ""The Ring"" does for tv's, (with a concious nod to ""Poltergeist"") vcr's, log cabins, forests, phones - you name it. Like Hitchcock, (note the homage to ""Psycho"" in Rachel's shower scene)the film does not derive its terror from gore or thrill kill - but rather through a painstakingly deliberate unfolding and revealing. ""The Ring"" was at times so dramatically tense and creepy, you felt you needed a break, but the director shows no mercy. (Yeah, and director-dude, thanks for all those ""false scares,"" I really needed those in addition to all the other trauma).There is much to praise about ""The Ring,"" and it seems destined to become both a block buster and a cinephile's cult favorite. The film craft is excellent - stunning visuals, spot-on music and atmospheric noise, good script, good acting and masterful direction. ""The Ring"" is elevated above the typical genre film.The myriad of meta-narrative and meta-cinematic elements only add to the meat of this film. Point 1- we are watching a movie about people watching a movie that kills them (and just wait till the home video! Try putting that in your VCR a second time). At numerous points in the film, it posits, and you think to yourself - will we the viewer die too, having seen ""the tape??""Also, interestingly, we mirror Rachel - we want to ""show"" people ""the tape"" (aka ""The Ring""), but we don't want to ""kill them"" with being freaked out and emotionally scarred. We also mirror her process of discovery as we look back and try to piece the film together - I see flashes of the movie as concepts click into my comprehension.The film does not explain everything, and to fault it for that I believe misses the point. There is much to ponder and discuss. You will want to see the originals, and simultaneously not want any more of those images in your head.See it, but only if you want to carry Samara (is this a gloss for Samsara??) in your head forever.",The Ring

I was slapping myself all true the movie and as the story progressed got more and more annoyed with the whole thing.  Then I saw the ace actor Brian Cox and thought that maybe he could raise the level of the movie a bit. But he saw that there was no saving this movie and he quickly killed off his character in a very very strange way.  This was just one of the things that does not make any sense. This remake loses the steady pace Ringu and adds all kinds of things I still don't know what these added to the story.  What was that with the horses? Why does the kid think he sees dead people (pun intended)? Horrible movie, watch Ringu and Ringu 2 (a few scenes of which also end up in this remake adding more confusion) instead.",The Ring
612,temes-adam,why is it scary?,10,17 September 2010,"There are no words with which I can describe this movie. Maybe ""amazing"" or ""brilliant"". The Ring is an absolutely perfect film about the ""invisible"" which makes you scared. I think it has had a part in the movie-history with its innovation after the bloody horrors and own atmosphere which is the most depressing I have ever seen. Because you're afraid of something you cannot see.I was just 12 when I saw it the first time - everybody spoke about this film, how scary it is, and that it's a story about a tape which kills you when you watch it - and it was a memorable day for me. I had thought I would be afraid of it, but then I wouldn't. It was something else. With its blue-green hues and fantastic music has ever composed to a thriller, I just felt sadness and depress. And yeah, it was scary in an other way. But not in the word's normal meaning. It created such a kind of atmosphere that no movies have ever did and I think they won't. That's why it is a perfect creation. And this film is gonna be the movie like the X-Files which everybody saw and made them scared in their childhood.Having watched it I heard that it's a remake and years later I watched the original version. But I realized I don't care it's a remake. Who cares? The Ring is an excellent movie and to tell you the truth I didn't find the original film good. It was very different than the American version. It wasn't bad but the director understands the message in an other way than The Ring's. And Ringu is also based on a novel so it can be announced as a ""remake"" too. Two film, two messages.The most interesting thing about The Ring is that actually you cannot explain what you afraid of. Are you afraid of a tape? A simple object? Ridiculous. But it is the truth. A tape makes you scared. With its disturbing pictures, noises, sounds and elements. I think that this short movie is a kind of art work. Fantastic how the director can transform everyday happenings into disturbing elements. It could have won an Oscar.I like the actors playing. I think David Dorfman acts very well as a child, and I don't think we have to discuss anything about Naomi Watts. She is perfect too. Nothing overacting. And when I watched it years later when I became older I found another message about The Ring.I found it sad. It is a sad story. A mother kills her daughter. Why? Because the horses bear themselves nervous? That's not enough. It is a sad story because a mum cannot stand her kid and she feels the only way to be quit of is death. And then she commits suicide. A series of deaths. Because of a little girl. Lots of unexplainable happenings. And with them I've told almost nothing about the movie.And why is it scary? I have no answer. Complicated, original, unexplainable, brilliant. The Ring itself is the answer.",The Ring
613,williamsij,Easily better than the original,9,5 September 2008,"To remake a 'cult' classic it seems, is to incur the wrath of those who loved the original so much that any thought of remaking it is blasphemy. This, it seems, is despite the imperfections of the original. For a horror film to be truly effective, however, never have the 'imperfections' been so important. For a horror film to work properly, you actually have to be scared. It has to be like the ghost stories older kids told you when you were kids (not the censored version your parents told you).I think in terms of the 'The Ring' I was lucky in that I got to see the American version first. As a result, I didn't know the story and so seeing this version of the story as my first view of the tale had the same effect on me (no doubt) as people who saw the Japanese original for the first time.I often believe that an original is better than it's remake ('The Vanishing', 'Yojimbo', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' to name many). Let's not even bring 'The hitcher' into this discussion. In this case, however, the far superiour production values of the original make for a much scarier film than the original. I watched this version - the hairs stood up on my legs as I was watching it. I saw the original afterwards and it didn't have anyway near the same effect. Sure - you say - you knew what was coming! That's true - but then I watched this version again I had almost exactly the same sensation as when i watched it the first time.Why? That's easy. For a film to work you need to be willling to suspend your disbelief. For a horror film to be scary, this is even more important. The superior production values of the remake make it much easier to suspend your disbelief and therefore it is more effective as a horror piece. Compare one directly to the other and you;ll see that the story is in no way compromised - but that the characters are richer, the acting is better, the effects are way, way ,way, way better and the tension is even more drawn out.Simply put THIS is EXACTLY how to take an original film that used story to scare the bejesus out of you and then make a better film that has the same fundamental psychological effect.

614,smvouriot,Darkly Beautiful Horror Movie,9,26 September 2014,"Gore Verbinski's 'The Ring',released in 2002, still possesses a distinct eerie quality which continues to effectively creep out audiences 12 years after it's initial release. This is largely due to the wise directorial choices made by 'Pirates of the Caribbean' director Verbinski in shifting the focus away from gore and more on atmosphere.What sets 'The Ring' apart from most horror movies of today and recent years, is the emphasis put on atmosphere, visuals and suspense, much unlike popular films such as the 'Saw' franchise, which rely more on gore and gratuitous torture scenes to shock or scare the audience. Unlike the 'Saw' sequels(or even 'The Human Centipede')which are just excuses to show people being killed in graphic and disturbing ways, 'The Ring' hooks you in with a compelling and interesting story with revelations and discoveries made one after the other. Technically, the film unfolds like a mystery, with reporter Rachel Keller(played sturdily by Naomi Watts) investigating the curse of a strange videotape and the dark secrets it possesses. No more will be said about the plot, as the fun of watching the film for the first time is discovering the secrets of the tape. A second viewing is where one can be more able to appreciate the enormous amount of craft and effort put in by Verbinski and his production team, which is where much of the beauty of the film lies.'The Ring' is set in Seattle and surrounding Pacific Northwest locales, which gives the film an exceedingly rainy and gloomy look. The filters and colour schemes that Verbinski and cinematographer Bojan Bazelli employ to capture these locations is of a sickly green and blue tint, which makes the look of the whole movie appear somewhat unnatural, or 'off', which is subtle but extremely effective in it's own right.The score, by renowned composer Hans Zimmer, is absolutely brilliant in evoking different moods throughout the film. While there are the somewhat typical loud booms in the soundtrack when something frightening or tense is occurring on screen, it is the quieter segments of the score that give the film it's unique and beautiful sense of melancholy. Zimmer employs many types of instruments, including effective use of the piano, to give 'The Ring' a haunting quality that echoes with sadness and despair, with sinister violins succeeding in painting an atmosphere of dread, while in contrast pianos and other instruments combine to create the melancholy atmosphere. There are even segments of the score, for example a grim lullaby from one of the film's characters, that actually give the film an almost fairytale like quality. The eight minute track from the score, entitled 'The Well', represents a fantastic overview of most of the musical ideas explored by Zimmer, and is a great listening experience in itself.The core theme at the heart of the film is the negative side of television. For example, the two(rather clichéd) teenage girls at the beginning of the film discuss how the unhealthy waves from watching too much TV can result in brain cell loss. Later in the film, Rachel is out on the balcony looking into the adjacent apartments across the street. The camera pans over several windows, showing people transfixed to the television screen, accompanied by Zimmer's sad and moody score. And finally, the television acts as the bringer of death to a major character. Since television is such a large part of contemporary daily human life and culture, 'The Ring' shows us a glimpse of the negative side of it and portrays the television as a gateway to another, sinister world that could potentially have the power to kill us. By having the story focus on something as universal as television, 'The Ring' has the power to unsettle basically anyone.One amusing thing about the film is how much of a product of it's time it has now become, mostly due to the fact that the main plot device is a VHS tape(Remember those?). Since VHS tapes are now a thing of the past and have since been succeeded by DVDs and Blu-rays, some plot holes in the narrative do come to mind if you think about it for a bit. But never mind. The movie is too beautifully made and creepy to get nitpicky over, complete with a bleak and terrifying non-ending that will get you thinking, 'will it ever stop?'",The Ring
615,ciccarellib,Excellent movie!,9,6 August 2012,"Though I can't compare this to the Japanese version since I've never seen it, this movie on it's own is quite great. The soundtrack is also interesting, containing a creepy tonality but fast paced tempo which provides the feeling that the viewer is unraveling a mystery. This movie has a few jumps, but what makes it great is the creepy atmosphere (greyish tint the whole time) and the psychologically induced terror. I imagine this movie was scarier when the tape format was more prominent, but this film is still worth watching. The Japanese version of this movie really created what most people today consider Japanese horror, and the American version is no slouch. A must-see for anyone interested in horror or mystery!",The Ring
616,misterronaldweasley,Wonderfully creepy!,9,31 December 2004,"One of the few PG-13 flicks that actually managed to get under my skin! Adapted from Koji Suzuki's novel, a female reporter investigates the origins of a tape that supposedly kills you one week after watching it after her niece is the last supposed victim of the tape's deadly curse. This one is way better than its Japanese original, ""Ringu"", of which it was a remake of. For one thing, it's pace isn't as deathly boring and Verbinski directs the movie with more visual flair than his Japanese counterpart. There are some truly scary ""jump moments"" thrown in here and there that caught me completely off guard and the imagery in this film is top notch. The killer tape in this one actually IS unsettling, unlike the one in ""Ringu"", and Samara is 10 times scarier than her Japanese alter-ego Sadako. It's best to think of this as a supernatural detective story and I enjoyed not being able to predict where the movie was going, I was along for the whole ride, right down to terrific ""twist"" ending that is only one of few in recent memory that I didn't manage to see coming a mile away. An oppressed, dreadful and genuinely creepy atmosphere prevails throughout and is possibly the film's strongest asset...this one will get under your skin. Naomi Watts is excellent as well as everyone else involved in this. Often suffers from corniness however and the plot hits it's ups and downs along the way, but there is enough here to make up for it.

From the teen's dead face in the closet at the beginning to the girl crawling out of the well and then out of the t.v. at the end and everything in between made this movie great. I read the comment in the beginning and it said that it was just silly. All horror is silly because it is not based on reality, but what makes a movie horrifying is our imagination. You have to have imagination for most everything that comes out of Hollywood especially horror films. I am not known to be emotional, but this movie actually made me move farther back in my seat when Samara crawled out of the well. The screaming teenagers that were probably underage helped with the effect. The reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it was a little slow at times.

It was a much glossier production than the original and did a slightly better job of explaining some of the ambiguities than the original Japanese version.  The shocking scenes of this film had greater impact than did the original.  On the other hand, the original version had a much greater build-up in tension than this one.  The cast in this remake was also far less likeable than the original version (particularly the young boy).  Although these characters clearly understood that their 7 days were running out fast, they sparsely acknowledged it - those in the original version agonized over it.  I would encourage moviegoers to see both versions - particularly those unfamiliar with Japanese psychological horrors.  Those films can be razor sharp.",The Ring

622,kskerby,"Stylish, Disturbing, and better than 'Ringu'- a lot better (no spoilers)",9,25 July 2003,"First thing first, I saw ""Ringu"" about the time I first heard they were shooting an American remake. I watched it and didn't find it bad at all, just- not that good (and I love subtitled movies, so that had nothing to do with it). So it was with some trepidation that I walked into the American version of the film directed by none other than the man who made ""The Mexican.""Well, my worries were unwarrented. This movie was great. I'm a huge movie buff, especially horror movies, and none of the classicly ""terrifying"" films have ever really gotten to me. I have jumped during movies before, but I can honestly say that no film has ever really gotten under my skin until this one. I'm not sure what it was, it's not particularly scary, it just hit the right buttons I guess. After getting ""The Ring"" on DVD, I rented ""Ringu"" just to refresh my memory of it. I was immediately reminded of why I didn't like it very much, and the points were made even more blaring watching the two side by side. ""The Ring"" is very stylish, and in certain scenes/shots rather graphic in visuals (the nail through the finger) or themes (Richard's abuse of Samara). The original, which did also have graphic bits, for me, just lacked intensity. After watching both films probably five times or so I still just can't be affected by ""Ringu"", and I try. From what I've read and people I've talked to, it seems that people who saw ""Ringu"" first prefer it and people who saw ""The Ring"" first prefer it. I don't fit in either category, seeing ""Ringu"" first but finding ""The Ring"" vastly superior. The look, the actors, the storyline (the minor differences improve it a lot), and especially the score are all top notch on this one.
Even if you didn't like ""Ringu"", or you did and don't think this could match up, at least give it a chance.",The Ring

Now, the enthusiasm has been replaced by disappointment.In a mix of Horror, Drama and suspense, they try to follow the tracks of the 6th Sense, but the foot-steps are numbers too great. If you compare: The horror-elements can't shock the visitor. Surprise, an  important ingredient of a thriller, lacks almost total. But this is no surprise, in the eye of a uninspired plot (Female Journalist try to find the origin of a video to safe her life and explores a family tragedy.). This psychological part weaves to be upset and amateurish. A few scenes with Brian Cox are not enough. And when Dorfman whispers about the dead young girl ""She shows me things"", then this shakes you some seconds. But in the next moment you thinks of Osment and the possibilities given away. The makers hadn't the 6th sense for the causes of Shyamalans success and overpaced their project. But little would have been more. They should go back to school.Loan the original, this movie isn't worth a cinema trip!",The Ring
625,Caught22,Surprisingly good and pretty scary,8,22 February 2003,I had an open mind about this one.  The only concern I had was that it might be just another awful teen movie (I'm 33 and long past all that!).  I was pleased with what I saw:  it was scary without any over-the-top gory scenes - there's lots of frights and a bit of suspense with an overall weirdness thrown in.The movie went along at a nice pace - not too slow (I get bored easily!) and it really kept my interest all the way through: I really wanted to find out the answers to all the happenings!

626,MarcColten,"Sorry, no sale (major spoilers)",3,12 October 2003,"Although I am, generally, easily terrified this movie didn't do a thing for me.

(2)  After they find the kid (which is supposed to exorcise the whole thing) her son says ""You weren't supposed to help her.""  Thanks kid, that's a great time to bring that up.  I hate kids in movies who make things worse when they could be helping.  (3) What were they supposed to do?  Was there a way to stop it? (4) I kind of get the ""making a copy spares you"" thing - you're spared if you help the kid.  But why did the son ask what would happen to the person they showed it to?  Who said they have to show it to anyone?Of course they used the old horror film ""out"" of alluding to things that, if told, wouldn't work.  Like (a) how did they actually manage to have Satan's child?  (b) If they did all those bad things to her - why did daddy survive?

627,steve-balogh,Original Japanese version is much better!,8,14 November 2002,"Just a few brief thoughts... In my opinion the ORIGINAL Japanese version of this movie (Ringu, 1998) is much better. There is also a Japanese sequel which is equally good (Ringu 2, 1998). The prequel (Ringu 0, 2000) is somewhat more strained although it tries to explain the history of why things happened in the other two movies. The American version of the film is a direct copy of the Japanese one, and not nearly as good. The only hassle with the Japanese version is having to read the sub-titles.

629,cecilparks,"Unnecessary, irrelevant",6,17 October 2002,"Take ""Ringu"", make it visually slicker, overexplain plot elements that don't really matter and remove the paranormal explanation and you have ""The Ring"". The moviemakers involved in the remake had the laudable idea of taking the near-perfect original plot in new directions, but all their initiatives fall flat by the 75th minute. In-depth character development is not a necessity in a genre movie, just a brief explanation will do. I can't blame the American team for trying to dig deeper, but their new ideas don't hold water and go nowhere. The actors don't even sound like they believe their own lines in a few scenes.There are some great moments in ""The Ring"", but they were integrally lifted from the Japanese version. The way the story unfolds in ""The Ring"" may seem unoriginal to someone who has already seen ""Session 9"", ""Stir of Echoes"" and M. Night Shyamalan's work, but that would be unfair since all those movies were obviously inspired by the J-Horror wave of the late nineties, which arguably culminated with 1998's ""Ringu"" (although I hear the recent ""Dark Water"" is brilliant). If you thought ""The Ring"" was good and if you don't mind sub-titles, do yourself a favor and seek out movies by Kiyoshi Kurosawa (""Cure"", ""Seance""), Hideo Nakata (""Ringu"" 1 and 2, ""Dark Water""), Masayuki Ochia (""Hypnosis""), Takashi Miike (""Audition"", ""Visitor Q"", countless others) and Higuchinsky (""Uzumaki"").",The Ring

I thought that the story was very interesting, held a lot of great detail for the backstory and I didn't find myself wanting for additional detail. I think the movie sewed itself up very nicely and that nothing else was required.The acting was acceptable, it didn't particularly stand out.The actual film itself was not terribly frightening. The scariest parts were when my wife dug her nails in to my arm (she's easier to frighten than I am, apparently). Probably the creepiest part for me in the whole film was when Samara actually came out of the television screen to kill Noah. That was extremely cool. Other then that, it was wanting for any real chills or thrills. I spent most of the film calmly sipping my soda.I will say that it was better than I expected but not as good as I could have hoped. Still, my expectations for horror films have been at at an all time low for the last couple of years so that's not saying much.Overall, I give it a 7/10.

Now, like several other posters on this site, I can't shut my eyes without playing through sequences in the film. Brrrrr, even writing about it conjures up a series of flashbacks. Having said all that.I still give this 10 out of 10. I love creepy films, but this is more than just creepy, it's insidious and nasty, you keep trying to swerve away from the creepy content and think about the atmospheric believable acting or the cinematography, but the shadow of flies, maggots, spinning chairs and grotesque facial distortions are lurking just out of the periphery of your minds eye.

Sorry, this is a bad remake. Not necessarily pointless, it could have been done a lot better.

The story centres on journalist Rachel Keller (played by the beautiful Naomi Watts) who, having seen the tape, has one week to solve its riddle or become its latest victim.Personally, I found this the scariest movie I have seen. I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre (not matter what anybody tells you, this IS a horror film) but I've seen most of the standards and can appreciate a good scary film. The whole atmosphere is downright chilling, and the scenes with Samara in the mental hospital are particularly disturbing. Great credit must go to young Daveigh Chase for her performance. Indeed, the character of Samara must rank as one of the scariest cinematic creations ever. She makes the film and the scenes involving her are the scary ones. And I mean SCARY. Her image will linger with you for long after the film has ended and you will never look at a television the same way again.There are arguments and counter-arguments for whether this is superior to the Japanese original. I want to add my two cents and I'll say this: whichever version you see first will probably be the one you will champion. On repeat viewing the film does lose some of its impact because you know what to expect. You know how the tape kills people and the shock will be gone. Therefore, if you see this after the Japanese version it will seem inferior, and vice versa. That said, its still a very effective horror film and, in my opinion, far superior to anything Hollywood has produced in this genre for a long time. Well worth a look, but I wouldn't advise watching alone because if someone hasn't already told you what happens, it will scare the hell out of you. I gave 8 out of 10.",The Ring

But I am doing so because I felt that the movie was nowhere near the creepiness I was expecting. I heard, and heard from lots of people that this movie was sicko horrifying. So I had expectations, and many expectations. I made environment for watching. I watched this movie when it was 2 of night, alone in my room, wearing headphones and volume cranked to full. The movie began and for whole of the movie I was expecting that now the hell is going to loose, now it will bring the horror out of me. But was I wrong? Yes I was. True that I am kind of person who do not feels horror most of the times. I watched 'Dawn of the dead' (2004) in the same environment and wasn't feeling afraid. If you don't think that Dawn of the dead was creepy, maybe you are right. But I am sure that the first half an hour of that movie is indeed creepy. The movie ended and there was no scene when my heartbeat was increased. I felt that 'Dawn of the dead (2004)' and both Exorcist are more creepy. And this movie lived up nowhere near to the hype.",The Ring

Because other than a little thrill, there's nothing in this movie. Good thing about this, is that it has some scary scenes which will give you goosebumps. A big thumbs up for the makeup artist. Costumes were mediocre. Writing is shit(maybe it's better in the original version), and directing is okay. Acting is also okay, although I expecte more from Naomi Watts.
 
Throughout the movie I had so many questions! I kept thinking ""why?"". You will know what I'm talking about if you've watched the movie. Well, it was 2002 when it was released, and it's 2018 now, so there will be a lot of difference between the horror movies made now and at that time. So taking all this in consideration, I rated it 6/10.The conclusion would be; watch it. That's the better thing to do.

Normally any movie above 8.0 on IMDB with over 100 voters is guaranteed to be great. I was expecting big things.  I could not believe how bad the acting was right off the bat - it looked like a horror comedy.  It was so bad the audience was pretending to scream and then laughing because the scene was so phoney.  There were a couple of good scenes in it that were impressive like the horse falling off the ferry but there were so many bad ones and the story was so unexplained - that it was a relief when the movie ended.  I am utterly astounded at the rating of this movie - I think it must have been a conspiracy to pump up the ratings because I cannot explain how about 1400 people could give it an 8.2 rating - that means 35% of the voters gave it a 10 out of 10.

The Japanese original made me lose sleep for days. The American version is slightly less shocking to anyone that has seen Sadako shake and jump toward the viewers, will find Samara a little less intense. I gave The Ring a 9 out of 10, only a few problems, that most American audiences will never notice, prevented the perfect score I gave the original.Though still incredibly scary and slightly reprocessed through the American film machine. The Ring still packs a punch. We as moviegoers should be ready to see a wave of American/Japanese remakes, as I believe that maybe now Western Filmmakers have realized the ""goldmind"" of awesome movies and stories that only a select group have been privy to seeing.

653,crackboy42,Scariest...Movie...Ever,9,13 December 2002,"Ive seen some scary movies in my days. I have nothing againstsome of the older horror pictures (Hitchcock, etc.) They did anamazing job, but don't really cut it these days. Today they arelooked at as good/but not scary FILMS.Anyway, I saw this movie in the theatre and was squirming theENTIRE time, beginning to end. I think this movie pulled off everyscary movie trick. They had the ""What's around the corner"" trick, the""Don't open the closet door!"" trick, the disturbing images, the ""OHMY GOD!"" sudden jump out trick... this movie scared me in everyway I thought I could be scared.Basically, If you saw Blair Witch Project (and actually thought it wasscary... cause if you didn't this doesn't count) think of that chill thatwent up your spine on the VERY last shot. If you remember theshot and remember that feeling of utter horror... this movie is likethat feeling for 90minutes. NOT 5 seconds...90 MINUTES!One of the girls I saw it with was not impressed. She felt that it wastoo unbelievable. For some reason Red Dragon was the scariestmovie she ever saw. She told me that stuff that CAN'T reallyhappen is not scary. To a degree I get her point. This movie is OUTTHERE...but that's the beauty of it. Another small comment I'd like to make is the fact that the neverexplain what the heck is going on or why. I really thought it was anice treat. They never explained HOW the things happened, youjust believe they do. (Hard to explain without spoiling, but if you'veseen it, you know what I mean).The plot wasn't that great. In fact the movie was a 90 minute hook.It hooked you immediate and never let you go.My beliefs are that if a scary movie makes you afraid of the dark,then it did its job...and I'll tell you, I slept with the lights on thatnight.SEE THIS MOVIE!",The Ring

656,cstead,A Genuine bed-wetter,9,27 October 2002,"Has the Sixth Sense stylized horror? A genre scarred by gore in the 80's and self-mockery in the 90's seems to be taking some positive steps towards the Hitchcock masterpieces of the past. Following on from the success of The Sixth Sense and The Others, The Ring backs an intriguing mystery with some genuine scares. Already a massive success in Japan, The Ring's Hollywood makeover has maintained its allure, proving that originality isn't necessarily the key to success.Taking the premise of an urban myth, The Ring centers around a mysterious video than once observed, leaves the viewer with only seven days to live. Watts (Mulholland Dr., Tank Girl) plays Rachel Keller, a investigative journalist seeking to unlock the reason behind her niece's bizarre murder while juggling a emotionally repressed son (Hoffman) and his lethargic father (Henderson) . When she stumbles upon the video, it becomes clear that she now only has seven days to live. Thus begins The Ring.To disperse more of the plot would jeopardize a brilliant and well told succession of twists, turns and frights. The Ring is genuinely scary, working your sub-conscience into a frenzy of anticipation that keeps an otherwise quiet middle from bogging down the film. Director Verbinski (The Mexican , Mouse Hunt) is in complete control, choosing his scares with unpredictability and providing some magnificently atmospheric eye candy.The performances are excellent. Watts (looking scarily like a blonde Nicole Kidman) and Henderson (Windtalkers) are believable in their fears as the threat of the unknown drives at their splintered family. A good show from the supporting cast is only dented by Hoffman, who, despite looking spooky, comes in several shades down from the peerless Haley Joel Osment in a performance clearly inspired by the seminal child actor of his generation.Horror films have definitely made a positive leap in the last few years and despite some Hollywoodised death scenes, The Ring is a dead set bed wetter. Hard to predict, rarely does the tension let up and the ending is one of the genre's greatest leaving you, at the credits, legitimately fearful of your immediate future. Take a friend and go see.",The Ring
657,perljunkie@yahoo.com,"Chilling, but... (SPOILERS)",8,16 May 2003,"*** Some slight spoilers ahead *** Chilling, but not as scary as some have made it out to be.  I've read through a lot of the user comments here and I'm surprised no one has made reference to Ghost Story.  The similarities are there to be sure -- a drowning, a restless and vengeful spirit that kills, embodiment and revealing of underwater decay, female, etc. I thought the ""unmasking"" of Eva in the house in Ghost Story (when she pulled her wedding veil off to reveal her true features) was more mortifying than Samara's so called ""evil eye"" face that was revealed to Noah in The Ring.  And the opening scene in Ghost Story was far more riviting than the one in The Ring in which just a well was shone.  Ghost Story stayed with me far longer than The Ring did (but I was a lot younger then too, granted.) A lot was made of the horses, but that all turned out to be a side-show. Anyway, if you can be spooked, this film will definitely do it.  But I've been through worse.",The Ring

It is very different and has weird parts to make it scary, like no other horror movie does. Everything seems to move very fast, which is on the edge-of-you-seat kind of style which is great. I like the cast and the acting. I like the use of light, an camera angles. I like the way at the end of each scary scene, it flicks through all of the images on the cursed tape very quickly (it does this 3 times throughout the movie). The suspense build-up causes fearful tension, and gives a sense of creepiness down you spine. I think this should be given a go to watch, even if horror movies scare the living daylights outta you. It's not THAT scary, it's very very well put together, and overall one of the best movies I have ever seen. Fantastic, give it a go!!!",The Ring

I never had the privilege mostly because of my lack of age to sit through first running of horror classics.  Tonight I thought I wonder if people felt like this when they sat through ""Psycho"", ""The Exorcist"", or ""Halloween"" for the first time.  I once said the ""The Blair Witch Project"" would define the horror genre for years to come.  ""The Ring"" might surpass anything ""The Blair Witch Project"" can spawn.

I've seen all of the classic horror films from ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Exorcist.""  I even watched the original ""Ringu"" as well as ""Ring"", the Korean remake of ""Ringu.""

Maybe it was the theater environment or maybe even the mood I was in, but this movie freaked me out.  Driving home wasn't easy and I'll have to see how I do going to sleep tonight.

It's a lot of fun.  9/10.PS: Notice how many people are more disturbed by what happens in the ferry scene with the horse than the fact that four teenagers died.

Some guys will try and be tough guys and say the movie sucked, but that is simply not the case.  The Ring is a truly unique scary movie that deserves to be watched with an open mind. There is a part when you think the movie is over, don't leave just yet. About 6 people got up and left out of the audience I watched it with.  They sure did miss out.

The scene at the start is fantastic, you have no idea what to expect as the girl walks up the stairs, and opens the door. I found the most brutal image the picture of the girl in the closet at the start. This film is seriously scary, do not see it if you are easily scared. The audience all breathed a sigh of relief when the credits rolled at the end, it is that gripping. I found the storyline somewhat ambigious, the scenes are sometimes very David Lynch style, but the ending is left to your own interpretation. Read the user comments here for possible answers to your questions. The filming is excellent, close ups and meeky colours add to the atmosphere. I was reminded of the final scene in 'The Blair Witch Project,' some of the scenes stay in your head for days, with the words, 'She never sleeps ...' I also found the ending unexpected, I thought it was over, and it continued again! Overall, excellent for a scare, if you don't scare at this then I'm not sure you will ever, (do you understand?) and this one will leave you at first frightened, but later you will want to find out the answers to your questions.8/10.

675,crow_jane,The sophisticated cousin of a large family,7,30 January 2005,"First, I saw The Ring. I stayed at my friends house, drinking coffee in her kitchen and talking about the movie, until 2am. I went home and slept with the light on. My curiosity, however, was piqued. My friend and I then rented Ring and Ring 2 to see how the Japanese versions stacked up. We watched them in her lounge room, alone, with the lights turned off, yet neither movie elicited in either of us the same response as the American version. To my, perhaps overly westernised view, each contained only one truly scary scene, in the first, the 'Sadako leaves the TV' scene, and in the second a scene where Anna appears as an oblivious ghost, but then turns around and looks at the main character.I then read all the information I could find on the net, and then one day in Borders I saw the book had finally been translated and published here. It was a great read, very different from the movies, and, apart from being incredibly sexist (all the women in it are either evil or insipid, the Rachel Character is, of course, a man) one of the best contemporary stories I have ever read.However, it opened my eyes to a plot hole I had ignored in the movies, which is; if Sadako/Samara wants everyone to know her pain and spread it like a sickness, why would she not SAY SO? In the book, the video is like a chain letter, featuring a ""If you do not pass this on within 7 days, you will die"" type warning, however, that part has been taped over by the teenagers as a prank. Apart from that, and the odd inclusion of horses, and the fact that the DVD has a trailer of Catch Me If You Can as a Special Feature, it is a very scary, well done movie with brilliant sound and lighting, and a breath-takingly chilling performance by Daveigh Chase. Some of the story changes, such as Samara's mother being the one who put her in the well, and of Samara being killed when she was still a child, were good choices for this film. Someone said here that the end is a disappointing sequel chaser, which is missing the whole point of any of the movies, and certainly of the original story- which was that ""it won't stop"". It will spread throughout the world like a virus, replicating a re-replicating itself until everyone has experienced the horror of Sadako.",The Ring

678,lvakq,A masterful command of film directing turns a silly premise into a incredibly effective horror,8,29 November 2019,"To get it out of the way: a killer videotape is objectively, a little ridiculous, and on the surface not a very frightening idea at all. For skeptics, especially horror skeptics, it would be tempting to write the film off for this reason alone. I would seriously urge you not to.What makes this film so effective is that it utilises atmosphere to entertain fear. The audience is not subject to regular, predictable jump scares. There isn't a character dying every 15 minutes. Yet you are kept in a permanent, undulating state of tension throughout because of how cleverly the film has set everything up.It achieves this in a variety of ways: the ever-present blue filter, the near-absence of music, the intertitle cards for each day of the week, progressively pulling us closer and closer to... we don't even know for sure. And last, the opening -- this is something a lot of horror films try to do, but in the majority of cases fail to execute as well: open the film with an incredibly suspenseful and ultimately terrifying 10 minutes, as way of locking the audience into a state of fear -- a state where the movie has showed them what it can do, and what do expect. A brilliant and sparingly used jump-scare is also delivered at the start, but rather than being predictable, it comes out of nowhere.What effect does this have? For the rest of the film, you are afraid of what'll happen next. The film barely needs to do anything at all, it only needs to suggest 'enough' -- you, the audience member, will create the fear for yourself. For instance, by virtue of the original jump scare coming out of nowhere, the audience is on constant alert for one even when the film doesn't look like it is leading there.In other words, this film very successfully adopts the 'less is more'. We get scared in the dark not because the dark is actively scaring us, but because our brains are projecting frightening thoughts onto it -- The Ring operates in the same way.---------------A point of contention: this vs the original. It seems that people generally prefer the version they see first. I personally think this is a rare case of the remake surpassing the original. The remake is more polished and controlled. Some will say this absence of grittiness lessens the scare, I disagree. To me the difference here is like one between a student film and a professional remake of the same thing. Mostly comes down to taste though, and which you saw first.",The Ring
679,Nallohki,Scariest movie I have ever seen,10,19 October 2002,"If you're looking for a gore-fest, you haven't found it.  If you're looking for a really, really deep psychological horror movie, then you've come to the right place.This movie is scary, will make you jump more than once, and keeps you in suspense almost all the way through.A lot of people I went with complained that there were many loose ends and unexplained elements at the end.  To these criticisms I say only this: use your head.  The movie gives you a multitude of clues, but it does not lead you by the hand.  As is typical of Japanese Ghost Stories (of which this movie is one - look for the original), not everything is explained, but many of the little things can be explained if you think them through enough.I would like to say for the record that I have never found a movie scary before in my life.  This movie is the first.",The Ring
680,Super_C,Can't... Sleep...,10,24 October 2002,"This movie was like nothing I have ever seen.  I am rarely scared by movies and when I am, it's usually a minor, fleeting sort of fear.  ""Signs"" did it a little, and maybe ""What Lies Beneath"" a bit - but I have never been scared by a movie like I was by this.  It's been a week since I've seen it and I'm still having problems getting to sleep.  And, if I wake up in the middle of the night, I just lay in fear until morning, occasionally (and reluctantly) glancing at the TV in my bedroom.  When they play the commercials on TV, I get the chills.  I can't decide if I love this movie, or dread it.  Both, I think.",The Ring
681,ManOWar-3,discombobulating,5,1 April 2003,"Maybe it was the fact that I waited to watch this on video, but this movie didn't impact as much as I thought it would.  Normally, I like a story that doesn't explain everything, and leaves the viewer to wonder about plot lines and conventions.  ""The Ring"", however, even after my second home viewing, seems to be reaching and grasping for its ""plot twist"".  It is never really clarified for me why a video tape is the tool used to scare the death out of those who view it (although it makes an interesting premise for a way to spread the young girl's pain and suffering that she wanted to share with the world).  The flashbacks to the tape images as Naomi Watts' character found them in her search were not as distracting as I first thought, but overall lacked clarity when things come full-circle (disturbing as they were).5 out of 10",The Ring
682,ahab1013,Disappointment Rings Loudly,5,9 November 2002,"I've given up on seeing widely distributed Horror genre films in the first few weekends because frankly the theaters are crammed with the types of people that ruin the movie going experience (talkers, cell phone ringers, teenagers). So I gave it a few weeks to catch ""The Ring"". Unfortunately my trip was ill timed to correspond with the release of ""8 Mile"" which, with its numerous sellouts, forced the same type of people into a second choice, my first choice ""The Ring"". I enjoyed Verbinski's ""The Mexican"", though I seemed to be in the minority of people who liked it, and now I'm apparently in the minority of people who didn't like this film. I probably suffered from the over hype that many of my friends have given this movie, and went in expecting something creepy, a cross between Sixth Sense and Seven and all the other disturbing movies that stick with you long after the credits roll. However ""The Ring"" is neither of those films, nor is it on the level of ""Urban Legend"" or other schlock spook fests. Instead it falls somewhere in between- an art film trying to make it mainstream. Too bad it failed for me miserably. Emily Watts was very wonderful playing the reporter trying to unravel the puzzle of the videotape of death (which I always thought was ""Showgirls""). But beyond her performance there was little else for the film to hang its hat on besides some forced eerie footage on the evil tape, and some moody cinematography (which is the only real reason to see the film) with a nice homage to Hitchcock tucked neatly inside. I found the story rather weak, though it didn't completely leave me disinterested (again mainly due to Watts being very alluring). I don't mind a slow paced film either; in fact I rather enjoy it when it adds to the story. However, I thought the pacing was all over the place here. We have a story that should take place over 7 days (or at least the part post-teaser...it did in some respects feel like episodic television after all), yet it's not pace evenly. Either building slowly, with the later days stretching longer, or moving faster to place emphasis on the running out of time would, I think, help.With all this said, I'd still recommend the film for Watts and for the lushness of the cinematography. Beyond that, if you want to see a well crafted narrative that builds suspense without tricks, check out ""Insomnia"" instead.",The Ring

And I do mean creepy. But that's a long wait for the few minutes you get out of it. Lots of plot holes you can fly a Boeing through, lots of things set up and then never resolved or even slightly explained, heavy on unexplained symbolism...The list goes on and on. In the end, I was bored and confused, and one creepy scene just isn't enough to justify the string of clichés and 'atmosphere' you have to sit through.

I just did not really care.  They should have kept me guessing more.  Was it the mom? Was it the little girl? Is something else going on?The little twist at the end was great.  The ""video"" was very cool.  The special effects and how they showed the two dead people were very good too.I am fine with not knowing exactly what was going on.

""What the hell?""The movie opens with a couple of girls talking about a seemingly urban legend about a video tape than when watched, causes the death of the viewer in seven days.  Of course the two girls build on skepticism shared by the audience until one of the girls dies--apparently she saw the video seven days ago.From that point, you are taken on a journey of disturbing images, unanswered questions, and unlikely revelations.The protagonist played by the beautiful Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr.), a journalist who was related to the girl who got killed in the beginning of the movie stumbles across evidence about the videotape.  Unfortunately she ends up finding the video and watching it (Dumb idiot).  Ultimately believing that she has 7 days to live, she goes to great lengths to solve the mystery, and we are right behind her.This movie puts evidence and disturbing images in front of you and lets you analyze what they mean and how it pertains to the whole mystery.

686,nickpalmer57,Obnoxious and cliche,7,23 October 2002,"Contains Spoiler Yeah, so it was startling at a couple parts, and the director knows how to make you jump by cutting quickly to a LOUD SOUND. Real gift you got there, Gore. However, the main characters are SO selfish and obnoxious, and the supporting cast SO clearly cardboard copies of 1,000 better characters in scarier films, that this film ultimately is just frustrating and kind of lame. At best it's a decent mystery, but c'mon, is this REALLY as scary as people are saying, or did the quick cutting just make you jump a bunch? After all, STARTLING is not SCARY (though just about all of the horror directors out there seem to have a really hard time understanding this). My main beefs with this silly movie were 1) Why, if this broad cares so much about her little Haley Joel does she ignore him the entire flick, and leave him at home with the babysitter for 90% of the film? The writer thinks so low of the audience that this chick can treat her child like crap the whole time, but if she keeps saying ""I'm doing this for Haley Joel #2"" then we're all supposed to go ""Holy crap! Guess she does love that little brat."" I had a lot more points to make, but I'm only writing this to keep from an essay I've been putting off, so I'm just going to make one more point - Who the hell kills themselves by gathering all the appliances in the house, creating some weird crown out of hot dog tongs, then hoping in a half filled tub and switching the surge protector around your neck to ""on."" Naomi Watts shoulda yelled ""Uh...hey Mr. Old Man...you can do the trick with just a toaster in the bathtub."" But I guess that wouldn't be so CHILLING and DISTURBING. Ohhhhhhhhhhh. I'm shuddering just thinking about her looking through old newspaper articles and saying ""What did you do to yourself, Ruth?"" just like EVERY character in these hackneyed plots has to say when their in the basement looking though old newspaper articles. This had such potential, and is just kinda gay at best. Try a little harder! C'mon, it's not THAT hard to be scary. Although, I beleive I'm in the minority, since everyone's running around saying this gave them nightmares. I'm jealous. I wish I was scared this easily. I'd go to thrillers a lot more often.

Night Shyamalan re-ignited the sense that scary doesn't always have to be someone after you, but the unknown. The mystery.A mystery is a good description for ""The Ring"". The scary story comes out of the belief that if you watch a certain video tape, you will die in seven days. Why? That is what the story is all about. That alone is kind of freaky. Just to think that by watching a video you will die kind of gives one the ""eebie jeebies"".""The Ring"" doesn't waste time on gore. There are only a couple of moments that there are glimpses of disturbing images. They are on the screen so briefly that it almost acts as a camera giving you a mental picture of what the people looked like after they died.

This movie is utter garbage, an insult to anyone with a three-digit IQ and a disgrace to the cinema everywhere. When you think of the miles of pristine 35mm film that were sacrificed so this movie could earn a studio millions of dollars, one is reduced to tears.
The recipe contains two parts lowbrow kitsch to one part silly horror. Combine with unaccomplished actors and morality preaching and we have `The Ring,' an innundation of poorly shot images and masturbatory use of wide-angle lenses strung together to form a barely cohesive story. The nauseating use of twisting plots and poor characterization is almost as infuriating as the distinctly plagiarized shots. The absurd plot makes suspending belief for `Star Trek' look easy.We are bounced like a ping-pong ball in our sympathetic expectations as audience members until we drop on the ground suffering from a bad case of futility. If I wanted such an experience I would open up to random pages of a Charles Dickens novel reading off random words from the page, pretending to be able to formulate something of value.If you are not a pre-pubescent moron or a comatose half-wit, then do yourself a favour and see something else.

I'd watched the Japanese original (well, not exactly the ""original"" but the 1998 version of a film now seeing its fourth remake) twice this past week and what makes Ringu (and now, absolutely, The Ring in its US manifestation) is the way in which it renders ordinary objects in mundane life- especially the telephone and the television of course- malevolent and, frankly, terrifying. I myself have always found a television in an empty room -- a television turned off especially -- to be frightening, something with a potential life of its own, and The Ring speaks to that primordial fear and exploits it.

Harsh reviews make this out to seem like a movie the likes of Blood Lake, The Sandman, or Jack-O (sad to say I've seen). It's NOT at all that bad, in fact, I rather enjoyed it. Let's go over a few things, shall we? Be prepared for lite spoilers.Okay, it's true, this has more shock value and less suspense than the original, yes, it's an American remake, but that doesn't make it absolute and total crap (one person suggested waiting till it went to the dollar movies... what the hell were they watching?). There is still a good deal of suspense. The shocks even, I venture to say, add some scare value during the movie that the original lacked, yet it still builds suspense (though not as much as the original, as said).Fine performances are put on by all, and the little boy didn't annoy me as much as I thought he would have. However, the character of Noah (played by someone I don't remember) was a weak link in the chain. He had no specific personality, in fact, he was rather dull, and wished for Takayama Ryuji to suddenly appear and help Rachel. Rachel, Naomi Watts, it shows that the chick in the movie CAN do something other than look up a few things (okay, okay, Reiko went in the well in the end, but she did little else). She I prefered to the original Asakawa Reiko. If only Noah were more like Ryuji... Our two children are interesting and creepy. But why did they cut Samara's greatest line (""Everyone will suffer."")? Sigh.Contrary to popular belief, not EVERYTHING is explained from the video (fingers in box, maggots) and not all is explained regarding the little girl (Why DID the horses die? WAS it her?) among other things (why were they at the mountain place with the horses, and when? We KNOW Ikuma took Sadako there after the suicide. Wait... something explained in RING but not in THE RING. AGH!).The ending... okay, the very end was SO much better in the original. However, the tv ending... well, certain things are creepier in the remake. And also, the deaths are much more interesting (and easier to explain, it's not a virus here... ugh, the virus idea... a point where THE RING is better).Overall, see this movie, it's really damn good.

The thrilling faction was thought marvelously and filmed great. Each thrilling scene hits you like a punch in the face. I really do not like '16' label on the boxes but I really think this movie shall not be seen below 16 , alone at a dark night or if you have any heart problems . The mystery facts are shot well and makes you forget the time while you are watching the movie. The cast is not consist of well known actors/actresses but the performance was great. This movie is a must to see for thriller/mystery fans and is really a must for archives. I enjoyed watching it and still in shock because I didn't think it would pass average and also I don't think that I will be watching it alone at home although it will be 2nd time.  10/10",The Ring

It never lives up, and I usually have sympathy for a movie in this situation.But The Ring was a freaking trainwreck of a production, and I can't believe anyone liked it.  There were two good parts in the movie, and they were both beacuse of well done, creepy images.  The first was near the beginning when they found the older girl in the closet, and you see her face for about a quarter of a second.  That was creepy.  The second and final good part was when the girl was walking out of the TV.  Bravo for that scene.The rest of the movie was nothing more than terrible.  The acting...Oh my dear lord I can't even decide where to begin.  It was despicable.  And I am usually very forgiving of acting in either an action or a horror flick, because they usually have redeeming qualities.  But there was no excuse for acting THIS unimpressive.  I am talking here mainly about the two main characters.  They simply sucked.  I can't describe it any differently.Also, the script/writing.  What the #*&%^@(*&#%^()@# were these people thinking?  What unengaging, uninteresting dialogue!  Screw the writing of this bad, bad movie.I have seen worse movies, but I'm very vocal abou this one because it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen that was considered excellent by most people.  Maybe I'm just completely stupid.2.5/10  You're better off watching Eight Legged Freaks so you can at least get some laughs.  At least that movie didn't take itself SO seriously, like The Ring.Bah.

It was, as others have stated, well crafted - the direction, the premise, the imagery - all good.But I cannot tap into a movie very easily if it has either bad acting or bad dialogue, and this movie failed at both of those. I simply did not sympathise with the characters, and never did get the creepy/cool/scary/funny feeling I get from truly great thriller/horror flicks like The Exorcist, The Shining, Poltergeist and Psycho.It's funny, the supporting actors were not too bad, but I thought the two main roles were terrible. They needed either Jennifer Connely and Jared Leto, Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp, or hell even Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon to do this movie.And it needed better dialogue.3/10 - wait for it, someday we will be granted a truly wonderful horror flick to put in our proud collection of horror DvDs, and finally be able to say that yes, our generation can produce good horror.A better remake in the meantime is the remake of Psycho. Vince Vaughn gives a great performance and it is most definitely worth your time.",The Ring

I wasn't scared ONCE throughout the movie's entirety.  I didn't find the plot to be intriguing, and I felt it left a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Certain potentially scary elements were thrown at the audience and never returned to.  The Sixth Sense was far scarier.  I don't know though, because everyone in the theater and everyone else who saw it aside from my friend and I thought it was extremely scary.

Even sorrier that the mass public is eating it up. I have had a hard time finding a good movie lately, and now I know why. If we applaud such ill thought out plotlines, that is what we will get. Why take the time to design a truely believable plotline, when you can churn them out faster if the plotline is not to be worried with?When have we last had a movie of the calibre of Shawshank Redemption, Sling Blade, Forest Gump, Babe, Pulp Fiction, or Blair Witch?

To be honest, I was expecting a teenage, slasher flick, I was proved wrong.The film circles around a cursed videotape that causes it's viewers to die in seven days. Investigative journalist, Rachel Keller, begins to uncover the secrets of the videotape, and must race against the clock to save herself.The movie was very unsettling and disturbing, which worked more effectively than some teens getting slashed with axes. The videotape was nightmarish and disturbing, and the images will stay with you long after the movie. The setting was gloomy and atmospheric, which enhanced the mood. Naomi Watts portrayed Rachel perfectly, her emotions are believable and haunting.

Ringu just has a scarier aura whereas this is just like any old american horror film... ie: not very scary at all. My advice is see ringu. It is much better in every way and especially ""the scene"" (as I have heard it referred to. You'll know what I mean when you see it (well if you see ringu because the ring's version of it is lame in comparison)). If this was original it would be OK but it's not so just watch the original.

This film is based on the Japanese novel and movie, Ringu. I own both the Ring, and Ringu, and The Ring adds much to the original. After so many disappointing horror films it is good to come across such a fresh approach to what frightens us. The story of a vengeful ghost looking for retribution is just the cover  for the true horror of this film. A couple who refuse to accept nature's, or God's, will that they simply weren't meant to have a child somehow manage a pregnancy. Their offspring, a little girl named Samara, is far more than she appears. An undefined dark force channels itself through her, and infects people and animals with horrible mental images. One has the since that this force is evil itself and, in a truly Lovecraftian sense, if one were to see this evil fully it would be more than the mind could handle, which suggests how this entity kills people through Samara. The movie is eloquently and beautifully directed with gorgeous cinematography and an eerie music score by Hans Zimmer. This next comment is a spoiler, so stop reading here if you have not seen the film.   The most terrifying thing about the film is the knowledge that this darkest evil will not stop, but will infect the world.",The Ring

Also because of Naomi Watts whose performance in 'Mulholland Drive' was awesome (here she was nothing special). The script and the reviews suggested that it was a great freaky horror but to me it was simply boring. There wasn't a single scene that frightened me. The storyline was flat, there wasn't anything at all to make you think of or remember this movie, there was no message, no point. The characters were boring as well with an average acting, they didn't make you worry/care about them if they die. I blame the director for that. The only good things were some nice shots and and the sounds. The fake ending was so stupid, it's only purpose being to leave the story open for a 2nd part, which I won't see for sure. 3/10",The Ring

The part where the girl comes through the TV at the end had me almost on the floor. I don't understand how people are scared by this.

The imagery just gets in your brain and you can't stop thinking about it. The tape itself is creepy and the reactions from all the characters are very close to real reactions (if it was real).

725,lisa-432,FINALLY!! Brilliant and dark!!,10,21 January 2005,"Just when I thought that the talent for ""seeing"" horror had died with Stanley Kubrick along comes Gore Verbinski and brings it back to refreshing life! At first I was skeptical about the teen element being involved (usually a cymbal crashing cue for long holds on tight shirts, tons of unnecessary screaming--not to mention screaming while ""running"" in high heels, and the most unabashed use of one-liners dredged up from every horror flick since the 70's), but thankfully that wasn't the case at all. The Ring was a truly edgy experience! The sound effects alone had me twitching, and I LOVED the puzzle of the video, its solution, and of course Samara's special effects most of all. The cinematography also gets an A+, beautiful work!As far as the acting, Brian Cox was OUTSTANDING (as usual); Naomi Watts was really believable (especially as an angry/frazzled single mom); Martin Henderson was INCREDIBLY hot.Now I realize that the only reason this film exists at all is because of the Japanese original (and of course the book) but what I don't understand is how anybody even thought that the original was ""scary/terrifying/astonishing/blah blahblah"". There weren't any special effects except for those annoying close ups and the screen changing colors (which is sooooo late 60's Hammer I can't even begin to go there). Sudako's ""death face"" had me on the floor laughing every time. If I'm watching a horror movie that is supposed to be legendary for scares, then I want to be scared; If I want to be stupidly amused I'll watch Freddy, Jason and Michael. I LOVE films that have plots that make you think and Japan has a ton of them, especially in horror, they're just not directed in a way that I find terrifying.

There are almost no cliché moments (except for the ""don't answer the phone"" type of thing), and Samara is truly scary. Even though there is minimal gore, this film needs no blood to deliver chills and keep you up at night. The special effects, especially towards the end of the film when Noah is killed, are beautiful, and all the loose ends are tied up, so if something seems like a plot hole, it's guaranteed to make sense by the end. If you like mystery and horror, this combines the best of both worlds. Also, at the beginning of each day of the curse, an on-screen caption reminds you of the day count, increasing the suspense as Rachel races to understand the meaning of the tape before her time runs out. The only complaint I have is that the teenage girls in the beginning aren't the best actresses, but that doesn't even bring down the rating! After this movie, you'll be expecting your own phone to ring with a call saying that your days are (literally) numbered, good if you're looking for a mystery, a scare, or a bit of both.",The Ring
727,WhiteManFromTown86,Damn fine horror film...,8,23 March 2006,"First off I was skeptical because it was PG-13...because there is so many bad ones out there. I was VERY surprised to say the least. This movie had the atmosphere that makes a horror film...this to me goes into that tiny group of great PG horror films such as Poltergeist. Also knowing it was written by Ehren Kruger before I watched it made me a little biased because I despise so many of his works. But he did something right in this movie. It's still full of his little trademarks such as offbeat side characters and weird little metaphors here and there...but it worked this time. Also I think the masterful directing by Gore Verbinski made it a little better than it actually was. But who cares? It was good as hell. The acting was great by one of my favs Naomi Watts...she had the charisma to make her one of my favorite horror film heroines. She just had that classy presence on the screen and it worked wonders for the film. She shined is all I can say. The side characters all do very well...I won't get to into them...they were just pretty good. The antagonist of the film Samara was an interesting and awesome character...such rage and evil inside made her one of the most ruthless villains of all time. The directing was top notch by Verbinski...loved every thing he put into it. Tbe film just had the""look"" to it that made it classy, scary, and beautiful all at once. The color palette was depressing and soggy...one of my favorite types of settings. SPOILERS: Also to add to its success were many freaky and really interesting scenes such as the horse on the ferry, Rachel's dream of coughing up that thing Samara wore in the hospital, the fly, the awesome Day 1,2,3..... title cards that made us feel the impending doom, interesting camera angles, wonderful use of a red tree against a gray sky, and I could go on and on. It just reminded me of a painting several times throughout. Once again great directing by Gore...no one could of done it better then he did.The writing by Kruger here was surprisingly good despite his usual clichés...but like I stated the clichés work here for some odd reason. I know this wasn't his idea. I know of the original Japanese versions and I have seen them...I'm really just not interested in them as much. Anyway, I know what Kruger added to the original story to make it his own. The writing on the Rachel character was very sharp, funny, and well wrought. She had great lines that made her more than just a standard horror heroine...she had that curiosity and timing just right. Also the characters had a very sharp way of speaking to each other. As with Kruger's other films, the characters sound a little to ""smart ass"" to be quite true. But again it worked here...the mixing of the script with Gore was a perfect match made in Heaven.I'll end this review hoping others out there will enjoy it as well. I know many have. Don't be discouraged because of other films such as The Grudge and the god awful Ring Two...in which Kruger's real skin showed. It is definitely one of the best ""ghost"" stories in years. One thing I can praise Kruger for was the simple line in which Rachel tells her angered boss after he threatens to fire her. It's the perfect introduction into a horror story.HARVEY: You're fired. RACHEL: No I'm not. HARVEY: YES you are. RACHEL: No I'm not...I'm cooking to good a story....then all hell breaks loose.8 out of 10.",The Ring

It doesn't show you how people are physically damaged when killed, and so there are so very many ways your mind can perceive based on their corpses. I love this movie, and was straight up terrified. Of course, if your all into gore and don't have an imaginative mind, then this is not for you.The terror of not being able to see your enemy is played up in this, which I like. You never really see Samara, except in the hospital and at the end, but you see her effects, and such things are scary to me. And the sense of lack of time is something that also adds a suspenseful feeling. It's one of those things where you really are hoping and praying for the hero or heroine before time is up. And of course, kudos to the ending. I must say I was not expecting that. And the ending makes you think...or at least...it did until they made a sequel, which I have yet to see but am still disappointed. Of course, I won't give away the ending, but I will tell you that if your mind works like mine, you'll be thinking about the future of Rachel.On the downside, the beginning was fudged up.

I saw this movie when I was 12 and when I was still going to Eden Prairie so it has a lot of old memories attached to it.That's a little strange considering the film I'm reviewing is a terrifying shriek-fest that disturbed me for months. But this was my introduction to horror, so I suppose that's why I'm happy looking back on it.This film is not perfect. The acting is not of extremely high caliber (aside from Naomi as Racherl and Daveigh as Samara). Yet there is a magic beyond the film's outer layer that disturbs the senses. The noises of the tape are a good example of this, still frightening for me today.When I saw this film at my birthday party on Sept. 5th, 2005 it was the first time I had watched it in a very long time. I did not get extremely frightened by any of it except for the classic scene where Samara crawls out of the TV. But I'm sure you could predict that.However, I will never fully recover from this movie and I will never look at static the same way again. And I thank the makers of the movie for allowing me to do so. They turned a slightly cheesy Japanese movie into something oddly beautiful and disturbing at once.

It didn't draw you in, there were no surprises. I was amazed at how many people freaked when the girl came out of the TV, it wasn't scary at all. Its not even a new idea.. ever hear of Poltergeist? I wasn't scarred and I wasn't entertained. What makes a horror great? There are two ways to make a horror strong- either make it on something that could truly happen or something that is just full of suspense and tension. This movie had none of it- no reality, no suspense, no surprise. Just a video a women and her child, oh and of course the ""hero"" boyfriend.

I didn't think the original was 'the most scary movie you've ever seen' - like everybody said, but I really like the concept of the cursed videotape and thought the Japanese did make a great movie. This US-version is a very good remake and also takes some information from one of the sequels. And that was what I missed in the original first movie.
Though the story is just slightly different (e.g. the horses) it's the same idea. Some scenes in the beginning are literally copied from the Japanese and that is wise 'cause the scenes were good as they were. Later scenes obviously had to change because the tape was totally different from the Japanese tape (and not the same as someone here wrote).
They succeeded in creating the same uncomfortable atmosphere by such small things like a fly and a bloody nose. The tension is always under the surface and is not spoiled by loads of special effects. I thought - even though I knew the story - this one gave me more creeps than the original. The scene with the horse on the ferry had my heart pound like crazy! And a big thumbs up for the cast.

The effects do achieve a good deal of fright...for about the first forty minutes of the movie. After that it just felt like guys in business suits were waving their hands in front of my face going ""oooOOOOoooOOOOooooo"" while they took my six fifty and watched their sales skyrocket. Needless to say, the creepiness dwindled considerably fast.The ending of the movie will make you angry, because rather than tie everything together, they instead choose to just do a bunch of random crap. You'll understand what I mean if you see it.Long story short, this movie was just another crappily-written piece of junk with shinier effects than the ones you can rent for a dollar at your local video store.

All throughout the film there is an impending sense that we're obviously being led somewhere, hopefully to the mystery behind the tape on which the story revolves around.  Unfortunately, it seems the film makers have taken the easy route and left out any explanation whatsoever for anything that occurs in the film.  My guess is that we're being set up for ""The Ring 2."" All I know is throughout the climax of the movie all I could think was, ""Now, why am I supposed to be scared by this?""

But, there were to many scenes that didn't add up right - maybe that was my way of keeping from being scared out of my wits.I think it was mean to kill Noah off.  And give me a break on making a copy to save yourself.  If that was true why'd the girl in the psycho ward tell our herione she had four days left - she'd already made the copy.

The crack of the horses' leg against the ship rail, and it screaming as it was sucked under and into the propeller, is unfortunately the main image I've brought home from the film. I like horror movies and I don't scare easily, but however much I know it 'isn't real', I just don't enjoy seeing an animal getting hurt. I think the point would have come across just as well if the horse had leaped over the rail, and just disappeared into the sea.

It will be worthwhile and make good entertainment if you watch it late at night...most likely. With that said, I also believe this movie is not meant for everyone who watches it. Some people who I've discussed this movie with hated it, simply because it was too weird for them. The movie is extremely imaginative and fairly surreal, so if you go into the theater expecting the ending to have every single question answered and a solid ending, you'll probably not get what you want. You need to be more open minded than that, and be able to think of it more as an idea or a philosophy than a story. After all, the movie is supposed to be an Urban Legend.Personally, I saw this movie in theaters 2 years ago exactly (on Halloween Night), and had a great time! But for me personally, there was more to the movie than just chills and frights. Rather, for some who may pick up on the ideas the movie presents, it can be quite an experience to see it.I voted for this movie as a 10. Others of you may feel it is a 8, 7, or 6...some may be completely unable to grasp the movie's abstract concepts and would rate it a 2 or 1, calling it a waste of time. However, if you are able to approach this movie at a different angle and can accept it's world, you will be in store for a great adventure!If you liked the movies ""Unbreakable"" or ""Kill Bill (both volumes)"", and can enjoy horror movies, I think you will love this movie from start to finish.",The Ring

The script is a mess, but the visual style of gore verbinski has made me a believer of anything he directs. The horse/boat scene alone is worth ten pounds...some sequences freaked my knickers and I wondered how this got a 15 certificate over here. Overall, this is an outstanding visual feast.

I wouldn't recommend young children to see it for the simple fact that seeing Samara thrown down the well would probably scare them, not to mention the aforementioned television scene. It was also dark and dreary throughout the entire movie. That in itself prevented me from enjoying this movie to its full extent. Of course, Seattle is a dreary place. But, I would have enjoyed it more if It hadn't been so dark. It's a good movie in it's own right. Like I said before, it's a psychological horror movie, not a live horror movie until the end.

While entertaining with good photography and mood, there were enough holes n the plotting to make me very disappointed with ""The Ring.""

It wasn't necessary to the plot. That's not where the kid spent the rest of her days. That's not where she was murdered. She was probably only there for a short while before her mom took her out to the well and tried to murder her. 4) How come there was no exploration of where the kid was adopted? That may have helped to explain her origins. 5) What's that whole confusing thing at the end about people who make copies can't be killed but those who are give the copy can? What? That's all I can figure out about why at the end she's making another copy with her son and they seem to feel they're not going to be killed, but maybe someone else is. Huh? 6) Do you actually have to pick up the phone and listen to the voice telling you you're going to die in 7 days, or doesn't it matter if you hear the message or not? And how do they get the phone number to call in the first place? 7) Why would a potential victim cause a horse to go crazy?I love horror and sci-fi films, but if they set up a universe where supernatural events occur, they have to follow their own internal logic. It's got to be real for the world the characters live in. Otherwise, it's just a film director throwing things at us like a big cheater and there's no point in understanding anything that goes on.

I understand the movie makes great lengths to show that Americans live by their televisions, that's fine.  But here is one question, if your tv has just turned on twice without anyone turning it on (except for spoiler answer) and you are REALLY paranoid, why not go take a walk?  Leave the house.  Sit in a park, heck, sleep there.  OK, tv is the death of us all and society, the fact this movie made over 100 million in the box office alone really does prove that. BUT as a movie, horror fans (and I mean those born when HORROR movies were coming out, not most crap in the past 15 years) have seen this all before. The only addition is a good director.  The movie LOOKS good, it is shot wonderfully.  The problem is the movie itself.  The acting is not horrible, the script is, well, very long winded for a movie that had WAY too many fake jolts (you know, the ""insert violen shrill here when nothing happens"") and not any real moments of suspense. I will concede the movie is a good attempt of taping into eerie suspense (not really horror though) but only an attempt.  Recently, Signs is much better because it really puts a human - family - what would you do - aspect to it where in this film its more - stretch your brain - please? And for those who say this is the best scary film since the Exorcist, watch that movie again, it is a very dark comedy, not a horror film, and in my opinion, not a very effective dark comedy. Instead of this film, please watch the real classic ""horror"" films such as Carrie, The Last House on the Left, Zombie, Opera, Suspiria, Sleepaway Camp (yeah, you heard me), and many others. Again, not a terrible movie but for those who watch films of this nature who are over 20 years old (who saw the old movies before they were/are classics), this is a forgettable Sunday afternoon movie.",The Ring

It will go down as one of the most haunting and complex scores of his career. But besides the music and a few effective scenes the movie has nothing going for it.Naomi Watts, who can be a brilliant actress when in the hands of the right director(like David Lynch), is awful in this movie. She, along with most of the cast, consistently delivers her lines as if she were reading them off a teleprompter. Watts exhibits the same kind of artificiality that was necessary for her character in ""Mulholland Drive"", but here it is just embarrassing and it comes across as a terrible performance.Gore Verbinski, who shows potential as a filmmaker with a few well-directed scenes, based this film on the Japanese horror movie with the same title. The original movie, in and of itself, was a rip-off of the 1980 classic ""The Changeling"" with George C. Scott. It is incredibly vexatious when you sit there in the theatre waiting for the pay-off and it turns out to be the pay-off from another movie.Like I said before, most of the acting is atrocious, with the exception of Brian Cox's cameo. It is impossible for a bad movie to bring down this amazing actor. In fact, the two scenes involving Brian Cox are the most effective and frightening moments in the movie. Every other scene intended to be scary was laughable. The scares could be spotted a mile away.With ""The Ring"" Verbinski wanted to make a rich, psychologically disturbing horror film along the same lines as ""The Tenant"" and other great films that are better than this movie. Instead what we get is a film that wants to be something that it cannot be due to a flawed screenplay and bad performances. Not to mention that for anyone who has seen ""The Changeling"" this movie will be recycled material anyway.",The Ring

I now own the movie, once I was able to get past the parts that terrified me, I was able to observe the film for what it was and the elements used in the film that made the scary parts of the film truly scary.The outline of the story surrounds the ""urban legend"" if you will, of a tape that was made that if you watch it, exactly seven days later you die. Naomi Watts plays a news reporter looking into this story after a group of teens all die at the same night and time after visiting Shelter Mountain a week earlier. She does her investigating and uncovers more and more about ""The Tape"" and realizes that is more to it than she originally thought.A well paced movie, with great acting, good tension build-ups and good ""Jump"" moments. The music does a great bit of help in the film, without Hans Zimmer's quiet, creepy music, the film wouldn't have been anywhere near as dark without it. It helped carry the flow of the movie all the way to the climax where you might as well be chewing on the edge of the couch because of the thrill it gives with its twist ending.Great horror film with no gore or blood which is how horror films should be made, highly recommended.",The Ring

Some praise the film as being very intelligent and original, while others complain that the plot is too thin. It's simply amazing to me how differently people perceive the same thing. The Ring is very much original in comparison with other horror films. It is not original in the sense that it is a remake of Ringu, but so what? It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, which, to me, is a big part of what makes it creepy. Are you still as scared once you've learned all of the answers? I know I'm not. It leaves a lot to think about, to wonder about, to imagine, and whether you choose to ponder the unanswered questions or not, The Ring is scary. It is, by far, one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen.

And it's nothing to do with Christina Angulawhatever's new clip, altho I'm pretty sure you can see the ring in that... No, this is infact the heart warming tale of a video that kills you 7 days after you've watched it. I'm not sure if watching the same thing on DVD kills you, but I suppose it does. I guess it depends how close you sit to the screen, and how violent Blockbuster get when the copy of The Little Mermaid you rented is 7 days overdue. This is another horror movie involving creepy kiddies. It seems every flick that attempts to be scarey has to involve a creepy kid in someway. That doesn't make it bad tho, it is infact pretty good. The story is nice and original (it's a remake of a Japanese version which has spawned a sequel and prequel), and the cast, led by talented Aussie Naomi Watts, is great. But is it scarey? Well I was sitting in a puddle at the end, but that may have more to do with the size of the large Coke... After being told by people who had already seen this that I'd be having nightmares afterwards I packed a change of underwear and prepared for the worst, but it didn't come. Altho there are a few sudden frights (one made the girl behind me actually scream), and while you're watching it there is an undercurrent of ""What's going to happen next??"" kind of scarey-ness, after it had finished I looked back and thought ""Well that wasn't really all that scarey"". It didn't haunt me like The Sixth Sense or Bambi did. So I guess you have to decide for yourself whether its scarey enuff or not. That said, I'm never watching a video again. Infact I came straight home and took an axe to my VCR. Then I jumped on the pieces. Then I burned my shoes. But no, this isn't scarey. Either way this is a good flick and its fun to watch. Go see it.

It's sexy without resorting gratuitous sex.  While it's not completely free of hokeyness, ""The Ring"" is one of the most intelligent horror films ever made. The direction is inspired and the performances are remarkably subtle.  The use of special effects is restrained but the impact hits hard.   In the end, it remains enigmatic and mysterious because it doesn't go overboard with explanations. There's also a lot to think about as it resonates with a number of themes: the harmful effects of video culture (understating the obvious), the ethical responsibility of parents for their children, and the transmission of evil into the world.

757,frannygirl,This contains spoilers.,1,31 January 2003,"I absolutely hated this film. First off, the acting was atrocious. I have not seen such a miscast group in a very long time. The children were overly cute, the female lead spent more time worrying about her hair than studying the character, and I'm pretty sure the male lead was a model. They were stiff and wooden, and entirely unconvincing. Every emotion was overdone; I felt as if I were watching theatre (and not in the good way). And the lead female character was a total monster (which was a complete departure from the original). That actress butchered that part, being calm on second, hysterical the next, flirting with her ex-husband and showing no real personality under the surface of classic modern sarcastic bitchiness.The direction was brutal. A good director could have at least made some improvement in the acting, but sometimes I got the feeling that no one had even screened the film after it was made. In on scene, the mother enters her son's bedroom, looks at his bed, and the shot of what was supposed to be her line of vision was actually at ceiling height looking down. And oh my God the dialog. I wrote better dialog in stories when I was eight. Predictable, simple and completely lacking any flow. It was also overly flirty and sarcastic a la Dawson's Creek, that distracted the viewer from even the possibility of setting a suspenseful mood. Which then brings me to the unbelievably annoying subplot of the rekindled romance between the two leads. Totally unnecessary and so nauseatingly Hollywood. Once again we find a director who falls back on ridiculous notions of sexualization for the sole purpose of fattening up weak material, and subsequently failing miserably. Then we come to the plot problems. While the film overexplained a million tiny details, it ignored numerous necessary points, such as the chronology of the horse family's events, and the girl's psychic abilities. She obviously could control events/actions with her mind, yet there wasn't even an attempt to explain how. Also there was a complete lack of explanation of where the girl came from and/or why she was evil. Yet the film spoon fed certain details to the audience, to the point of choking. Us hearing the voice on the phone, the extended first death scene, the water oozing out of the television, what was up with that whole Before you die you see the ring nonsense? Which was, incidentally, totally inconsistent as the boyfriend was not drawing on magazine faces or scribbling circles before he died! And what was with that stupid female lead getting knocked into the well? Most rediculous scene ever! And then we come to the ending, which was so obviously complete left open for a sequel, and in doing so, dropped all moral implications of the tape. Instead of the ending in Ring (where the mother asks her father to watch the film and die, giving up his life to save that of his grandchild, and effectively ending the cycle), in the remake, they imply that all that matters is saving the son, regardless of who sees the film and if the cycle continues.

It would appear that her heart just stopped. But the girl's mother asks Rachel, who is a journalist, to try and figure out why she really died. What Rachel discovers is that her niece, along with the three other friends of hers, watched a video tape exactly seven days prior to when they all died simultaneously.The Ring has a rating of MA15+, and it earned it. This is a very scary film that will have you on tenterhooks the whole way through its many twists and turns, but is not exceptionally gory, nor are things jumping out at the central characters every few minutes. The film is scary because of the creepy way it goes about things, letting you only have another piece of the puzzle that Rachel is presented. But the frightening imagery that the film uses makes it creepier then the story would have been. The scenes that stay with you especially are Rachel's encounter with a horse, her final meeting with Richard Morgan, the owner of a horse ranch on Moesko Island, and the gripping finale.But, the powerful imagery doesn't only come in the forms of scares. Certain scenes, like one simple scene where Rachel stands on her apartment's balcony and looks out at other people's lives gives us a snapshot into other people's lives, just showing that everyone you see has a tale to tell, something different from the last, and that people always have secrets.This film for me doesn't come under the ""horror"" category, but rather the ""thriller"" category, even though it is a very frightening piece of cinema.

Now comes the Ring, a vast improvement over the original Japanese version, and a truly scary film.  I can find no real fault with any aspect of the movie, and it stuck with me for weeks afterwards.  Of particular excellence is the Ehren Kruger screenplay. The Ring also features the best aerial photography I've seen in any film, even ones outside the genre.  The Ring is a great film, and one that I think will be remembered.",The Ring

768,carly1964,WHAT THE HECK was this about?,3,11 June 2003,I really don't get what this movie was about? It started so quickly and I never understood what was going on. Why was there a tape?

769,mastermoviecritic,Horribly Overrated,1,30 November 2002,"This movie was terrible.  I can't believe the amount of hype that this movie received.  I went in expecting a movie that would be somewhat scary but all I got was a movie that was laughable at best.  Let's see, there were so many weak points, it's hard to know where to start.1. The lack of a coherent plot severely crippled this movie.  It took too long to figure out what was actually going on and the ending was a tad lame. The ending didn't really answer any questions and at best, added to the confusion.2. The lack of good acting skills also hurt this movie.  In my opinion, the best character by far was the little boy.  Everybody else was just gravy.3. The capabilities of Samara were not scary, but just so far out there that it didn't make any sense.  With the abilities that Samara was given, she should've been able to destroy everybody...weird...she didn't...4. This movie was just plain overrated.  If this is what is considered very scary, people need to watch the classics again.  To relate this movie to The Exorcist does not do The Exorcist justice.  That movie was truly scary. The Ring went for some cheap scares and it shows.In the end, this movie was pretty poor.  Too often, the standards of the general public falls when they view a string of weak movies.  This movie might be scary compared to what has been released lately, but it is nowhere near the quality of The Exorcist.",The Ring

773,Drknsinstr,Not scary...,8,24 February 2003,"With the upcoming DVD release of this oustanding movie I wanted to add my own review.  I admit having not seen the Japanese original leaves my opinion slightly jaded.  Pressing on though I didn't find this film scary at all... But it is by far one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.It seems there should be a different genre for these type of films, instead of horror perhaps it would be best to label them uber-thrillers.  The movie was very suspenseful and compelling to watch in a very morbid sense. Imagine all those people that slow down driving past car accidents to see the damage and carnage.  That kind of morbidity propels the viewer through the ring with a definite sense of ""on-the-edge-of-your-seat"" tension.When you couple that dreaded sensation with the excellent sound effects, music, eerie locations and grainy film, it makes the American version of this film one of the best modern ""horror"" movies hands down.   I have still be told REPEATEDLY to see the original Japanese film if I ever get the chance as it is supposed to be far superior in story and dread. Hopefully with the American remake coming to DVD next week they'll import the Japanese version so we can enjoy it as well.",The Ring

The whole film leaves you feeling cold throughout.  The evil that pours out from the little girl Samara is intense, possibly due to the neglect she had recieved from her parents.It's certainly a powerful and disturbing film, and kept me thinking about it all night, hence the lack of sleep.A good film, by no means fantastic, but worth seeing ... 7/10",The Ring

The whole thing is a mixture of impossible scenarios that totally lack any kind of credibility coupled with a loose story line that never begins to work.Take my advice, keep your hard earned in your pocket and keep it for something else..

778,emsleaves,horror not totally fun or great but compellingly disturbing,6,20 March 2003,"I just saw this film.  I was quite impressed until thinking about how some of the elements of the film didn't add up.  Why was Naomi Watts a bottle blond?  Why were the ""scary"" people dark-haired with everyone else in between?  It seemed contrived, with badly bleached and dyed hair.  That was really ugly, black hair I was seeing.  I have hair that color, and it's not that ugly.  That bothered me.  The worst thing that bothered me was the beginning of the movie.  The teenagers had banal dialogue.  It seemed like it would be one silly thrill after another.  The beginning of the movie seemed like it belonged on a home video.  It began in a rather awkward way. I'm used to being lured into a movie, just a little.The hair color was pretty annoying.  And the young boy under Naomi Watts charge most of the time was spooky.  The kid was innocent and good, yet scary?  I don't get it.  But I definitely did not want some sensitive Haley Joel Osmet.  So, overall, I didn't get what I wanted, no matter if the kid was different.Then there was the video.  Watts' character is disturbed, but not her video geek friend?  Not convincing that the video is horribly seductively scary. And the whole thing about the drawings.  Too Sixth Sense.  And the teacher's comment about the cousin being dead a week ago and not three days ago. What was the point of that?Here is what I did like.  I was quite disturbed the whole film.  I kept getting jerked around to believe different things, the way the characters would.  And my eyes were big as saucers by the end of the movie as if I had watched the disturbing video and was about to die myself.  I didn't scream once, but can say I had a deep soul horror, the kind that says, oh my, I hope not, really.  The black and white dull cinematography was great.  The unexplained yet, to me, logical parts of the plot I loved.  To me, when it worked, the unexplained was the wonderfully, deeply understood.I loved how the movie commented on how things spread in a community by the use of curiosity and mystery.  There was no cover or label for the bad video.I enjoyed the image of the tree.  I was not disturbed by the mirrors.  The well was very Old World looking, therefore quite cursed looking, as if Britain, land of the legend and the paranormal was about to invade the U.S.I found the movie flawed, yet compelling to watch.  It was not what you call seamless, but jerky for mystery, thrills, and some disturbing thoughts that are keeping the lights on tonight.My rating: 3/5 (for overall disturbing effect on me)SPOILER AHEAD:  DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEI hated the end.  We were supposed to draw conclusions from the dialogue between Watts' character and little scary boy?  I had no idea what they meant.  Did they go evil?  What would they do with the copy of the tape? What about the showing of the dark-haired girl going up the lift after Watts' character sees her friend is horrifically and unexpectedly dead? Did that mean knowledge?  Did blond mean no knowledge or innocence and dark hair mean knowledge?  That didn't even hold up the whole film.  And I didn't like the video girl stepping out of the screen.  Please kill me and get it over with, like the poor characters in the movie.  That is so contrived, so bottle-blond.  And how do I believe that the scary little boy would aid his mother in learning about the poor poor dead girl when he knew she was evil all along if he was actually good though weird?  Mind tricks?  Come on.",The Ring

781,Wolf120,The Best Movie of All Time *SPOILERS*,10,15 June 2004,"~MAJOR SPOILERS~ON MY OPINION OF THE MOVIE: There are no words to describe this movie. It is beautifully written, not very scary (which is good to me), yet will freak you out. The horror of 'what ifs' is what this movie is made of. YOu fear you will die the same way Katie or Noah did. You no longer look at wells, or like TV. This movie is bound to have psychological effects on you, which makes it entertaining. ON ACTING: The acting is truly the best. Everyone must have studied hard to get their character down. Daveigh Chase (Samara MOrgan) is so well transformed into a villain/pity, that you can't even tell who she is. Her voice, look, hair, is all different. Naomi Watts (Rachel Keller) hides her accent, and becomes a very motherly figure. The rest of the cast was awesome, but I have nothing to say about them. ON EFFECTS: Samara crawling out of the TV is so scary and well done, I had nightmares for 7 days..The horse scene is a bit sad and sick, but it was well done on special effects. The make-up is so amazing, I have no idea what to say. Let me just say that Katie's face was close to no special effects. I think that deserves a medal on its own. ON LOCATION: The movie seems a bit green, but it is fine to me because I love the color green. The places were all dark and gloomy adding to the fear. MY FAVORITE MOVIE!! 11 out of 10",The Ring

Of course, I did not believe it would be scary, but I was in for a real surprise when I actually saw it.This movie was one of the least scary movies I have ever seen.  First of all, it is a ridiculous premise for a movie, a killer videotape?In fact, the scariest thing about the movie is probably the colors.  It is so dark and dreary, everything seems to be a sort of metallic blue shade....not hugely appealing, although I suppose a good bit accurate for a film about the Pacific Northwest.If you are looking for a scary movie, this is not it.  It does not even have the sort of ""shocking/jump out of your seat"" moments that even bad horror movies have.

This story is based around a reporter who is attempting to figure out why a group of people died at exactly the same time. It just so happens that they had watched the tape with one an other.

Her Niece watches the video tape and she notices creepy pictures in her bedroom and decides to investigate. She has no idea what shes getting herself into. The video itself i found weird and much different to what i expected. This isn't your typical horror it has a lot of twists and keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat or hiding behind it whichever. The Ring2 i thought Samara was more creepy in the way she acts and moves, yet the storyline seems abit teedias. I had to watch it a 2nd time to understand little bits. The first is better, because its unusual and no-one has achieved a movie like this. Acting from all the cast is very good. Naomi Watts succeeds in playing the worried mother figure very well.

The Ring (and other modern ""horror"" movies) could take a bit of a lesson from that. Don't show everything. Let the mechanisms be implicit (not missing, but not explicit either).

Everything in the video tape for THE Ring was explained unlike the video tape in Ring. I believe one of the things the the filmmakers in the Japanese version set out to say is that the unknown or uncertainty is what scares us.

Why does that girl have the ability to project her evil onto videotape, specifically?  Why doesn't she just run a pirate video feed into, like, ESPN or A&E or something and be done with it?  Or better yet wait until Super Bowl Sunday?Where did Samara come from?  They ""went away"" and came back with her, telling everyone that she was adopted; Richard said that Anna wasn't ever meant to have a child and that Samara wasn't his child and yet we see the birth certificate in Richard's house, naming him as the father.Katie clearly took the death threat seriously, since she told Aidan about it, so what was with the joking and then ""sudden realization"" that it was all true the night she died?How did Samara manage to live in so many places for so long?  She lived in the barn, she lived in the hospital, she lived in the family's mainland home. . .  And why hasn't that tree gotten bigger in the last 14 years?Why did Aidan say all that about ""the horses keep her awake; she doesn't like living in the dark"" when he should have said, ""she's *evil*; don't help her""?  That is, of course, why Rachel couldn't drag Aidan around with her, not because she'd be exposing him to danger, but because the whole movie would have ended right then.Why bother setting up an ongoing theme of maternal love and rejection if the real message was ""she's evil and it's never going to stop""?I understand that this movie is the remake of a part of a trilogy, but they should have made this movie make sense within itself, rather than, apparently, just copying down the bits that were revealed in the corresponding movie in hopes that the American moviegoing public will foot the bill for two more.",The Ring

Forget about that ""don't go in that dark place/open the door to the creepy axe-murderer"" kind of thing. You won't get any of that here, I promise.Basically, this is a story ""à la Sherlock Holmes"": there's a murder (actually 4 murders). In comes Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the victims. On the day of her niece's funeral, she meets some of the teenager's friends that tell Rachel about this tape. Rachel's also a journalist and starts investigating the murders on her own. The clues will soon bring her to the possession of the accursed tape. She watches it. Then, everything gets really creepy.The photography is superb! The movie has a greyish hue all over it, making the story even more brooding and menacing. The setting is Seattle, a city already plagued by near constant cloudy and rainy weather. You get the feeling that Verbinsky's been watching a lot of Ingmar Bergman and Kubrik as inspiration. The shots, during the wake, with Aidan framed by the corridors and staircase reminded me o ""The Shinning""; also, the way time goes by is very much ""shinningish"".The plot takes us through the investigation, as we watch Rachel Keller putting together the pieces around this puzzling death. At the same time, she has to come to grips with her child - Aidan, who never calls her ""mum"" - and her estranged ex-boyfriend, Noah.When finally Rachel puts the puzzle together, it still doesn't make sense. We can't understand how did that tape got recorded in the first place. This was the reason some people criticized the film, but it goes to show that sometimes you don't need to show everything. Suffice to say that the murderer is not human.Kudos to the director and the crew, and also for superb performances all around.

797,Sinestroplex,Waste of Time,3,15 April 2006,"This Review May Contain Small Spoilers (they may actually save you the time you waste if you do see the movie anyway because at least then you may get a laugh in). When I first saw previews for The Ring I was rather intrigued. I read a summary on line and the idea of a people dying from watching a videotape was new to me so I decided to check it out. However, when I saw this movie in the theaters i was bored, unimpressed, and even a little let down. The actors couldn't act and the only thing that made them stand out from the actual set was the fact they were either dying or screaming. A lot of the movie was taken up with flashbacks that eventually lead to us realizing how the tape was created and why people die when they watch it. The style of going backwards in a movie to piece together a story that sucks never succeeds and is just wasting your time. The Ring is supposed to be a horror movie but there is little to be horrified with. Every now and then there will be one of those some dead girl screaming somewhere in a tight space like a closet or a well which only helps you stay awake for more stupidity. The special effects were lame and the behind the scenes crew were lazy. More than once I saw things left in the background including even an actual worker for the crew. Overall this was a lousy movie and a waste of time. Do not see this movie unless you like to be bored or you like to be disappointed.

798,IsaiMegan,A refreshing piece for American audiences,8,21 September 2009,"The Ring started what became a wave of horror remakes from Japanese cinema, and while other tales such as The Grudge were not as critically well received, The Ring truly earned its merit among audiences. The movie starts out with Seatle reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) aiding her sister after the mysterious death of her niece-- a death that was provoked by watching a mysterious videotape and not following the rules in order to save one's life. After seeing the tape herself, Rachel is horrified to learn that those who see it have seven days until they die, unless they somehow manage to avoid death, by performing the task that the spirit haunting the tape wishes the viewer to do; if you're not familiar with the full plot by now, keep yourself unspoiled and discover it for yourself! As the film progresses Rachel seeks the help an exboyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) in order to discover the origins of the mysterious tape before it is too late. What Rachel discovers is a dark, hidden story from one of the Pacific Northwest's many small island communities, where a small girl arrived with her adoptive parents, only to cause grief that they could have never imagined. Has she young girl returned to seek her revenge? The visual style of The Ring is arguably its greatest asset. Imagery is both creepy and alluring, with the film's dark color palette adding to the cold, wet climate of The Pacific Northwest. While certain aspects of the film are a bit far fetched or not fully developed, The Ring stands out as one of the better psychological horror films in recent memory, aided by a unique story, strong performances and haunting visuals.

After the first 10 minutes I thought i was sitting and watching another crappy teen horror movie, but i was very wrong. This movie was perhaps one of the most well done suspenseful movies in recent memory. I never get scared during crappy horror movies, but this one had me on the edge of my seat. There was some disturbing imagery, and had scenes that were stuck in my head for days to follow. It rivals ""Signs"" as one of great suspense movies as of late, and i think even surpasses ""Signs"" in that regard. The tension is great, added even more so by a countdown of sorts. It is a phenomenal, tension filled movie that will scare the bejesus out of more people watching it. Very well done movie.",The Ring

807,horrorwriter-23046,My Favorite Horror Remake!,10,8 June 2021,"The original ""Ringu"" from 1998 is a horror classic that shall never be forgotten. The movie is beyond terrifying and it has a fantastic atmosphere that builds up to the horrific ending, that I won't spoil. But the remake by Gore Verbinski is, in my opinion, the greatest horror remake in cinema history and that's a very high bar when it comes to these kinds of films. Most remakes are filled with godawful characters and even worse writing for the most part. But ""The Ring"" managed to stay true to the original classic as well as throwing in its own Western spin on the story. Verbinski does an excellent job with building atmosphere much like ""Ringu"" did all the way up to the epic and famous finale. I give it a solid 10/10!P. S. I do not recommend the two sequels, as they are GARBAGE. But if you want to laugh at something hilariously bad, go ahead and check out ""The Ring Two!""",The Ring

Still, the Ring is easily one of the top 10 horror movies of all time.People expecting the second coming of the Exorcist may have been aiming too high, however The Ring is easily the scariest, most well put together horror movies since the original Halloween back in 1980.The terror starts from the first scene, and the film never relents during the race to discover the secret behind the haunting deaths of those who watched a mysterious tape.I would advise against trying to rationalize the movie. ""Where did the tape come from?"" and similar questions that can't be answered and really don't need to be addressed.

I have rated this movie a ten because it is very scary and has a great plot. Also its not all gore and you have to think about it and there are many interpretations on what different things in the movie might mean. It had the perfect mix of scary moments and plot twists.

This girl is mentally disturbed and was wierdo-freak parents! ahh! She has long hair over her face and looks like a freak! ahh! I would have gotten more enjoyment out of banging my head on a wall for the 2 hours this movie dragged on. The coolest part was when the horse want nuts and got all chopped up. That was hilarious.

After watching it, stunned by what they saw, they received a phone call saying they will die in exactly seven days. Believing the tape was some sort of twisted joke, they shrugged of the feeling and lived life as usual. But a week passed since they watched the video and all four ended up with the same fate: dead. Katie's mother, confused and shaken by the loss of her daughter, asked Rachel, her sister, to find out what really happen to their troubled girl.Now determined to solve the mystery of Katie's death, Rachel finds herself and her son, Hayden with the same fate as her niece. Can she save her life and Aidan's as well? Directed by Gore Verbinski, The Ring gives a fairly decent work of art. I applaud Gore for directing the effect of viewers sensing that they're not alone anymore from start to finish. However, I find the tape (The Death Tape, as I nicknamed it.) disturbing. It was some of the images of the finger and the suicidal horse that made me feel unusual, almost at the point of being uncomfortable.The cast was also very well picked. Naomi Watts, who played Rachel, gives a performance that will surely give her more success in her career. But what was more surprising was the work of little David Dorfman who played Aidan. He gave some excellent acting skills in The Ring. The girl who haunts the tape (Daveigh Chase who acts as Samara) gave a frightening job as well.The Ring was, I thought, more of a thrill then a horror movie, but it does frighten well. But I heed a warning to those who want to rent 'The Ring'. If you're easily disgusted, then I suggest you pick another movie to watch. To those who ignored my warning, however, will surely be pleased that they did, because it really is a one of a kind movie. I give 'The Ring' a two thumbs up well done.",The Ring

I am a huge horror/suspense fan and am not rattled by much.  As the movie opened, the whole time limit on when one was going to die reminded me of Feardotcom, which I thought was incredibly stupid.  So I thought that it would be sort of like that, and it was.  Hear about a movie that kills people, try to make it so that it doesn't.  I was not prepared for what was on the movie, nor the journey that the main character would have to take to make it right.  The main character was very strong, and, being a female in a horror flick, did do some of the typical female things (i.e., watching the movie).  But I was pretty amazed by this movie.  I definitely wasn't prepared for the ending.  By the end of it, my heart was racing and I was scared to go home alone.  And the subliminal images (yes, there were subliminals) were a good touch.  I saw one of them, and none of the three people I was with did.  I felt that the movie did a great job with the story.  Even though there were holes, it didn't hurt it.  I left trying to figure a few things out.  It really made me wonder, and I like that about a scary movie.  I haven't had real nightmares from a movie since Candyman came out (I was 12).

I don't remember the last time I left a movie complex so pleased.  The only complaint I have heard about this movie, is the fact that is a remake. To that, I say who gives a damn.  This movie is saving the horror genre and if more directors and people in Hollywood followed this film as a model, we would have much more to look forward too.  This was a movie that tied up all ends of the story perfectly without leaving you wondering how is that possible and what happened to that person, etc.  The ending, is just so amazing and well done, you really need to see it instead of me trying to explain it here (one of the scariest parts of the movie too).  With all those dumb cheap teen horror flicks out there, its good to see there are some people who can still make great movies that will make you THINK and who don't have to lower themselves to cheap thrills with lots of blood or killings.

The cast is pretty darn good in their roles, and the way this film was directed was genius. The ending is unpredictable, and I think it is also excellent.

Very creepy.This is not a typical slasher film and cheap thrills horror movie.  The plot makes sense and moves along and you get to know why the characters are acting as they do.  One of the best parts is that it turns several cliche scenes around and doesnt present them in the same way.  In an early scene a female charecter opens a a fridge door and pours a drink, the scene is set up for something to happen to her right then as a lesser directer would have, however here it just serves to build tension.  The are several nice twists and turns in the movie following this, and a nice surprise ending, following following a very nicely done false finish.The movie is shot were every scene has a sort of griminess and darkness to it, which really raises the creepyness of the plot to a new level.  My only complaint is that the actress in the opening scenes did not seem to really mesh.  I also got the feeling somewhere that this movie was Rosemary's Baby 2. but maybe that is just me.

I was so scared during and after this movie, that I expected to have a heart attack. Half the time I couldn't even look straight at the screen, which was a first for me. It has been three days since I went to see The Ring, and I'm still avoiding my VCR. This movie had great actors who I had never seen before, great plot and real live and loud horror. I'm surprised if I ever go see another scary movie in my life! I'm glad, that there is still someone out there who can make a real horror movie. But at the same time I wish I had never seen this one.

832,meisetsu33,Not bad at all!,7,23 May 2008,"I've been a fan of the original Ring (Ringu here), and sure The Ring doesn't meet up to the quality of the original, but this is still a solid horror movie and an adaptation if you want to compare.Ringu drew the horror with its intense mood (rather than shock/jumping scenes), and The Ring doesn't fail at doing it either. Acting is solid, and the music is as creepy as the original. It is definitely a ""different"" type of horror movie than the traditional American ""slasher"" films, and I'm sure both horror movie fans and non-horror movie fans can enjoy (and be scared) this film.The downside is that the plot was almost as I expected, leaving me with nothing new to take away. I guess its unfair to judge it this way, since it is an adaptation, but I did hope that the director would add some kind of change that made The Ring distinct from Ringu.Also, I felt that the presence of Samara was very toned down compared to Ringu. In Ringu, Sadako was an angry girl that I would wet my pants upon meeting, but in the Ring, Samara seemed almost like a sad girl with a sad past and no more. I'm sure other people would disagree, but at least the character of Samara did leave me with less fear for compared to Sadako (which was borderline traumatizing). But in either case, fans of American horror films would most likely feel a lack of impact that the main villain would leave, compared so lets say Freddy Krueger.Otherwise, its still a solid movie.

I found the digressions from the original plot in this version irritating in the extreme. The business about the horses is spooky, but not really anything to do with the main plot. The same goes for the stuff about the barn. The director appears to have thrown in stuff from Ringu 2, without any regard for whether it belongs in this film or not.Then there was the child actor who played Aiden. His performance wasn't as convincing as that of Takashi Yamamura as Yoichi in the original, and I really couldn't bring myself to care too much what happened to him, which killed the suspense.SPOILER WARNING I also found it puzzling how after Richard electrocutes himself in the bathtub (in a shocking, but gratuitous scene) Noah suddenly arrives virtually out of nowhere, then they seem to make it back to the cabin on the mainland in an unreasonably short length of time.Rachel's choice of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as a tape to replace with the cursed video seems pointlessly nasty.

Let it be known that The Ring contains everything that I found makes a movie riveting,spellbinding, and scary as hell. This movie plays with your mind it freaks you out in ways you never thought possible, it brings out those nightmares in the back of your mind that scare you senseless. As you watch the movie it starts off scaring you right from the beginning and the fright fest never halts. The vagueness of the movie on specific subjects is what scares like for instance the actual tape that kills; it never shows how the ladder is standing up by itself or how the girl's image is in the mirror but no-one is actually there. As you play these images through your head you come up with things that force you to the edge of horror and that's what makes this movie excellent.

Throughout the whole film I felt like I was waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen, but it kind of left me high and dry towards the end. There are a lot of great moments where I nearly p***ed myself, so I can't really call this a BAD movie.

I have watched the original Ring in Japanese too.American re-make ""The Ring"" keeps Japanese taste with slight modifications for people here to enjoy the movie beyond the cultural differences.  For example, a very long black hair girl with white clothes appears in the movie.  Why not short hair? Why not blond? Why not red clothes?  There is a reason.  I am glad the re-make honors the original concept.  Several meaningful items(to scare you) in the original are dropped in the American Ring.  I guess it's because non-Japanese don't associate them with anything. Only Japanese do?  Maybe so.The plot is little weak though.  It is not clear why the girl is not ordinary.  The Japanese one explains why.  Also, the ending is much more scary in the original.   That's why I don't want to watch the original one again....I will not be able to go to the restroom at night.

What I liked best about this film was the fact that it managed to maintain the fear factor right throughout the entire film, unlike other chillers such as Sixth Sense or Jeepers Creepers which were scary for forty minutes before losing themselves in the latter parts. This film is scary right up to the end!The main reason I felt compelled to write however concerns the Ring, Ringu debate. To those who dont know The Ring is actually a remake of a Japanese film Ringu which came out in 1998.  The general consensus on here seems to be that the original is much scarier and darker, a view to which I cannot subscribe. I watched Ringu first, about 3 months ago and although I found the story inriguing it wasnt really scary at all until right up to the end,(which was shocking I must admit!). The original Japanese version, obviously made on a low budget had a made for tv feel about it, and the acting wasnt really that good either. I cant honestly belive how anyone watching the two films could say the original is scarier, it just so isnt! Anyway one thing the original did do better however was to flesh out the story. I wont spoil either film by saying what happens but in the original the history of the girl is much better and explains things more.  I would recommend watching both films as they both offer something different from the usual teen slasher horrors we seem to get all the time nowadays. The only similar film I can think of is FearDotCom which by the way was terrible, so I would recommend this or the original Ringu to anyone wanting an original, scary horror.",The Ring

At times I felt a little twinge, but nothing like I did when I saw Linda Blair tearing into those priests and spewing pea-soup and walking down the stairs like a spider with blood gushing out of her mouth. The movie just flickered on and on and I thought it was never going to end. My wife said, ""What's going on."" I replied, ""I don't have the foggiest."" We didn't shiver. We didn't shake. No one in the audience made a sound. A few got up and left. But I paid my money and I almost never walk out during a movie. I mean, like, what is the matter with me? Am I the only person on the planet that didn't enjoy this flick? Did I miss something? My eyes were open the whole time. I didn't fall asleep, but wanted to.

From the opening scene to the horrifying finale, I was absolutely, 100% terrified. The movie starts off innocently enough, with two girls, Katie and Rebecca, watching TV and talking aimlessly. However, the conversation soon turns to the ""cursed"" tape that Katie had seen last weekend. Both girls laugh it off, but there is still a heavy tension in the air. A series of disturbing things begin happening, such as the TV downstairs turning on and off by itself. Katie is killed, and Rebecca, after witnessing the horrible death, is sent to a mental hospital. The rest of the movie goes on show how Rachel, Katie's aunt, unravels the mystery behind the strange tape.The plot line is interesting, and the scares were genuine.I have never seen the original Ringu, so I can't compare it to that, but all on its own, this movie was pretty good.

And the feeling was enhanced when I was walking home that night, pitch black, thick fog and alone in the north part of Sweden. As a film I don't fancy it. Lame actors, no extraordinary sounds, no deep. Not anything remarkable about it. But as a horror film; a little masterpiece. Excellent editing. The flashes in were the corpses are revealed are genial. A very good way to scare the audience, indeed. The picture loses little of it's supernatural charm in the end, but that is typical.

I know the beats, cadences and standards of storytelling, and while I haven't written a 'scary story' I'm familiar with the process. Further, I have studied fear from both a psychological aspect and a mythological aspect.I watched this movie on cable, over a year after its release, in the fullness of the afternoon sunshine streaming into my eleventh floor, three bedroom apartment.And I was scared.This was a brilliant film, so brilliant in its terror inducing imagery and story that I would recommend anyone with an overactive imagination or a low-tolerance for fear, avoid this movie at all costs. It's that good.Technically speaking (directing, acting, scripting, cinematography, lighting, score, et al) the film is highly proficient in all areas. There may have been flaws, but none that I observed on first viewing. In that regard, you could do much less rewarding things instead of sitting down and watching this movie. It was engaging, enthralling and unabashedly creepy.Be aware as I repeat myself: If disturbing imagery or scary tales are too much for you to handle DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. There is very little in the way of gore, and the mortality rate is low for this genre.

In fact, all the movies that are thought of as very classic scary movies such as Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Shining, none of these movies ever scared me at all.  But this movie truly freaked me out.  I really didn't want to go to my house by myself after watching this.  I ended up staying at my aunt's house and even then I was uncomfortable sleeping in the livingroom by myself.  It is embarrassing but I was so scared and I loved every minute of it.

854,LorrSJ,does the job better than others,8,24 May 2003,"i love horror/supernatural movies, rather then slasher types, because of the thoughts that it implants into your head. i saw the exorcist when i was 15 and it wasnt the movie that frightened me, but the thought that the devil could take over my body. i know it was stupid, but the movie did it to me.it is the same for the ring. the movie itself was no scarier then the sixth sense, but the thought of footage that kills you played on my mind. the dvd i watched had the entire 'real footage', and after the movie i began to watch it. the movie was so effective, that as i watched, i subconsciously looked away for a few moments at a time so i didnt watch the entire footage. about half way through i was forced to eject the dvd (on command from the brother's friend) since the footage could not be stopped. however, i will end up watching the entire footage later (i hope).the movie itself was not as scary as i thought it would be, but resembled the sixth sense quite a bit. but i recommend watching the 'real footage' alone in the dark after having watched the movie. it will give you the biggest scare of your life. another thing would be to watch it with mates, and create myths about the 'real footage' actually killing people or the rumour that the japanese version of the movie had put people into physciatric hospitals.to conclude, the thought of the ring itself is scarier than the actual movie.",The Ring
855,Fantasyman09,Not so much scary as it is psychological,8,2 July 2003,"Let me start off by saying that The Ring isn't as scary as many make it out to be. Yes, it has some moments where you may jump a little bit, but those moments are few and far apart. The movie is mostly psychological, with many freakish moments, for example, the haunted tape. The story is pretty good. It's about a video tape that kills its viewers seven days after they watch it, and a reporter who tries to investigate its mystery after watching it herself. You probably will need to see the movie more than once to fully understand the plot, but when you do, it'll be worth it. I couldn't help but ask, why? I won't ruin the story for you, but after you watch it, you'll be asking the same question. Since this movie is based on the hit Japanese film, Ringu, you might have already seen it, but I doubt that. And it has many differences with the superior Japanese version. All in all, The Ring is a great movie to watch at night time, in a dark room, with few people huddled around the television set. Definitely check this one out.Final Score - 9 / 10",The Ring

857,gsworth02,Don't believe the hype,1,12 January 2004,"I was actually excited to see this movie based on what just about everyone who had seen it had told me, but the movie just ended up being another example of why American movie-goers have no clue. First off, I thought this movie was supposed to be scary? It wasn't, at all. I never found myself being remotely scared. Second, this movie explains almost nothing. Watch it as many times as you want, most of what happens has no explanation, and the plot has more holes than a block of Boar's Head Swiss Cheese. Maybe ""Ring 2"" will clear things up for us...

858,blacklives4ever,This movie stays with you...,8,30 January 2005,"The weirdest thing: this movie is not all that scary. Well, it is. But not the ""scary"" that most American audiences expect, with decomposed-faced ghosts popping up, grabbing your ankle, weird noises in the wall. Nope, this ghost hardly makes any appearances at all. There are one or two jump scenes, but nothing that will really freak you out. What makes this movie so scary is the sense of impending doom, like a black raincloud hanging over your head, ready to burst any minute. It's the kind of fright that hasn't been successfully made since The Sixth Sense or even Psycho. Hardly anything is shown, but everything else is shoved in your face to make you think that you saw everything that you didn't really see. And that's what gives you nightmares.What's also creepy is that it's not your everyday plot: psycho killer on the loose, or even boy who can see ghosts. No, this plot has been weaved and woven to the point where only those with enough patience are able to sit down and unknot the plot until they can go ""oh! now I get it...."" but just like fractions, that's not the end. There's back story and after story and clever twists and turns and meatballs every now and then.So if you're interested in a good psychological ghost thriller, grab a trustworthy pet to cuddle and a glass of water and, contrary to what many critics say, watch it alone! It's juicier that way and will have you leaping backward away from your television set faster than you can say ""seven days.""My take: 8/10",The Ring
859,psychy,Great film but ending was too open ended,9,23 March 2004,"This movie had tons of shock value with disturbing images, I'll give it that. It also proves that a movie these days doesn't have to have tons of gore and death to be scary. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat more or less for the whole movie. By the time it got towards the end my heart was literally pounding, wondering if she was going to die or live. One great comment I have about this movie is how it leads you on that it's over. It makes you feel comfortable by giving you that warm feeling of seeing the kid's mother and father holding hands and then cuts to the scene with the kid's dad. The ONLY gripe I really have about the movie is how open-ended the ending is. It just leaves too much out and doesn't even really give you a solid clue of what happens after the end. It doesn't even really give you enough to think about to try and form your own hypothesis. I probably would've given the move a 9 if there was more closure at the end. Still a GREAT film and I highly recommend it to anyone.",The Ring
860,nightkayleen,"A brief review of ""The Ring""'s plot.",4,17 October 2013,"To begin, I have neither read the book or seen the Japanese movie, so my review is about this version only. ""The Ring"" was artfully filmed, with good color choices and lots of tiny features that were fun to find. Visually, I loved this movie. But I watch for the plot, and there wasn't much of it here. ""The Ring"" is the detailed story of a chain letter. It is one of the ""pass it on or die"" stories that I'm sure we've all seen at one time or another. Yes, this is much better written than a usual e-mail, but it's still, in my opinion, an overused and cheap plot. I laughed at the first few scenes of the movie, but from there it went downhill. There were clichéd characters (the skeptical detective, the all-knowing young child, the creepy little girl) and unoriginal exposition techniques. As the story progressed, I began to enjoy ""The Ring"" a bit more, but it left many unanswered questions and loose ends that I feel should have been tied up. Many interesting characters are introduced, and their histories are extremely important to the plot, but we only receive the very minimum information. So many ideas are introduced and never properly explored. I was left wondering at the end of the movie--not thoughtful, more exasperated that they hadn't included more information. Throughout the movie, I never related to any of the characters and never felt like we got a grip on who they were. Each character has a role in the movie, but their stories feel not fully developed and I think this could have been improved upon. If you are looking for a beautiful film with good colors, interesting shots, and carefully placed details, ""The Ring"" isn't a bad movie to watch. But if, like me, you care more about the plot than anything else, I wouldn't recommend it.",The Ring
861,readysetgo88,It just wasn't all it should have been (***SPOILERS***),8,17 September 2004,"According to a good many people, The Ring is one of the best horror movies ever made. I haven't seen a lot of horror movies, but I don't see how that could possibly be good news for the genre. My chief complaint with the movie is that it left far too many plot holes. I appreciate the thought-provoking open-endedness of REALLY GOOD FILMS, but when I find myself trying to stuff the cracks in the script as the credits are rolling, I think there's something wrong. Here are some, but not all, of the questions that should have been answered (spoilers):1. What did the images in the video actually represent, other than as a means to let Rachel find out the story? Why was Anna brushing her hair in the mirror? Why the lighthouse? Why the bugs? I understand the hair theme and the water theme, but doesn't that seem to be st-re-tch-ing things a bit far?2. How did Aidan know what was going to happen to his cousin? At the beginning of the movie, he was drawing pictures that predicted it. Shouldn't he just have been an innocent little kid at that point? And how did he find out all about Samara in order to make his smart little comments at the end of the film? Surely Rachel didn't tell him? Incidentally, another complaint I have is that the climax was far too weak. I completely missed the fact that it WAS the climax (when Samara kills Noah). In fact, I was sure that Aidan WAS Samara and that THAT was how the movie would end. That would have given the scriptwriters a chance to explain some things that they left out.3. Why did Anna go crazy? Because the horses went crazy? Why did THEY go crazy???? This was never even TOUCHED upon. I don't even see why there were horses in the movie at all, except as some sort of filler, and there's nothing I hate more than a movie that has to resort to fillers.4. What was Richard Morgan's role in the movie? Anna killed Samara, they were kind enough to show us that, but then why did Richard act like HE was responsible? Why did he kill himself?5. How did Samara make the video? Why a video at all, for that matter? To give this movie some sort of PLOT? Couldn't somebody somewhere have come up with SOME explanation before they starting shooting?6. Who was Becca? She was with Katie when she died, but there's no explanation for what happens to her afterward and why she ends up in a psych ward. She knew what would happen. Was SHE somehow Samara? They had the same color hair. I've already suggested how Aidan could have become Samara, but they couldn't both have been. And if Becca WAS Samara, why wasn't that pointed out cohesively in the movie? And if she was, that opens up the plot to even MORE holes than it had without that explanation. They're pretty self-evident, so I won't point them out.7. Conceivably, every single other one of my questions could be left to the viewer's imagination to figure out, but there is one (at least, that I'VE thought of) gigantic glaring plot hole that simply can't be overlooked: Where did the tape of Samara in the psychiatrist's office come from? Not specifically where did it come from, but how did it even exist? Samara is talking about the things that she's doing, the pictures that just appeared and blah blah blah. Shouldn't she be dying in a well at that point? Or, if the psych tape was made before she was killed, why was she so bitter already? Did she know her mother would kill her? Was she just plain evil? In that case, why did the video include images from the well, specifically THE RING? Maybe I could sit here and invent an explanation, but as I said earlier, if I'm going to have to write the script myself I at least want my name to go in the credits.In conclusion, The Ring is not a bad movie, just a tad misguided. There were things that could have been done and ought to have been done to eliminate at least some of the holes in the plot, and made a better movie. I give it 4 points for actually being scary (I'm not sure how well I'll sleep tonight) and 2 points for stringing a few plot elements together to come up with something. Some movies have no plot whatsoever and thankfully, this wasn't one of them. I really wanted to like the movie, but it just wasn't what it should have been. .............6/10",The Ring

Much scarier, atmospheric, and interesting for me. The Ring has been a success in the US, and people keep saying, ""It was so scary!"", and ""How did they come up with such a great idea?"". In reality, the people at Dreamworks had no idea where to get a new idea for a movie, so they ripped off an excellent Japense smash hit and repeated the success. Unfairly, in my opinion.

That being said, I think that this is one of the best remakes ever. In my personal opinion, I think that 'The Ring' is a far better movie than 'Ringu'. Not only is it superior in acting and storyline, it also features better effects and a darker tone overall.I think that this movie is what all other horror flicks should strive for. It sets a very dark atmosphere from the very beginning and does a brilliant job at delivering hopelessness throughout its entire duration. It never reveals too much, as so many films nowadays tend to and gives you just enough eeriness to keep you hooked to the screen, waiting for the next hint at what the story behind the mysterious videotape is.It's honestly the most suspenseful film of its genre and I would recommend watching it as soon as possible.",The Ring

It doesn't have (and doesn't need) the gore of most horror movies these days. It is all in the mind. And let me tell you- some of the images they show you in the film are so disturbing that they stick with you for a very long time.

The Ring is an American adaptation of the Japanese horror film Ringu. Following the success of this movie, it spawned its own sequel and introduced the Western audience to J-horror adaptations, notably The Grudge. There's intense tension, scares and mood developed in this film that are still palpable every time you watch. In doing so, director Gore Verbinski shapes a timely narrative about communal disconnect, modern alienation and the all-conquering power of technology with this adaptation. Naomi Watts delivers a superb performance as Rachel and I'm so glad it propelled her into mainstream consciousness. Martin Henderson too is equally on form as Noah, her confidant.No matter how many times I've seen it, I enjoy watching this film. The Ring is a classic horror film of the 2000s, if not 'the' classic horror film of the 2000s.",The Ring
868,damo65-2,Flawed beyond belief,1,29 October 2006,"When I heard that Ringu was being made in Hollywood, I was appalled. When it came out and did well, I ignored it. I finally watched it last week and cannot believe it has done as well, both critically and financially. The acting is so wooden it's not funny, especially Naomi Watts. How reviews failed to point this out amazes me. I was led to believe that the film was a, practically, frame for frame remake of the original. The opening 15 minutes or so are nearly exactly the same and I began to be drawn in. But then the video comes into play and as each element in it is revealed in the storyline I got more and more frustrated. Some elements do survive the ordeal but some images cannot have been made by Samara (the scene of her mother's suicide for instance, the ""burning tree"" for instance etc etc). In fact the whole character of Samara makes no sense at all. Why was she put into the hospital? What had she done? What's with the pictures she ""created""? Why did she get let out? Are her parents really her parents (showing a partial birth certificate for a second or two is only going to make me angrier!)? Why does her touch burn? It is an insult to my intelligence (and yours!)! There is no sense of doom, of urgency in any of the characters. There is no sense of geography. When 10 minutes of story would have, maybe, helped move the story along, we get 10 minutes of frantic action with no meaning. Why?! What Hideo Nakata did to Koji Suzuki's awesome novel was to take the important parts and overlay a supernatural story over the top. The Ring has taken the important parts out of Ringu and overlays a different supernatural story over the rest. The problem with The Ring is that the story they used is pathetically weak in comparison to that in Ringu. And if the US market is willing to accept it as ""better"" then that merely exposes the ""quality"" of contemporary US horror. I recommend that everyone read the book in addition to watching Ringu as a remedy to this disaster of a movie. Although it looks good and contains some shocks, it is too flawed to be a version of Ringu or a satisfying horror movie in its own right.",The Ring

White Noise, Boogeyman, Hide & Seek, The Village, Gothika, The Ring Two, they all sucked. This is a great movie with so many twists and turns, but it makes you think which is kinda a good thing because most movies are just so bland and just plain boring! anyways this movie is awesome and one more thing two new scary movies that are actually scary are The Exorcism of Emily Rose & Cry_Wolf. I'd Recommend seeing them too! well anyways this movie is reely good and i would recommend seeing it! ~!@#$%^&*()_+ PEAcE +_)(*&^%$#@!~",The Ring
870,Cheshire_cat_with_a_grin,My first IMDb comment....its important!,10,9 October 2005,"This is one of my favorite movies. I'm like..obsessed. I know some of you are thinking I'm crazy. This movie, to me, is awesome! There was some confusion (as i read in other comments) about how the images got on the tape. It WAS mentioned in the movie. The four teens from the beginning were trying to record a football game, when they were staying in CABIN12. Samara, being in the well RIGHT UNDER CABIN12 made the reception bad and as the football game was recorded, the images were placed there instead.There are parts of this movie that you wont understand until you see The Ring twO. The second one is better. Nothing really happens in the first one. Its an introduction to the story. All it is is Rachel (Naiomi Watts) trying to figure out the mystery. Something ACTUALLY happens in the second one. The second one is definitely bizarre. Mostly cause a Japanese person directed it, instead of Gore Verbinski. They are both great. If you're a GREAT fan of horror movies that aren't really scary, but give you that EERIE feeling when you're watching it..i'd recommend seeing this!",The Ring
871,fernandomeliani,No words but AMAZING!,10,19 February 2019,"Classical, notorious, relevant, creepy. It is not meant to scare you, but to keep you afraid. The movie has an unique atmosphere, something I didn't feel while watching the original version, it makes you pay attention from the start to the end.I wouldn't mind hearing someone say ""The Ring"" is the best horror movie ever. I might not agree, but I would get the point.",The Ring
872,Marlay,You've got to be kidding me.,4,16 May 2003,"This movie was garbage from the first minute to the very end.  I'm wondering how you sell something like this to an audience - it's a video tape that when you watch it, you die.  What ten-year-old came up with such a lame concept?  What's worse is that it leaves you with a ton of questions, it's not scary at all, and is overall pretty uninteresting.  Thumbs down!",The Ring
873,njdevil,"Not the creepiest, but close",10,21 October 2002,"Just saw it tonight. Wasn't as creepy as The Sixth Sense, but of its genre, excellent point-of-view camera work and story-telling puts it in the same league. It has a lot going for it. An inventive ""urban legend"" kind of tale, a creepy little kid (stolen, I'd say from the aforementioned picture), a well-written mystery/detective story and a frightening denouement. The methodical unraveling of the tape's meaning makes you forget there is a time element in this movie until the end. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year.",The Ring
874,Keith-48,Fear is a personal thing.,9,25 August 2003,"Take into your viewing of this film no presuppositions; fear is a personal thing, and when it aims to seep into the mind as deeply as this, some people will pass it by without a sideways glance, and others will just laugh.Some films scare on the surface - Halloween, Psycho, The Exorcist and TTCSM are superficial, almost enjoyable thrillers, laced with gore, comedy and shocks. That is the modern idea of horror. It is unlikely that a person of sound mind will take the scenes to bed with them, less still have any nightmares.The Ring has some of these, but the real genius are those moments that cause nothing more than aghast silence, and a sense of bewilderment. Don't Look Now has such moments; Eraserhead goes, perhaps, a little too far, but still hangs around like a bad taste in the mouth. Some of the imagery in The Ring is too intense, it needs comic relief, but around each corner is another thug of a moment : blood red, hyper-polarised, in your face.As I have said, real horror is a personal thing, and I won't be losing the baggage that this film has left in my head for some time.",The Ring
875,Moovie12,"Chilling, Mature Horror Film of Depth and Emotion",9,21 December 2004,"I have always puzzled over criticisms that this film is a soulless cash-in of a superior Japanese horror film, intended for low attention-span teenagers. While the original RING stands as a intensely horrifying ghost story on its own, it is safe to say that the American remake is its own fresh take on the same story, adding to the horror of the original with thematic complexity and penetrating subtext.The Japanese RING is effective because of the stark realism and dry terror it evokes; the remake takes the opposite route, taking on a nightmarish and surreal atmosphere. While RING steams forward to the final climax with menacing intensity, THE RING creeps forward with a languid, contemplative pace. Criticisms for being ""slow"" are inevitable, but to those who can appreciate it, THE RING ultimately benefits from the way it languishes on its vivid dreamscapes. One is not likely to forget the shot of the well, bathed in blue, or the leaves lighting up ""as if they were on fire."" But my real point in writing this review is to praise the excellent adaptation this film is of its Japanese counterpart. Scriptwriter Ehren Kruger adds his own version to the legend behind the tape, replacing psychics with unnatural conceptions, and scandal with tragedy. Kruger also adds layers to the film, introducing arcing themes of parenthood, the nature of children, and empathy.Parenthood is examined in a number of places in the film. Naomi Watts' character, a crass and insensitive journalist, is also an uncaring mother, not wanting to acknowledge the distance between her and her son. Martin Henderson's Noah is a deadbeat dad, afraid of taking responsibility of the child. Jane Alexander, as the Moesko Island doctor, talks to Watts about her mentally retarded grandson. ""We loved him anyway,"" she says. ""It takes work. Some people have limits."" She is indirectly talking about the Morgans, whose daughter shows them the worst-case scenario of becoming a parent. The extent to which they go when dealing with their child is horrifying. Aidan and Samara have a subtle relationship in that they are both victims of parents struggling with their role as parents. It is finally the curse that leads Rachel Keller to take full role as a mother, and the empathy she creates with the neglected daughter Samara Morgan's plight ultimately reflects on her own son.There is a lot more to this film than one would think. The final climax with the television has its own dark edge, even with the superior climax of the Japanese RING edging it out. The final scene brings up a moral dilemma though that rivals the original in resonance.For added insight, watch the DON'T WATCH THIS feature on the DVD. There is one scene between Rachel and her sister Ruth that should not have been cut from the film: their conversation reflects directly another mother-child relationship and how ""involved"" a parent should be with their children.Great film, one of the best horror films in years. 9/10.",The Ring
876,Koskosov,Truly Imbecilic,1,30 April 2003,"Well, this film left me depressed, not because it was creepy, but because it was so stupid and at the same time so cynical.  I may say that there is not a single thing in this picture which makes any sense or has any genuine humanity in it.  The monster is an evil little girl, but there is never the slightest indication to suggest why the girl is so evil or so powerful - indeed, precisely the sort of silence which is a certain giveaway that the picture has been made by people with adolescent mentalities, for adolescents.   You posit some sort of monstrosity, and that's all there is to it, nothing more need be said.  ""Okay, like, there's this evil little girl with incredible powers...?""  To give but two instances of the astonishing illogic which characterizes the film.  For one, the mysterious video which is killing people is said to have been imprinted from the evil girl's memories.  But the video is full of images of things that the girl could not possibly have seen.  For another, the characters are horrified to realize that it is a terrible calamity that her skeleton has been taken from the well, because somehow this means that now she is free to wreak her evil upon the world and kill people.  But she has been wreaking her evil upon the world and killing people even with her skeleton at the bottom of the well! Oh, I'm sorry, apparently she can now actually drag her ugly carcass out of the television set and kill people instead of killing them from inside the television set.  But perhaps her identically melted-face victims would not consider this such an important distinction.  Then there is the clerk who manages the cabins and upon whose shelf the evil video is found - the curious fellow who plays him is given a nice little character-actor turn, interacting with the blonde lady who is the star, trying to perform card tricks, and so forth - and then we never see him again!  What the heck was <i>that</i> about?  What was his part in the sinister events, what was the video doing on his shelf?  We never learn!  We never see him again!  You see, it is as if the screenplay for this film was written, scene by scene, without any reference to anything that had been written before, certainly not with any intention to exercise the slightest logic or continuity, but merely to work certain changes upon the psyche of the filmgoer, who is presumed to be a teen-ager, I suppose, and who is certainly held in utter contempt.  And here is the real horror, that the film wants nothing from you but your money, and has no meaning other than to trick you into pushing some bills through the slot at the box office.",The Ring

I think this is an incredible movie, not only of the crazy freakyness of it, but for the amazing message right there inside it.  The reporter saves herself (and her son) by perpetuating the circle.  She lives by making someone else die, which in end of the movie, is all of us.  The boy's father's quote, something like, you media, you take one person's tragedy and force us all to live it; Think about it.  Look at all the use of TVs in the movie.  Now turn on your TV to one of the 24 hour newsstations.  You got a sniper in DC who's killing people for attention, the media covers it, he gets more attention, keeps on killing, perpetuating the circle.  The girl is evil and wants her message spread.  The reporter does this for her.  For me at least, this movie really makes you stop and think about some serious issues regaurding the media and where we are going. Well, we only got 7 days, but I'm sure the 24 hour news cycle will give us 168 straight hours of coverage of our demise.  Gore Verbinski better win some major awards, this guy is for real.

I have seen both films, and I really gotta say that the bastardized American version of ""The Ring"" is a better all-around flick.Not that ""Ringu"" is a bad movie, not at all.  Despite a few changes, the basic story (even the pacing of the film) remain intact, almost identical altogether (see the opening scene with the two teenage girls in the beginning of both films).  ""Ringu"" is still a good thrill ride.I think the US version of ""The Ring"" fills in a couple holes that original left maybe a bit too open-ended.  More of the story behind Samara/Sadako is revealed; instead of wishing for the little girl to remain dead, you feel sorry for her and understand her reasons for doing what she does.  Not only this but I think a bigger budget really helped out in the US version. The exaggerated deaths, creepier video, and surreal Samara/Sadako add quite a bit to the film (I don't think inverting the colors on the screen are a convincing way to show someone dying...).So see both movies, you'll like them both - but there's no way the US version takes away from ""Ringu"" - it's better.",The Ring

There are some things that go unexplained (like how Samara's thought's got on video in the first place)...I would have liked them explained, but, I am not sure it was crucial to the movie.I won't spoil the ending but I thought it would have been better if it has ended about 2 minutes earlier than it really did; I do have to say that the ending was much better than where I thought it was going to end while I was watching it.

I'm not usually the Gory type but i love being scared, and if you want to be scared, this is definitely the movie to watch. Its great how it has scary moments, but still a bit of humor to soften it up a bit. When i watched it with my buds, a couple of us screamed at points when things popped up. But so far as the story, i think it is excellent. Just the texture and how every single clue just fits in like a jigsaw puzzle. it stinks about how its a cliffhanger. I've never seen the original version, and after seeing the remake, i think it would be awkward. The video tape is freaky though,i wish someone would make a movie like that and as a joke, pass it around the world. Just a thought.

I was the most scared when they switched scenes and would play a screeching sound and show an eyeball or a ring between the shots.  The whole point was that the girl wanted people to hear her story but why would she kill them once they did?  If she had this amazing power to just kill someone, why wouldn't she just kill the people who didn't know about her or some how make them find out her story.  A lot of stuff wasn't even explained like how did she make the tape?  It seems kind of impossible to me that a tape just appears somewhere.

884,may_lin,Definitely not average slasher-teen-horror flick,8,17 October 2002,"Ring is a rather morbid movie with a simple yet original concept: An unmarked video tape that kills whoever watches it.Naomi Watts plays a reporter who(urged by her sister) investigates the sudden death of her niece. After snooping around a little, the clues lead her to a sinister tape viewed by the teens in a remote cabin. After watching the tape, she receives a warning that she has only ""7 days"" to live. As the countdown begins, the cynical reporter begins to believe in the curse of the tape and tries her best to break the curse.Though I've not seen the original Japanese version, I think this remake has the potential to draw in a lot of fans in the U.S. The story keeps the tension level up well enough as it takes you on a journey to discover the origin and meaning of the tape. However, the most important aspect of the story is that you never expect what will happen next and it leaves lot to your imagination. It isn't gory nor revolting but it does prove itself to be a horror flick that deserves some attention in the midst of the many teen-angst-slasher-horror movies that are so common these days.

That's hard to admit - coming from an 18 year old male.  I was shaking for the entire 107 minutes of film time, then all through the credits.  I found my breathing patterns had slowed down, returned to normal, when I woke up this morning.I am quite a fan of the thriller/horror genre.  SCREAM is one of my favourite movies.  But I must say, no movie has ever really frightened me, and I was proud to admit that.  I mean, JEEPERS CREEPERS was slightly creepy for a selected few moments, but the feeling passes quickly - and it was hardly there, anyway.I'm not going to give you a plot summary, an indepth analysis of the story. Those who are interested will go and see the movie.  But I will say, the direction was fantastic.  Gore Verbinski (The Mexican) did a fantastic job. Australian, Naomi Watts was nothing short of flawless. And that little creepy kid, Aidan, was very good, too.I have rated more than 300 movies on this website, but this is only the second time I have left a comment - I was THAT impressed with it.If you don't like horror films, you should still find this as a well-made piece of cinema.

887,Irish14,"It DOES receive a ""ringing"" endorsement...",10,1 November 2002,"After spending Halloween night with the Scream trilogy (again) in my college dorm, a friend and I decided we were looking for something better, so we tried The Ring.  It was a purely impulse movie choice--we'd heard some good things but knew little about it.  My recommendation to you: Go See It.The film's basis is a video tape that brings about the death of its viewers within 7 days.  It's a decent enough scary movie idea--you know that right away the main character is going to watch the video tape and then have 7 days (or 2 hours of film time) to solve the mystery of why the tape is so deadly.  So it's already granted that not everything in this film will be a surprise to you--sometimes the people you expect to die do, and the bad things you expect to happen do.  But don't be fooled into thinking you've got it all figured out--it's more likely than not that you don't, and there are no false climaxes--there's really only one.The plot is well constructed--my friend and I who both delight in finding plot holes and poorly constructed scripts tried very hard to be disappointed with the film, or catch something the editors missed, but we couldn't. It's a good mystery, and halfway through the film you will want to stay solely to figure out all the pieces of the puzzle.  While, on the surface, the killer and the victims may not seem connected, the storyline actually does draw a line between the two, the video being the vehicle.  It's all explained, it's all there on film--the movie AND the movie within the movie.Technically, it's a beautiful movie.  Landscape shots are very well planned out, and it (thankfully) lacks in cheap special effects, dripping blood and gore (total gore time likely comprises 1/64 of the film), and poorly done computer miracles.  The Pacific Northwest was beautifully utilized, the sets were well done, the cinematography was excellent...I could go on and on.
This is not your average Halloween slasher-pic scary movie.  It's Hitchcockian in nature in that it's based more on suspense and solving the mystery than on teenagers in ghost masks jumping out with large knives. For the Hitchcock fan, check out the in-film homage to Rear Window.

However The ring was more of a horror mystery and a very good one at that. This movie is pretty amazing except for the adidan the main characters child who weirdly acts like an adult and it is never really explained, but maybe it is in the sequel which I have never seen. The 2 main characters dynamic was very good and made me actually care about them. The ending scene where samara climbs out of the TV was ruined for me by the editing and the fact that she always looked like she was part of the TV. The film is shot in this weird green and gray but also in color way that I was not crazy about at first but really grew on me, especially when I saw the shot of her on the balcony on the apartment.

Maybe a little uneasy, maybe a little tens, but not scared, not grown up me. The truth is, we all experience fear, embracing that fact is what makes the Ring so enjoyable.
In my view the best scary movies are the ones that really start to get scary after the credits have rolled.The ones that are at their most frightening in that last moment before you turn the bedside light off... That are at their most frightening when you walk down the darkened hallway to your bedroom after turning the lights off... That are at their most scary when you wake to a noise in the night KNOWING its just the house cooling... That are at their most frightening when their memories come to you in the moments before dawn. Images that take only a few seconds to pass on big screen but have the time to stir languidly in our dreams, making us toss and turn.The ring may not be a scarefest, nor gory, not lighthearted. But it is un-nerving, a rare treat in this age of the feel good flicks. The kind of movie children should not watch, for it will give them nightmares. The kind of movie that will raise the hair on you back from time to time as another frightening scene is recalled (especially the video of ""the nightmare"").As with all great movies there is passionate discussion as to its value, but only a dullard could see no value in the well directed and ultimately disturbing and frightening piece of work.Spoiler: One point many critics have touched on is the supposed scariness of the tape and why the child would even make a tape. I implore you to watch the film again and listen to what she has to say in her interrogation, and note who her only ""friend"" in the barn loft is alluded to being.

The Ring shows a type of horror few movies can pull off... Psychological terror.  This movie should make tons at the box office, because of word of mouth alone,  despite all the mediocre reviews its getting from the critics... only because its a remake.

The great thing is it has absolutely no huge stars. But is still being loved by everyone. Maybe Hollywood should take note.
On that note the acting was superb.  Naomi Watts does a great job. In her first leading role. The two young actors David Dorfman and Daveigh Chase. Give chilling young performances. Best I've seen in a long while. These two will be ones to watch in the future.To sum it up. If you want to be scared go see this film. See it with your better half. So you have someone to hold on to.",The Ring

I am not really a horror movie fan cause the horror movies released after '90 are all full of nudity , blood and gore.They always forgot to include the main part Horror.I went see this movie cause my friends took me too see it. What can i say? After a long time i had a hard time to sleep for a movie. I gave it an 8 because it has everything to scare the s**t out of you. Specially the last ten minutes!!! Whoof........ the plot is kind of unsolved in the movie, you have to watch it a couple of times to figure it out (check the IMDB message board for THE RING, you will know why)but damn......i dont have much words to explain it. Those who think you have a lion heart watch the movie at a silent night ALONE. If the last scene of the movie still doesn't scare you then i guess you dont even have a heart. For others DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. You might give yourself a mini heart attack. So if you wanna get a scary movie  for a Haloween night this is the pick for you. Enjoy (& scare).",The Ring
900,gbemerson,"Good, but not scary",8,10 November 2002,"The Ring is a pretty solid idea, reminiscent of The Changeling with George C. Scott, and the story keeps you interested. The acting was fine, given the rather poor, at times, dialogue the actors had to work with. It just fell short on actually scaring the audience, unlike the Changeling, and wasn't able to convince me how terribly frightening such a situation would be, if indeed ghosts were real and cared to scare anybody. Other than that it was a fine movie and worth a shot, but I do have a problem with Hollywood's insistence that it pours when it rains here in Seattle. It doesn't pour here, it just drizzles mostly, or softly rains.",The Ring

All the gimics of the genre are incorporated, while the suspence of the Japanese original remains intact. Many of the original sequences are reborn and enhanced, and along with this rehashed script, are not dumbed down in anticipation of Hollywood audience prerequisites. The idea of Sadako/Samara is fantastic. Perhaps the main difference in feeling from the original lies with our perception of her: In the original one understands Sadako to be non-human, supernatural, and a product of some ancient sea torment. The Ring (2002) however, portrays Samara as a fundementally evil entity out for revenge. All in all this was an excellent film, a tribute to the first, which adds its own original concepts and visual artistry.",The Ring

909,BballChick151615,ONE OF THE SCARIEST MOVIES EVER,10,4 November 2002,"This movie is really really good and really really scary!!! It's one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and also one of the best.  It's not like ""The Exorsist"", which is more gruesome and gory than scary.  This is the real thing, a REAL scary movie.  I was going to go see ""Abandon"", but I saw this instead, and I'm really glad I did.  ""Abandon"" is probably really good, but this movie was definately worth my time.  I actually screamed twice in the theater!!  I highly recommend going to see this movie.At first, it's just freaky, but as the movie goes on, the pieces start to fall together until you understand everything that was in the video. There's alot of stuff in this movie that, when it happens, makes you jump.. or scream.  And just when you think the movie is over and everything is resolved, something  happens that completely surprises you, and the movie goes on a little longer.  This movie is really good, so if you like really scary movies and/or mysteries, you should go see this.",The Ring

It sparked memories of Jacob's Ladder, and such over ""scary"" movies that incorporated disturbing images and quick cuts to 'bubbling blood shots' and such to mortify it's unlucky viewers. Throughout this entire movie I kept waiting for something to catch me...suck me into the story. This movie lacked focus. The entire portion of the movie where she tried to figure out the puzzle of 'who is this woman, and why is she haunting me?' was dumb. At that point I found my self saying 'who cares'...bring back the video and watch it again or something. The more I think about this movie the more I feel like it's a cheap copy (which it is), and we all know a copy of anything is not as good as the original.

Another point scored.I was quite impressed by the lead's acting. Even better.

I enjoyed this movie.  I was hyperventilating in my seat and a true terror was evoked.I find that the plot is tightly strung and the parallelisms in everything was amazing.  Especially the foreshadowing..  This left the ending of showing how the death occurred a grave shock.  The acting was superb.. and coming from a theatre major...  amazing.  Absolutely real and urban.  I can't see these other actresses doing it.  Granted Nicole Kidman could have done the role, but the real question is, would it have been like The Others? I think she was good for that role but this role wouldn't have worked for her in the end and I think she knew that...  there is no way I could have seen Gwyneth Paltrow doing Rachel's role.Amazing.",The Ring
914,orangenormal,Overrated,7,19 November 2002,"I wasn't terribly impressed by this film. Although it's well produced and surprisingly convincing despite it's overly fantastic premise, there are far too many contrived plot conveniences that the audience is expected to either naively accept or overlook entirely.The story involves a videotape that grants the viewer only 7 days to live after watching it. The origin of this tape is vaguely explained, but the origin of its creator is not. The audience is expected to accept--Deus Ex Machina--that the creator is simply evil, and for all intents and purposes, magic. Why the creator chooses to torment those that watch her tape is not explained. How the creator is able to kill the viewers of the tape is yet another mystery. Indeed, the mysteries build up as the movie progresses (I won't spoil the surprise by revealing these mysteries), but very few are fully explained in the end.Overall, the story is well filmed, and there are some truly unnerving scenes (my favourite involving a horse on a ferry), but there are too many unexplained plot features.

If you do some looking around for the original ""Ringu"" you'll see that they had to make a sequel to it (seemingly because there is enough story to keep going-I know I want to know more).

917,Mike72385,Greatest horror movie released in a long time.,9,21 October 2002,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have ourselves a horror movie. After watching The Ring I have just witnessed one of the most unique and best horror movies ever released. There isn't really anything bad about this film at all. It has every ingredient to provide chills, scares, and a great 2 hours of your time.First of all, I think The Ring had some excellent characters that brought the whole story together. I really liked the character of Rachel, mainly becuase of her persuasive and determined attitude through the film. Her son, I didn't care for becuase he seemed to be a rip off of Haley Joel Osmont's character in The Sixth Sense. Rachel's ex-husband Noah was a very captivating character and I could feel myself rooting for him throughout the film. Rachel and Noah had great chemistry.The story is extremely complicated, but once you figure it out, you see exactly how great and creative it is. The story is basically this. There is a video tape in which after you watch, you have exactly 7 days to live. Rachel's niece caught a viewing of the tape, and a week later she died. This gets Rachel's investigation going. After she views the tape, and gets her little phone call of her demise in a week, she goes to find things out before her time comes. That is all I can reveal without spoiling things in the movie. This film is very captivating and I know it had my attention throughout.The best thing about this film is the actual suspense and fear factor enclosed in it. There is a scene at the end which I can easily say is on of the most freakiest and scariest moments in horror film history. The whole film basically builds up to this and I have to say they did a hell of a job pulling this scene off. You will know exactly what I'm talking about once you see it. It will have you talking for days and days. You may even have nightmares as well. Also, the director really knows how to bring scares to the audience. Loud bangs, out of control animals, and grizley images of the little girl are some of the things that many people seemed to be scared of. The scares are evenly spread out through the movie adding surprise each time.Overall, I beleive the Ring is one of the best horror movies released in a very long time. I can't think of anything as unique and well made as this movie. I was captivated from the opening sequence to the credits. From an excellent plot, to a detective study of the tape, to one of the most terrifying scenes ever on screen, The Ring delivers. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone willing to to devote 2 hours of their time. It's one of the best horror movies ever released in my opinion. Watch The Ring and have fun!",The Ring

Also, if samara was causing all that trouble while dead in the well, then what does it mean when the little boy asks his mom, ""you didnt let her out did you?""

Naomi Watts does a mediocre performance in her lead role in this movie. The acting is sub par. The scenes in this movie where it's supposed to be scary are weak. Some scenes are scary and I do mean some, but the overall movie was weak. The plot of how she has to do research and the tv video tape thing is lame it is all lame and it gets boring and dry during the movie as well.

This is based not only on the comments posted, but on the fact that my spouse pretty strongly disliked this movie. All I can say is see the movie for yourself, and make your own decision.

924,novena,Very frightening - excellent atmosphere & symbolism (some spoilers),10,5 November 2002,"Last night I read another member's comments, which basically reduced The Ring to a series of cheap shots or 'jump out and scare you' moments. Nothing could be further from the truth.  I found it to be lastingly frightening - independent of those few adrenaline moments.  (I saw it on Saturday and I'm still counting my seven days!)A few 'scare you' moments -are- part the film, but they don't carry it. They're entirely appropriate and consistent with plot elements.  The last major one (with the TV) is completely earned and still gives me chills when I think about it.The real success of this film is in its repetition of symbolic elements, its soundtrack and its use of lighting.  These build an atmosphere of dread and hopelessness not unlike that found in films such as 8mm or Industrial Symphony No. 5, or even in an H. P. Lovecraft story.  Visually, it could be compared to some of Wyeth's darker paintings, or to one of Robert Rauschenburg's moodier ""combines"".In terms of plot, the film had set me up for a very serious disappointment in its first few scenes -- starting off with all the polished teen gloss of a Wes Craven type flick.  However, it diverged from that path rather quickly, leading instead to a storyline that used elements of, but completely subverted, the now thoroughly worn out 'heros put the ghost to rest' theme.  It's about time that someone did so, and did so well, in a major film.",The Ring

However, if you've seen those two films, all of the screenplay schemes in ""The Ring"" will look identical.  This film had solid intentions but the plot in and of itself was its achilles heal.

I am not much for horror movies but this one was MUCH different than the usual run of the mill Freddy-Jason slasher movies. BEWARE Spoilers below: Someone made a comment about the blurred photos and the horse having nothing to do with the plot. I disagree. The scenes with the horse were very important to the plot. The horse sensed the evil death ""spell"" that was cast upon Rachel after watching the video. I am not a horse expert but for whatever reason the horses sensed the evil. Remember that Samara cursed her mother the same way. Anna's(the mother) horses started going crazy and were dying/killing themselves. Remember that Anna eventually killed herself as well. It was reported a suicide in the newspaper articles Rachel found, but we now know she probably died the same way both Katie and Noah did. The blurred pictures happened only to those who were ""cursed"" from watching the video. It doesn't have any HIGHER meaning other than to show that it was one of the symptoms of watching the video.

931,FlawlessCritic,Without a doubt the Best Thriller of the year!,9,28 January 2003,"WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM!
This film was just brilliant. Opening night for this film I walked in the theatre knowing it was a thriller, but I did not expect to see the fantastic cinematography done in this film. As for some, I'm sure this was quite a scary experience and I admit I was scared quite a bit, but it was more of a psychological thriller than anything else. This film makes you think. It is up to you to follow through and figure out exactly what it is leading to. It was original and had a great plot indeed. The acting was done well and made you believe that the videotape has a curse and death will come upon you in 7 days. I love how it went day by day as Rachel(Naomi Watts) the newspaper reporter in this film, tried to figure out exactly what has been killing these teenagers.
This film is up there with The Others as one of the best and original screenplays of all time. Just as you think the movie is going to end with a nice hug and chat with Rachel and her husband another 10 minute scene comes along. The little girl Samara actually comes out of the TV screen and kills the husband. That just blew me away and I stayed with awe. How is it possible that she can come out of the tv screen. It will be explained most likely in The Ring 2. It is obviously impossible for a little girl to come out of a tv screen, but it made for great shock. To add to that many things that people did not understand will be revealed in The Ring 2 and thats the beauty. However, there were many things to understand in this film you just had to think hard. When the DVD comes out, I will be at Best Buy ready to buy myself a copy. For the Ring fans that will be buying a copy, make sure you buy 2 or you'll have 7 days. Excellent thriller in my opinion and I am a thriller maniac freak. I give this film a definite 4 stars out of 4. I'm a harsh critic with thrillers because I like originality, well done plot and good acting. So I definitely recommend this film to all Horror/Thriller fans and the DVD will be a must get.

Well worth going to the trouble of seeing the Japanese version instead, far scarier etc. Oh surprisingly the Japanese one has got real actors, as oppose the laughable acting in this one(yeh people in the cinema laughed at it). Japanese also develops the storyline better and more fully, and it will make more sense. Compare it to a fighting scene, e.g. US film is just another fighting scene(steven segal type thing), the Jap is the new matrix style, slo mo etc, fighting scene,  they both show a fight but matrix style is more enjoyable to watch and makes the character seem more skillful.Spoilers First it starts off with crappy acting. The girl did not look scary, Japanese girl made you scared. Some scenes were just a complete waste, added nothing really to the story, while leaving out big parts of the story which would have given the viewer a much better understanding. I didn't sense any sort of desperation, when her time was running out, or desperation for her child. That boy annoyed the hell out of me, basically 6th sense child.

The story was very close to the original and was very well represented on the screen. After watching the original again, I was disappointed to find that I didn't like it nearly as much.  The acting in the original seemed almost bland and timid compared to the remake and there were a few plot holes that I never noticed before.

But in a good way, luckily.I saw this film with a friend, at 01-03 am, on a winternight where the wind was blowing like crazy - all the ingredients to make this movie even more scary then it was build up to. All through the picture we just shouted ""OMFG, this is some scary s*it certainly is... I told one of my friends about it and she had to tell me to stop because the images she imagined was freaking her out. Pretty impressive, i must say.But anyways, i can highly recommend this film - even though it's not for people who aren't into horrormovies, or doesn't like psychological suspense.

I'll explain why this movie wasn't good to me. THIS WILL SPOIL THE END OF THE MOVIE AS I WILL MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT THE ENDING!1. This movie was in no way scary to me. You see some dead face for .5 seconds in two different scenes throughout the entire movie. That is not nearly enough to scare me or even entertain me. Maybe if they had like their hearts ripped out or there body was taken apart and like their bodies were hanging from a wall.2. The lapses between the two so called ""death scenes"". Waiting the entire movie to kill off one character. That is simply ludacris. Maybe if you found some pictures or something in a cabin that showed the high school students who had died in the beginning.3. Aiden ,or whatever the boys name was, did some stupid stuff throughout the movie. ""I couldn't sleep!"" What the hell kind of excuse is that. And why did he now so much about the girl.If I have some more time I might go over a few other details that annoyed me. I must say the ending was a little innovative but it seemed to make two mistakes. I would of enjoyed this movie more if after Naomi Watts and Noah (don't know actors name) the movie simply faded out and the credits began to roll. BUT, this didn't happen and the ending had Noah die and then they make a copy of the take and the movie ended. Well I think that the director should have went beyond that and had something more happen. I honestly have no idea what should of happened but there NEEDED to be something else to happen after that.Oh, yeah and the horse jumping off the boat was like the funniest thing I ever saw in my life. It was like just about to clear the railing and then it's back legs hit the railing and the horses face collides with the side of the boat. I was laughing for like three minutes!",The Ring
940,fbessoles,What a shame...,1,15 April 2003,"It has to be understood as an offense to any savvy viewer who caught the Japanese version of the movie, 'Ringu'.I am aware of the fact that US crowds do not go for movies that do not cast large-breasted blonde psychotic women, but this is a little far-fetched for this story. The movie is meant to be solely based on psychology thrills and brain scare. The American version of the movie does not help in this at all, as all goes into the image and the special effects. Event he plot has to be altered and worsened: the little boy becomes a depressed child with a 6th sense who calls his mom by her first name.Anyhow, you may go for the American remake if you are the kind to be scared by movies with subtitles. However, if you were delivered with a brain and some artistic sense, you'll go for 'Ringu'.",The Ring
941,cent_805690,scariest movie I've ever seen!!!,8,12 May 2003,"Hi there!!I watched ""The Ring"" for the first time a few months ago, and let me tell you, I got the scare of my life!  I went to go see it in the afternoon so that I could have a good night sleep, instead of waking up horrified from a dream the involved a gruesome little girl coming out of a tv, so that's why I went to go see it in the afternoon!When you see the movie, at first you think: ""Wow, that was freaky!"" after jumping up from your seat, but then, the movie has this way of sticking in your subconscious.  I couldn't even go by my TV at home after watching ""The Ring"" withought thinking about that little girl!  And man was I terrified! Even looking in one of my mirrors at home ( which looks like the same mirror that you see Samara's (the little girl) mother brushing her hair! No joke, it's a crazy coincidence! I almost flipped after realising it!) just gave me goosebumps!Because of that movie, I also experienced one of the most scariest moments of my life, what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth, I not just saying it so that I can make the movie look good or anything, but it's really scary, and just goes to show that the movie was so well maid, that it had that much of an impact on me!Ok, it's not that long of a story, all that happened, was that I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night (approx. 3:00 in the morning) and had a nose bleed! This was on the same week that I just watched the ring, as if it was one of those signs that I was going to die.  No this was not a dream, my brother ask me the next morning what I was doing up in the middle of the night!So anyway, very freaky! Just goes to show that the movie was extremely well made, and well acted.  I hope they come out with another one just like it!

Who's behind it? Who kills you? How can anyone detect when you are watching a videotape? Etc.., are many of the hundreds of questions you will be asking while you watch this movie.  The problem? By the time the credits have finished at the end of the movie, you still have many more questions than answers.  And the answers you have don't make much sense, and don't satisfy at all.This movie also does not deliver as many say or said it would in the are of being ""scary"" or a ""horror.""  All of the shocks and scares of the movie are in the style of the Sixth Sense.  Something scary doesn't necessarily happen, it just happens very quickly and loudly, and right in your face, usually proceeded by a silent build up.  There are a couple of those types of scares in this movie. Most, however, come by anticipation. Most hear so much about how ""freaky"" and/or ""scary"" this movie is, so they watch on the edge of their seats waiting for a scare, and a lot of the time a quiet scene is followed by something very loud happening in the next scene, something that is not scary at all.I give this movie ** out of ****, because it did have an entertaining idea, and wasn't total crap.",The Ring

Starring Naomi Watts as journalist Rachel Kellar and Martin Henderson as her ex-flame Noah.After Rachel's niece Katie dies mysteriously, Katie's mother asks Rachel to investigate. She soon discovers that 3 of Katie's friends are also dead, exactly a week after they shared a cabin and saw a videotape. Soon Noah and their son, Aidan (David Dorfman) are also dragged into it after Rachel watches the tape, giving her one week to unravel the mystery of the videotape.The movie doesn't give into cheap scares like killers jumping out at you, which unfortunatly leads people to think that it isn't scary when the frightening themes and images are what make it true horror. This movies is only slightly bettered by the original, but is still a great film.4/5 stars",The Ring

The Ring wasn't scary in the least, I didn't care about any of the characters, and I really couldn't have cared less about the dumb, meandering, and pointless story. I have seen four movies in the past two days that I never wanted to waste my time seeing. Now that I've seen them (Underworld, Scorpion King, The Ring, and 28 Days Later) I wish I would have stuck with my gut feeling and just not watched any of them.

949,nicksieb,the best thriller ever!!!,10,12 September 2005,"It was just a year ago when my eye caught a DVD called ''The ring'' in a Videoclub. I had heard a few things about it but I didn't think that it would be such a big deal. However, I decided to borrow and watch it. I was totally astonished. From the very beginning to the end credits I remained absorbed in the magic of this movie. Even though the plot is a bit complicated, it is imaginative and totally innovative that it can lure even the most demanding spectators. According to it, there is a videotape which if someone watches, he dies after seven days. Yeah, it may be unrealistic but very challenging as well. Isn't it? Furthermore, the direction was great.Gore Verbinski, the charismatic director of ''The ring'' managed successfully to create a gloomy atmosphere where horror and mystery are harmoniously combined. This whole situation provokes to the spectator a weird feeling of anxiety and fear for what is going to happen in the movie.Undoubtedly, the outstanding performance of Naomi Watts, who proved for one more time how talented she is, has a great impact on them too.In many cases, the spectator puts himself into her place and tries to answer the questions about the cursed videotape. The whole movie is a quest for the truth, an attempt to survive from the evil that seems to live in the tape. One of the best thriller ever, equal to the ''Silence of lambs'', with Jodie Foster, and ''Seven'', with Brad Pitt. Don't miss it!",The Ring
950,backd,"if you want gore, you picked the wrong movie",7,28 December 2003,"First, i have to mention that I haven't seen the original. So perhaps my view on this picture will be a tad more objective 'cos I won't compare it to Ringu.-might contain spoilers (and a lot of typo's)-Either way, i heard a lot of good things about this movie, so with high expectations I decided to watch it on a dark, cold winter night. The movie starts with two teens on the bed, talking bout this urban legend. My first impression was: oh god, not again. Now a killer with a mask will jump from behind the curtains and stab them both to death, right? Well..no!From the beginning there's this eery atmosphere and with a few (cheap) tricks the tension starts to rise till the end of this intro which leaves us with a riddle of what exactly happened. I almost pissed my pants after this first scene so the intro really set the mood.The story continues at a comfortable pace. Nothing drastic happens, but there's this constant creepy atmosphere and simple things like that red tree at the cabin, the bleeding noses, terrific camera-angles and loud sounds (read: noise) that just make you want to grab a pillow and hold it in front of your eyes.Till the 7th day, I can't tell anything bad or annoying bout this movie. But then they start messing things up. Rachel falls into the well, Samara grabs her hand and Rachel gets this vision of how things went. This part looks great actually, but then Samara comes to the surface. Bad move lads. Till that particular event, 'Samara' was a huge mystery: was samara really evil, how did she look like, etc. But here everything about this mystery goes to waste when Samara floats to the surface in, what seemed to me, a clumsy way.Well, from then on they think everything is solved and the party goes home. If they had ended the film here, that would have been a damn lame ending. So they put on this extra chapter in which the truth becomes clear to Rachel and the poor lad dies in a great scene (remember the fly that left the screen? Wow!) It's a nice turn in the story, but it feels artificial. They could have done a lot better job to add this extra part.Also, there are quite many `what if's like `what if the TV is really small so samara can't  crawl out' or `what if you're in this forest on the 7th with no TVs around you' etc.Despite the mediocre ending, I give this movie 7/10.PS: Nice acting from Naomi Watts",The Ring
951,megan140,One big let down,1,9 February 2007,"The plot was predicable and dull. Not the movie you want to see if you want to go see if you expect something good. The acting was okay but I wouldn't recommend the movie to any horror fan. You could guess the ending when the movie first started and everything in between was just to fill space. Everyone may say that this movie is so scary and full of suspense but if you're a real movie goer this movie it tasteless and dull. The Ring is a colossal waste of time and satellite frequency. Some of the actors over played their parts and some sounded like they were reading lines. The movie would have been better if those actors wouldn't have been in it.

Good scenario but it's unnecessary to think that I will be in a hurry to die after 7 days :)Good cast but perfect with NAOMI WATTS...At the end the scenario is summing up well but copying the tapes is a bit strange. Make-up is so good but I could not understand why the victims were like the zombies. It was made to give a horror mood to the onlookers.

This is by far the best mystery movie I've seen. Don't listen to the people that say this is a bad movie, I guarantee you that you'll love it! It's not like most scary movies you see, these days.

The 20 minutes at the start are brilliant, the director changed a few of the elements from the Japanese original for the better thanks of course to the higher budget. The end of the film is great too, one of the most inventive and genuinely frightening conclusions i have ever seen.Its these final exhilarating 20 minutes that almost make you forget about the painfully slow, dull and boring middle of the film. If ever a film has drawn attention away from what in the original was a great story this is it !!! Where as the Japanese version went by with a quick pace never dwelling on small details that have little bearing on the characters the Hollywood version labors over and over. I was honestly on the verge of tears when i thought the film was concluding.However, the ending saves what for first time watchers will agree was almost one of the biggest anticlimax's ever. All in all i can only say that if Hollywood script writers are struggling with the translation from japan to USA just set it in Japan. Better that than create a ridiculous insert in the storyline which not only bores viewers but at times makes no sense whatsoever.Is this film a horror ?..... yes ! is it scary ?..... not particularly ! 6 / 10",The Ring

Its almost like the writers were stretching for a plot and couldn't quite grasp how to draw the viewer into it including me. After about 30 min of this film I really found the only horrific part about it was it wasn't over yet.

I think this movie puts you in the chair and while you're watching it you just can't stand, the suspense is just to attractive because you want to know why are this things happening and edition makes you ask why or what is the real thing in the mind of this terrific girl. Of course I believe the movie will not end there, the sequel must put some pieces that lack in this movie because at the end you're still trying to understand some points. The symbolism of the ""tape"" is very good because through the movie all parts of the tape are appearing and those are the pieces of the life that the girl had till end.

Sure, the beginning and conclusion were great to watch, but not scary. The suspense at the beginning was well performed though, however, the movie is too predictable, typical horror film really. It also has a very strange storyline, and very unrealistic. I mean, if you watch a video tape, 7 days later a girl comes out your television and kills you, yeah, like that would ever happen in real life. Other horror films are more realistic, even if they're not scary (eg Scream, not so scary but you could be brutally murdered by a serial killer, can't you?)

959,paulstark_1980,"Japanese Classic, American Studio Tripe",1,24 March 2005,"I live in the UK and was glad to find something a little different.Hideo Nakata's 'Ring' was the first film I'd genuinely found creepy mainly due to the gradual build of suspense and the fact you were actually given some kind of atmospherics (rather than an American paint-by numbers or loud in-your-face horror).Gore Verbinski's remake does two things: 1) Scene by scene re-enactments of all the best moments of the original (with none of the same sensibilities or feel of the Japanese version). Basically it's Ring-Lite in terms of horror, but also it represents a case of trying to achieve ""more bang for your buck"" 2) Removes all internal logic present in the world of 'Ring'. What the heck was with the horses in 'The Ring' (2002)? At least Sadako's lineage (her mother has psychic abilities) goes some way toward answering questions posed by the events of the first film.I personally don't really like anything beyond 'Ring' & 'Ring 2'.'Ring 0: Birthday' humanised Sadako to such an extent, the character really doesn't scare me anymore. The mystery is gone and also I doubt anyone could fear her ever again.'Ring 2' was as far as it should have gone.No spin-offs, rip-offs or remakes.However, I await Nakata's US made 'The Ring 2' with a little more enthusiasm.

Everything in it just blends in so well together to create a subtle yet very frightening prospect of this genre. The cast was great in this - much better than the original Japanese version ""Ringu"". Naomi Watts is the perfect actress for Rachel Keller and Aidan was just plain freaky - the way he's supposed to be. Everything you wouldn't expect happens and the ending is twisted and equally disturbing. It just opens up a new idea for your imagination to scare the heck out of you. The story is told very well and added much more suspense than ""Ringu"". It should be R, not PG-13 because of the psychological level of disturbance.

965,zolicon,Very Americanized in a good way,6,30 June 2005,"I admit the American Ring is very faithful to the Japanese original one as I've seen the original one as a Japanese. Though it was very interesting that I didn't feel scared much comparing to the original one. That might be simply because that I knew the story already, but I would say the expression of horror is very different from Japaense way. As Japanese horror tends to hide the most scary part and let viewers expand their imagination to get scared, American version is more revealing the part you should get scared. The depiction of mother and child is also bit different and seemed very American to me. I thought it must be very hard to translate this Japanese way of fear into American way, but I think this gets really well translated in the end to the understandable Americanized version of the Ring.

The story line was spectacular about a girl who was murdered by a mother and used a video tape to get her revenge on society. You don't pay much attention to the acting in this film. Naomi Watt's son in the movie was very creepy however and he really stood out in my mind. The creepiest and positively the coolest aspect of this movie was the contents of the video tape like a woman brushing her hair, a ladder and a girl in a mirror. Only the ring can make the nicest things seem so horrifying. The girl popping out of the video tape and the phone ringing saying ""seven days"" helped the movie a lot too. The very beginning and the very end were the coolest parts of the movie. The only downside to this movie was that the entire movie wasn't plain horror and suspense.

968,brooktrout1,Simply one of best 4 or 5 horror flicks ever...,10,11 November 2005,"As an amateur film reviewer, I'm genuinely surprised by the number of individuals who rated this movie at an ""8"" or lower. Based on the very weird, surrealistic Japanese original, this film breaks the mold of the increasingly predictable, mega-redundant themes and settings of the horror genre in the US. Please... Visiting a good DVD rental shop with tons of horror flicks lined up together is truly depressing, so commonplace are nearly all productions from US companies.If one eliminates sci-fi ""horror"" films like the great ""Alien"" of 1979, then this film joins a very small select group, like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" the remakes of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" and then moves decisively beyond them into some yet-to-be-defined new departure of eclectic imagination. Sure, a few of the scenes really stretch all credibility (as the contrived survival of a key player in one of several sequential ""endings""), but the movement, complexity, and cast of characters in the work render this objection mostly innocuous. Strange, inexplicable occurrences simply remain flatly mysterious or ambiguous. The fly (not a spoiler). Yet the ""shocking"" scene in the scary, revelatory Edward-Munch-like house also shares in the tradition of somewhat conventional ""build-up"" scenes right out of ""The Thing."" Finally, unlike the wonderful ""gotcha"" resolution of ""The Sixth Sense,"" this film concludes with an ominously open-ended question, actually giving the culminating terror a palpable, horrifying moral dilemma that requires no sequel whatever. This is utterly unique. And it simply isn't what American audiences pay good ""horror"" money to see, on screen or video.If this isn't a 10, folks, then I'd like to know one that's been made in the past ten years.",The Ring
969,x-zombie_massacre,-cough-,7,18 December 2005,"I liked this movie. It scared the dook out of me and it still creeps me out when I think about it. Yet, there are some things that made me scratch my head. The little boy was too mature for my liking, and the other characters were somewhat cliché - A freaky killer who was a seemingly innocent child, the mother had a one dimension personality and was jam-packed with sarcastic comments, The ex-boyfriend -a non-believer turned believer when it was a bit too late, etc. Also, What if the person who was supposed to die wasn't at home or anywhere near a television set? What happens then? When you think about it, it is a little bit unrealistic that all of the 'video' victims just happen to be at home when they are supposed to die. Now, I kind of wish that someone could have died somewhere outside the home, it possibly could have made it a little bit more realistic.",The Ring
970,hannahzhao2003,"go see it, but don't see it right before bed time",9,7 April 2006,"this movie is really exciting to see and does not have much useless gory scenes for scaring the audience. all the thrill is from wanting to know how the movie ends and not from screaming and blood squirting all over the place. the audience mostly start to care about what happens to the characters. if you want to see major blood and screaming, this isn't the movie for you, but if you just want a thrill, this is a great movie. it is very scary lots of times and have special moments that you will remember for a long time. this movie would really be recommanded for watching with a bunch of friends on a rainy day. it would definitely give you a big scare, but with friends there, you probably won't have trouble sleeping. although, if you are the type of person that is very gullible, this movie probably have some moments that seem too realistic.",The Ring
971,jenzbabes,frightening,8,3 April 2006,"Did You Make a Copy? The Ring, directed by Gore Verbinski, redefines the horror storyline many people expect in movies today. This film is a remake of the Japan film The Ringu and exceeds it by far. The Ring is creepy, haunting, and mesmerizing all while staying within the PG-13 rating standards. Audiences leave the movie with a genuine feeling of fright and unease. The story follows a young woman and her son discovering a VCR tape which appears to be the cause of many frightening deaths, including the niece of the central character. After discovering her niece's boyfriend died the same night and in a similar fashion, Rachel (Naomi Watts) begins to question the nature of their fatalities. Her inquiries lead her to a mysterious tape she soon watches.Rachel then begins to research the origin of the tape, and discovers she is experiencing many of the same things she viewed on the tape. Her son Aidan (David Keller) and her close friend Noah (Martin Henderson) watch the tape also. The movie includes a viewing of the tape, and it is frightening. The images are disturbing, and the tape is grainy and surreal. It creates an overall feeling of fright. Rachel, Aidan, and Noah work towards discovering an answer for their impending deaths. This includes visiting a mental hospital and the area the tape was filmed at.The Ring is truly a unique viewing experience. I was scared of the dark for several nights after watching it. The movie depicts a frightening, unnerving story without using the usual amounts of blood, gore, and extreme frontal nudity-- all of which have become standard practice when creating a horror show. I believe this movie is astounding and should be regarded as a major motion-picture breakthrough. The Ring is in a genre of its own, delivering great screams and still staying easy on the stomachs of the viewers.",The Ring

973,cod-2,"Excellent, a rare gem for horror fans.",10,11 November 2002,"An English actor on his deathbed said, ""Dying is easy, comedy is hard."" I think doing good horror is much harder than comedy.  The makers of the Ring have succeeded in delivering a truly scary, well made movie.  What separates hype from substance is word of mouth and the grosses for this movie (15, 18.8, 18.5 and 16 in the first 4 weeks) show that people are telling their friends to see it.  And it is worth seeing.  Some critics have talked about plot inconsistencies and things left open.  They don't get it.  They're like country music fans listening to Bach.  It's the supernatural, it's not supposed to be explained completely and wrapped up in a neat little package like 99% of the formula crud that is shipped out of Hollywood.  It just has to stay true to itself within the four corners of the movie - and it does. Congratulations to Naomi Watts and the rest of the Ring cast and crew for pulling off a difficult task, an intriguing, well made, frightening picture that is worth seeing.

975,Helmy,The Ring vs. Ringu,10,6 November 2003,"I just don't understand people who say that The Ring was just a crap Hollywood remake or that it was remade as a movie for the teen slasher crowd. Did these people see the same movie I did? Apparently not. I have also noticed that whichever version people see first seems to be the one they prefer. I myself saw The Ring before I saw Ringu, and at the time I thought The Ring would be pretty hard to top. After seeing Ringu, I honestly don't see how the original is supposedly superior. While it is a good movie on its own, I found the remake to be much more effective. Here are some of the reasons (WARNING: Spoilers ahead):1. The atmosphere of The Ring was just dripping with dread and foreshadowing throughout. Ringu, by comparison, seemed much more calm and normal, which isn't exactly what I'm looking for in a horror film/ thriller.2. The characters and story seemed much more developed and fleshed-out in The Ring, particularly the characters and story of Samara and her parents, which made Samara much scarier, and all of them much more tragic. In Ringu, there was hardly any time given to the back story of Sadako or her parents at all, so they seemed much less developed, more two-dimensional, and in turn less scary.3. The dreaded videotape itself was longer, more fleshed-out, and far creepier in The Ring. Some of the same images appeared in both movies, but there just seemed to be a lot more going on and a lot more disturbing content in The Ring's version. Ringu's version was very short by comparison, with almost none of the dread or impact. The ""ring"" itself - the lid of the well as seen from beneath - was barely even visible in Ringu. In The Ring it became an effective visual motif.4. The production values in The Ring were much better than in the original, lending so much more to the atmosphere. Of course this is where many accuse it of being ""too Hollywood"" or too slick. If adding a lot of atmosphere through cinematography and some minor digital effects is ""Hollywood-izing"" it, then in this case it's a good thing. The horrific effect shown on the first victim, the little touches like the strange video fly, the extended surrealistic scenes in the video, the lone red tree, and the scene where Samara comes out of the TV with digital enhancements, are all fairly minor things that really added quite a bit to the atmosphere, and in turn to the movie's effect on me. In Ringu, the ""film negative"" effect that's shown when the victims meet their fate is rather cheesy and not scary at all.The only complaints I have about The Ring are the exaggerated creepiness of the boy and the over-the-top death scene of Samara's father. But those are easily overlooked annoyances. I honestly don't see how the remake plays to the teen slasher crowd. To me this was anything but that. It was one of the most intelligent, effective, and freaky movies I've ever seen, and it should be applauded for that. Pre-conceived notions, expectations, and prejudices from other movies should be left by the wayside when judging this excellent movie. Watch it with an open mind, and you won't be disappointed. While it didn't give me nightmares, it certainly got under my skin and gave me the heebie-jeebies for a few days afterwards.",The Ring
976,Rexy-2,"Nothing comparing to the original ""Ringu""",6,15 July 2003,"""The Ring"" is a re-make of a popular Japanese horror movie, ""Ringu.""  I watched ""Ringu"" first, and I still find it scary after watching it more than ten times.  So I went to watch the American version with high hope, and unfortunately, though predictably, it turned out to be a complete let down. The atmosphere of the original version, which was what made the movie oh-so scary, was almost completely wiped out in the American version by all the visual and sound effects.  In fact, the quietness in the Japanese version creates the atmosphere and gives you an extra level of horror because you just don't know what to expect next.  (SPOILER) I just can't stand the fact that in ""The Ring"", the TV chases Naomi Watts and pushes her into the well.(END SPOILER)I'll recommend ""The Ring"" to those of you who haven't watched either version.  If you've watched ""The Ring"", I strongly recommend you to watch ""Ringu"" as well.  If you've watched ""Ringu"" but not ""The Ring,"" don't bother.  It's nothing comparing to the original one.",The Ring

978,ReineL,Hollywood does it again...,5,31 December 2002,"Hollywood does it again; botches another remake. Well, almost. If you don't know it already, this is a remake of the Japanese movie Ringu from 1998. And a pointless remake at that. Sure, the effects are better, but that's to be expected as they probably had ten times the budget.The story is simple, yet intriguing. A couple of teenagers have died. Separately, but all at the same day, and at the exact same time. Rachel Keller starts investigating the events and finds out that they had all been in a cabin watching a videotape seven days earlier, and as rumour has it; everyone that watches that tape, dies seven days later.My recommendation is to see the original, Ringu. As least start with that one and watch this afterwards, if you must. I saw Ringu about 2 months ago, and in my opinion it was darker, scarier, and made me think more. The remake does the classic Hollywood thing; they explain too much as if we, the audience, as incapable of independent thought. I like a movie that makes me think, and leaves me wondering a bit. That's always a good reason to see a movie for a second, or third time.But, honestly, I can't be sure what I would have thought if I had seen The Ring before Ringu.Anyway, if you don't have some strange phobia about seeing subtitled movies, try to get hold of Ringu, Ringu 2 and the prequel Ringu 0: Baasudei (Birthday).

981,cason444,Bucking the trend,9,2 May 2003,"The Ring has finally bucked the trend, started by The Sixth Sense, of trying so hard to have a surprise ending that you write yourself out of a decent story. The great mystery writers of the past never lied to you about which person committed the murder, they convinced you that you didn't need to know who did it until the end of the book, this is the best way that I can explain the way that The Ring redefines the budding modern horror/thriller/mystery genre.I felt that, after The Sixth Sense, M. Night was trying too hard to do something special, and lost sight of filmmaking. This is also true with alot of lesser filmmakers who have tried to make a decent entry into this genre.

No matter how many times you watch the movie you wont ever figure it out. Movies are fine that leave it open for you to make up the connections or to figure out but good luck on this one.

I've read a lot of people complaining about plot holes, or things ""not being explained,"" but I felt like the movie operated on its own sort of nightmare logic.

I would say I'm pretty jaded with scary movies and don't get scared easily anymore, but I still watch them for the fun. I rented Ringu and watched it alone one night. And it creeped the hell out of me. Since then, I've recommended it to everyone I know. It's not at every video store, so you'll have to search for it. In SF, it's at LeVideo. Anyway, I was excited about the remake, esp. since it was starring one of my new favorite actresses, Naomi Watts. I was kind of upset of the PG13 rating. Well, I can tell you...it was still creepy, very faithful, and a job well done. I hope it becomes a huge hit, it deserves to be seen by a lot of people, and that it doesn't get ignored. The filmmakers should be very proud. As in the original, there is no blood, no gore, just images and trippy visuals that will make you look in awe and mezmerize you. You're involved right away in this tape and you want to know what it's all about.  Not all remakes are good at all, this one is really really good. I hope you all see it.

Some of us were convinced to skip class to see this movie, and they were truly regretting it.  It takes a pretty awful movie to have a person wishing he were in class. The only thing effective in this movie were the ""shockers""--the cut to scenes that began with a loud noise.  At least i jumped.  Otherwise this was a moronic movie with a convoluded storyline that made no sense.  And as others have noted, the ending was so completely forced that i wanted to force a pencil through my head.  So completely forced that i felt the need to use a stupid play of words. The sad thing was that the movie had true potential.  But all it did was sit in front of me saying, ""Hello, i'm a psychological thriller.  I want to play with your head and make you scared.""  But it takes more than that to scare a person. Just as in some suspensful movies, the suspenseful moments are overplayed to the point that they aren't truly suspenseful.  The Ring suffered this same problem: scary moments were so played up that they ceased to be scary and caused me to laugh. To be honest the acting is really not too shabby.  Its good, really.

Then later they showed a bridge that she is driving across to get to the island and it was Deception Pass Bridge and I screamed because it is a landmark of Whidbey Island.

It was good precisely because it didn't attempt to shock you at every turn but rather crept up at you and made you feel thoroughly uncomfortable. (In a good way.)

997,feline_of_avenueb,Terrible. Here is why,1,19 July 2006,"I am a great lover of Japanese horror and therefore find this American Adaptation of The Ring truly awful. They changed the storyline and although clearly this can be a good thing to play around with originality wise, they changed parts to something totally irrelevant and slowed down the whole pace.Not only this but Asian films don't rely on scary music playing every 5 seconds (which in American horrors ruins it anyway as it tells you whew to prepare for a 'scary' moment), rather than the surprises you get from the original and far superior Ringu.This American version has to spell out every bit of the plot with totally unnecessary dialogue to explain the story, whereas the clear symbolic images in the Japanese version is enough. It allows cognitive pleasures from the audience and does not spoon feed or treat the audience like they are totally stupid.I felt the young boy was represented in a far too 'mature' way in the way the part was acted and scripted. The younger innocence of the boy in Ringu makes parts far more sinister. There is a long list of reasons this version is awful, I have merely listed a few. Clearly no remake can live up to the original of anything, however there are many ways they could have improved this version and not make it the trash that it is.",The Ring

I would recommend to watch the plot about it on YouTube first, so you will understand more background information.The way the story is being told is very similar to ""The Grudge"". One person researches about the life of the antagonist and by doing that the story unfolds itself, bit by bit. In ""The Ring"" though, this happens in a much bigger extend. You get a lot more to explore and research, together with the protagonist. More people. More places. Things which are untold. And this is what makes the story even more interesting than ""The Grudge"" in my opinion.I would very recommend this movie if you are rather looking for a deep spooky story instead of a pure jumpscare-movie.

Plus, it had other elements I liked.While the story's basic premise was sound, the script could have used work: primarily, I would have preferred a ""deeper"" storyline for Samara, the Morgans in general and the circumstances surrounding Samara's ""partial"" demise. I also thought it got a bit slow in places, and seemed to ""jump"" at points. I also wasn't too thrilled that Amber Tamblyn, one of my favorite young actors, got knocked off so early, but that's more personal than anything.Naomi Watts turned in an excellent performance as did Brian Cox, who was quite believable in his role as the troubled and disturbed patriarch of the Morgan clan. Young David Dorfman's performance was eerie (which is good for a horror film). The only downer (if you could call it that) was Martin Henderson's performance - though it wasn't ""bad"", I felt they could have found someone a little better to take the role of Noah.Nice touches: the ""countdown""; Samara's ""look""; Rachel's initial belief that 'all is well' when, in fact, it wasn't, followed by her subsequent (failed) race to get to Noah; and the scene at the very end showing resulting circumstance driving the ""good guys"" (Rachel and Aidan) to not be so good.While ""The Ring"" doesn't come up to the level of many other horror-thrillers, there are just as many worse ones, and worse ways to spend an evening (...or late night...).",The Ring

1003,niv_14,Why this movie is crap,1,24 January 2007,"First of all, as it was said before, this movie is a remake of the excellent Japanese movie ""Ringu"" by Hideo Nakata. I saw ""Ringu"" several years ago and really enjoyed it. So when I heard about this American remake I was expecting the worst, and sadly, I was right. ""The Ring"" isn't worth ""Ringu"". It's just crap compared to it, and above all, it's not scary an inch ! ""Ringu"" is really scary, but this remake has lost all that made ""Ringu"" so good. The work that Hideo Nakata made on ""Ringu"" is pure genius, whereas ""The Ring"" is just another bad Hollywood horror film with only a bit of originality since the story is Japanese. The music that tells you when it's going to be ""scary"" before it happens..., the same shots seen a thousand times as in all Hollywood horror films..., the roughness, the crudeness, and the gore effects that are supposed to be terrifying..., this is only a glimpse of what makes ""The Ring"" so dull and stupid. Of course if you haven't ever seen any Japanese horror film and only know the Hollywood turkeys, you may find ""The Ring"" scary, but it's nothing compared to how terrifying you'll find ""Ringu"". Watch ""Ringu"" and you'll see what Hollywood can't do and why Hollywood horror films are so pitiful compared to the Japanese ones. I therefore strongly not recommend ""The Ring"", and recommend instead the brilliant ""Ringu"".",The Ring

What was really scary about it, was when some of the scenes struck without any warning! Man ! When I watched it it gave me the chills and also, whenever the phone rang after I watched the movie, I always jumped and got those flashbacks !Oh God I even brought the movie, but in my opinion, The Ring was better than The Ring two. Because the first one was more creepy, more real. And no doubt about it that The Ring was better than Ringu!!! The video tapes were totally different, like The Ring had more scenes and details, but in Ringu shows like six scenes. Come on people!!!! This is Hollywood!!",The Ring

1011,bisaid-32402,The Ring,10,2 November 2021,"The Ring, filmed in 2002 is a horror movie about an urban legend involving a mysterious video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it. This movie is great because it is not like other horror movies, it's a different type of horror, psychological horror. This is not like Halloween or Friday the 13th where there is a mass murderer, Samara (the killer) gets in your head to mess with you mentally before killing you. Pictures, and videos of a family of three including Richard, Anna, and their adopted daughter Samara are shown on this murderous videotape. Samara was a mentally ill child, who had serious issues, mostly because the family had multiple horses on their farm that were very loud and kept Samara awake at night. After Samara had gone crazy due to sleep deprivation, Anna and Richard had enough of her. The farmers had no choice but to kill their daughter by throwing her down a well. The only source of light visible from inside the well was a ring that was made from the lid of the well not being big enough to cover the top fully. Samara lasted 7 days before dying in the well. Many years later, Samara is mentally insane, she has a bonanza by psychedelically torturing people who watch the tape for 7 days before killing them. Cutting to the actual story, a news reporter named Rachel Kelly had a niece who had watched the tape with her boyfriend on a trip to Shelter Mountain, 7 days later she was presumed dead. Rachel didn't know how she died so she looked through her niece Katies notebook and saw a photo of her at the Shelter Mountain Inn from a few days before she died, naturally Rachel thought to go investigate the Inn. Rachel found the videotape, she watched it and brought it to her son Aidans father Noah the next dayNoah is g. Noah thought the video couldn't have killed the teenager, but he agreed to help collaborate with Rachel in order to solve the mystery anyways. Noah is good with tech, so he helped her get pictures of what was on the videotape to figure out what it was that was killing people. Once they found out the Morgans were the family in the tape they searched them up and found that they had a daughter named Samara. The two searched the landmarks in the video until they found themselves on Moesko island, where the Morgans farm is located. Once they learned what the Morgans had done to Samara, they wanted to help her by confronting her dad because her mom had died. Rachel helped Samara, but it turned out to be a costly mistake. Samara had been connecting to Rachels son the whole time and she said she didn't want help. ""Why did you do that?"" ""You weren't supposed to help her"". At the end, Samara killed Noah for trying to help her. Ehren Kruger, the writer did a fantastic job creating this amazing psychological horror movie, and really getting in your head. The director, Gore Verbinski brought Ehren Krugers ideas to light by adding more to the film than just the plot. Verbinski added the small details that make horror what it is, like the photos, flashbacks and scenes of the Morgan family displayed through the movie, that help the storyline greatly. The producers, Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes did a magnificent job hiring the perfect actors for the roles of Rachel (Naomi Watts) and Aidan Keller (David Dorfman), Noah (Martin Henderson), Samara (Daveigh Chase) and Richard (Brian Cox and Anna Morgan (Shannon Cochran). The Special effects editor Burt Dalton also did a spectacular job at making certain scenes look glitched with discordant sounds. The film editor Craig Wood did a great job editing flashbacks to overlap the scenes, and he put all the pieces of the puzzle together to make a well-rounded movie. The director of photography Bojan Bazelli did a great job creating dark photos and videos to use as the flashbacks and scenes from the film. Production designer Tom Duffield did an exceptional job creating the mellow forest and lonely island settings for this movie. The sound director Tim Holland did a good job creating the perfect eerie soundtrack for this movie. The setting of this movie takes place in Seattle, Washington, In 2002. The point of view is through the action so once something happens, the audience knows fully what is happening. Overall, The Ring is a great movie that made a big impact on the future of the psychological horror genre. If you are going to watch a horror movie a great option is The Ring.",The Ring
1012,pavlov-1,Great story which doesn`t live out of its effects,10,1 February 2003,In spite of great effects the movie builds up a tension which does not depend on effects or the spread of blood. There should be more movies like that with such a plot and creativity. That`s what makes this movie special. The reason for that may also be because the original was made in 1914 when special effects were not as available as they are nowadays.  I'm fed up with Hollywood-bulls**t and was very impressed to see something positive coming out of this machinery for making dumb people even more dumb. This movie represents everything what I expect from a horror. It gives you the creeps in every single scene. Great!!!,The Ring
1013,bf001k,You liked this movie why???,3,31 January 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I saw The Ring twice in the past week, hoping that the second time would change my opinion of it.  If you haven't seen it yet, and would like to pay money to be disappointed, stop reading here to avoid the ***SPOILERS***Unfortunately The Ring tried to give a complex plot to a dull shock movie. It certainly made me think, but the more I thought about it, the more questions arose:1)The end reaveals that Samara comes to kill her victims through the TV 7 days after watching the tape, but how did she kill the two teenagers who were driving in the car?2)It is established throughout the movie that Samara never sleeps, but Aidan tells us that ""the horses keep her up at night.""  Since she never sleeps, this wouldn't be a problem.3)When Aidan  watched the tape, the end shows Samara's arm coming over the top of the well.  This is not on the original tape, as this is the beginning of Samara's appearance when she comes to kill her victims.
4)The end of the movie implies that copying the tape (and showing it to someone else) saves you from death on the 7th day.  Rachel had already made a copy and Aidan had seen it by the time she and Noah are in the cabin. But the TV turns on and the water appears, signaling Samara's appearance, which should not happen if copying was actually the immunity from the certain death.I know there were other points that bothered me in this movie, but I have tried to put them out of my mind, and have included the biggest ones here. For a horror movie, I enjoyed the shock scenes and overthetop settings, but the plot too obviously paves the way for a sequel... The End? (sigh)",The Ring

Normally I just love horrorflicks like the exorcist and even the bad made ones such as Braindead and Bride of Re-animator because I think they are so over the top that they become a amusing movie. But this movie isn't scary or funny at all. In the first sequence I was thinking: hopefully it gets better (it was sooooooo to obvious) but helas, it only gets worse!

I think I was misled by the previews or just knew too little to have much expectations. The movie turns out to be remarkably fresh and clever in it's story telling. The cinematics are done so well and the themes are kept true throughout the film.  It's not a masterpiece in the acting department but Naomi Watts is turning out to be one to watch and the acting from David Dorman (the child) left chills running down my spine.  Everything from the soundtrack to the sound effects were all top notch.  I honestly don't think I've ever seen so many people jump from such simple, yet well-placed, well-timed sound effects.  As far as the plot of the movie goes, it's up there with some of the greats in the same genre (Sixth Sense, Dark City and Memento).  I actually enjoyed the entire story and believe that the producer of the film did an excellent job bringing it to the big screen.  I've been recommending this film to many of my family and friends for it's a fitting late October release.  If you enjoy thrillers even a little or are looking for something different from your typical slash-horror films, go see this film as soon as you can.",The Ring

I have seen some bad ones in my days (Tremors 3, 13 Ghosts, etc) but this one definately takes the top 3 worst movies ive ever seen. There are so many things that could have been better had the director been talented. First off, the storyline is riddled with useless characters, the photographer's girlfriend, the stranger on the street that meets eyes with the kid once and dissapears, the teacher, both girls at the beginning and most of the others.

When I was watching I could see the genius at work, the close ups of Samara's ripped fingernail beds, and her water logged toes. Oh and don't forget the tape! The disturbing objects in her ""loft"" and the insects were just the best cinematography I probably I have seen in my life. Also the fuzzy television was lovely, and killing people by scaring them, brings a new freshness into the movie world. I just have to say that no movie makes me want to be smothered and pushed down a well like this one!!! Samara Morgan will become one of the classic horrifying murderers with her counterparts: Michael Meyers, Jason, Freddy Krueger, and Leather Face. Everyone should experience this amazing work, it is the best I have seen in years. All I want to say is that wearing a stained white gown and having Maryjane's that are too tight is the hottest look, of the season, can you say Fall 2008!

1018,Nadya629,"Most suspenseful, least bloody horror movie since the original Halloween",9,26 September 2002,"The Ring is, in my opinion, the most suspenseful, least bloody horror movie since the original Halloween.  Quick synopsis: a journalist's niece dies and in the course of trying to find out what killed her, discovers a videotape that, once viewed, seems to cause the death of the viewer one week to the moment of viewing.  The journalist (of course) views the tape, and then has 7 days to discover the origins of the tape and end the ""curse.""  From the hair raising opening when the niece's friend tells the ""urban legend"" of the tape to just about the end, this movie is very well put together, leading us from one discovery to the other, and leaving no unanswered questions that I noticed.  My only quibble is with the last two seconds of the movie.  I thought they were cheesy.  Overall, a really good movie.  See it.",The Ring
1019,alektorophobic,I haven't covered my eyes at the movies in a long time...,10,18 October 2002,"...and I'm not saying that in a negative sense. The Ring, a remake of a popular Japanese horror film, is about a mother/reporter who looks into the mysterious death of her young cousin and four of her friends. Their deaths are rumored to be because they watched a video tape, after which they had seven days to live. Following their tracks, Rachel (played by Naomi Watts), comes upon the tape, and after watching it, begins to believe in its myth. Now she has seven days to solve the mystery behind the tape, before it claims her life.There's more to it than this, of course. Rachel has a son who seems to have some semi-telepathic abilities. She also gets help from Noah, a photographer, and father of her child. Other than that, I don't want to give away any of the movie's secrets.The Ring is quite good at making you jump. Some may call them cheap thrills, but there's more to it than that. The days seem to fly by so fast, you're really counting the time left when suddenly the next freaky thing occurs and makes you shift in your seat. At several points, I covered my eyes because, I knew I was going to jump, and I really didn't need more nightmares tonight. I haven't covered my eyes for a movie in a long time.So, is it as good as the original? I think so. I love the original, but at the same time, there's just something cleaner about this version. Things not explained in the original are clarified here. The ending is not as creepy, but it is creepy in its own different sense. Go see it if you liked the original. Go see it if you like being scared. I'd go see it again, but not alone.",The Ring

Unfortunately, people immediately feel the need to find every scene in the movie that was remotely similar to another film. Good directors borrow, great directors steal, right? Right. Anyway, aside from a few overdone scenes and contrived scares, the Ring is a competent remake of the original. The main problem lies in why a remake was made in the first place. For money, I know. This is a shame. Read: There were no holes in the plot. Anyway who disagrees, please email me and I will explain. Just because you didn't get it doesn't make it a bad movie.The American additions to the screenplay tend to hand hold a bit too much but American audiences are stupid, right? I jest. This film is well ahead of the majority of horror/thrillers hitting the screens lately.I hope it does quite well. The genre needs a boost. It is worth your money and time.",The Ring

Now, being 13 years old, I recently re-watched this movie, and it still scared the living daylight out of me, it is just one of those movies that really creep you out. The scene that will always really scare me are when the mom is talking to Rachel (Naomi Watts), and she says ""I saw her face"", and then, out of nowhere, they show her dead body, oh my god, that just really got to me.

And Japanese version better"" I think in this film the action is not main thing but only a scene,space. And main in this film I think is to show people, their relations...to help people became a bit kinder. And this film shows this. In this film Samara wasn't an absolutely evil. She had some singularities. And her adoptive parents put her into psychiatric hospital where she was alone for many hours, she lived in a stable and in the end her adoptive mother broke her in the well. As for me it is a enough reason to take offense. Some people write that it is very non-original and stupid story and many films has story like this. Yes this story is very simpler than story in book of Koji Suzuki. But main mean of this is not a difficult, long and very interesting criminal story. Americans when they were making this remake they didn't understood this idea. They tried to make a very scary film. So they put this in their film (this history is modified history from book of Koji Suzuki) but their main intensification was directed to make a good action. So this film has a good history of Samara with bad and stupid history of Rachel and company.",The Ring
1024,ianblanchard,The Sixth Sense meets The Others,9,4 November 2002,"As I read some of the comments that are posted I notice all the negative comments about character development and plot holes and not understanding the story. Did it ever occur though that perhaps the movie is exactly doing to some of the viewers what it was supposed to, baffle you.*****SPOILERS**** If some of you are having a hard time trying to understand the plot I will break it down simple for you. The little girl herself is not evil, she is a manifestation of evil. She knows what she has done and continues to do is wrong and she says she is sorry but cannot stop as this is also explained by Aiden when he informs his mother she will not stop, she cannot sleep. A lot of you wonder why Rachel lives, its not because she heard the story fully, or because the little girl touched her. No its more simple than that. The little girl has designed the tape as recordings of her mind and that is why there is no tracking #. It is simply a chain letter effect that keeps Rachel alive as is revealed in the last seen. She wonders what she did different and realizes, she made a copy and showed it to someone else. Therefore she makes her son touch the buttons to make a recording and show it to someone. In that case the someone is us at the end as it goes full screen. Also the director has hidden several ring flashes in the movie. Perhaps the most effective is a large ring in the middle of the screen that flashes for about a tenth of a second right after the horse over the boat scene. Watch carefully.Overall there have been too many in depth opinions about this movie. It is an excellent suspense film. It was not supposed to be a drama or romance film so don't try to over critic it as such. I recommend this to only those who truly believe they can handle an intense movie and will expect nothing more than a great suspense.",The Ring

Naomi Watts sizzles and gives a performance as equally impressive as her previous effort in ""Mulholland Drive.""  The cinematography is also fairly impressive.

I know it's just a typical scary movie.  I think the reason I am still mad about it is that somany people encouraged me to go see it and it has made way too much money for the quality. Maybe if I was a girl in junior high or something, I MIGHT like it then.  Too slow, too ridiculous, and too annoying for me.  My fellow IMDB voters- I know the only reason this is getting such a high voting is b/c of blurred vision and people who don't know movies like ""we veteran"" movie goers do.  To all of the ""amateurs"" who also probably liked kung pao of supernova:  stop voting- you are ruining the prestige and honor of IMDB and the rest of the ""casablanca"" top of the class movie guru's.Thank You...I feel so much better now.",The Ring
1037,kaiv,one of the worst remakes of a film i have ever seen,1,15 March 2003,"The original (Ringu) was not bad, i gave it a 8/10 for an interesting plot, but this remake is really one of the worst i have ever seen. Imho even the special effects were better in the japanese version. And don't say i am just one of those moviefreaks who like boring and slow classics, the remake of Stanislav Lem's Solaris for example was quite enjoyable, giving a new perspective to the movie and i really recoommend watching both of the movies. When it comes to the ring/ringu my only advice is don't watch the ring before you have seen ringu, the original maybe slower and harder to understand but it has a LOT more to it. Watch the content of the killer-tape in Ringu and compare it to the content in The Ring ;) that should say it all.",The Ring

I got to watch it the other night on DVD (advantage of working at Blockbuster).  Three in the morning was a bad time. The movie does have a great story to it, though.  And the visuals are scary, the sound is scary, the story is scary...I don't spook easily, but damn!  So one would think that, after being so damn scared, I'd swear it off.  Of course not!  I want to buy it so I can see the special features (I was too scared to watch them), it had DTS sound, which I think would give me a heart attack, and I want to watch the original Japan version, Ringu.  I didn't rent it because I didn't realize what it was, but as soon as I can, I'm watching it.  And I want to track down the sequel/prequel to Ringu, thoughtfully titled Ringu 2 and Ringu 0, respectivly.Watch this movie.  Just not alone.",The Ring

I am obviously not the only person to review it and I'm sure you will take my words with a grain of salt.  Regardless, I still feel obligated to say my peace.  I will not go into the specific details as to whether you should see it or not. I don't know your tastes.  All I can say is I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It made the hair stand up on my neck in many instances, and regardless of any plot holes, that's essentially the point of horror movies. How often do horror movies have an air tight script?  Does that add to the joy and campiness of scary movies?  Perfection is a feat rarely achieved regardless of any genre.  I will not reveal anything, just don't attempt to make the movie something it isn't.  Just go to get creeped out and realize that senseless scare tactics are often thrown only to assist the plot at moving along.  This movie has an intensity and creepiness about it and it's the idea that really matters.  I also loved how this movie didn't crap itself out at the end like most new horror movies.  Yes, the middle ran drab and gave you a sense of deceiving finality, but it ripped that from our hands and redeemed itself with a genuine classic ending.  This movie was consistent straight through.  Yes, it had it's problems, but so does every movie and if you pick apart this movie; or any for that reason. I can't imagine what you deem as good.  If you like horror movies (this is a statement only for the truest fans) then you should enjoy this movie.

So maybe the reason for my dismay is that I actually did not want to watch a horror / psycho flic, but even if I would have wanted to this movie would have certainly disappointed me. There is no logic behind the movie whatsoever. All it does is steal some ideas of other movies (all genres) and meet every cliché there is in the horror genre. And instead of ending at an acceptable 80 minutes, it drags on and on. SPOILER: Having almost reached the end, you think ""okay, at least it has a decent ending with the bad dreams of that spooky girl in the well finally gone"" and then it -like so many other horror flics- still continues and gives us an open end, ready to make a sequel if necessary. All I can say is: please don't! I am not an avid fan of the horror genre, but still I think that I can say this one is really really bad.

It's subtle, and if you go in expecting a slasher film or a gore-fest, you will be disappointed.  If you're in the mood for creepy, suffocating dread and horror infused into everyday objects, then go see it.A lot of people who prefer the Japanese original say this version explains too much; some Americans say it doesn't explain enough.  It doesn't come right out and explain everything, but the answers are there if you look.I saw this movie at a 1:30 matinee, and halfway through, I had completely forgotten that the sun was shining outside.  And when I left the theater, the sunlight seemed utterly irrelevant to what I'd witnessed.

Even if LOTR: TT or HP: COS comes out, I predict that this movie will create more gross!Many people know that this movie was actually originated from the Japanese movie ""Ringu"", which was based on a novel series (Also named ""Ringu"") In 1999, Korea made a re-make of this thriller ""Ring"" I watched Ringu at least 4 times and Ring 2 times, and I find that The Ring is much more scarier. I'm not trying to be degrading anyone, but I think that the original wasn't really as creepy as the Korean version. The Korean version was also really crappy. And after that, Ringu 2, Ringu o: Bassudai, and Ring: Rasen was also a chilling series that left me out cold. I don't know, but in my opinion, Asian countries (Well I AM Korean myself, so I'm just referring to our wrongs) try to make it TOO terrifying. But the American Version is sooo much more honest and believable.If The Ring was this good, I can't wait for its sequel (The Ring 2), prequel (The Ring 0: Birthday) and its epilogue (The Ring Rasen/Loop) America made some crappy horror movies, but The Ring... just try not to get a heart attack!!!",The Ring

I have not seen the Japanese original or sequels, but the American version ranks as the best horror movie ever for me.  Lacking the cheese and stupidity of gore-filled slasher flicks, but packing the serious punch of terror that even good suspense/thrillers miss, ""The Ring"" breaks new ground in western cinema.  While a few of the plot details may be puzzling, watching this film is such a powerful visceral experience that you can't and won't be bothered by them.  I found ""The Ring"" to be completely engrossing and ultra-creepy, and I left the theater feeling totally impressed and a little out of breath.  Not since I watched ""The Exorcist"" on TV at a far too young age has a movie so effectively gotten under my skin.  Hats off to Gore Verbinski for a rare achievement.

What we are left with is a very formulaic thriller that offers nothing new to the genre.  Even though THE RING has elements from every recent horror film from THE SIXTH SENSE to SESSION 9 to 13 GHOSTS, it still manages to keep the audience entertained and on the edge of their seat.  As is typical with these films, the best moment is in the last minute of the film and there is a lot of the BOO!!! scares that seem to come out of left field, but you know they are coming.

1051,yevgeni,In seven days...,9,18 April 2003,"I'm glad I could make it home safe after watching ""The Ring"". The movie itself was not that frightening but the ending was so stunning and scary, I walked out of the cinema like a ghost with my eyes opened unusually wide. Not easily scared by movies,  I don't know how much time will it take until I touch a video tape again. The movie is about this mysterious video tape, that whoever watches it, gets an immediate phone call where he's being notified about his death in seven days. If he or she doesn't believe it, well, they will one week later, after experiencing one absolutely terrifying encounter with a TV. But if he DOES believe it, he will try to prevent his own death, exactly what Naomi Watts' character, Rachel, did in the movie. This was the was the first time I saw Naomi in a movie and I was definitely impressed by her performance. Being a professional reporter, Rachel has no problem breaking into strange people houses, killing horses, stealing things - the usual stuff reporters do, but this time not only for the article in a newspaper, but also for her and her ""family"" lives.  David Dorfman plays Rachels son, unsuccessfully trying to make the second Haley Joel Osment, but he definitely brings some thrilling, unforgettable lines(""Don't You get it, she never sleeps"").  Daveigh Chase, the voice of Lilo in ""Lilo & Stitch"", plays exactly the opposite role here in a performance that would even scare the hell out of Stitch himself. Gore Verbinski , the director, makes it up here for his disastrous ""The Mexican"". Hopefully, he's on the right way. Go see this movie.

From the first 10 minutes of the movie your heart rate jumps to 160 and stays there for the next two hours. This movie stands alone as one of the scariest movies I've seen. Everything a good horror movie needs, this has. Note: it's not at all a slasher filled with mindless gore but an extremely well thought out screenplay.  Naomi Watts performance is as riveting as it is different from her character in ""Mulholland Dr"". Unusually, out of the entire cast there was no weak link. Every one gave a strong, believable performance. This movie is definitely one of the better movies of the year.

It's a very good story (completely with deeper meanings and all), but I think that the strength comes from the visual interpretation.  De shots are beautifully filmed (f.e. on the island), the sound is excellent (f.e. the scene with the horse on the ferry) and the scary moments are surprising.  I really appreciated the subliminal effects (the ring is seen for a fraction of a second) as the film proceeded.  It's like you (as an audience)are a victim as well: you have seen the video, and as the days go by, you see the ring flashing before your eyes a couple of times.  At the end of the movie, you see the video in full speed and then... a black screen (no image, no sound...).  I thought that was very clever.So even if not everything is crystal clear (there are some weird things that I didn't really get), 'The Ring' is worth seeing for its visual style!",The Ring

Almost all of the new material deepened the film without sabotaging it.  I left the theater ever more engrossed in the story and excited to see it again on opening night. My friends who joined me also said they would definitely see it again.Let's hope for a just as great American sequel (and maybe the prequel too).",The Ring

The mood, the setting and the casting was all excellent.  But the pacing and the story needed work.  For those who do not know, this movie is a remake of a 1999 Japanese Film called Ringu.  If you combined the pacing and story of Ringu with the casting and setting of this movie you would have an awesome movie.  The Story?  But it's a remake, it has the same story doesn't it?  Well, yes and no.  While it has the same premise, and even the same twists, the Japanese original is much more streamlined, and more vague at times.  How is this better?  Well it lends more suspense and more mystery, more creepiness to the whole thing. Believe it or not, sometimes less is more, and that is certainly the truth with Ringu.  That does not mean that this film is bad though.  It has it's own creepiness, and its own mood.  Naomi Watts is awesome, and David Dorfman as her son is terrific.  This movie comes off mostly as a mystery and not horror, although that is also true of the original, this version almost reminds me of ""The Lady in White"" for some reason. Horror, but horror based in mystery.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has not seen the original and is looking for a good suspense/mystery.

The story is rather predictable other than the plot twist at the end, but the direction of the movie makes the surprise all the less surprising.  From the beginning when the two young girls are teasing each other about the urban legend about the tape, you're given the clue the director is going to tease you by presenting suspense only to turn around and say everything is just a joke.  The buildup is somewhat entertaining but the conclusion is quite rushed and leaves you with an empty feeling. The relationship between the characters is almost nonexistant, you're given no indication of any connection between Rachel and her son other than she's his mother.

Why? because I think i'm already emotionally scarred for eternity.The plot summary of there being a video tape where if you watch it, in seven days you will die simply doesn't scratch the surface of this movie. From 5 minutes into the movie to the time you see the ring right before the credits you will be taken to a world that creates itself right before your eyes.Was it scary? Sure, but it was something more than that...What? I have no idea, but what I can tell you is I had to actually remember to close my wide-open jaw once the credits started rolling.Realistic movie? No way, but lets face it, what good horror flick is. People who write a bad review of any kind(which you'll notice by the VERY high rating not many people have) have absolutely no imagination or fun in their life and should just call it quits now..go crawl in hole and wither away...Let me put it this way.

In fact, I can not get to sleep at all because of it. Tonight all the lights in the house are off. It is hard to think of this as a movie and not an urban myth that might come true in the real world.

1069,GameOverPaxton,Best...thriller...in years.,9,19 October 2002,"I'll cut right to the chase:  The Ring is the most spine-tingling, stylish, suspenseful and satisfying horror film of AT LEAST the past decade. Or perhaps, at least out of the so-called ""thrillers"" I've seen in the past 10 years.  Superbly filmed and paced, the movie clutches you from the opening scene and doesn't let go until the credits roll.
Pros:  - The Fincher-esque noirish cinematography is beautiful to behold, while creating an enveloping sense of dread and paranoia...never has the Pacific Northwest been so terrifying. - Naomi Watts's screen presence keeps your eyes glued to the screen even when Verbinski backs off on the scares (which isn't often). Plus, she is in her undies at one point.  Yummy. - Like any psychological thriller worth its salt, The Ring never resorts to gore or cheap scares, although the few instances of FX use are extremely tasteful and will chill you to the bone (There is no asinine CGI use here that would spoil the film, as it did in the recent ""Signs""). Everyday objects such as ladders, chairs and especially televisions are imbued with ominous weight.  The cursed video itself looks like a student film collaboration between Trent Reznor and Salvador Dali, and is creepier in and of itself than most of the ""thrillers"" that have come out recently (*cough*feardotcom*cough*halloweenresurrection*cough*). - A scene involving a mad horse on a ferry is one of the most intense and riveting pieces of cinema I've seen in my life.  It's worth the price of admission alone.  The tension in the film is almost unbearable at times, which is fantastic...and there's always a payoff.BRIAN COX!  BRIAN COX!  BRIAN COX! - Didn't you always think wells were pretty creepy?  Yeah, so did I.  After seeing this, you won't want to travel within 10 miles of one.Cons:  - A couple of the twists are pretty predictable. - The screenplay insists on overexplaining certain aspects...perhaps they would have been more effective if left more ambiguous? - Certain aspects of the ending could've been presented a little more clearly...as opposed to other things which could've been better if more vague, I thought the ending could've come together a little better.  Don't worry though, it makes perfect sense after thinking about it for a few minutes.Overall:  As you can see, my quibbles with the film are very minor. As a whole, The Ring is a stunning visceral thriller, overflowing with the kind of nightmarish psychological content that will stay with you for weeks after seeing it.  Anyone looking for the kind of unsettling ""smart-horror"" most recently espoused in films like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Session 9"", and ""The Others"" will be in for a delightfully macabre treat.",The Ring

Whether it made me laugh, cry, scream, or just plain THINK, if I continue to think about it for hours, or in this case days on end, it is a fantastic movie.I thought this movie was nothing short of amazing, the most frightening and psychologically disturbing I have ever seen. I don't believe in hyping up movies, it usually disappoints people. This movie, however, deserves the hype. I was expecting a crappy excuse for a ""horror"" film. The last one I saw was Thirteen Ghosts. After seeing this movie I gave up on the whole horror genre; I was sure apocalypse was upon us if someone couldn't think of a better friggin' ending to a movie.So, I saw this movie three days ago and I am still thinking of it constantly. I am not the jumpy type, and so-called scary movies do not ever scare me. This movie scared me to the point of being frightened of the letter O. Unless you have a weak heart, see this movie just to experience the freakiness of it.I've heard a few complaints about the movie. The first being holes in the plot. Yes, it will leave you wondering, but afterwards you will think about it a while (perhaps too much) and it will all fall together. If not, read some of the interpretations on the discussion boards here after you watch the movie. There are many interesting ideas.I have also heard complaints about the microphones in the picture. I'm sure this really detracted from the experience of the people who saw this- whatever creepiness in those scenes had to have been ruined. In the theatre I went to, I couldn't see the microphones at all.I think some people seem to be over-analyzing the movie as well. If you go into the movie with the mind set of ""that could never happen,"" well, you're going to think the whole movie is stupid. Before you see it, accept this thought: ""A person, during life or after death, can possess supernatural powers."" This can make the entire movie more believable and easier to understand. If you keep this in mind, the movie can admittedly seem extremely real. I think this is why it freaked so many people out.Also, the artsy fartsy sections of the movie... again, I am not an art expert, but I can really tell the sound and imagery are well done.
Kudos to the makers of ""The Ring"", I am finally satisfied with a horror film. Thanks for this, but I must say I am too frightened to watch it a second time.",The Ring
1071,kimsscreen,a highly suspenseful movie with something more to it,10,20 October 2002,"considering that the trailer left me a bit confused as to what the movie was actually about, i originally decided to go on the basis that naomi watts, one of my favorite actors, was no doubt going to give a stellar performance as the lead and that the different clips were hinting at a kind of scary movie that isn't quite so predictable.  not being one to take movies like this lightly, as i am girl who is scared very easily, i was still immediately intrigued.what makes this movie different from most horror movies is that it still elicits a sense that as a movie it should continue to have all of the necessary elements of making an evocative story.  the plot is consistently developed, each character is integral in determining the nature of these mysterious occurrences (and the actors accurately and skillfully portray these roles), and just when everyone in the audience suspects that the pieces are falling into place, another twist comes along.  the script is rather intelligent, and it gives just the right combination of fear and weakness (with a bit of humor interjected for good measure and heightened suspense) to make it an incredibly dynamic and poignant movie.  and it just builds and builds without letting go until the very very end...the tension doesn't subside until the credits hit the screen.the imagery is excellent.  the cinematography is rather noteworthy.  pay close attention to the close up aerial shots that are prevalent throughout the movie.  all of the different components of the film come together and make a story worth remembering.  and it leaves the audience asking questions...not questions of what should have been answered in the movie but questions of how does a person react to this as it is something we've never seen before.  then it makes you demand to see the original. :)",The Ring

This movie had a great story line, great cast and near perfect pop-outs. The only complaint on those is that they were CONSTANT. EVERY scene change started with a loud (yet innocent) bang that became redundant and annoying. Some parts were very predictable, some were not. You'd better hope they ALL are because when the big ones come, they will DISTURB you. The images will stay with you as the last thing you see before you fall asleep. But that's what makes a horror movie great! I'm asked if it was scary and all I can say is yes, but in my defense of not sounding like a COMPLETE coward, it's a fun scary for you macho guys. You'll get scared no matter who you are, but you'll like it. Bring someone with you, or the ride home will be pretty rough all by yourself.The spoilers end so keep scrolling. S P O I L E R S !
The ending was somewhat lacking. She makes a copy and the curse is lifted? Didn't do much for me. I won't argue that Samara coming out of the TV wasn't arguably the most terrifying scene in the movie, but I think Rachel holding Samara's corpse and somewhat ""setting the spirit free"" was a good ending.
Fatal Frame is a game for PS2 based on real events that happened in a mansion in Japan. For those that have played it, there's a scene at the end of the game when Kirie comes out of a mirror. Kirie is a long, dark-haired Japanese ghost who wears a white kimono. (See the similarities?) So the TV ending didn't do as much to me as it could've.END S P O I L E R S Whether you've mastered Fatal Frame, are known as fearless, or cower at the sight of a spider, The Ring will be tons of fun and keep you jumping.",The Ring

Leaving a full aray of haunting images that cant be easily forgotten. The story is about a supposed cursed video tape that if watched results in a phone call in where a young girl tells you that in seven days you will die. We see this happen in the opening part of the film. One of the victims is the niece of Rachel Keller(Naomi Watts) who because of the request of her sister digs deeper into the mystery of four young teens who die in mysterious ways all exactly at the same time. The same four friends who watched the video together exactly one week earlier. Her young son, superbly played by David Dorfman and ex boyfriend (Kiwi Martin Henderson) are drawn into the mystery as well. She soon realises she must solve the origins of the tape quickly as she herself recieved the same phone call straight after viewing the cursed tape. Full of some shocking moments and great horror the film has you gripped from beginning to end with one of the most shocking and freaky endings ive seen in a long time..you will never feel the same about your t.v again!

The Ring is well made, and decently acted, but like The Cell, the 'look' of the film is what is most appealing.After seeing it I saw the original Japanese film from 1998. The Japanese version (Ringu) told a similar story but without some of the touches Gore Verbinski used to appeal to Western audiences. Ringu was much more subtle about revealing the secrets of the tape while Ring is a little more blatant about some things, like the 'seven days' revelation near the end. I thought it was a very disturbing and original film. The people who think The Ring is stealing ideas from Feardotcom or some PS2 game obviously don't realize where the concept started.",The Ring

But it isn't going to love you back, as you are going to exit the theater with major goosebumps.For those who don't want too many spoilers: It's creepy, it'll get to you, you'll want to analyze it to death afterwards. Now go see it.(spoilers ahead) The Ring is a remake of the Japanese blockbuster Ringu. The only thing that the American version has extra in it is the relation to horses.The Japanese Ringu already has several sequels. But now with the relation to horses and with the scenes at the asylum with the x-rays of the horses, along with several other scenes in the movie, an intresting conclusion might lead to a very creepy sequel.Since Samara's mother (Anna) was not able to conceive a child, perhaps Richard Morgan wanted to give her the greatest gift of all, a child. And in his desperation to give them the only thing needed to reach perfect happiness was through invitro. Only, he impregnated not a human carrier, but a mare (female horse). Noone knew until the mare gave birth. Anna found out, went bananas and threw herself off a cliff. And obviously Samara wasn't all 1+1 either. She turned out to have special powers, alongside a twisted personality. And those powers only grew ripe when she got killed.Put together (day)dreams, horses and a monster. What do you get?Incubus/succubus: A demon; a fiend; a lascivious spirit, supposed to have sexual intercourse with women by night.(male form) The devils who appeared in the female form were generally called succubi; those who appeared like men incubi, though this distinction was not always preserved. They were also known to evoke TERRIFYING DREAMS. In other words: -nightmares-.Here is where American bases screenwriters can take off and leave the original scrips behind, and make it worthwhile to have made a remake of the first Ringu.Would be nice to see a 'The Ring' meets 'Exorcist' meets 'Nightmare on Elm Street'",The Ring

Some previews related it to Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, but it some ways, I find it better than both. Soon after seeing The Ring, I rented Rosemary's Baby, expecting the same level of frightening plot and scenery, but it stunk. Not half as scary, nor half as smart. And The Exorcist, while about as scary, got most of its screams and such with gross-out tactics. The Ring is smart, scary, and has a story you can actually get into. Add this to a great twist ending, and its a must-see. The only people who may not like it are the dim-witted and those who cant follow a story for more than the length of a Saturday morning cartoon.

However the film gets confusing by just adding unconective elements without frame. Good scarry scenes but sometimes a bit on the gore side, and don´t match. Despite the good visual devises and the wise use of light, its usually boring and no effective. The worst thing is that it doesn´t give any explanation of lots of important details, for example why, who and when the video tape was made.

Remember how fast it died and was forgotten? The same will happen here. There is nothing of ""long lasting rememberance"" in this movie. Really a total disappointment.

The people who made it apparently never even realised why it was called 'Ring' (or 'Ringu'). It does not have anything to do with the apparent well that is in the movie, it has to do spreading a video tape around, which is almost completely left out of this horrible remake.People die of heart-attacks and look like zombies, and noone suspects that anything is wrong. I hope doctors in the US are not that stupid.If you want to see this movie; don't. See the japanese original instead. Then, when you've seen that, see Ringu 2, and after that Ringu 0.

After the first scene I began to learn that when a TV was in the room and I didnt want to get too freaked out I should close my eyes. (bad mistake) but it was impulse and I wish so bad I could have been a little less freaked out.In any case I came home SO excited.

1092,andrew_banks3,"Awful, awful, awful",1,9 November 2002,"I had such high expectations for this movie. I guess the moviemakers did not share my expectations. Don't get me wrong, the music, photography, directing and some of the acting (the heroine's) are good. I just don't get why they didn't do more with the story. Now of course it is a remake, but the original must have been better than this! Let me be more to the point. The story is absolutely awful. It makes you think that all these clues are going to add up to something. It could have been really clever. But about 15 minutes into the movie the clues have become so absurd that there is no chance for the villain to be anything else than a ghost. How original. Now here's the really dissatisfying part. All those clues you were paying close attention to? They don't mean diddly squat! They really don't lead to anything. You could have taken all the clues, changed them completely into some other clues, tacked on the ending, and it would have been just as good a fit. The simple truth is that it's just some mean monster terrorizing and killing people. And all those clues that could have at least revealed a tragic motivation for this disgruntled ghost's vengeance end up being utterly vain: the monster is just evil. That's all there is to it. It came up from who knows where, always has wanted to hurt people, and always will. That's why none of what I said is really a spoiler. If the clues meant something, then telling you about them would reveal the ending. But this ending might as well have been put at the beginning, because all going through the middle is just a waste of time. The movie is a scare machine. It is mechanical, cold, and shallow, filled with mere fluff. A string of one cheap thrill after another. If you like this kind of movie, it would be cheaper and just as satisfying to go have yourself electrocuted (gently, of course -- as the movie shows, you can die from electric shock).",The Ring

Those last ten minutes in the movie changed the rating I gave it from a 9 to a 7. Those last 10 minutes without which the movie would have a near great ending.Walking out of the movie with a heartbeat that slowly returns to almost-normal, you think back about the images that the movie left you with in your head that will haunt you for a couple more days, and all the unanswered questions that you hear everyone around you ask. Where did that videotape come from? Who shot it? Who is the little girl? How did the old man know about the tape? How does the little boy know everything?

I could have watched it in a barn with horses.  Two that stick out prominently in my head are: The entire boom ""arm"", mike and cord in the upper right corner in the scene where Rachel leaves Noah's apt the first time and is standing by the elevator discussing poo-poo drivel.  The other goofy use of the mike is in the scene where Rachel interviews wacko at the insane asylum. Not only can you see the mike you can watch it go back and forth from wacko to Rachel during their talk.    Stink-o. The frames of the solo face shots cut off the chins in a not-art-film way and the love for her son was about a genuine as a frog and a rock.   The up side was the kid was the best part. He was a little creepy but endearing and I appreciated the dull overall color to add to the mood. Otherwise, maybe the ""deleted"" scenes that some say there are would explain the confusing David Lynch attempt they were going for.

It's a remake of the Japanese film Ringu, which is apparently based on a novel(?), but I don't think the novel can have been as frightening. What does it is the suggestiveness of the images, the unimaginable terror that, it is hinted, lies behind the surface. Obviously the strange phenomena are not explained: what with the horses, the tree, the amulets, what sort of hellish method was used to conceive that child? What do the victims see in the last moment before they die (the short glimpses of their faces was possibly the most frightening thing in the entire movie)? If you have an vivid imagination, the images and thoughts that will come to mind for days after watching the movie will be at least as scary as the actual thing. (When the girl crawled out of the tv and took on corporeal form, the whole thing became more tangible, and then, in my opinion, less scary.)",The Ring

The entire time that the movie is showing, I looked around the theatre and saw young couples clutching each other.  Mainly the boys holding the girls.  To my dismay, I was the one holding my husband! He said that he would never watch it again.  The music was what got to him. In most horror flicks, the music leads up to a scary scene.  This movie didn't do this and that was the best part.  You couldn't expect anything to happen. My husband claims not to see it again not because it was bad, but because it was too scary for him.  I, on the contrary, have seen it 3 times in the theatres and am planning on buying it once it comes out.  If you enjoy suspensful, edge of your seat movies, I would strongly suggest watching this movie.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.  Love, Brosiaboo.",The Ring

But this movie really did it for me.For the next HOUR after viewing the ring -on a warm Sunday afternoon I might add- my heart was racing so much I thought I was having palpitations. My friend andrea who saw it with me (who also has a history of immunity towards horror films)and I were speechless, and andrea jumped as her phone rang as we were exiting the cinema. For ages after that we kept saying ""oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh"" and stuttering in awe. A movie has never before affected me even a fraction as much as The Ring did, as we speak I am in fact home from school because I could not sleep a wink last night from fear.

The new plot is pathetic, the in-film 'video' didn't have the mystery that the original had, and the storyline has been interweaved with irrelevant rubbish.

1124,danimal-1,"So much better than the bland, emotionless Japanese original",10,2 April 2003,"I thought I'd take the advice of the pretentious minority one this one, those who highly recommended watching the Japanese film, 'Ringu', before watching the clearly superior American re-make. After watching the generally unimpressive original, I truly wasn't expecting alot from this film - after all, 'The Ring' didn't benefit from being a sexy foreign film, it must have been dumbed down to appeal to mainstream, borderline retarded American crowds, and most of the element of surprise had been wasted by my watching Ringu - right?Remember, Japanese audiences flock by the hysterical thousands to watch Jennifer Love Hewitt sing.Period, point blank, and that's the bottom line - 'The Ring' is superior to the original in every conceivable way - and it managed to thoroughly compel me while seriously freaking me out. Sometimes the book is better than the movie, sometimes a bands first album really is their best, and sometimes that guy blabbering on about not watching TV really doesn't watch TV. But in this case, feel free to ignore anyone telling you that 'The Ring' just can't hold a candle to the always superior foreign film.Forget about some very impressive special effects and remarkable cinematography that come with an obviously bigger budget (and when I say 'forget', I mean for the sake of comparison, not for the sake of enjoying the film). Compare the character development. Compare the attentions to detail. Compare the ambience, the general mood captured by 'The Ring' that was so lacking in 'Ringu'. And leave out the need to tell anyone who prefers the american film that they ""just don't understand"" the japanese version - I understand it just fine.***Potential spoilers, I guess.....Why in god's name should I like Ryuji, Reiko or their son (so unimportant and underplayed that I won't even bother to remember what his name was)? Call it a cultural difference if you like, but Ryuji is downright repulsive as a character, and Reiko was frustratingly weak and irrelevant. Conversely, Aidan is actually developed as an intriguing individual within a few minutes of the film. Kinda important, eh? Aren't I supposed to care one way or the other about his mother's eventually tireless quest to save his life? The relationship between all three Kellers was infinitely more interesting than the poor presentation of the same in 'Ringu'. Ryuji-Reiko? No chemistry, no real look into their past, no invitation to wonder about anything between the two beyond the faux finish of the film. Noah and Rachel actually had me believing they were once together, and more importantly had me wanting them to finish that way despite knowing it wasn't gonna happen ahead of time. Reiko and son? Forget it. I guess for the foreign film fan, it's preferable to just assume that a mother loves her son, so let's not bother with actually developing that on screen. Rachel and Aidan had some serious tension between them. And Ryuji-son? Nothing! No, I don't mean almost nothing, I mean LITERALLY NOTHING. Noah and Aidan managed to build something of interest in two minutes of meaningful dialogue.As for comparing Sadako/Samara - not even close. A Ringu proponent on this website actually said that samara was all wrong because she has thick black hair and only Japanese girls can have a mop like that? Jeez, just another example of the pretentious artsy fartsies reaching for straws. Samara was genuinely evil, but that revelation was done so well. She was a legitimate child of the Morgans, but something went wrong as they pressed fate in an attempt to have a child. She tortured her mother with her ability to 'imprint', caused her suicide, and eventually managed to imprint again beyond the grave. Sorry, but Sadako being extremely psychic because her mother was and maybe her father was not of this world is just not as compelling a story.I used to play in a terrible band called Deus Ex Machina - saw the term in the dictionary and thought it sounded cool. Basically, it's a term to describe a method of filling in a plot hole. In 'Ringu', there are Machina's galore, the most blatant being that Ryuki has frikkin' ESP, yes ladies and gentlemen, he has real psychic powers. Need to find out what really happened to Samara/Sadako? In 'The Ring', it actually requires some detective work, finding a tape from a psychiatric hospital, following clues left by Samara, pestering her father. In 'Ringu', things are much easier - just touch someone's head and the entire plot is explained! Wanna find her final resting place? In 'The Ring', the Kellers follow a serious of clues, left from Samara's ability to imprint, that lead them in spite of the fact that they don't truly understand why they are being led. In 'Ringu', Ryuji actually knows he's in a horror film! ""If we find her body and release her soul, the curse will be lifted"", and ""let's start digging here, because I'm psychic and the director couldn't come up with a plausible way for us to legitimately find the well"". Rubbish.Opening scene? 'The Ring' had me running for a fresh pair of Haines, despite the fact that I knew what was going to happen. 'Ringu' rushed through it as though they were trying to conserve film.The money shot? I thought 'Ringu' was just fine here, very frightening, hence the very similar scene in the American version. I liked the touch of fingernail close-ups in Ringu, the special effects and the fact that Samara looked like someone who died in a well in 'The Ring'. Fact is, though, that I was alright with Ryuji getting his at the end - I wasn't so cool with it happening to Noah, and that makes a world of difference.I really could keep going on. So much more depth to 'the Ring', and so much patchwork holding 'Ringu' together. Props to the original for making a nice flick from a novel on a limited budget, but calling it a superior film to 'The Ring' is just utter nonsense. Yes, the American version did follow the original closely in some spots - all the right spots if you ask me. And it strayed from the original in all the right ways as well (get it? as WELL). Verbinski took a mediocre B-movie and made it an unforgettable cinematic experience.",The Ring

One Missed Call was more of a comedy than a horror. But, The Ring was the first movie that contained many things that could not happen, but had an interesting story line from the beginning, and had you wanting more at the end. Be aware that the following sentences contain, should I call it, warnings for the squeamish, not spoilers. I am not giving away important plot points.I watched this film with a friend of mine on YouTube in parts. Within the first ten minutes we couldn't stop watching it. There was always some question we were waiting for the answer to. For those parents who are wondering if this is appropriate for their child, I would say 11 and up is fine. If you have heard about the tape, you do see what is on the tape throughout the film, and parts of it throughout the rest of the film. On the tape are a random series of disturbing events, which are really disturbing. This movie IS meant to ACTUALLY SCARE the viewer/viewers. SQUEAMISH: If disturbing images, strange noises/songs, disturbing facial expressions, and death bother you, do not see this film!All in all, I give this film 9 out of 10 stars.

I cannot say enough how the tenseness takes over as the music and the motives combine. I went to high school in Washington state and the ferry rides were never like this.

A good plot line, a reasonably good amount of emotion from the characters and amazing camera works are just a few of the things that make this film so exceptional.If you ask me, the movie is frightening, not scary. It doesn't make you want to scream and run away while watching it. It just sends a shiver down your spine which I wouldn't say gave me a nightmare. It doesn't give you any cheap thrills but goes on with a vague presence of death and terror all along.The movie may seem a bit incomplete to a few people because the making of the Tape was never shown or even hinted towards. But I quite liked that part of the movie. Humans have been fascinated by the thought of ghosts from ages ago. We don't know how they work or what makes them tick. So withholding that bit of information from the audience is a well thought out idea.I could give the movie a 8 or 7, mostly due to it's overly clichéd general outlook of it.

The word 'horror' in the English dictionary is defined as 'A strong feeling of fear'. With the films I mentioned above, there isn't a lot of fear, just dark room's, blunt instruments and fake pints of blood. 'The Ring' is based on the Japanese original movie of the same name and is about an evil video tape created by a young girl who kills you seven days after you watch it by crawling out of a well and through your TV set, the only way to prevent this however is to create a copy of the evil tape and show it to someone else to 'spread the suffering'. There are some special effects, between the region of 'The Matrix' which was terrible and completely made of special effects and 'The Village' which although was brilliant, had none. 'The Ring' get's you gripped from the puzzling and gripping start to the shockingly stunning ending, which I loved because of it's great reasoning yet amazingly obvious answer.

While other movies are coming out like ""Freddy vs. Jason"" and ""Jeepers Creepers"" which are partially scary only because of their gore content, ""The Ring"" probably took a risk by coming out in the midst of these movies. The basis of the movie revolves around an urban legend about a video tape that kills you seven days after you watch it. The video is a mix of horrifying clips of various things -- a woman jumping off of a cliff, a nail through the finger, dead animals -- and as soon as the video ends you get a mysterious phone call. ""Seven days,"" the person says at the other end, and soon enough, at the end of the seventh day, you unexplainably die. A newspaper reporter's niece suddenly dies and rumors are going around it's because of this ""killer video tape"". She tries to unravel this mystery and ends up watching the tape herself. She tries to figure out how to undo the video tape's ""curse"". As the movie goes along there are very scary parts, and overall the movie has a spooky feel to it. 10 out of 10!",The Ring
1147,Wolftoothfist,Couldn't sleep for a week!,6,9 November 2004,"Out of all the horror films I have ever seen this wins heads down. I wouldn't consider this as a horror movie as I normally associate horror with blood and gore and terror with mind haunting and chilling. This is a terror movie. My eccentric old maths teacher made my class and I watch it as punishment for 'scaring' him all year. From the moment it started I couldn't rip my eyes away from the screen. Most of the girls in my class were screaming when that poor girl got killed. The atmosphere was so effective as well. The constant raining in Seattle, the clouds, the TREE (I still have dreams about it) and the cursed people's clouded faces when ever a photo was taken of them or if they were under video surveillence.I couldn't concentrate for the rest of the day (and to be honest I don't scare easily!). I had drama next and luckily I watched Carousel to wash the images from my mind. ""Oh the Ring. My its terrifying. Jack saw it and stayed awake all night and it takes a lot to scare him! Watch the Sound of Music a few times and you'll be back to normal"" my drama teacher said. Its been over 5 months since I've seen the Ring, my friend recommends that I see the Japanese version. It doesn't have as many special effects but what it suggests it much more terrifying, is what he said. I think I'll pass there. After watching the Ring you think more deeply about the plot and what the 'video' was really about. So the reason Naomi didn't die at the end was because she let her husband watch it and so pass on the ring to someone else. Also the woman in the video was a psychic of some sort who burned her thoughts into it. Well for those of you haven't seen it I'll not ruin the plot anymore but be prepared for very late nights!",The Ring
1148,hugotoo,Scary and Strange,7,10 November 2004,"If you're like me and are scared by thrillers other than slasher-movies than this one's for you. Scariest movie based around the television since Poltergeist. The movie left some questions unanswered but I guess that helps set up a sequel which I see is coming out Spring of 2005. There's a lot of detail to the story-line so it might help to watch a couple of times to follow every detail. The extra footage on the DVD was confusing to watch right after the movie, think of it as deleted scenes and alternate endings. The characters are likable. The scenery is fun. There's a twist towards the end of the movie that wasn't expected. The effects are good. Good movie to watch with the lights out, even though I did not!",The Ring

Can someone please help me with this so I will have a better understanding of the movie before going to see part II. Does anyone know where the video came from? Was Samara their real daughter or not? Do they have to keep showing the video to other people in order to stay alive and when Racheal told her son that she helped and found Samara, he was upset and said she never sleeps. I understand that she could not sleep because of the horses but what does that comment mean now that she is dead. Lastly......why was the video killing people in the first place. I understand that part of it was taped interviews when she was in the hospital but it still doesn't make sense to me.",The Ring

When I saw this film when it was released in 2002, I was terrified. Whereas other scary movies I had seen before it tended to be predictable, this one wasn't. Certain images were unexpected and shocking to me. The plot is well-placed and the setting dark and dreary. Such natural things in the world are given new meaning within the film's context.Watching it again 18 years later, I know what to expect, but it still gives me shivers. This is a solid horror/suspense film and I appreciate it in light of the tendency towards gore which followed.",The Ring

The plot-line is good and the scenes are well shot. You are always asking yourself questions, and in the end it all makes sense. Although it is a supernatural horror, the ring is greatly about mystery and the way the film is done is fantastic. For horror fans this is a must-see. In my-school this film is a forbidden object, that if seen will make the watcher an immortal horror fan. The little girl is great and is disturbing, and the final moment in which she is unmasked, you see where this film is really going. Another great thing about this film is how weird it is. The affects of the tape make no logical sense, and they don't need to. Though there are some flaws.The opening scene is tacky and unoriginal. Also at the start the boy is really weird and feels miscast. But all-in-all a classic and if you like horror you already should be driving to rent a copy.",The Ring

1154,Substatic_Intensifier,Inferior to Ringu on every level - A disgrace to the original,4,2 March 2005,"I am amazed that nobody has posted a thread saying one bad word against this film. If you want to appreciate the remake of a film, see the original first. As with music, if you are going to remake or remix something, you must add something to it that gives it a different style but still appeals to people that liked the original. As far as i can see, this remake has failed to do this by a mile, and furthermore, is an insult to the effort of the craft and collaboration between Koji Suzuki and Hideo Nakata that went into making the original a genuinely original and revolutionary horror film.The plot is so much more unnecessarily complicated than the original. Half of the original plot twists from the original, and even aspects of the narrative, are removed and replaced with totally convoluted and unbelievable ones. What was all this business about the barn that Samara allegedly stayed in? What was all the excess nonsense about the lighthouse? What was all that confusing and unnecessary crap about mother in the papers and hospital records that ultimately leads to nothing? We find out that Samara was killed by her mother. Not only was this contrary to the father performing the act in the original, but also we never know why. Fair enough, you do not know why in the original unless you see Ring 0 but in the original, Dr Ikuma was not given anywhere enough attention for the viewer to actually worry about not knowing. In comparison, the remake focuses a lot on revealing about the past of Samara's mother, but does not give any hint as to why should would have any motive for killing her daughter. This leaves the viewer frustrated and confused. I agree that the unexplained is frightening, but this has to be taken to a lesser degree when concerning the fate of pivotal characters. Clearly, the director has not paid any attention to these problems and this puts a stain on the genius of the original, which found the perfect balance.The character's were far less believable in this version, and is a further insult to the believability of the original. None of the leads were particularly outstanding. The innocence of Yoichi in the original, with sensible dialogue to convey his emotion and confusion of being wrapped up in the essence of the tape's curse, is replaced in the remake by a bad-mouthed, precocious little brat that contributes nothing to the film either in terms of the constant eerie aura that sweeps through the film that Nakata masterfully conveys, nor the sympathy you extend to Yoichi, again through the lack of believable dialogue, which makes him sound like a spoilt little runt, rather than an innocent caught up in the curse. Because of this, the very child's presence in this remake irritated me and I had no concern for his feelings in the film, what little there were of them (which were unconvincingly portrayed anyhow), which ultimately further lacks the constant mix of horror and anxiety that every character in Ring represents to the viewer. Yet again, such flaws are insult to the sure-handiness of the original.There are characters that are introduced, turns in the plot, and objects, which are left unresolved. For example, the friend of the first victim from the beginning of the film does not appear in the original. We are given the feeling of her importance to the film and yet by the end we do not know of, nor care, for her fate. It gives the impression that her role in the film was merely a red herring device to confuse the audience, as if by two thirds of the way through we are not confused enough already. You are left asking the question 'Why?' with a sense of immense frustration rather than anxious pleasure.Finally, we are plagued with CGI to convey horror. A big reason that Hideo Nakata's original was so appealing was that it was simplistic in its conveyance of terror, and therefore terrifyingly effective. I am referring to Ringu's ending, whereby we are greeted with the chilling realisation of Sadako's wrath. In the original, this scene was so successful because a real human being crawled from the TV set, thereby conveying the horror of the most unbelievable thing in most realistic way possible. You can't help but feel cheated when CGI is used. This is a clear case of where the more advanced most certainly does not equate to the most effective. The director has gone so far in making Samara unreal, that there is no physically real aspect to her at all  instead, she is some kind of digital ghost without any real presence. Adding flickers to the edge of her character as if a flickering TV screen unfortunately clearly shows where the film's priorities lie. As such, I felt little fear in comparison to the total body muscular tension I experienced in the scene from the original Ringu.Overall, this film has failed on every level compared to Ringu. Rather than honouring Ringu's history with a modern horror in the spirit of Japanese film making while adding more, it has instead tarnished it with unnecessary, unbelievable, and incomplete plot twists and characters that typically reflect the abuse of a comparatively massive Hollywood budget.It is sad that the genius of the original will always be associated with this. I can only hope that Japanese cinema gets the credit it deserves so that more people will be more likely and more inclined to see the original foreign version of a film first. Until then, when the word Ring appears in film-talk, this inferior remake will be the first that comes to mind and the brilliance of the superior original will be overlooked. A shame. A real shame.",The Ring
1155,douglas-a-moraes,Before you die you see the ring,7,19 January 2014,"The Ring is a remake of the Japanese film Ringu . It can be classified as horror and thriller, the second category is the best classification. The film was released in 2002 and was directed by Gore Verbinski, the director of Pirates of the Caribbean. Everything starts when the niece of Rachel Keller dies in a completely strange way. At the funeral, she meets some friends of her deceased niece and during a conversation she discovers the existence of a tape, a legendary tape that supposedly kills all who watches it. Rachel then starts a race in search for truth. Her son Aidan is a young psychic who immediately senses that something wrong and paranormal is in this story. Rachel finds a copy of the dreaded tape, and skeptically, she just watched. At the exact second that the tape ends, the phone rings and a voice tells her that she has seven days. Then comes Noah, Aidan's father. He is more skeptical than Rachel and gets to mock the former partner for believing in the history of a tape that kills. He ends up watching the tape too, and because some strange happenings, he changes his minds about the veracity of the urban legend. The problem begins when Aidan, suffering from insomnia - probably caused by something supernatural - decides to watch the tape . Rachel finds him sitting on the floor of the room just when the last image passes. Then Rachel and Noah begin a journey to save their son. It's a real race against time to find out as much as they can about the tape and its motive to kill people. After several bizarre events and some deaths at the end of the film, Rachel unravels some of the mystery and save herself from the curse, she also manages to save her son. Gore Verbinski used and abused from oriental techniques to cause fear in movies. Terror of The Ring is the one caused by bodily mutilation or constant appearances of monsters. Terror is totally psychological, leaning on the great atmosphere of suspense that the plot provides. The movie has subliminal passages (in the passage of a particular scene to another, it is possible to identify the appearance of an image by fractions of a second) and a surrealist aesthetic with influence. The images on the tape are complex, a total nonsense at first glance, all carefully fitted to unravel the mystery(which by the way is just completely unraveled in the second film) the viewer can understand the meaning of each. Moreover, the shadows of the actors were taken to make a greater impact in the mind of the viewer. The film was highly praised, one of the few remakes that did not disappoint. The only criticism made very soon after launch was towards the end, which was confusing for many. One needs to watch the film very carefully to understand (or else watch the second movie, there are almost all drawn) the whole story. On the issue of performance, David Dorfman gave a show. His way of interpreting a gifted and sensitive boy convinced and won. His interpretation was as good as Haley Joel Osment in AI Artificial Intelligence. Always serious and sentimental without many statements. Naomi Watts also played very well its role as sloppy and desperate mother. The plot has a few holes, for example, does not explain the relationship between the call and the curse. Also it uses much scares cliché, with a tense music in the background and moments of silence. But even so it's a great film for those who enjoy suspense and mysteries to unravel. The ""villain"" in the end, is not that villain so. Recommend watching calmly, paying attention to the smallest detail to understand the end.",The Ring
1156,Foobie,Delightfully creepy and basically wrong,9,21 March 2005,"This movie should be put under the title of horror, but more one of Terror. The Ring contains very little gore, and apart from a couple of scenes (bath suicide, death of Samara) there is little violence. The film wins by having images which are 'wrong' from the girl in the closet at the beginning with the horribly contorted face, its not bloody but just 'not right', difficult to look at, easy to remember. The same with Samara emerging from the TV and doing 'that walk'.In agreement with the other user comment this does seem to be a movie about settling disgruntled spirits, however in difference the characters fail to do so. The films heroine does link the clues, and visits the resting place of the demon, however she realises that nobody can calm her, and even after trying to bargain with the dead, they still come for our souls, there is nothing anybody can do to escape.",The Ring

I highly recommend this movie to all people in the universe.I have seen both Ringu and The Ring and in my opinion, The Ring is much better.

1158,apkarian_77,Weak unbelievable plot no better than buffy,4,5 April 2005,"THere are few genres where in my opinion a film scores points by being believable as much so as the horror film genre. The very foundations of a film which sets out its stall to "" scare"" as in the case of ""The Ring"" are jeopardised when totally unfathomable things begin to occur. This film contains many of these moments but the main irksome point in the plot would have to be a girl who never dies who makes a video tape that kills people after seven days when she crawls out of the TV. Maybe America has indeed watched too much TV and is ready to quickly digest this sort of nonsense, or maybe this film with its pg-13 rating was aimed at an audience easily ready to suggestion IE .. kids drunk people or suggestion-able adults. This film is an utterly pointless waste of celluloid , i just feel sorry for the actors involved who after this sort of tripe are no doubt facing a very unrewarding career.

The suspenseful sound effects and music were more effective in the American version to make it creepier where as in the Japanese one, there was a smooth transition to when the death scenes came out. The decayed faces on the dead victims were scarier than the ones in the Japanese version. Also, I thought the ESP in the Japanese version was kind of lame.

1164,Crowzur,A captivating and terrifying mystery.,9,13 August 2016,"First, it's important to know that this movie is an American remake of the Japanese 1998 film, Ring (which I'll call by its literal title Ringu for this review), which is itself based on the novel of the same name by Koji Suzuki. The critical and commercial success of The Ring brought in a whole slew of remakes of J-Horror movies, like Dark Water, Pulse, One Missed Call, and most successfully, Ju-On The Grudge(both the original and remake are quite good, though the original is perhaps a little better). And this is a remake that outshines the original.The plot is simple; Rachel, played by Naomi Watts and her ex-husband Noah, played by Martin Henderson, have a week to answer the mystery of a cursed videotape, which has claimed the lives of several teenagers. Telling anymore spoils the mystery, which is the heart of the movie. A fair bit of it is different from Ringu, but for the majority, these changes are far better for the movie. The intrigue of the tape and it's background is the real grip of the movie. The contents of the tape itself are incredibly disturbing, and at first appear as a seemingly random string of images. Each little piece gets slowly revealed to the viewer, and you begin to piece it all together, without the film telling it all to you. You solve the mystery and are invested in it just as much as our heroes. And thankfully, these heroes are excellently played. Watts performance of Rachel is a grounded, level-headed, and intuitive one, making Rachel a sleuth in all but name. Henderson brings some much-needed humour to the earlier parts of the movie before the horror starts to creep in, but soon reveals a versatile and human nature to Noah. Brian Cox (without saying too much) also has a few unfortunately brief, but powerful scenes, that bring real gravity to the situation. Our villain probably has less than 15 minutes of screen time, but her presence is constantly felt throughout the last half. The other actors aren't all that much to write home about however. They're far from bad, but instead feel only like links to where the plot will take the mystery, or to tell you about some dark event. The Ring is a great balance of mystery and horror. While Ringu perhaps focused too much on the mystery, and could only scare you a handful of times, The Ring has scares spaced out sporadically to keep you on your toes. There are jump scares, but a lot of the terror is from what you don't see. As mentioned earlier, you constantly feel the villain's presence, just breathing on the back of your neck. The soundtrack is unnerving, and the music that you would expect to play in the calmer moments is distorted, just to remind you that things are never safe. Two scenes in particular start with an almost mundane scenario, and soon escalate to something nightmarish (one of them I had to pause the movie for a few minutes).Now to air out a few of the bad things, but these are almost petty. The child actors are...well, child actors. They're not amazing. But for what they have to do, they do it well enough. Much of the film also has a green hue to it, but I suspect this was because it came out no long after the Matrix, and being green was the thing. Viewers may also find parts of it quite confusing. I saw Ringu and read the book before seeing this, so I knew the plot fairly well, but I can understand anyone's confusion. The Ring is a fantastic film, combining elements of a classic mystery and psychological horror. You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout/ The Ring eclipses Ringue in my opinion, though I know many who might disagree. Ringu worked really well for a book. But The Ring works even better as a movie. If you like a good mystery, some unknown terror, or just watching a good movie, The Ring is one of my highest recommendations.",The Ring

I can only rate this movie for what has been made, and thats just re-shooting a good movie and earning money in the process.

When She then begins doing research on the video, and ends up watching it herself. She then starts seeing images from the tape in everyday life and starts to do research on the things in it. She comes across Moesko Island, the Morgans that lived there, and their mysterious daughter Samara. She begins to discover the story behind the tape.This movie is one of my absolute favourites! I, having seen several movies and read several books with completely static, two-dimensional characters, was amazed at how well the characters were developed, especially Samara.

When it stops, it's just the beginning. Sun comes up, we all laugh. Sun goes down, we all die...""
